00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.550
PROFESSOR: OK, in that
case, let's take off.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.190
There's a fair
amount I'd like to do

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.090
before the end of the term.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.190
First, let me quickly review
what we talked about last time.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.290
We talked about the
actual supernovae data,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.930
which gives us brightness as a
function of redshift for very

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.590
distant objects and
produced the first discovery

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.530
that the model is not fit very
well by the standard called

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.140
dark matter model, which
would be this lower line.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
But it fits much better
by this lambda CDM,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.090
a model which involves a
significant fraction-- 0.76 was

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.150
used here-- and significant
fraction of vacuum energy

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.370
along with cold, dark
matter and baryons.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.420
And that was a model
that fit the data well.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.380
And this, along
with similar data

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.370
from another group
of astronomers,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.180
was a big bombshell
of 1998, showing

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.900
that the universe appears
to not be slowing down

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.550
under the influence of gravity
but rather to be accelerating

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.810
due to some kind of
repulsive, presumably,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140
gravitational force.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.940
We talked about the
overall evidence

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.760
for this idea of an
accelerating universe.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.760
It certainly began with
the supernovae data

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.220
that we just talked about.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.530
The basic fact
that characterizes

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.050
that data is that the most
distant supernovae are

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.780
dimmer than you'd
expect by 20% to 30%.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.310
And people did cook up
other possible explanations

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.380
for what might have made
supernovae at certain distances

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.460
look dimmer.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.890
None of those really
held up very well.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.860
But, in addition, several other
important pieces of evidence

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.930
came in to support this idea
of an accelerating universe.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.660
Most important, more
precise measurements

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.940
of the cosmic background
radiation anisotropies came in.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.030
And this pattern
of antisotropies

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.980
can be fit to a
theoretical model, which

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.290
includes all of the parameters
of cosmology, basically,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.850
and turns out to give a very
precise setting for essentially

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.150
all the parameters of cosmology.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.970
They now really all have their
most precise values coming out

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.680
of these CMB measurements.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.240
And the CMB measurements
gave a value

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.510
of omega [? vac ?], which
is very close to what we'll

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.301
get from the supernovae,
which makes it all

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:41.890
look very convincing.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.430
And furthermore, the
cosmic background radiation

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.000
shows that omega total is
equal to 1 to about 1/2%

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.900
accuracy, which is very hard
to account for if one doesn't

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.980
assume that there's a
very significant amount

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.790
of dark energy.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.290
Because there just
does not appear

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.310
to be nearly enough of anything
else to make omega equal to 1.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.360
And finally, we pointed out
that this vacuum energy also

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.140
improves the age calculations.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.060
Without vacuum energy,
we tend to define

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.900
that the age of the universe
as calculated from the Big Bang

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.930
theory always ended up
being a little younger

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.660
than the ages of the oldest
stars, which didn't make sense.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.950
But with the vacuum
energy, that changes

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.860
the cosmological calculation of
the age producing older ages.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.010
So with vacuum energy of the
sort that we think exists,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
we get ages like 13.7
or 13.8 billion years.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.940
And that's completely
consistent with what

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.820
we think about the ages
of the oldest stars.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.280
So everything fits together.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.910
So by now, I would say that
with these three arguments

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.570
together, essentially,
everybody is convinced

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.520
that this acceleration is real.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.530
I do know a few people
who aren't convinced,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.920
but they're oddballs.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.960
Most of us are convinced.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.460
And the simplest explanation
for this dark energy

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.735
is simply vacuum energy.

00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:02.610
And every measurement
that's been made so far

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.300
is consistent with the
idea of vacuum energy.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.330
There is still an
alternative possibility

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.120
which is called
quintessence, which

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.642
would be a very slowly
evolving scalar field.

00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:15.100
And it would show up, because
you would see some evolution.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.490
And so far nobody has
seen any evolution

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.330
of the amount of dark
energy in the universe.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.530
So that's basically
where things stand as far

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.090
as the observations of
acceleration of dark energy.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.580
Any questions about that?

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.230
OK, next, we went on to talk
about the physics of vacuum

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.680
energy or a
cosmological constant.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.970
A cosmological constant
and vacuum energy

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.830
are really synonymous.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.900
And they're related
to each other

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.480
by the energy
entering the vacuum

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.960
being equal to this expression,
where lambda is what Einstein

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.775
originally called the
cosmological constant

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:56.264
and what we still call
the cosmological constant.

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:58.180
We discussed the fact
that there are basically

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
three contributions
in a quantum field

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.845
theory to the
energy of a vacuum.

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:04.720
We do not expect it to
be zero, because there

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.489
are these complicated
contributions.

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:09.530
There are, first of all,
the quantum fluctuations

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.750
of the photon and
other Bosonic fields,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.950
Bosonic fields
meaning particles that

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.050
do not obey the Pauli
exclusion principle.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.380
And that gives us a
positive contribution

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.790
to the energy, which
is, in fact, divergent.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.870
It diverges because every
standing wave contributes.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.740
And there's no lower bound to
the wavelength of a standing

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.610
wave.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.280
So by considering shorter
and shorter wavelengths,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.880
one gets larger and
larger contributions

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.900
to this vacuum energy.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.030
And in the quantum field
theory, it's just unbounded.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.020
Similarly, there are
quantum fluctuations

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.160
to other fields like
the electron field

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.290
which is a Fermionic
field, a field that

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.450
describes a particle that obeys
the Pauli exclusion principle.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.710
And those fields behave
somewhat differently.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.840
Like the photon, the
electron is viewed

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.610
as the quantum
excitation of this field.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.550
And that turns out to be by
far, basically, the only way we

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.270
know to describe
relativistic particles

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.090
in a totally consistent way.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.960
In this case, again,
the contribution

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.420
to the vacuum
energy is divergent.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.020
But in this case, it's
negative and divergent,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.320
allowing possibilities of
some kind of cancellation,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.131
but no reason that
we know of why

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.380
they should cancel each other.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.350
They seem to just be
totally different objects.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.410
And, finally, there
are some fields

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.220
which have nonzero
values in the vacuum.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.910
And, in particular, the Higgs
field of the standard model

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.170
is believed to have a nonzero
value even in the vacuum.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.310
So this is the basic story.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.110
We commented that if we
cut off these infinities

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.550
by saying that we don't
understand things at very, very

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.050
short wavelengths, at
least one plausible cut off

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.300
would be the Planck scale,
which is the scale associated

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.460
with where we think quantum
gravity becomes important.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.050
And if we cut off at
this Planck scale,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.880
the energies become
finite but still too large

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.340
compared to what we observe
by more than 120 orders

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.470
of magnitude.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.650
And on the homework set
that's due next Monday,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.010
you'll be calculating
this number for yourself.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.720
It's a little bit more than
120 orders of magnitude.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.360
So it's a colossal failure
indicating that we really

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.790
don't understand what controls
the value of this vacuum

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.010
energy.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.707
And I think I
mentioned last time,

00:07:28.707 --> 00:07:30.540
and I'll mention it a
little more explicitly

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.090
by writing it on
the transparency

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.490
this time, that the situation
is so desperate in that we've

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.150
had so much trouble trying to
find any way of explaining why

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.860
the vacuum energy should be so
small that it has become quite

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.080
popular to accept the
possibility, at least,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.190
that the vacuum energy is
determined by what is called

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.720
the anthropic
selection principal

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.352
or anthropic selection effect.

00:07:58.352 --> 00:07:59.810
And Steve Weinberg
was actually one

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.062
of the first people who
advocated this point of view.

00:08:03.062 --> 00:08:06.080
I'm sort of a recent convert
to taking this point of view

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.790
seriously.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.380
But the idea is
that there might be

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.620
more than one possible
type of vacuum.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.720
And, in fact, string
theory comes in here

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.949
in an important way.

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:18.490
String theory seems
to really predict

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.830
that there's a colossal number
of different types of vacuum,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.680
perhaps 10 to the 500 different
types of vacuum or more.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.840
And each one would have
its own vacuum energy.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.560
So with that many, some of them
would have a, by coincidence,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.220
near perfect
cancellation between

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.730
the positive and negative
contributions producing

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.770
a net vacuum energy that
could be very, very small.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.840
But it would be a tiny fraction
of all of the possible vauua,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.970
a fraction like 10
to the minus 120,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.030
since we have 120
orders of magnitude

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.730
mismatch of these ranges.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.170
So you would still have to
press yourself to figure out

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.550
what would be the explanation
why we should be living

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.260
in such an atypical vacuum.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.840
And the proposed answer is that
it's anthropically selected,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.280
where anthropic means
having to do with life.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.110
Whereas, the claim is
made that life only

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:16.840
evolves in vacuua which
have incredibly small vacuum

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.090
energies.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.910
Because if the vacuum energy is
much larger, if it's positive,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.520
it blows the universe apart
before structures can form.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.590
And it it's negative,
it implodes the universe

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.760
before there's time
for structures to form.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.750
So a long-lived universe
requires a very small vacuum

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.664
energy density.

00:09:35.664 --> 00:09:37.580
And the claim is that
those are the only kinds

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.810
of universes that support life.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.100
So we're here because it's
the only kind of universe

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.961
in which life can
exist is the claim.

00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:45.460
Yes?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.655
AUDIENCE: So, different
types of energies,

00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:48.806
obviously, affect the
acceleration rate and stuff

00:09:48.806 --> 00:09:49.472
of the universe.

00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:52.106
But do they also affect, in any
way, the fundamental forces,

00:09:52.106 --> 00:09:54.064
or would those be the
same in all of the cases?

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.510
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is, would the different kinds

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.630
of vacuum affect the kinds
of fundamental forces

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.760
that exist besides the force
of the cosmological constant

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.839
on the acceleration of
the universe itself?

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:08.130
The answer is, yeah, it would
affect really everything.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.350
These different vacuua would be
very different from each other.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.000
They would each have
their own version

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.585
of what we call the standard
model of particle physics.

00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:16.960
And that's because the standard
model of particle physics

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.890
would be viewed as
what happens when

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.380
you have small perturbations
about our particular type

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.434
of vacuum.

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:24.850
And with different
types of vacuum

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.670
you get different time
types of small perturbations

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.530
about those vaccua.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.020
So the physics really could
be completely different in all

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.330
the different vacuua that
string theory suggests exist.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.030
So the story here,
basically, is a big mystery.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.880
Not everybody accepts
these anthropic ideas.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.160
They are talked about.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.780
At almost any
cosmology conference,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.446
there will be some session where
people talk about these things.

00:10:52.446 --> 00:10:55.920
They are widely
discussed but by no means

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.080
completely agreed upon.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.230
And it's very much
an open question,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.840
what it is that explains
the very small vacuum energy

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.300
density that we observe.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.370
OK, moving on, in
the last lecture

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.779
I also gave a quick historical
overview of the interactions

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.320
between Einstein
and Friedmann, which

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.680
I found rather interesting.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:24.460
And just a quick summary here,
in 1922 June 29, to be precise,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.530
Alexander Friedmann's first
paper about the Friedmann

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.450
equations and the dynamical
model of the universe

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.150
were received at [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.820
Einstein learned about it
and immediately decided

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.840
that it had to be wrong and
fired off a refutation claiming

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.820
that Friedmann had gotten
his equations wrong.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.140
And if he had gotten
them right, he

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.389
would have discovered that
rho dot, the rate of change

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:50.500
of the energy density,
had to be zero

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.170
and that there was nothing but
the static solution allowed.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.030
Einstein then met a friend
of Friedmann's Yuri Krutkov

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:05.110
at a retirement lecture
by Lawrence in Leiden

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.210
the following spring.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.400
And Krutkov convinced
Einstein that he

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.570
was wrong about
this calculation.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.390
Einstein had also
received a letter

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.960
from Friedmann,
which he probably

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.005
didn't read until this
time, but the letter

00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:19.290
was apparently also convincing.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.450
So Einstein did finally retract.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.760
And at the end of May
1923, his refraction

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.425
was received at
Zeitschrift fur Physik.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.700
And another interesting
fact about that

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.400
is that the original handwritten
draft of that retraction

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.620
still exists.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.010
And it had the curious
comment, which was crossed out,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.270
where Einstein suggested that
the Friedmann solutions could

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.670
be modified by the phrase,
"a physical significance

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.290
can hardly be ascribed to them."

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.330
But at the last minute,
apparently, Einstein

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.800
decided he didn't really
have a very good foundation

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.414
for that statement
and crossed it out.

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:01.830
So I like the
story, first of all,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.884
because it illustrates
that we're not

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.300
the only people
who make mistakes.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.140
Even great physicists
like Einstein

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.065
make really silly mistakes.

00:13:09.065 --> 00:13:12.114
It really was just a
dumb calculational error.

00:13:12.114 --> 00:13:14.030
And it also, I think,
points out how important

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.620
it is not to allow
yourself to be caught

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.066
in the grip of some firm idea
that you cease to question,

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:21.440
which apparently
is what happened

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.830
to Einstein with his belief
that the universe was static.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.330
He was so sure that
the universe was

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.150
static that he very quickly
looked at Friedmann's paper

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.100
and reached the incorrect
conclusion that Friedmann

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.310
had gotten his calculus wrong.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.960
In fact, it was Einstein
who got it wrong.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.630
So that summarizes
the last lecture.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.900
Any further questions?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.380
OK, in that case, I think
I am done with that.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.750
Yeah, that comes later.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.890
OK, what I want to
do next is to talk

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:58.800
about two problems associated
with the conventional cosmology

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.280
that we've been learning
about and, in particular,

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.941
I mean cosmology
without inflation,

00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:04.440
which we have not
learned about yet.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.530
So I am talking
about the cosmology

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.140
that we've learned about so far.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.340
So there are a total
of three that I

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.080
want to discuss
problems associated

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.400
with conventional cosmology
which serve as motivations

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.570
for the inflationary
modification that, I think,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.710
you'll be learning about
next time from Scott Hughes.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.570
But today I want to
talk about the problems.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:37.030
So the first of 3 is sometimes
called the homogeneity,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.220
or the horizon problem.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.870
And this is the problem
that the universe

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.130
is observed to be
incredibly uniform.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.370
And this uniformity
shows up most clearly

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.390
in the cosmic microwave
background radiation,

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.960
where astronomers have now made
very sensitive measurements

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.390
of the temperature as a
function of angle in the sky.

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.770
And it's found that that
radiation in uniform to one

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.970
part in 100,000,
part in 10 to the 5.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.260
Now, the CMB is
essentially a snapshot

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.610
of what the universe looked
like at about 370,000 years

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.160
after the Big Bang at the
time that we call t sub

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.590
d, the time of decoupling.

00:16:00.088 --> 00:16:00.588
Yes?

00:16:00.588 --> 00:16:02.560
AUDIENCE: This measurement,
the 10 to the 5,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.026
it's not a limit
that we've reached

00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:06.150
measurement technique-wise?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.186
That's what it actually
is, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:09.186 --> 00:16:11.630
PROFESSOR: Yes, I was
going to mention that.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.710
We actually do see fluctuations
at the level of one part in 10

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.540
to the five.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.730
So it's not just a limit.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.230
It is an actual observation.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.840
And what we interpret is
that the photons that we're

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.480
seeing in the CMB have been
flying along on straight lines

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.906
since the time of decoupling.

00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:33.530
And therefore, what
they show us really

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.071
is an image of what
the universe look

00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.080
like at the time of decoupling.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.200
And that image is an image
of the universe which

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.767
is almost a perfectly smooth
mass density and a perfectly

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:44.350
smooth temperature--
it really is just

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.620
radiation-- but tiny
ripples superimposed

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.210
on top of that uniformity
where the ripples have

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.240
an amplitude of order
of 10 to the minus 5.

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:57.840
And those ripples are
important, because we

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.110
think that those are the
origin of all structure

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.760
in the universe.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.260
The universe is
gravitationally unstable

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.069
where there's a positive
ripple making the mass density

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.160
slightly higher than average.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.170
That creates a slightly
stronger than average

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.609
gravitational field
pulling in extra matter,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.010
creating a still stronger
gravitational field.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.339
And the process cascades
until you ultimately

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.660
have galaxies and
clusters of galaxies

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.990
and all the complexity
in the universe.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.960
But it starts from these
seeds, these minor fluctuations

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.260
at the level of one
part in 10 to the five.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.970
But for now we want
to discuss is simply

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.960
the question of how
did we get so uniform.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.210
We'll talk about how the
non-uniformities arise later

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.640
in the context of inflation.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.030
The basic picture is
that we are someplace.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.540
I'll put us here in
a little diagram.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.690
We are receiving photons,
say, from opposite directions

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.190
in the sky.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.930
Those little arrows represent
the incoming patterns

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.310
of two different
CMB photons coming

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.020
from opposite directions.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.480
And what I'm interested
in doing to understand

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.570
the situation with regard
to this uniformity is I'm

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.240
interested in tracing
these photons back

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.570
to where they originated
at time t sub d.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.169
And I want to do
that on both sides.

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:22.460
But, of course, it's symmetric.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.052
So I only need to
do one calculation.

00:18:25.052 --> 00:18:26.520
And what I want
to know is how far

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.260
apart were these two points.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.690
Because I want to explore
the question of whether

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.360
or not this uniformity
in temperature

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.290
could just be mundane.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.590
If you let any object
sit for a long time,

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.580
it will approach a
uniform temperature.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.230
That's why pizza gets cold when
you take it out of the oven.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.730
So could that be responsible
for this uniformity?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.860
And what we'll see
is that it cannot.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.040
Because these two points
are just too far apart

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.600
for them to come in
to thermal equilibrium

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.830
by ordinary thermal
equilibrium processes

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.210
in the context of the
conventional big bang theory.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.560
So we want to calculate how
far apart these points were

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.252
at the time of emission.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.180
So what do we know?

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.900
We know that the temperature
at the time of decoupling

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.920
was about 3,000
Kelvin, which is really

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.850
where we started with our
discussion of decoupling.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.540
We did not do the
statistical mechanics

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.370
associated with this statement.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.485
But for a given density,
you can calculate

00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:27.880
at what temperature
hydrogen ionizes.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.740
And for the density that we
expect for the early universe,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.254
that's the temperature at
which the ionization occurs.

00:19:34.254 --> 00:19:35.670
So that's where
decoupling occurs.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.900
That's where it becomes neutral
as the universe expands.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.977
We also know that
during this period, aT,

00:19:44.977 --> 00:19:46.560
the scale factor
times the temperature

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.950
is about equal to
a constant, which

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.370
follows as a consequence
of conservation of entropy,

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.879
the idea that the universe
is near thermal equilibrium.

00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:56.170
So the entropy does not change.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:04.260
Then we can calculate
the z for decoupling,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.070
because it would just be the
ratio of the temperatures.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.630
It's defined by the ratio
of the scale factors.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.250
This defines what you mean
by 1 plus z decoupling.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.690
But if aT is about
equal to a constant,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.990
we can relate this to the
temperatures inversely.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.510
So the temperature of decoupling
goes in the numerator.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.810
And the temperature today
goes into the denominator.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:34.680
And, numerically,
that's about 1,100.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.780
So the z of the cosmic
background radiation

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.020
is about 1,100, vastly larger
than the red shifts associated

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.930
with observations of
galaxies or supernovae.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.160
From the z, we can calculate
the physical distance today

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.870
of these two locations, because
this calculation we already

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.370
did.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.770
So I'm going to call l sub p
the physical distance between us

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.520
and the source of
this radiation.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.951
And its value today-- I'm
starting with this formula

00:21:18.951 --> 00:21:20.450
simply because we
already derived it

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:30.430
on a homework set-- it's 2c h
naught inverse times 1 minus 1

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.250
over the square
root of 1 plus z.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.480
And this calculation was done
for a flat matter dominated

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:55.064
universe, flat matter dominated.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:56.730
Of course, that's
only an approximation,

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.930
because we know our
real universe was matter

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.380
dominated at the
start of this period.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.830
But it did not remain
matter dominated

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.980
through to the present at
about 5,000 or 6,000 years ago.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.990
We switched to a situation where
the dark energy is actually

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.330
larger than the
non-relativistic matter.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.830
So we're ignoring
that effect, which

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.996
means we're only going to
get an approximation here.

00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:19.770
But it will still be easily
good enough to make the point.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.400
For a z this large, this
factor is a small correction.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.390
I think this ends up
being 0.97, or something

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.160
like that, very close to 1,
which means what we're getting

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.500
is very close to 2c h
naught inverse, which

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.610
is the actual horizon.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.894
The horizon corresponds
to z equals infinity.

00:22:37.894 --> 00:22:39.310
If you think about
it, that's what

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:41.055
you expect the horizon to be.

00:22:41.055 --> 00:22:43.026
It corresponds to
infinite red shift.

00:22:43.026 --> 00:22:44.650
And you don't see
anything beyond that.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:56.000
So if we take the best value
we have for h naught, which I'm

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.970
taking from the
Planck satellite, 57.3

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:06.130
kilometers per second
per megaparsec,

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:14.980
and put that and the value
for z into this formula,

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:24.080
we get l sub p of t naught
of 28.2 billion light years

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.700
times 10 to the 9 light year.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:35.020
So it's of course larger
than ct as we expect.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.450
It's basically 3ct for a
matter dominated universe.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:42.520
And 3ct is the same
as 2ch 0 inverse.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.010
Now, what we want
to know, though,

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.510
is how far away was this
when the emission occurred,

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.200
not the present distance.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.840
We looked at the
present distance

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.030
simply because we had a formula
for it from our homework set.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.290
But we know how to extrapolate
that backwards, l sub

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.070
t at time t sub d.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.550
Distances that are fixed
in co-moving space,

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.050
which these are,
are just stretched

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.420
with the scale factor.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.280
So this will just
be the scale factor

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.180
at the time of decoupling
divided by the scale factor

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.450
today times the
present distance.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:30.790
And this is, again, given by
this ratio of temperatures.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.400
So it's 1 over
1,100, the inverse

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.170
of what we had over there.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.160
So the separation
at this early time

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.070
is just 1,100 times smaller
than the separation today.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:46.350
And that can be
evaluated numerically.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:54.900
And it gives us 2.56 times
10 to the seven light years,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.747
so 25 million light years.

00:24:59.747 --> 00:25:01.830
Now, the point is that
that's significantly larger

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.724
than the horizon
distance at that time.

00:25:05.724 --> 00:25:07.140
And remember, the
horizon distance

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:09.770
is the maximum possible
distance that anything

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.280
can travel limited
by the speed of light

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.710
from the time of the
big bang up to any given

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:17.790
point in cosmic history.

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:23.060
So the horizon at
time t sub d is just

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.480
given by the simple formula
that the physical value

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.180
of the horizon
distance, l sub h phys,

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.570
l sub horizon physical, at
time t sub d is just equal to,

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:41.720
for a matter dominated
universe, 3c times t sub d.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.670
And that we can evaluate,
given what we have.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:52.050
And it's about 1.1 times 10 to
the sixth light years, which

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.840
is significantly less than
2.56 times 10 to the seven

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.790
light years.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.920
And, in fact, the ratio of
the two, given these numbers,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:10.870
is that l sub p of t sub d
over l sub h is also of t sub

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:19.720
d is about equal to 23,
just doing the arithmetic.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.170
And that means if we go
back to this picture,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.820
these two points of emission
were separated from each other

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.995
by about 46 horizon distances.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.900
And that's enough to
imply that there's no way

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.880
that this point could have known
anything whatever about what

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.100
was going on at this point.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.690
Yet somehow they knew to
emit these two photons

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.100
at the same time at
the same temperature.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.300
And that's the mystery.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.630
One can get around this
mystery if one simply

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.460
assumes that the singularity
that created all of this

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.359
produced a perfectly homogeneous
universe from the very start.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.150
Since we don't understand
that singularity,

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.630
we're allowed to attribute
anything we want to it.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.330
So in particular, you can
attribute perfect homogeneity

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:15.729
to the singularity.

00:27:15.729 --> 00:27:17.270
But that's not really
an explanation.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.260
That's an assumption.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.060
So if one wants to be able
to explain this uniformity,

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.760
then one simply cannot do it
in the context of conventional

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.010
cosmology.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.880
There's just no
way that causality,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.240
the limit of the speed of
light, allows this point

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.150
to know anything about what's
going on at that point.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:34.650
Yes?

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.910
AUDIENCE: How could a
singularity not be uniform?

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.520
Because If it had
non-uniform [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.537
then not be singular?

00:27:41.537 --> 00:27:42.953
PROFESSOR: OK, the
question is how

00:27:42.953 --> 00:27:46.020
can a singularity
not be uniform?

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.480
The answer is,
yes, singularities

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.560
can not be uniform.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.090
And I think the way one can
show that is a little hard.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.810
But you have to imagine a
non-uniform thing collapsing.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.060
And then it would just be
the time reverse, everything

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.750
popping out of the singularity.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.850
So you can ask, does
a non-uniform thing

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.534
collapse to a singularity?

00:28:03.534 --> 00:28:05.450
And the answer to that
question is not obvious

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.510
and really was debated
for a long time.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.830
But there were theorems
proven by Hawking and Penrose

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.170
that indeed not only do the
homogeneous solutions that we

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.722
look at collapse but in
homogeneous solutions also

00:28:18.722 --> 00:28:19.805
collapse to singularities.

00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:25.380
So a singularity does
not have to be uniform.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.150
OK, so this is the story
of the horizon problem.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.950
And as I said, you
can get around it

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.325
if you're willing to just
assume that the singularity was

00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.040
homogeneous.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.550
But if you want to have a
dynamical explanation for how

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.100
the uniformity of the
universe was established,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.730
then you need some model
other than this conventional

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.670
cosmological model that
we've been discussing.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.660
And inflation will
be such a twist

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.120
which will allow a
solution to this problem.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.830
OK, so if there
are no questions,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.400
no further questions,
we'll go on

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.270
to the next problem
I want to discuss,

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.520
which is of a similar nature
in that you can get around it

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.670
by making strong assumptions
about the initial singularity.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.020
But if one wants,
again, something

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.530
you can put your hands on,
rather than just an assumption

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.550
about a singularity, then
inflation will do the job.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.590
But you cannot solve the
problem in the context

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:24.055
of a conventional
big bang theory,

00:29:24.055 --> 00:29:26.430
because the mechanics of the
conventional big bang theory

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.720
are simply well-defined.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.510
So what I want to
talk here is what

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.980
is called the flatness
problem, where flatness

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.840
is in the sense of
Omega very near 1.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.470
And this is
basically the problem

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:48.930
of why is Omega today
somewhere near 1?

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.360
So Omega naught is the
present value of Omega,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.795
why is it about equal to 1?

00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:57.170
Now, what do we
know first of all

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.750
about it being about equal to 1?

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:03.900
The best value from
the Planck group,

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.890
this famous Planck
satellite that I've

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.820
been quoting a lot
of numbers from--

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.970
and I think in all cases,
I've been quoting numbers

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.310
that they've established
combining their own data

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.897
with some other pieces of data.

00:30:16.897 --> 00:30:18.480
So it's not quite
the satellite alone.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.730
Although, they do give numbers
for the satellite alone

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.800
which are just a little
bit less precise.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.410
But the best number they give
for Omega naught is minus

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:34.560
0.0010 plus or minus 0.0065.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.460
Oops, I didn't put
enough zeroes there.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.657
So it's 0.0065 is the error.

00:30:47.657 --> 00:30:49.740
So the error is just a
little bit more than a half

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.320
of a percent.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:56.330
And as you see, consistent
with-- I'm sorry,

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.650
I meant this to be 1.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:01.680
Hold on.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:09.750
This is Omega naught minus 1
that I'm writing a formula for.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.060
So Omega naught is very
near 1 up to that accuracy.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.620
What I want to emphasize in
terms of this flatness problem

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.920
is that you don't need to know
that Omega naught is very, very

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.180
close to 1 today,
which we now do know.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:43.090
But even back when inflation
was first invented around 1980,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.630
in circa 1980 we
certainly didn't

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.740
know that Omega was so
incredibly close to 1.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.950
But we did know that
Omega was somewhere

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:57.790
in the range of about
0.1 and 0.2, which is not

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.140
nearly as close to 1 as what we
know now, but still close to 1.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.420
I'll argue that the
flatness problem exists

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.640
for these numbers
almost as strongly

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.000
as it exists for those numbers.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.990
Differ, but this is still a
very, very strong argument

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:15.240
that even a number like
this is amazingly close to 1

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.350
considering what
you should expect.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.255
Now, what underlies this is the
expectations, how close should

00:32:22.255 --> 00:32:24.070
we expect Omega to be to 1?

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.170
And the important
underlying piece

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:31.560
of dynamics that controls this
is the fact that Omega equals 1

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.370
is an unstable
equilibrium point.

00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:37.290
That means it's like a
pencil balancing on its tip.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.920
If Omega is exactly
equal to 1, that

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.650
means you have a flat universe.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.270
And an exactly
flat universe will

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.390
remain an exactly
flat universe forever.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.055
So if Omega is
exactly equal to 1,

00:32:48.055 --> 00:32:51.580
it will remain exactly
equal to 1 forever.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:54.420
But if Omega in
the early universe

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.390
were just a tiny
bit bigger than 1--

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:58.220
and we're about
to calculate this,

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:05.170
but I'll first qualitatively
describe the result--

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.522
it would rise and would
rapidly reach infinity,

00:33:08.522 --> 00:33:10.980
which is what it reaches if
you have a closed universe when

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.010
a closed universe
reaches its maximum size.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.830
So Omega becomes infinity and
then the universe recollapses.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.395
So if Omega were
bigger than 1, it

00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:20.870
would rapidly approach infinity.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.300
If Omega in the early universe
were just a little bit less

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.250
than 1, it would rapidly
trail off towards 0

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.990
and not stay 1 for
any length of time.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.000
So the only way to
get Omega near 1 today

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.310
is like having a pencil
that's almost straight

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.470
up after standing there
for 1 billion years.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:41.195
It'd have to have
started out incredibly

00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:42.320
close to being straight up.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.250
It has to have
started out incredibly

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.240
close to Omega equals 1.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.080
And we're going to
calculate how close.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.160
So that's the set-up.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.700
So the question we want to
ask is how close did Omega

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.940
have to be to 1 in
the early universe

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.110
to be in either one of
these allowed ranges today.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.100
And for the early
universe, I'm going

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.220
to take t equals one second
as my time at which I'll

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.389
do these calculations.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.639
And, historically, that's
where this problem was first

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:17.610
discussed by Dicke and
Peebles back in 1979.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.040
And the reason why one
second was chosen by them,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.150
and why it's a sensible time
for us to talk about as well,

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.729
is that one second
is the beginning

00:34:25.729 --> 00:34:27.770
of the processes of
nucleosynthesis, which you've

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.370
read about in
Weinberg and in Ryden,

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:34.610
and provides a real test of
our understanding of cosmology

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.969
at those times.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.721
So we could say that we
have real empirical evidence

00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:40.929
in the statement that the
predictions of the chemical

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.678
elements work.

00:34:42.678 --> 00:34:44.719
We could say that we have
real empirical evidence

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.900
that our cosmological model
works back to one second

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.900
after the Big Bang.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.745
So we're going to
choose one second

00:34:51.745 --> 00:34:54.120
for the time at which we're
going to calculate what Omega

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.840
must've been then for it to
be an allowed range today.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:20.480
How close must Omega have been
to 1 at t equals 1 second?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.530
Question mark.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.030
OK, now, to do this
calculation, you

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.930
don't need to know anything
that you don't already know.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.070
It really follows as a
consequence of the Friedmann

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:33.710
equation and how matter and
temperature and so on behave

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.902
with time during radiation
in matter dominated eras.

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:40.360
So we're going to start with
just the plain old first order

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.680
Fiedmann equation, h squared
is equal to 8 pi over 3 g Rho

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.370
minus kc squared
over a squared, which

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:56.640
you have seen many, many
times already in this course.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.320
We can combine that
with other equations

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.140
that you've also
seen many times.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.920
The critical density is just
the value of the density

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.540
when k equals 0.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.900
So you just solve
this equation for Rho.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:14.484
And you get 3h
squared over h pi g.

00:36:14.484 --> 00:36:15.900
This defines the
critical density.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.650
It's that density which makes
the universe flat, k equals 0.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.130
And then our standard
definition is

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.412
that Omega is just defined to be
the actual mass density divided

00:36:26.412 --> 00:36:27.620
by the critical mass density.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.990
And Omega will be the quantity
we're trying to trace.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.430
And we're also going
to make use of the fact

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.250
that during the era that
we're talking about,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.990
at is essentially
equal to a constant.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.870
It does change a little bit
when electron and positron

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.910
pairs freeze out.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.600
It changes by a
factor of something

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.470
like 4/11 to the 1/3 power
or something like that.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.760
But that power will be of
order one for our purposes.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.180
But I guess this is
a good reason why

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.679
I should put a
squiggle here instead

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:56.910
of an equal sign as an
approximate equality,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.240
but easily good enough
for our purposes,

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.565
meaning the corrections
of order one.

00:37:02.565 --> 00:37:03.940
We're going to
see the problem is

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.170
much, much bigger
than order one.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.010
So a correction of order
one doesn't matter.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.210
Now, I'm going to start by using
the Planck satellite limits.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:18.230
And at the end, I'll just make
a comment about the circa 1980

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.160
situation.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:25.922
But if we look at the
Planck limits-- I'm sorry.

00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:28.380
Since I'm going to write an
equation for a peculiar looking

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.560
quantity, I should
motivate the peculiar

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.667
looking quantity first.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.700
It turns out to be useful
for these purposes.

00:37:39.482 --> 00:37:40.940
And this purpose
means we're trying

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.220
to track how Omega
changes with time.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.580
It turns out to be useful
to reshuffle the Friedmann.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.220
And it is just an
algebraic reshuffling

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:52.680
of the Friedmann equation
and the definitions

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.200
that we have here.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.360
We can rewrite the
Friedmann equation

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:02.560
as Omega minus 1 over Omega
is equal to a quantity called

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.174
a times the temperature
squared over Rho.

00:38:07.174 --> 00:38:09.840
Now, the temperature didn't even
occur in the original equation.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.460
So things might look a
little bit suspicious.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.440
I haven't told
you what a is yet.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:26.925
a is 3k c squared over 8
pi g a squared t squared.

00:38:26.925 --> 00:38:29.550
So when you put the a into this
equation, the t squares cancel.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.410
So the equation doesn't
really have any temperature

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.660
dependence.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.360
But I factored things
this way, because we

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.789
know that at is
approximately a constant.

00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:40.830
And that means that this
capital a, which is just

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.205
other things which
are definitely

00:38:42.205 --> 00:38:45.260
constant times, a square t
square in the denominator,

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.420
this a is approximately
a constant.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.330
And you'll have to
check me at home

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.705
that this is exactly equivalent
to the original Friedmann

00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:58.870
equation, no approximations
whatever, just substitutions

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.620
of Omega and the
definition of Rho sub c.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.040
So the nice thing about
this is that we can read off

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.790
the time dependence
of the right-hand side

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.290
as long as we know the time
dependence in the temperature

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.280
and the time dependence
of the energy density.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.350
And we do for matter dominated
and radiation dominated eras.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.870
So this, essentially,
solves the problem for us.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.120
And now it's really
just a question

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.500
of looking at the
numerics that follow

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.920
as a consequence
of that equation.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.840
And this quantity,
we're really interested

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.572
in just Omega minus 1.

00:39:30.572 --> 00:39:32.780
The Friedmann equation gave
us the extra complication

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.372
of an Omega in the denominator.

00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:36.580
But in the end, we're going
to be interested in cases

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.121
where Omega is very,
very close to 1.

00:39:38.121 --> 00:39:41.200
So the Omega in the denominator
we could just set equal to one.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200
And it's the Omega minus
1 in the numerator that

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.390
controls the value of
the left-hand side.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:57.080
So if we look at these Planck
limits, we could ask how big

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.220
can that be?

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.030
And it's biggest if the error
occurs on the negative side.

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.120
So it contributes to
this small mean value

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.260
which is slightly negative.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.970
And it gives you 0.0075
for Omega minus 1.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.140
And then if you put that in the
numerator and the same thing

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:20.560
in the denominator, you
get something like 0.0076.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.760
But I'm just going
to use the bound

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:32.330
that Omega naught minus 1
over Omega is less than 0.01.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:34.950
But the more accurate
thing would be 0.076.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.430
But, again, we're not really
interested in small factors

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.930
here.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.830
And this is a one signa error.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.010
So the actual error could
be larger than this,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.730
but not too much
larger than this.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.010
So I'm going to divide the time
interval between one second

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:18.940
and now up into two integrals.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:20.920
From one second to
about 50,000 years,

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.940
the universe was
radiation dominated.

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.680
We figured out earlier that the
matter to radiation equality

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.470
happens at about 50,000 years.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.830
I think we may have gotten
47,000 years or something

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.530
like that when we calculated it.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:41.962
So for t equals 1
second to-- I'm sorry,

00:41:41.962 --> 00:41:43.420
I'm going to do it
the other order.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.711
I'm going to start with the
present and work backwards.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:42:01.966
So for t equals 50,000
years to the present,

00:42:01.966 --> 00:42:03.340
the universe is
matter dominated.

00:42:08.514 --> 00:42:09.930
And the next thing
is that we know

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.710
how mattered dominated
universe's behave.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:14.030
We don't need to recalculate it.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:17.360
We know that the scale
factor for a matter

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:22.340
dominated flat universe goes
like t to the 2/3 power,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.290
I should have a
portionality sign here.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.390
a of t is proportional
to t to 2/3.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.602
And it's fair to assume
flat, because we're always

00:42:31.602 --> 00:42:33.935
going to be talking about
universes that are nearly flat

00:42:33.935 --> 00:42:36.059
and becoming more and more
flat as we go backwards,

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:37.866
as we'll see.

00:42:37.866 --> 00:42:39.990
And again, this isn't an
approximate calculation.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.890
One could do it more
accurately if one wanted to.

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:43.960
But there's really no need
to, because the result

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.610
will be so extreme.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:51.101
The temperature behaves like
one over the scale factor.

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.225
And that will be true for
both the matter dominated

00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:57.070
and a radiation
dominated universe.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.680
And the energy density
will be proportional to one

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.910
over the scale factor cubed.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:11.040
And then if we put those
together and use the formula

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.200
on the other blackboard and ask
how Omega minus 1 over Omega

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.600
behaves, it's proportional
to the temperature squared

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.160
divided by the energy density.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.820
The temperature
goes like 1 over a.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.990
So temperature squared
goes like 1 over a squared.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:30.160
But Rho in the denominator
goes like 1 over a cubed.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:33.310
So you have 1 over a squared
divided by 1 over a cubed.

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:36.990
And that means it just goes
like a, the scale factor itself.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.740
So Omega minus 1 over
Omega is proportional to a.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.310
And that means it's
proportional to t to the 2/3.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:55.240
So that allows us to
write down an equation,

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.810
since we want to
relate everything

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.630
to the value of Omega
minus 1 over Omega today,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:08.410
we can write Omega
minus 1 over Omega

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:21.660
at 50,000 years is about equal
to the ratio of the 2 times

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:37.210
the 50,000 years and today,
which is 13.8 billion years,

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:41.640
to the 2/3 power
since Omega minus 1

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.989
grows like t to the 2/3.

00:44:42.989 --> 00:44:44.530
I should maybe have
pointed out here,

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.800
this telling us that Omega
minus 1 grows with time.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.762
That's the important feature.

00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:51.670
It grows t to the 2/3.

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:55.420
So the value at 50,000
years is this ratio

00:44:55.420 --> 00:45:00.870
to the 2/3 power times
Omega minus 1 over Omega

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:04.060
today, which I can
indicate just by putting

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.280
subscript zeros on my Omegas.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.310
And that makes it today.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.430
And I've written this as
a fraction less than one.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.810
This says that Omega
minus 1 over Omega

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.840
was smaller than it
is now by this ratio

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.720
to the 2/3 power, which
follows from the fact

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.380
that Omega minus 1 over Omega
grows like t to the 2/3.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:32.230
OK, we're now halfway there.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:38.010
And the other half is similar,
so it will go quickly.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.020
We now want to go
from 50,000 years

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.054
to one second using the
fact that during that era

00:45:46.054 --> 00:45:47.595
the universe was
radiation dominated.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:46:06.660
So for t equals 1
second to 50,000 years,

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.350
the universe is
radiation dominated.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:18.390
And that implies
that the scale factor

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.040
is proportional to t to the 1/2.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.000
The temperature is,
again, proportional to 1

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.880
over the scale factor.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.070
That's just
conservation of entropy.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:36.212
And the energy density goes
one over the scale factor

00:46:36.212 --> 00:46:36.795
to the fourth.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.630
So, again, we go
back to this formula

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.500
and do the corresponding
arithmetic.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.960
Temperature goes like 1 over a.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.140
Temperature squared goes
like 1 over a squared.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.616
That's our numerator.

00:46:50.616 --> 00:46:51.990
This time, in the
denominator, we

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.130
have Rho, which goes like
one over a to the fourth.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.650
So we have 1 over a
squared divided by 1

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.647
over a to the fourth.

00:46:58.647 --> 00:47:00.230
And that means it
goes like a squared.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.130
So we get Omega
minus 1 over Omega

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.080
is proportional to a squared.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.630
And since goes like
the square root of t,

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.230
a squared goes like t.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:20.962
So during the
radiation dominated era

00:47:20.962 --> 00:47:22.420
this diverges even
a little faster.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.294
PROFESSOR: It goes like
t, rather than like t

00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:28.060
to the 2/3, which is a
slightly slower growth.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.170
And using this fact, we
can put it all together now

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:41.970
and say that Omega minus
1 over Omega at 1 second

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:47.520
is about equal to 1
second over 50,000

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:55.020
years to the first
power-- this is going

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.950
like the first
power of t-- times

00:47:57.950 --> 00:48:12.420
the value of Omega minus 1
over Omega at 50,000 years.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.380
And Omega at 50,000 years,
we can put in that equality

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.560
and relate everything
to the present value.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.760
And when you do that,
putting it all together,

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:53.220
you ultimately find that Omega
minus 1 in magnitude at t

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:59.440
equals 1 second is less than
about 10 to the minus 18.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.780
This is just putting
together these inequalities

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.121
and using the Planck value for
the present value, the Planck

00:49:05.121 --> 00:49:05.620
inequality.

00:49:08.597 --> 00:49:10.930
So then 10 to the minus 18
is a powerfully small number.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.810
What we're saying is that to
be in the allowed range today,

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.010
at one second
after the Big Bang,

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.870
Omega have to have
been equal to 1

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.870
in the context of this
conventional cosmology

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:23.680
to an accuracy of
18 decimal places.

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:26.900
And the reason
that's a problem is

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.630
that we don't know
any physics whatever

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.390
that forces Omega
to be equal to 1.

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.680
Yet, somehow Omega
apparently has

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.930
chosen to be 1 to an accuracy
of 18 decimal places.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.760
And I mention that the argument
wasn't that different in 1980.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.520
In 1980, we only knew
this instead of that.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:48.590
And that meant that instead
of having 10 to the minus 2

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:51.840
on the right-hand side
here, we would have had 10

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.050
differing by three
orders of magnitude.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:56.270
So instead of getting
10 to the minus 18 here,

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.255
we would have gotten
10 to minus 15.

00:49:58.255 --> 00:50:00.880
And 10 to minus 15 is, I
guess, a lot bigger than 10

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.620
to minus 18 by a
factor of 1,000.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.530
But still, it's an
incredibly small number.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.975
And the argument really
sounds exactly the same.

00:50:07.975 --> 00:50:10.660
The question is, how
did Omega minus 1

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.610
get to be so incredibly small?

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.100
What mechanism was there?

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.830
Now, like the
horizon problem, you

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.250
can get around it by
attributing your ignorance

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.340
to the singularity.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:22.840
You can say the
universe started out

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.470
with Omega exactly equal
to 1 or Omega equal to 1

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.459
to some extraordinary accuracy.

00:50:28.459 --> 00:50:30.000
But that's not really
an explanation.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.740
It really is just a
hope for an explanation.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.330
And the point is
that inflation, which

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.970
you'll be learning about
in the next few lectures,

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:37.540
provides an actual explanation.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.710
It provides a
mechanism that drives

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.280
the early universe towards Omega
equals 1, thereby explaining

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.810
why the early universe
had a value of Omega

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.640
so incredibly close to 1.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.800
So that's what we're going
to be learning shortly.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.675
But at the present time,
the takeaway message

00:50:53.675 --> 00:50:56.540
is simply that for Omega to
be in the allowed range today

00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.130
it had to start out unbelievably
close to 1 at, for example, t

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.800
equals 1 second.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.170
And within
conventional cosmology,

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:07.920
there's no explanation for
why Omega so close to 1

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.610
was in any way preferred.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.630
Any questions about that?

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:14.424
Yes?

00:51:14.424 --> 00:51:16.844
AUDIENCE: Is there
any heuristic argument

00:51:16.844 --> 00:51:21.684
that omega [INAUDIBLE]
universe has total energy zero?

00:51:21.684 --> 00:51:25.556
So isn't that, at
least, appealing?

00:51:25.556 --> 00:51:28.440
PROFESSOR: OK the question
is, isn't it maybe appealing

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.510
that Omega should equal
1 because Omega equals

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.525
1 is a flat universe,
which has 0 total energy?

00:51:34.525 --> 00:51:36.650
I guess, the point is that
any closed universe also

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:38.430
has zero total energy.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:42.200
So I don't think Omega
equals 1 is so special.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:46.590
And furthermore, if you look at
the spectrum of possible values

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:52.270
of Omega, it can be positive--
I'm sorry, not with Omega.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:55.564
Let me look at the
curvature itself, little k.

00:51:55.564 --> 00:51:57.230
Little k can be
positive, in which case,

00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:58.035
you have a closed universe.

00:51:58.035 --> 00:51:59.451
It can be negative,
in which case,

00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:00.800
you have an open universe.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.510
And only for the one
special case of k

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:07.460
equals 0, which really is one
number in the whole real line

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.576
of possible numbers, do
you get exactly flat.

00:52:10.576 --> 00:52:12.450
So I think from that
point of view flat looks

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:17.420
highly special and not at
all plausible as what you'd

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.620
get if you just grabbed
something out of a grab bag.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.372
But, ultimately, I think there's
no way of knowing for sure.

00:52:24.372 --> 00:52:26.830
Whether or not Omega equals 1
coming out of the singularity

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.080
is plausible really depends
on knowing something about

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.740
the singularity, which we don't.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.550
So you're free to speculate.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:34.430
But the nice thing
about inflation

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.220
is that you don't
need to speculate.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.500
Inflation really does
provide a physical mechanism

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.070
that we can understand
that drives Omega

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.830
to be 1 exactly
like what we see.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.500
Any other questions?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.540
OK, in that case,
what I'd like to do

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.120
is to move on to
problem number three,

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.010
which is the magnetic monopole
problem, which unfortunately

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:59.410
requires some background
to understand.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.770
And we don't have too much time.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:04.240
So I'm going to go through
things rather quickly.

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.860
This magnetic
monopole problem is

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.100
different from the other two
in the first two problems

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:18.270
I discussed are just problems
of basic classical cosmology.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.750
The magnetic
monopole problem only

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:24.200
arises if we believe that
physics at very high energies

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.080
is described what are called
grand unified theories, which

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.400
then imply that these magnetic
monopoles exist and allow us

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.410
a root for estimating
how many of them

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.950
would have been produced.

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:35.520
And the point is
that if we assume

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.290
that grand unified theories
are the right description

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:41.060
of physics at very
high energies, then

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.750
we conclude that far too
many magnetic monopoles would

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:46.970
be produced if we had just the
standard cosmology that we've

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.534
been talking about
without inflation.

00:53:48.534 --> 00:53:50.575
So that's going to be the
thrust of the argument.

00:53:50.575 --> 00:53:52.220
And it will all go
away if you decide

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.595
you don't believe in grand
unified theories, which you're

00:53:54.595 --> 00:53:55.120
allowed to.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.370
But there is some evidence
for grand unified theories.

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.900
And I'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.230
Now, I'm not going to have
time to completely describe

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:04.320
grand unified theories.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.892
But I will try to tell
you enough odd facts

00:54:06.892 --> 00:54:08.100
about grand unified theories.

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.760
So there will be kind of
a consistent picture that

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.314
will hang together, even though
there's no claim that I can

00:54:14.314 --> 00:54:16.730
completely teach you grand
unified theories in the next 10

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.510
minutes and then talk
about the production

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.884
of magnetic monopoles and
those theories in the next five

00:54:20.884 --> 00:54:21.390
minutes.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.780
But that will be
sort of the goal.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.342
So to start with, I
mentioned that there's

00:54:26.342 --> 00:54:28.300
something called the
standard model of particle

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.790
physics, which is
enormously successful.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:33.720
It's been developed
really since the 1970s

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.710
and has not changed too
much since maybe 1975 or so.

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:40.950
We have, since 1975, learned
that neutrinos have masses.

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.200
And those can be incorporated
into the standard model.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.460
And that's a recent addition.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.380
And, I guess, in
1975 I'm not sure

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.040
if we knew all three
generations that we now know.

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.840
But the matter, the
fundamental particles

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.277
fall into three
generations, these particles

00:54:57.277 --> 00:54:58.110
of a different type.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:59.464
And we'll talk about them later.

00:54:59.464 --> 00:55:00.505
But these are the quarks.

00:55:00.505 --> 00:55:02.890
These are the
spin-1/2 particles,

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.620
these three columns on the left.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:09.680
On the top, we have the quarks,
up, down, charm, strange, top,

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.180
and bottom.

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.460
There are six different
flavors of quarks.

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:18.502
Each quark, by the way, comes
in three different colors.

00:55:18.502 --> 00:55:19.960
The different colors
are absolutely

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.510
identical to each other.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.870
There's a perfect
symmetry among colors.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.730
There's no perfect
symmetry here.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.354
Each of these quarks is a little
bit different from the others.

00:55:28.354 --> 00:55:30.630
Although, there are
approximate symmetries.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.860
And related to each
family of quarks

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.320
is a family of
leptons, particles

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.660
that do not undergo
strong interactions

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.310
in the electron-like
particles and neutrinos.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.750
This row is the neutrinos.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:45.480
There's an electron neutrino,
a muon neutrino, and a tau

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.590
neutrino, like
we've already said.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.180
And there's an electron,
a muon, and a tao,

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.820
which I guess we've
also already said.

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:56.690
So the particles on the left are
all of the spin-1/2 particles

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:00.060
that exist in the standard
model of particle physics.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:03.240
And then on the right, we
have the Boson particles,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.560
the particles of
integer span, starting

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.910
with the photon on the top.

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:09.870
Under that in this
list-- there's

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.080
no particular order
in here really-- is

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.840
the gluon which is
the particle that's

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.340
like the photon but the
particle which describes

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.530
the strong interactions, which
are somewhat more complicated

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:24.890
and electromagnetism, but still
described by spin-1 particles

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:26.940
just like the photon.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.190
And then two other spin-1
particles, the z0 and the w

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:33.130
plus and minus, which
are a neutral particle

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.000
and a charged
particle, which are

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.355
the carriers of the
so-called weak interactions.

00:56:37.355 --> 00:56:40.490
The weak interactions
being the only

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.380
non-gravitational interactions
that neutrinos undergo.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.660
And the weak interactions
are responsible

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.340
for certain particle decays.

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:50.870
For example, a neutron can
decay into a proton giving off

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.940
also an electron--
producing a proton,

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.810
yeah-- charge has to be
conserved, proton is positive.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:00.250
So it's produced with
an electron and then

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:04.750
an anti-electron neutrino to
balance the so-called electron

00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.480
lepton number.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.045
And that's a weak direction.

00:57:08.045 --> 00:57:09.920
Essentially, anything
that involves neutrinos

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.474
is going to be weak interaction.

00:57:12.474 --> 00:57:13.640
So these are the characters.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.070
And there's a set
of interactions

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.720
that go with this
set of characters.

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.510
So we have here a
complete model of how

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:24.020
elementary particles interact.

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.580
And the model has been
totally successful.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.130
It actually gives
predictions that

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:32.580
are consistent with every
reliable experiment that

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:36.930
has been done since the
mid-1970s up to the present.

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:38.920
So it's made particle
physics a bit dull

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.140
since we have a theory that
seems to predict everything.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.340
But it's also a
magnificent achievement

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.510
that we have such a theory.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.570
Now, in spite of the fact that
this theory is so unbelievably

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.660
successful I don't think I know
anybody who really regards this

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.360
as a candidate even or the
ultimate theory of nature.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.559
And the reason for that
is maybe twofold, first

00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:04.225
is that it does not
incorporate gravity,

00:58:04.225 --> 00:58:07.060
it only incorporates
particle interactions.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.057
And we know that gravity exists
and has to be put in somehow.

00:58:10.057 --> 00:58:12.640
And there doesn't seem to be any
simple way of putting gravity

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.300
into this theory.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:20.152
And, secondly-- maybe there's
three reasons-- second,

00:58:20.152 --> 00:58:22.610
it does not include any good
candidates for the dark matter

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.390
that we know exists
in cosmology.

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:29.860
And third, excuse me-- and this
is given a lot of importance,

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.600
even though it's an aesthetic
argument-- this model has

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.690
something like 28 free
parameters, quantities that you

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.190
just have to go out and measure
before you can use the model

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:41.540
to make predictions.

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.110
And a large number
of free parameters

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:49.500
is associated, by theoretical
physicists, with ugliness.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:52.460
So this is considered
a very ugly model.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.530
And we have no real
way of knowing,

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:57.650
but almost all
theoretical physicists

00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.130
believe that the
correct theory of nature

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.850
is going to be simpler and
involve many fewer, maybe

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:06.147
none at all, free knobs
that can be turned

00:59:06.147 --> 00:59:07.730
to produce different
kinds of physics.

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:14.500
OK, what I want to
talk about next,

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.100
leading up to grand
unified theories,

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:19.730
is the notion of gauge theories.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:22.270
And, yes?

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:26.206
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, question
real quick from the chart.

00:59:26.206 --> 00:59:28.666
I basically heard
the explanation

00:59:28.666 --> 00:59:31.454
that the reason for the
short range of the weak force

00:59:31.454 --> 00:59:34.324
was the massive mediator that is
the cause of exponential field

00:59:34.324 --> 00:59:35.062
decay.

00:59:35.062 --> 00:59:37.030
But if the [INAUDIBLE]
is massless,

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.490
how do we explain
that to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:41.724
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, the question

00:59:41.724 --> 00:59:43.265
is for those of you
who couldn't hear

00:59:43.265 --> 00:59:45.915
it is that the short range
of the weak interactions,

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:48.500
although I didn't talk about
it, is usually explained

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.970
and is explained by the
fact that the z and w naught

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:53.170
Bosons are very heavy.

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:55.270
And heavy particles
have a short range.

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:57.770
But the strong interactions
seem to also have a short range.

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:01.290
And yet, the gluon is
effectively massless.

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:04.210
That's related to a
complicated issue which

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:05.990
goes by the name of confinement.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.940
Although the gluon is
massless, it's confined.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.820
And confined means that
it cannot exist as a free

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.260
particle.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.960
In some sense, the
strong interactions

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.670
do have a long range in that
if you took a meson, which

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.620
is made out of a quark
and an anti-quark,

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.520
in principle, if
you pulled it apart,

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.720
there'd be a string
of gluon force

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.865
between the quark
and the anti-quark.

01:00:27.865 --> 01:00:29.490
And that would produce
a constant force

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.970
no matter how far
apart you pulled them.

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.680
And the only thing
that intervenes,

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.870
and it is important
that it does intervene,

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:39.480
is that if you pulled
them too far apart

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.380
it would become
energetically favorable

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.776
for a quark anti-quark pair
to materialize in the middle.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:48.150
And then instead of having a
quark here and an anti-quark

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.112
here and a string
between them, you

01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:52.070
would have a quark here
and an anti-quark there

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.140
and a string between them,
and an anti-quark here

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.046
and-- I'm sorry, I
guess it's a quark here

01:00:57.046 --> 01:00:59.170
and an anti-quark there
and a string between those.

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:01.160
And then they would
just fly apart.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.890
So the string can
break by producing

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:04.210
quark anti-quark pairs.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:07.110
But the string can never just
end in the middle of nowhere.

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.967
And that's the essence
of confinement.

01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:10.675
And it's due to the
peculiar interactions

01:01:10.675 --> 01:01:14.772
that these gluons
are believed to obey.

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:16.230
So the gluons behave
in a way which

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:18.490
is somewhat uncharacteristic
of particles.

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.990
Except at very short distances,
they behave very much

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.990
like ordinary particles.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.970
But at larger distances,
these effects of confinement

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:28.570
play a very significant role.

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:30.570
Any other questions?

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:33.810
OK, onward, I want talk
about gauge theories,

01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:35.400
because gauge
theories have a lot

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.530
to do with how one gets
into grand unified theories

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:41.380
from the standard model.

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:44.520
And, basically, a gauge
theory is a theory

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.500
in which the fundamental fields
are not themselves reality.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.680
But rather there's a
set of transformations

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.020
that the fields can
undergo which take you

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.320
from one description
to an equivalent

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.370
description of the same reality.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.940
So there's not a
one to one mapping

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.490
between the fields and reality.

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:03.364
There are many different
field configurations

01:02:03.364 --> 01:02:05.500
that correspond to
the same reality.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.560
And that's basically
what characterizes

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.824
what we call a gauge theory.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:10.740
And you do know one
example of a gauge theory.

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.896
And that's e and m.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:16.990
If e and m is expressed in terms
of the potentials Phi and A,

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.120
you can write e in terms
of the potential that way

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.140
and b as the curl of A, you
could put Phi and A together

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.000
and make a four-vector
if you want

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.052
to do things in a
Lorentz covariant way.

01:02:28.052 --> 01:02:30.260
And the important point,
though, whether you put them

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.440
together or not, is
that you can always

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.380
define a gauge transformation
depending on some arbitrary

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.595
function Lambda, which is a
function of position and time.

01:02:38.595 --> 01:02:40.720
I didn't write in the
arguments, but Lambda is just

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.190
an arbitrary function
of position and time.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:46.450
And for any Lambda you
can replace 5 by 5 prime,

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:50.365
given by this line, and a by
a prime, given by that line.

01:02:50.365 --> 01:02:51.990
And if you go back
and compute e and b,

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:53.860
you'll find that
they'll be unchanged.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.610
And therefore, the
physics is not changed,

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:59.140
because the physics really
is all contained in e and b.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.590
So this gauge transformation
is a transformation

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:04.570
on the fields of the theory--
it can be written covariantly

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:08.065
this way-- which leaves
the physics invariant.

01:03:08.065 --> 01:03:09.940
And it turns out that
all the important field

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:13.770
theories that we know
of are gauge theories.

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:15.970
And that's why it's
worth mentioning here.

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:20.290
Now, for e and m, the gauge
parameter is just this function

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:23.087
Lambda, which is a function
of position and time.

01:03:23.087 --> 01:03:24.670
And an important
issue is what happens

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.480
when you combine
gauge transformations,

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.850
because the succession
of two transformations

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.150
had better also be a
symmetry transformation.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.620
So it's worth understanding
that group structure.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:37.430
And for the case of e
and m, these Lambdas

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:40.930
just add if we make
successive transformations.

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.430
And that means the
group is Abelian.

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.910
It's commutative.

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:47.060
But that's not always the case.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.530
Let's see, where am I going?

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:50.646
OK, next slide actually
comes somewhat later.

01:03:50.646 --> 01:03:52.020
Let me go back to
the blackboard.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:00.340
It turns out that the important
generalization of gauge

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.710
theories is the generalization
from Abelian gauge

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:06.680
theories to non-Abelian ones,
which was done originally

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:16.130
by Yang and Mills
in 1954, I think.

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:19.140
And when it was first proposed,
nobody knew what to do with it.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.310
But, ultimately, these
non-Abelian gauge theories

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:26.170
became the standard model
of particle physics.

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:28.570
And in non-Abelian
gauge theories

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.720
the parameter that describes the
gauge transformation is a group

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.850
element, not just
something that gets added.

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.030
And group elements
multiply, according

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:41.040
to the procedures of some group.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.772
And in particular,
the standard model

01:04:43.772 --> 01:04:44.980
is built out of three groups.

01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:49.430
And the fact that there
are three groups not one

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:52.880
is just an example
of this ugliness

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.980
that I mentioned and is
responsible for the fact

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.470
that there's some significant
number of parameters

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.120
even if there were no
other complications.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.460
So the standard model is based
on three gauge groups, SU3,

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:10.370
SU2, and U1.

01:05:14.459 --> 01:05:16.250
And it won't really be
too important for us

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.920
what exactly these groups are.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.280
Let me just mention
quickly, SU3 is a group of 3

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.530
by 3 matrices which are
unitary in the sense

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:33.130
that u adjoint times u is equal
to 1 and special in the sense

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.390
that they have determinant 1.

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:36.980
And the set of all
3 by 3 matrices

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.438
have those properties
form a group.

01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:39.820
And that group is SU3.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.430
SU2 is the same
thing but replace

01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:44.400
the 3 in all those
sentences by 2s.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.306
U1 is just the group of phases.

01:05:47.306 --> 01:05:48.680
That is the group
of real numbers

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.080
that could be written
as either the i phi.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:55.380
So it's just a complex number of
magnitude 1 with just a phase.

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.510
And you can multiply those
and they form a group.

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:00.740
And the standard model
contains these three groups.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.370
And the three groups
all act independently,

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.952
which means that if you
know about group products,

01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:09.120
one can say that the full
group is the product group.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:16.670
And that just means that a full
description of a group element

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:20.980
is really just a set
of an element of SU3,

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.490
and an element of SU2,
and an element of U1.

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.094
And if you put together three
group elements in each group

01:06:28.094 --> 01:06:29.510
and put them
together with commas,

01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:31.840
that becomes a group element
of the group SU3 cross,

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.660
SU2 cross U1.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.322
And that is the gauge
group of the standard model

01:06:37.322 --> 01:06:38.155
of particle physics.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:07:08.050
OK, now grand unified theories,
a grand unified theory

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.800
is based on the idea that
this set of three groups

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.220
can all be embedded in
a single simple group.

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.160
Now, simple actually has a
mathematical group theory

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:40.660
meaning.

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.660
But it also, for
our purposes, just

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:46.580
means simple, which is
good enough for our brush

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:49.220
through of these arguments.

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.052
And, for example--
and the example

01:07:52.052 --> 01:07:54.010
is shown a little bit in
the lecture notes that

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:57.900
will be posted
shortly-- an example

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:59.570
of a grand unified
theory, and indeed

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:02.070
the first grand unified
theory that was invented,

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:06.260
is based on the full gauge group
SU5, which is just a group of 5

01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:10.750
by 5 matrices which are
unitary and have determinant 1.

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:15.380
And there's an easy way to embed
SU3 and SU2 and U1 into SU5.

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.490
And that's the way that
was used to construct

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:19.930
this grand unified theory.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:29.200
One can take a 5 by 5 matrix--
so this is a 5 by 5 matrix--

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:36.029
and one can simply take
the upper 3 by 3 block

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:40.850
and put an SU3 matrix there.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:46.080
And one can take the
lower 2 by 2 block

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.830
and put an SU2 matrix there.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.939
And then the U1 piece--
there's supposed

01:08:53.939 --> 01:08:57.359
to be a U1 left
over-- the U1 piece

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:01.120
can be obtained by giving
an overall phase to this

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.250
and an overall phase
to that in such a way

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:05.590
that the product of
the five phases is 0.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:08.620
So the determinant
has not changed.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:17.660
So one can put an e to the i2
Phi there and a factor of e

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:22.020
to the minus i3 Phi
there for any Phi.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:28.130
And then this Phi
becomes the description

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:31.950
of the U1 piece of
this construction.

01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:35.020
So we can take an arbitrary
SU3 matrix, and arbitrary SU2

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:39.240
matrix, and an arbitrary
U1 value expressed by Phi

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.810
and put them together
to make an SU5 matrix.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:44.810
And if you think about
it, the SU3 piece

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:47.634
will commute with the SU2
piece and with the U1 piece.

01:09:47.634 --> 01:09:49.800
These three pieces will all
commute with each other,

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.341
if you think about
how multiplication

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:52.620
works with this construction.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.953
So it does exactly what we want.

01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:57.310
It decomposes SU5.

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:01.710
So it has a subgroup of
SU3 cross SU2 across U1.

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:06.560
And that's how the simplest
grand unified theory works.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.060
OK, now, there are important
things that need to be said,

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.540
but we're out of time.

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:18.590
So I guess what we need
to do is to withhold

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:21.690
from the next problem set,
the magnetic monopole problem.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.110
Maybe I was a bit over-ambitious
to put it on the problem set.

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:27.320
So I'll send an email
announcing that.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.474
But the one problem
on the problem

01:10:29.474 --> 01:10:31.390
set for next week about
grand unified theories

01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:32.290
will be withheld.

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:37.250
And Scott Hughes will pick up
this discussion next Tuesday.

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:40.319
So I will see all of
you-- gee willikers,

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:42.360
if you come to my office
hour, I'll see you then.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.110
But otherwise, I may not
see you until the quiz.

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:49.990
So have a good Thanksgiving
and good luck on the quiz.
