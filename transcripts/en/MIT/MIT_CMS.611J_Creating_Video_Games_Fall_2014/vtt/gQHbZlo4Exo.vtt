00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.850
SPEAKER 1: So the schedule
for today-- once again,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.820
another one of those
one hour lecture,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.492
two hour group work things.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.170
We've got a guest
lecturer today.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.084
We're got Luigi, here, to talk
to us about art and artists,

00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:36.250
especially when it comes
to games and, particularly,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.810
visual artists.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.150
Yeah?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.670
LUIGI GUATIERI: Yes.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.086
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
so visual artists

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:41.270
when it comes to
game development.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.148
After his lecture,
and after Q&amp;A, we

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:47.080
don't have any scheduled
play tests today,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.167
but we do have a
couple of guests here

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:51.820
who have some really good
experience making games.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.790
So if you'd like to set aside
10 to 15 minutes per team,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.330
have a person come
and play your game,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.322
I'd highly recommend
taking advantage of it.

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:02.978
I mean, it all depends,
I think, on what state

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:04.810
your games are in.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.280
I do want to know that.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.965
How many teams are
now working in what

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.120
is going to be their final
development environment.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.150
So if you're working
in Phaser, you're

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.275
building in Phaser now, if
you're working in Unity,

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.560
you're working in Unity now.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.194
Looks like one team,
two teams, three teams--

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:21.062
is that two different
teams over there?

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:22.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:23.260
SPEAKER 1: Here.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.940
OK, great.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.790
So everybody's
pretty much working

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.040
in a development environment.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.550
Great.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.040
Cool.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.710
So like I said, as
it says on Stellar,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.000
Wednesday we're going to have
a play test at 3 o'clock.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.982
So at 3 o'clock we're going
to have a guest class come in

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:42.007
to play your games.

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:43.840
We'll do a play test,
just like we've always

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.480
been doing play tests.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.960
And then before that, I'm going
to be giving a talk on fiction

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.481
and story for your games.

00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.980
And in between there will be
time for you to meet your teams

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.980
and set up for your play tests.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.990
LUIGI GUATIERI: Cool,
artists and games.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.350
And So this talk's going
to be about what artists

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.470
do in games, how
to find artists,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.090
how to work with artists,
how artists are involved

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.090
in game development,
the different roles that

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.740
are assigned to them.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm going to be talking
from the independent games

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.170
perspective, so smaller
teams, because that's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.390
sort of my background and
my experience with games.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
But I will talk a little bit
about the diversification

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.690
of artists' roles
in bigger studios.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.080
First, who am I?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.580
I'm me.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.810
I'm this dude in the corner.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.890
My name's Luigi Guatieri.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.820
I'm a local Boston
indie artist, when

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.690
it comes to games at least--
no so much comics anymore.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.690
Yeah, so I work with a lot
of teams in Boston developing

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.590
games.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.950
Since so few of these developers
know a lot of artists,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.950
I get to work on a lot
of different projects,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460
because they don't have a
lot of people to turn to.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.110
And I'll go into
that in a little bit.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.550
Sort of games I've
developed in the past-- I

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.710
worked on Girls Like
Robots with Ziba Scott--

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.070
up there-- which was
published by Adult Swim, iOS.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.890
And he likes to tout it
as the 13th best rated

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.890
iOS game of 2012.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.985
I don't really care
about that statistic,

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:17.847
but I'll mention it anyways.

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:19.430
I worked on The
Counting Kingdom which

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.040
Jenna Hoffstein, which
is actually coming out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.360
this week on iOS.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.300
So if you have
kids, please buy it.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.220
If you're not a
kid, buy it anyways.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.020
I've been working on Elegy for
a Dead World, also with Ziba,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.290
and, as a partnership,
with Dejobaan Studios,

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.070
which had a successful
Kickstarter so

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.944
if anybody backed it in
here, that was great.

00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:41.360
But if none of you did,
then sucks to be you.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.260
All right, that's
sort of my summary.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.704
I'm not going to show my
portfolio, or anything.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:46.620
But let's get into it.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.870
So you need an artist.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.940
You're a programmer, or a
designer, or a sound guy,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.070
and you can't draw for crap.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.170
You think you can
be like, oh no.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.220
I'll just wing the art.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.100
It'll be fine.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.780
I'll release my game.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.350
No, don't, do that.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.229
Get an artist.

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.520
Artists make games look pretty.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.540
Artists make games
more immersive.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.370
Artists take a player
who-- maybe you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.170
have the most amazing game
mechanics in the game, sort

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.060
of like a dwarf fortress or
something, which turns away so

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.310
many people because
of how ugly it is.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.860
No, you need artists.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.250
Artists make your game
better, more interesting,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.190
even objectively better
in a lot of ways--

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.246
if you get the right
artist, of course.

00:04:25.246 --> 00:04:27.370
It also makes something
you're proud of looking at,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.920
and proud of showing
off at shows.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.410
When you have your
booth at PAX and you've

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.620
got all the AAA studios around,
all the high-end indies,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.640
and then there's you with
blocks that hit each other,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.950
you're going to be kind of
disappointed in yourself.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.560
But cool.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.040
What kind of artist do you need?

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.380
But of course, that depends
on what kind of game

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.880
you're making.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.550
Obviously, here I
have just doodled

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.820
out a few different styles.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.310
Style's a big part
of art for games.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.360
But of course, there's different
roles and different kinds

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.560
of artists in the world.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.980
I'm sure a lot of this
will be redundant to any

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.680
of those who really
like games, but I'm

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.930
going to go over it anyways.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.980
Obviously, in big
studios you have

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.999
a lot of very specific
roles for artists.

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.290
This is a character artist,
environment artist, texture

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.990
artist, this is the animator.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.480
But when it comes
to indie studios,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.860
I'm the guy who does everything.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.830
I do the concept
art, the 2D assets.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.611
I do the promotional material.

00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:23.610
I do the graphic design.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.530
I do the logo design.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.030
I make trailers.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.970
Because usually indie
studios don't have the funds.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.600
They don't have the
ability, or the time,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.210
and/or the resources to
get more than one artist,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.090
so it sort of comes
down to the one guy.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.000
But sort of going to go through
the different kinds of art

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.970
that are typically
done in games.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.610
I'm going to break it down
to their specific roles.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.950
And I'll talk about-- I'll be
showing mostly my work here.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.200
I'll sort of break it down to
the different kinds of art,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.500
and the different kinds of
artists that work on these.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.770
So first is a swath of
indie games that are 2D now.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.750
Used to be that
retro games were 2D.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.140
And then older games before
polygons and all such things

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.620
were all 2-dimensionals--
2-dimension.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.170
So 2D makes up
[? like-- ?] illustrators,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.540
graphic designers, concept
artists, sprite artists,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.440
texture artists, 2D
animators, UI designers--

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.100
it is a large field.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.312
Again, with indie developers,
it's easy to go 2D,

00:06:23.312 --> 00:06:25.020
because you don't have
to worry about 3D,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.460
which takes a lot more time.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.150
So this is sort of some 2D
assets from a prototype that I

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.580
worked on a while back, but
this is sort of [? my old ?]

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.530
[? end ?] game stuff.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.630
Of course, the first part of
2D art, which also pertains

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.072
to 3D art, and at
bigger studios they

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:44.280
have specific roles for this.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.510
This is concept art.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.330
Concept art is far my favorite
part of pre-production,

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.840
at least, in terms of you get to
take what the programmer wants,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.590
and actually make it look like
what they think in their head

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.900
it's supposed to look like.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.566
They'll come to you
with a crappy pencil

00:06:59.566 --> 00:07:02.876
sketch on some paper, and be
like, here I've got a knight,

00:07:02.876 --> 00:07:05.000
and he's on a mountain,
and he's fighting a dragon.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.855
And I'll be like, this doesn't
look anything like that,

00:07:07.855 --> 00:07:09.730
but I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.250
And he's like, I'm feeling red!

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.072
I want red!

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:14.030
And they just took like
a Sharpie or something,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.060
and just scribbled all
over the piece of paper.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.580
So I'm like, all
right, I got that.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.490
Give me like a day,
and I'll come back,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.906
and then you'll
have this painting

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:22.610
of a knight fighting a dragon.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.400
And the [? programmer's ?]
like, yes!

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.490
That's exactly what I
drew on my piece of paper.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.290
It isn't, but you
let them have that.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.840
It makes them feel better.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.604
So concept art is definitely
for both 2D and 3D.

00:07:33.604 --> 00:07:35.020
You need to know
what your game is

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.811
going to look like
before you dive straight

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:40.160
into it-- into the visuals
and even some of the design,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.850
before you have a
clear idea of what

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.750
the game's going to look like.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.833
If you have no idea what
the game is going to look

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.880
like, and you already
have an artist,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.290
and you've made this
amazing prototype.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.230
And you're like look, just swap
out my art and put yours in.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.430
That's not always going to work.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.820
There's a lot of
design decisions

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.790
you have to make
around the art--

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.990
how the characters contrast
from the environment, how

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.860
the environments will animate,
how the environments will

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.590
disappear into the mist, or
how this sort of UI will work.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.970
These are all things
that it's really good

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.610
to have an artist's eye
on as early as possible.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.350
It also gives a sort of
visual Bible for the game.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.445
Concept art helps-- the artist
draws it, and then hands it out

00:08:25.445 --> 00:08:27.070
to the rest of the
team, and like, this

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.797
is what we're aiming for.

00:08:28.797 --> 00:08:31.130
In a big studio, you would
have the concept artist would

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.250
hand that off to the 3D
artists or the other 2D

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.820
artists, the animator, the
modelers, texture artists,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.719
and say, look, this is
what we're aiming for.

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:40.260
This is what I want
the final product

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.762
to look as close as possible to.

00:08:43.762 --> 00:08:45.470
But of course, if
you're making 2D games,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.820
you go into 2D assets.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.850
This is a screenshot,
or an early screenshot,

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.050
from Elegy for a Dead World.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.150
So with this, I sort of
made the concept art,

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.530
cut it up, and stuck
it in the game.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.877
That's a really basic
way of making 2D art.

00:08:58.877 --> 00:09:00.710
I have one with this
sort of painterly style

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.520
that I decided to go
with the concept art.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.910
I made a painting.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.720
I said this is the style
that we're aiming for.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.800
So I cut it up and
put it in the game.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.900
And now you can move
around when things happen,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.370
and you can explore
this piece of art.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.320
2D assets are part of--

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.620
Illustration, it's more of a old
school term, especially when it

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.690
comes to games now.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.260
People don't think of
it illustration so much,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.530
but illustration is used
for promotional art,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.460
for advertising the game,
for inspiring your team,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.700
for websites, for
trying to solidify

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.330
your game into like a poster,
or an image, or a banner.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.400
So many games are
sold on Steam now

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.146
with just a tiny little
banner that you click on,

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:51.020
then you get a little
slightly bigger banner,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.394
and then maybe a
game-play video.

00:09:52.394 --> 00:09:56.470
So much of that first click,
like making that person go,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.880
oh that tiny little banner
looks kind of interesting.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.560
Let me click on it-- is
such a crucial point,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.200
especially if you haven't done
your job marketing, that you

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.680
need to have illustrations
and promotional art,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.230
and posters, and graphic design.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:17.100
And that goes under the
Illustrator sort of dome.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.660
In a big studio, they'd usually
have the concept art also

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.310
be the illustrations
a lot of the time,

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.740
but usually the concept
artists are very proficient,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.270
because they have to be fast.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.710
And they also make the
illustrations for a game.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.580
Obviously as an indie, you're
making the illustrations too.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:41.300
UI design-- this is like in
between three different facets.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.100
You got design, illustration,
and graphic design.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.500
Graphic design, I mean,
by like sort of logos,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.980
and making things more
readable to users,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.779
but that sort of goes
into game design in terms

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:55.070
of how the UI is going to work.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.210
And then you also need
a graphic designer

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.030
to actually make it look good.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.930
This is a big part of
2D design-- obviously,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.370
it's in 2D games,
but usually UI's

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.510
flat, because you're dealing
with buttons and menus

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.750
and HUD overlays.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.310
So that's sort of a weird
intersection between all three

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.679
of these facets, where it'd
sort of have to be usable,

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:15.470
has to make sense in
the game design world,

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.469
and it has to look good.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.780
Let's jump into 3D.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.254
3D is the more complicated
side of the art.

00:11:25.254 --> 00:11:27.420
Painting a picture doesn't
take me a very long time,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.810
but making a 3D model
takes much longer time,

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:32.150
especially if it's
highly detailed

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.660
or needs a lot of
texturing, or I

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.670
need to make it work in a
very specific type of game.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.090
There's a reason a lot
of indies avoid 3D.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.790
It's because-- I
mean, especially--

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.623
it's getting easier all
the time, especially

00:11:45.623 --> 00:11:49.550
with tools like Unity and
Blender but a lot in Indies

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.290
do stick to 2D, because
3D just gives you

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.120
a lot of hassles that you
don't have to deal with in 2D.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.300
And usually you need more
artists to work with 3D,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.539
because, to make a game in
3D, it takes a long time.

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:02.830
You have to model environments.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:03.570
You have to model characters.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.653
You have to model objects.

00:12:04.653 --> 00:12:07.100
Whereas in a 2D game,
I'd be like all right,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.520
a box is just four lines
and just color it in.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.470
Box in 3D?

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.050
All right, I made the cube.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.080
That's easy, whatever.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.750
Now I got to texture it,
and I got to inclusion map

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.890
it, normal map it-- It
takes a lot more time.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.060
And it usually ends up
looking really nice,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.260
but usually you'd
need more artists.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.080
The roles in 3D is modeling--
this is one of my earlier

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.340
attempts at modeling.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.370
So the modelers, they sculpt
3D characters in environments.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.710
They sculpt what's going
to be put into the world.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:38.340
Modeling and texturing makes
up the bulk of 3D work.

00:12:41.704 --> 00:12:43.120
It takes a long
time to get right,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.990
and then sort of having to
make it work within your game

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.380
is another big facet of that.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.840
ZBrush is a really fancy tool
that a lot of 3D artists use.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.220
And they will sculpt the
crap out of it, and be like,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.340
oh man, you can see every--
I sculpted every skin pore

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.020
on this guy's face,
and every vein

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.800
is actually underneath his skin,
and the fat, and the muscle,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.280
and the bone-- yeah, good luck
getting that to run in any game

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.930
right now.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.596
Obviously, things
getting more powerful.

00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:12.130
Again, as an indie
guy, if you tried

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.255
to sculpt every pore
into a guy's skin,

00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:15.880
you're going to end
up spending a month

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.005
working on that where you
should have been spending

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:21.910
a month just pumping out art.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:25.570
So those get broken down further
into character art, which

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.500
is-- at bigger studios, you
do have a specific character

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.000
artist.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.400
They only work on
the characters,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.400
because the characters
are a very important part

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.110
of the game,
obviously, and usually

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.580
have to be more detailed
than a lot of the other parts

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.410
of the game, especially if
it's the player character.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.100
You're always staring at them
if they're a third person game,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.306
or if they're NPCs you deal
with regularly in the world,

00:13:46.306 --> 00:13:47.180
they're always there.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.170
They're always looking at them.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.040
They have to be visually
nice to look at.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.910
And the modelers have
to spend a lot of time

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.409
making that work
right and look right.

00:13:54.409 --> 00:13:56.700
And they also have to deal
with a lot of uncanny valley

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.830
stuff, which-- what
the uncanny valley is,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.050
if you try to make it
realistic, and it doesn't quite

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.500
look realistic-- like this
guy-- people look weird,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.980
and people are
weirded out by that.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.740
And it's a big problem character
artists have to deal with.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.270
Environment artists-- they're
the ones who make the world.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.270
They make the buildings.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:17.860
They make the trees.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.010
They make the mountains.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.470
They're the ones who
fill up the world.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.342
Sometimes concept
artists are actually

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:25.800
broken up between character
artists and environment artists

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.846
too, depending on how
big the studio is.

00:14:27.846 --> 00:14:29.220
Again, as an indie,
you're always

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.120
making the environment art, the
character art, the concept art,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.300
UI, and everything.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.310
But usually when you hand in
a portfolio to a big studio,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.221
as an artist, they
always ask first,

00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:42.720
are you a character artist or
are you an environment artist?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.840
Unless you're going
for like UI design.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.360
But as an artist, if
you go up and say,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.390
I don't-- I'm kind of
both-- which is what I do,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.930
kind of both-- they
just turn away.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.280
They don't have time for
you unless you're just

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.000
unbelievably amazing at both.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.070
So the big facet I skipped
out on both of those things

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.080
is animation, which
pertains to 2D and 3D.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.360
Animation is very,
very difficult

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.100
to get right in 2D, and in
3D, but 3D is way easier.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.170
There's a reason Disney closed
down all their 2D animation

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.100
studios, because it's
a waste of time now.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.500
It looks good, but it's very
expensive, very time consuming.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.610
A good reference point is--
has anyone played Skullgirls?

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.320
Which was like a 2D
indie fighting game.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.820
They wanted to add a single
character to their game.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.670
And they started a Kickstarter
and they asked for $250 grand

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.410
just to add one character.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.620
Because of how
exact the animations

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.460
had to be and the quality
of the 2D animations.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:52.030
Hand drawing animations
is very time consuming

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:58.370
for sprites-- and sort of
hand animating 2D guys.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.610
So that was sort of
solved by tweening.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.880
Tweening is-- as you probably
all know-- is I have my arm,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.670
and I draw it, and I
can do this with it.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.060
And that makes
animation more fluid,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.780
and you can sort of
blend in animations

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.110
with other animations much
easier, especially with like,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:22.150
I've been using
Spine-- that's it.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.110
Spine in Unity to help blend a
lot of my tweening animations.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.870
3D usually only works
with tweening animations,

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.880
in sort of, you have
the animation rigged.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.530
And you move the
body parts around,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.810
and sort of algorithmically
draws in the in between frames.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.240
Whereas in hand drawn 2D
animation-- old school

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.640
2D animation-- characters-- if
you want to move the character

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.270
like this, you have to draw
all of those frames usually.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.580
So that's why a lot of indies,
they turn to pixel art.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.580
Because an arm doing this
is like two blocks moving,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.700
which it takes way less time.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.710
It's way easier.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.710
And it's a style
that a lot of people

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.439
like so it's sort
of easy to sell it.

00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:02.105
If there was no such
thing as pixel art,

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:05.149
and you tried to make
a pixel art game now,

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:06.940
people would be like,
this is kind of lazy.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.550
The whole world was
Disney quality animation.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.716
All right, great, so you're
thinking about what kind

00:17:12.716 --> 00:17:16.339
of artists you need, what roles
you need to fill for your game.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:16.839
But wait!

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.630
The most important
thing is, how much money

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.579
do you have in your wallet?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:27.530
Because artists cost
money, obviously.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.560
They have to eat, as much
as the starving artist

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.110
stereotype is perpetuated.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.560
Obviously, if
you're a big studio,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.910
you can just throw down
the fat stacks of cash,

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.200
and say, I want four
concept artists,

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.870
an army of VFX artists,
3D art modelers.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:49.650
I need 2D texture guys and
UI designers, you name it.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.860
And they can bring
in every one and get

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.860
the best of the best,
because they have millions

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.200
of dollars to work with.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.430
As an indie, you don't have
anything to work with, usually,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.300
unless you Kickstarted magically
now, and made a ton of money,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.910
or you have some sort
of outside funding,

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.490
you sort of have to coax
an artist into your grasp.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.570
And either promise them
with some money you have

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.170
or revenue share,
but usually you're

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.022
going to only end up with
maybe one, two artists,

00:18:19.022 --> 00:18:20.480
depending on the
size of your team.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.520
It's tough.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.860
Amazing artists
cost a lot of money.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.030
If you're trying to go
for the best of the best,

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.510
the famous guy you saw
on the internet one time,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.500
they're going to
charge for being

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.100
the famous guy on the
internet you saw one time.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.300
Middle-of-the-road artists
are harder to find,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:46.850
because-- how do I put this--
either they're too old to have

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.930
kept going with art
and they've given up,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.080
because they couldn't
be an amazing artist,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.940
and they're not making enough
money as an artist making

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.962
a living, and they're
sort of given up,

00:18:56.962 --> 00:18:59.170
or you can nab them right
out of school at some point

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.460
or in school.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.870
But there are a lot of
crappy artists out there.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.590
If you want to find any
artist, there's a ton of them.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.340
I will go into how to
find those guys too.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.460
First, back to the next-- one
of the early slides here--

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.720
artists are important.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.030
I know as a designer programmer,
you think you can do it all,

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.960
but don't skimp on artists.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.030
If you have an
amazing game idea,

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.150
you want to make that
product the best you can.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.290
And having a really good
artist is a big part of that.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.040
You might think, I'm just going
to sell my game on mechanics.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.540
It's going to be great.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.450
The best mechanics
you've ever seen.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.700
But why stop there?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.330
Why not have amazing art
to go with your mechanics?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.930
If you can hire multiple
artists, please do.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.632
Because it'll take a load
off of them, because--

00:19:51.632 --> 00:19:54.090
especially at a big studio,
even indie studios-- making art

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:57.670
is a huge chunk of time.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.470
As graphics get more and
more intense and more

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.257
and more realistic,
art is the thing

00:20:04.257 --> 00:20:06.590
that takes up the most amount
of time during development

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.764
and it's the money sink now.

00:20:08.764 --> 00:20:10.305
You know, OK, let's
say we're working

00:20:10.305 --> 00:20:12.820
on the new Call of
Duty-- just came out.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.840
All right, this is a
first-person shooter.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.310
We can do some level design.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.560
There's some added features.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.060
But like, all right,
we need robots,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.980
and destructible
buildings, and soldiers,

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.660
and everything has to look
as top quality as possible,

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.000
or else everyone will decry
the game as looking like crap,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.900
because of one other game
that did go that extra mile.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.270
And as an indie,
maybe you do want

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.230
to try and compete with that,
in that-- let's say, all right,

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.630
you have your illustrator.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.790
He can do the concept art,
he can do the 2D assets,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.580
in a lot of ways.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.760
But maybe he's not the
best at animation--

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.190
I'm not the best at animation--
so we'll get an animator,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.340
as well, who doesn't have to
come up with the cool designs--

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.940
maybe he can help
or she can help--

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.470
but you have this artist.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.460
You can be like, look, these are
the monsters I need animated.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.340
Can you do the animation while
I move on to the next thing?

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.510
And especially if you're working
in 3D, having multiple artists

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.260
is almost a must,
because otherwise you're

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.240
never really going
to get anything done,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.280
unless you can sort of design
around having one artist, which

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.092
becomes a huge limiting factor.

00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:19.550
But again, with everything,
especially in game development,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.650
you get sort of a law
of diminishing returns.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.084
The more artists you have-- or
the bigger your team is-- you

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:28.840
know, going back to Destiny with
it's ridiculously high budget.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.410
It was like $300 million
or something, $500 million?

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.350
You know, how much
more game did they get?

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.820
How much more
entertainment value

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.570
did they get with their
like studios of artists?

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.065
They didn't just have
one studio of artists

00:21:43.065 --> 00:21:43.940
working on that game.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.530
They had multiple.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.720
So if you're an indie studio
and you're like, right,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.730
we have two programmers
and, like, eight artists.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.990
Eight artists, that work
is diluted between them.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.115
You have to try and make
sure that each one of them

00:21:56.115 --> 00:21:59.519
is working in the
exact same style.

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:02.060
You have to sort of understand
that it is difficult to switch

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.130
your art style.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.090
If you've been drawing
one way your whole life,

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.630
and then you're hired to
a team, maybe wrongly,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.580
to work on this game that
looks nothing like anything

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.730
you've ever done.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:21.211
And you can't work within those
limits, within that style,

00:22:21.211 --> 00:22:22.710
you're going to
make work that looks

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.110
different from the other
artists, and it will stand out

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.000
and it'll look weird.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.220
Yes, really.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.190
Artists are important.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:35.020
I got to really stress this
point because I like work.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.330
Artists not only make
the game look good,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.360
but they inspire the
rest of the team.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.040
If you're just sitting, staring
at blocks hitting-- you know,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.342
pongs-- hitting a block
back and forth all day,

00:22:45.342 --> 00:22:47.050
you're going to get
tired of it if you're

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.520
working on it for a year.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.100
If you have constant art
coming in, like concept art,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.550
animations, illustrations,
and you see it

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.170
when a website writes
about your game,

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.610
or a You-Tuber does a
stream about your game,

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:04.060
it's exciting to see like,
look how good my game is,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.560
and I need to make this better
to match to the awesome art

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.296
that I have in the game.

00:23:09.296 --> 00:23:13.270
It helps motivate everyone to
be excited about the project

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.300
they're working on.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:15.980
To know that, look,
when this comes out,

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.700
it's going to look great.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.890
And it's going to be
compared to the best of them.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.400
Because that's awesome!

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.790
And everyone should be inspired.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.459
And art is such a quick
way of inspiring people,

00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:26.750
that it's almost worth the
money to pay the artist just

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.685
to keep your wheels turning.

00:23:28.685 --> 00:23:30.810
Because if you just, again,
if you're just watching

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.097
blocks bounce back and
forth-- yeah, great, OK.

00:23:33.097 --> 00:23:34.930
If you get excited about
that, that's great.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.010
But if you've got five
other people on your team,

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.270
and they're all just working on
blocks bouncing back and forth,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.440
they're going to go and work
on something else that's

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.148
more interesting.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.480
So where do you find
these so-called artists?

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.030
Usually in sewers,
like the Ninja Turtles.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.300
But artists, in general, are
usually introverted people.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.260
Sort of like a
upbringing of-- I'm

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.960
just going to sit in the
corner and doodle all the time.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.710
A lot of programmers
have the same thing--

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.400
I'm going to sit on
my computer and code.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.550
A lot of them don't go out of
their way to make attention

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.840
to themselves.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.340
I first learned
this when I was sort

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.190
of going to meet ups around
Boston for game development.

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.330
And how few artists
I was meeting.

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.820
It was kind of disheartening
in a lot of ways.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.820
And the few artists I was
meeting, a lot of them

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.810
were like, eh, OK, get
out of here, you're done.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.640
Because artists, sort of,
even some of the best artists

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.540
I know, they sit in their
rooms, they make their art,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.332
maybe they get a blog
post on the internet,

00:24:41.332 --> 00:24:42.331
and it does really well.

00:24:42.331 --> 00:24:44.030
But a lot of them are
just sort of like,

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.710
oh I'll just work
on this drawing.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:46.680
It's OK.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.080
And it's crap.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.060
Work on the next one.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.670
So you do have to look for
the right artist, which

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.140
is sometimes more difficult
than you think it would be.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.473
You would think all artists
are always looking for work.

00:24:57.473 --> 00:24:58.710
They're all starving.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.420
They need work.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.640
They need work to live.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.230
Well, yeah sure, a lot of them.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.210
They're not going to be coming
looking for you specifically.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.030
So here's some ideas
of how to track down

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.300
this elusive species.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.629
Networking.

00:25:15.629 --> 00:25:17.920
Meet-ups, like I mentioned,
a lot of game dev meet-ups.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.990
They do exist.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.956
They are there.

00:25:19.956 --> 00:25:22.650
There's some comic
book meet-ups in Boston

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.950
with a lot of artists.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.490
It's all about maybe you'll
meet someone who knows someone.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:28.990
That's how most of
my work comes in,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.094
is someone who knows me from
someone or from a project I

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:35.510
worked on through networking,
they get in contact with me,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.660
and I get work.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.530
I actually used this in a
slide for one of my classes.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:41.250
This is PAX.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.300
PAX is actually another
great place, surprisingly

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.340
to meet other artists.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.490
Because a lot of people
are walking around booths,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.850
looking for work,
surprisingly, at PAX.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.760
Which is kind of weird.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.574
They'll hand you business
cards and you're like,

00:25:56.574 --> 00:25:58.240
oh, I'll check out
your portfolio later.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.323
Maybe they're pretty good.

00:25:59.323 --> 00:26:01.300
And then maybe there's
something to that.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:08.075
Obviously, bigger conferences
like GDC, IndieCade,

00:26:08.075 --> 00:26:09.855
like Unite, or something.

00:26:09.855 --> 00:26:11.730
There's a lot of artists
there that hang out,

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.200
and they're a great
place to meet, socialize,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.690
see if you find someone
you sort of can relate to

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.070
and hang out with,
and maybe they

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.020
have some really cool work
they can make for you.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.978
I just thought it was
funny, because I randomly

00:26:21.978 --> 00:26:24.020
found this picture of
PAX East on the internet.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.612
Ziba and I at our first
booth-- we're actually in it--

00:26:26.612 --> 00:26:27.320
and it's circled.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.570
Our birth, I was very
excited about that.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.970
Internet, that scary place.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.540
There are a lot of artists
on the internet, obviously.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.580
There are some
big sites that are

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:45.200
great to find artists, and sort
of remotely discuss with them.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.807
CG hub used to be a big
one, but for some reason

00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:48.890
the guy just shut it down.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:49.700
I don't know why.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.780
But deviant art, you have to
shift through a pile of shit

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.490
to find good art in
deviant art, but it exists.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.070
Tumblr is actually really good.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.390
A lot of artists I know,
especially good artists,

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.590
post their art on Tumblr.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.690
And usually with tags
like game art or concept

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.450
art or indie art.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.590
And again, you have the
shift through a lot of crap

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:10.020
to find the good stuff.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.050
But I know a lot of people
who find work through Tumblr.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.970
Conceptart.org has some of the
bigger, well-known artists,

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.910
but there's also a lot
of smaller artists.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.900
There's like a jobs board
you can post on there.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.130
This was conceptart.org.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.000
A lot of the big studios
post there, looking for jobs.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.090
This is more for 2D painters,
and concept artists, and 2D

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.090
guys more-- Polycount,
for 3D artists,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.480
which is another great
website and resource.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.060
But if you want to scrape the
bottom of the barrel, schools.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:49.150
Schools are a great way
to get free artists.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.790
I like the claw grabber,
because that's basically

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:52.962
what you're getting.

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:54.420
I mean, I'm not
saying there aren't

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.820
amazing artists at school.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:56.920
Of course there are.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.850
But most of them are,
obviously, inexperienced.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.929
Most of them will work
for cheap to nothing,

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:05.720
because they're just
excited about the fact

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.180
to work on a game.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.510
So if you just desperately
need an artist.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.840
And you're just like,
I got this prototype.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.680
I want to pitch
it somewhere else,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.940
but I just need some art in it.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.065
Schools are a great places.

00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:18.856
There's lots of schools
in the Boston area.

00:28:18.856 --> 00:28:21.550
A lot of art schools
around here with lots

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.360
of people looking
for work, obviously.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.620
But again, scraping the
bottom of the barrel.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.070
There's a lot of shows that
aren't about games where

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.580
are great to pick up artists.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.650
In Boston, we have the
Massachusetts Independents

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.830
Comics Expo, where a bunch
of artists sit around tables

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.950
and they sell their comics.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.350
This is a great place to meet
artists who, maybe, aren't

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.420
into games, but maybe you
find someone who's like wow,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.640
your style's really unique.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.730
Your style's really cool.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.630
Come work for me.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.500
Come be a part of my team
and we can make something

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.316
really interesting together.

00:28:58.316 --> 00:28:59.690
There's a lot of
artists' tables.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:02.735
There's a lot of-- I
used to do these a lot.

00:29:02.735 --> 00:29:04.360
I don't really do
them so much anymore,

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:06.900
but-- just selling
your prints on tables.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.184
There's lots of
festivals all the time.

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:11.100
I know this isn't really
a stereotypical where

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.780
to find a game artist,
but they are great places

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.486
to find artists who maybe never
thought about making games.

00:29:16.486 --> 00:29:18.110
And maybe they have
a really cool style

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.410
that'll fit games perfectly, but
they've just never even thought

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.130
about it.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.190
Because, again, in this
very competitive environment

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.490
that we are in,
game development,

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.950
you want to make your games
stand out and be unique.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:32.533
You don't want it
to look like, again,

00:29:32.533 --> 00:29:34.520
Call of Duty number five.

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.830
Why are you bothering
at that point?

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.400
Why don't you find someone
who has like-- no one

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.610
can draw like this person.

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.490
It might not be
the most realistic,

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:48.380
and it might not be
the theme of the time--

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.880
like low poly is
a big thing now--

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.260
but like, this guy
will stand out.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.770
This guy will make my game look
so unique and so interesting

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.530
to people who may not have even
been interested in my mechanics

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.960
in the first place.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.150
And it jives with my theme.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.900
I want this person
to work for me

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.705
to make my game
the best it can be,

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:08.880
because that's really
what it's about.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.419
It's all about finding
that special someone.

00:30:11.419 --> 00:30:13.460
You're going to have a
working relation together.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.104
You're going to have
some rough times,

00:30:15.104 --> 00:30:17.020
you're going to have
some good times together.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.420
So you really want to
find someone, especially

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.160
as an artist, who you guys
can work together very well.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.170
You understand a common goal.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:27.070
You're going to be
both-- or if you

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.569
have multiple artists-- you're
going to be all your harshest

00:30:29.569 --> 00:30:31.000
critics, including themselves.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.820
You're going to-- because
if no one in your group

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.830
is telling you what
you're doing is bad,

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.470
then everyone else will and.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.880
They will do it much
harsher and much meaner

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.092
than anybody in your group.

00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:46.050
Because if you're like,
hey man, you know, this

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.890
is a good drawing,
but why don't you

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.000
try doing this to
make it better,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.940
is much better than
a comment on, like,

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.430
[? Kotaki ?] was saying,
this fucking sucks.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.180
Don't buy this
fucking piece of shit.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.327
Because that's-- yeah.

00:30:57.327 --> 00:30:59.160
You want to, again, you
want to find someone

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.250
who's good as an artist.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.350
You want to find
someone who's competent,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.060
who turns things in on
time-- which is a big thing.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.510
I've recommended
too many artists

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.370
to developer friends who did
not turn things in on time,

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.880
and that made me look
bad in a lot of ways,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.380
because I recomm-- I thought
these-- I'm like these guys are

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:19.879
great.

00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:20.792
They work hard.

00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:22.500
But they weren't
hitting their deadlines,

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.840
they weren't getting stuff
in, so they obviously

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.314
lost those contracts.

00:31:27.314 --> 00:31:29.730
So you guys are really going
to be like partners in crime,

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.950
especially if you're in
a small, two-man group.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.740
So these are some my working
relationships I'll talk about.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.450
Girls Like Robots, I
developed with Ziba.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.390
He's up there.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.890
You can all look
at him if you want.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.430
He took a chance on me.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.930
I was out of college.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.490
And I'd done my three
month period of mourning

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.820
looking for a job.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:55.490
And he found me and said,
OK, you're OK enough.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.220
I'll let you work on my game.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.770
And so we really hit it off.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.875
And we worked really
well together.

00:32:01.875 --> 00:32:04.250
This game went places we didn't
think it was going to go,

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:05.870
which was great.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:08.640
It's still doing
things that I didn't

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.790
think it could do as a game.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.229
And so we've continued to
work together from this.

00:32:14.229 --> 00:32:16.770
This was The Counting Kingdom
with Little Worlds Interactive,

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.360
Jenna Hoffstein.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:25.100
This was a more standard
contractual artist hiring,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.610
game development cycle.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:30.350
Jenna came to me and was like,
I need these five things.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.170
Done.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.240
I need these 10 things.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.550
Done.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:33.420
I need these five things.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:33.680
Done.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.138
All done with
[? sculpture ?] works

00:32:35.138 --> 00:32:37.730
and work for hire contracts.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.380
She is the most
efficient game designer

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.050
I've ever met in my life.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.690
It was just boom,
boom, boom, boom.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:43.940
We're aiming for this release.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.460
Done.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.250
Released.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.880
It was kind of amazing.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.990
I don't think any
other game I've ever

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:53.380
seen in my life
developed that smoothly.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:56.240
And she didn't do any coding,
which was also the crazy thing,

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.670
as the lead designer and coder.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.000
She only used PlayMaker,
which was kind of fascinating.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.160
Elegy for a Dead
World was a weird

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.810
in that I worked with Ziba
again from Popcannibal,

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:14.150
but this was a game jam game
that turned into a full game

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.640
when it started
getting some attention.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.150
It started out as a
rev share agreement

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.350
between a few different
studios in the office.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.254
And it's been,
less of, these are

00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.420
my boss's working on the
game, but I've sort of been

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.490
like a partner in crime.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.980
I'm on the same level as
all the designers, which is

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.050
kind of interesting for once.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.530
All right, enough of that.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.000
Great, you found an artist.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.220
Now what do you do with them?

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.310
You have them, all right?

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.360
You just going to
poke 'em a little bit?

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.370
Hey, make some art.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.070
Well, first you
have to hire them.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:53.770
And there's one way I like
to think that artists should

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.800
be hired is with an art test.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.450
Before you sign them up for
a huge massive contract,

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.070
you should say
look, you know what?

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.910
Your portfolio looks great.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.160
I really like you as a person.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.190
I think we're going to
work really well together.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:11.750
But how about you like take
this design that I did,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.530
and I want to see
the final product.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.469
And I want to see how
long it takes you.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.114
I want to understand your
workflow and your process.

00:34:20.114 --> 00:34:22.780
Because they might have the most
amazing portfolio in the world,

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.155
but if it takes
them three months

00:34:24.155 --> 00:34:26.920
to draw a single picture,
then it's not worth your time.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:30.184
And maybe they just lied.

00:34:30.184 --> 00:34:31.100
That's always a thing.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.409
They might have just been like,
I just found this picture.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.750
I found a photo
and I drew over it,

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.699
which a lot concept artists
do to get things done quickly.

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:43.257
They maybe can't do what
you think they can do,

00:34:43.257 --> 00:34:45.840
and this is a good way to figure
out exactly what they can do.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.730
So you do pay them for this.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.699
You pay them for their time,
whether you hire them or not.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:53.580
How many art tests I've
gotten, which were like,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.060
oh no, no, I'm not going to
pay you for the art tests,

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.860
because it's just an art test.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.420
I want to see if I
want to hire you.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.050
No, no, no.

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.710
They took time out
of their schedule,

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.410
doesn't matter if
they're busy or not,

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.390
to make this art
test to show they

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.930
are capable of doing the work.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.430
You pay them for
the time they spent

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:12.440
on it, whether they continue
to work for you or not.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.140
If they don't, you say,
thank you for your time.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.630
I don't think you're exactly
what we're looking for.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.590
Get lost.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.460
But you do pay them
for their time.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.060
Contracting, most
indies are going

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.170
to be on work-for-hire basises
for independent artists.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.850
What I mean by work-for-hire,
those of you who don't know,

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.430
any work they make,
they don't own anymore.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.300
When I draw a picture on
my own, it is my copyright.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.710
I can do whatever
I want with it.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.270
I can hire a 70 foot
billboard and put it up,

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.360
and there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:54.920
But if I'm under a
work-for-hire contract,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.460
and I'm working for a game
designer or game company,

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.430
and I make art for
that game, I longer

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.930
can put it up on a
70 foot billboard

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.460
without any permissions.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.940
The company, or the designer, or
the person I'm working for now

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.700
owns that art.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.050
And that is what most
artists and other people

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:16.455
work as for game companies.

00:36:16.455 --> 00:36:19.080
In art school, I was always told
work-for-hire contracts aren't

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.990
fair, because then I
can't sell my art again.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.870
And that is a-- I mean,
that's good as an artist,

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.960
meaning like, good, I
can sell my same painting

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.540
again and again and again
and again for lots of money,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.670
and make more money off
of this one painting.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.670
But that's not the
norm in game industry.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.770
It's the norm in other illus--
in other illustration fields

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.157
you can do that-- some
magazine publishing.

00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.240
Since they're all dying,
they're much more lenient

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.270
on that thing, on that.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.550
But game companies is,
you no longer own the art.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.140
So you're going to have to
make a work-for-hire contract,

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.700
usually with a scope of work
attached to it of what exactly

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.140
is needed from the artist.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.960
Another interesting point
for independent contractors

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.710
when hiring for work-for-hire
work is software licensing.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.930
It's usually up to the artist
to have their own software.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:08.300
If they're hired full-time--
if you somehow magically

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.870
are able to do that, usually
you have to supply the software,

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.750
especially for
working at an office.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.470
Great, so you've hired them.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.210
You've got them down.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.220
They're sitting there.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.550
They've got their tablet out.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:21.800
They got their pen.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800
Now what do you do?

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.050
You got to art direct them.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.710
You have to play art director,
even if you can't draw.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.090
As the person who
hired this artist,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:36.710
you have to critique them,
and understand how they work,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.300
and to give them feedback
constantly, even if it's just

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.100
encouragement.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.560
You have to make them
make the art that you

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.170
want them to make for you.

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.770
They're not making
art for themselves,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.460
they're making art for you.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.510
They're not fine artists.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.070
Fine artists just sort
of waft in the air

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.060
and discover what they want.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:01.570
But as an illustrator, or a 3D
artist, you're like a plumber.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.780
I need you to fix this pipe.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.670
I need you to draw this
picture specifically.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:12.190
It's a great variation
on do what I say,

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.050
not what I do, especially with
a programmer or designer who

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.050
can't draw.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.300
But here are some helpful
things to yell at artists.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.990
Aesthetic, just instead of
saying do it better this time,

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:25.310
just not as crap.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.270
Aesthetic, the general
feel of the art.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.330
This one is a little hard
to critique, aesthetic,

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.000
but if you have a
general sense of what

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.750
the theme of the game
you're going for, definitely

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.930
be like, all right, this
is a zombie shooter.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.831
OK, you've put
Hello Kitty in here.

00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:44.330
This isn't really the aesthetic
I'm looking for in the game.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.610
And that ties into style.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.670
They're very close together,
but style is very easier

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.990
to point to and be like, we're
looking for this style of game.

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.625
And that helps guide the artist.

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.000
OK, that's what
they're thinking.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.140
It's a bad idea, but I'll
sort of work with it,

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.490
and see what I can come up with.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.990
Contrast is probably the
most important term in art,

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:11.760
in general, and specifically
for game development art.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.420
Contrast is how different
things look, like in contrast

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:15.980
in real life.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.480
Like when two things
contrast against each other,

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.438
that you're telling the
difference between them

00:39:19.438 --> 00:39:21.610
or the similarities.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.660
In games, you want the
character to stand out

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.493
from the background.

00:39:24.493 --> 00:39:26.410
You need items to be obvious.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.237
You need certain things to
stand out more than others,

00:39:30.237 --> 00:39:32.570
maybe things to disappear
more than others, maybe things

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.294
to be more similar,
to be more hidden.

00:39:34.294 --> 00:39:36.710
Like if you're making a Metal
Gear Solid game is like, oh,

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.130
I need the character to
blend into the environment.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.200
Contrast is a very
helpful word when

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.910
you're having trouble defining
what's wrong with this image,

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:45.530
why isn't it
working in the game?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.241
OK, it's because these
animations blend in too much

00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:50.490
with the character animations.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.960
I can't tell what's going on.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.240
Or, this image, there's
not enough depth in it.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.710
This image, I need more depth.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.354
Contrast is a big word.

00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:59.270
It's a really great word
that helps with that.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.050
Saturation is another handy
one, but that just means how

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.730
colourful something is.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:08.580
The more saturated something is,
the more vibrant and colorful

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:08.770
it is.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:10.895
The less saturated it is,
the more gray into whites

00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:12.870
and blacks it is.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:17.310
That really helps with
saying, all right,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:20.444
this is sort of the objects
and the theme I'm going for,

00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:22.110
but why don't you
make it more colorful?

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.120
Maybe make it more saturated
so the world feels more

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.514
fantastical and interesting.

00:40:26.514 --> 00:40:28.430
Or, it's like I want
this to be dark and grim.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.550
Let's lower the
saturation quite a bit

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.910
to really make it feel
like oh, it's a gray day

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.900
and it's dark and dreary.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:40.870
Composition, just the layout of
art, and the layout of levels,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.357
or the layout of what
the player is seeing,

00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:44.690
what the player is dealing with.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.850
It's just sort of the
arrangement of items.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:49.060
It's another handy word to know.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.490
But of course,
encouragement, encouragement

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.380
is always needed in any
part of game development.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:58.130
It's always great to hear
you're doing a good job.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.850
Give yourself a high-five,
or me a high-five, whatever.

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:06.990
It's really helpful to
encourage your artists,

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.290
so it makes them make
the best work they can.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.032
If you're just yelling
at them all the time,

00:41:12.032 --> 00:41:14.240
and they're not doing a good
job-- or you don't think

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:14.970
they're doing a good job.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.480
Maybe they aren't,
but they're not

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.920
going to get better if you're
just always dissing what

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.330
they've got, and it's not fun.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.310
Let's go into-- so
you've got the artist,

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.880
you're going to art direct
them, now what are the phases?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.550
Pre-production!

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.951
Pre-production is the happiest
part of game development.

00:41:30.951 --> 00:41:32.450
You're coming up
with all the ideas.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.390
Your scope is increasing
through the roof.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.680
You're like, oh, now we're
going to have open world this.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.310
The world's dynamic,
the characters

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.476
die, their families grow
up, it's going to be great.

00:41:42.476 --> 00:41:44.240
The art is going
to be realistic!

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.980
It's going to go into space!

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.910
We got to have all
these textures!

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:51.160
And the concept art is amazing!

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.152
But as an artist, you're
working on, usually,

00:41:54.152 --> 00:41:55.360
the concept art for the game.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.860
You're helping with
ideas sometimes.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:03.580
Maybe your designer,
he's so happy

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:07.150
to let you help out
with ideas for the game.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:11.672
Pitches, another good thing
if you're making concept art.

00:42:11.672 --> 00:42:13.380
If you're pitching a
game to get funding,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.010
like Kickstarter
or maybe it's one

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:19.780
of the bigger studios like Sony,
Microsoft, Nintendo, or others.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.720
If you're trying to
get money upfront,

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.271
artwork really helps a pitch,
because you have nothing

00:42:24.271 --> 00:42:24.770
to show.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:27.030
On Kickstarter, you're
selling hopes and dreams.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.800
You're not selling a game.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.450
Because people are
imagining in their

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.199
heads what the actual
game is going to be,

00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:35.520
and it's way better than what
you're actually going to make,

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.340
because they have no idea
what they're thinking about.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.700
Pitches with art work better
than pitches with nothing.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.590
If you just have text,
and just be like,

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.300
here's some scribbles of
how my game's going to work.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.050
They're going to be
like, I'm not excited.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.080
But if you have like,
here's a painting!

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.306
And then they're like, wow!

00:42:52.306 --> 00:42:52.930
That's amazing!

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:53.450
How's the game going to work?

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:54.660
Don't worry about that.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.450
Just look at the painting.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.690
Web stuff, so making a
website, obviously, it's

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.564
early pre-production.

00:43:02.022 --> 00:43:04.480
Maybe you want to make a blog
or something about your game.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.646
It's a great place to start.

00:43:05.646 --> 00:43:08.520
And posting about
art as it comes in

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.700
from concept art, and pictures--

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.430
Logos are another
big thing, especially

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.180
if you're doing a pitch.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.714
Logos really help with
identifying your game,

00:43:19.714 --> 00:43:21.380
not only to your
selves, but if you ever

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.210
want to talk about
it really early on,

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.907
it's a really good way of
getting your icon out there.

00:43:26.907 --> 00:43:29.240
And early prototype work, so
if you've made a prototype,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.310
and you're like, look, let's
just slap some art in there

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.851
to see what this game's actually
going to visually feel like.

00:43:33.851 --> 00:43:35.940
This is all part
of pre-production.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.240
Production, the
bulk of the work.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.090
So this is all the
asset creation.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.310
This is, maybe, you're
doing concept art here too.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.389
Maybe you've said, all right,
that style isn't working.

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:46.930
Let's go back a
little bit, but we'll

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.680
keep moving forward with
making models and texturing.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.620
It's all about iterations
too in production.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.002
It's sort of oh, OK, this
level doesn't quite look right.

00:43:56.002 --> 00:43:57.210
Let's change it a little bit.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:58.630
Let's make it look like this.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.650
This is the longest
part of game design

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.880
usually, unless your
pre-production was,

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.860
I've thought of this
game from five years ago.

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:07.780
This is just making
the stuff that

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:12.650
will actually go in the game
and making it fit together.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:16.940
Near end of production, and
this is when you start panicking

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.660
and realize your open world
space game with dynamic NPCs

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.000
and families that live
and die and have children

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.240
isn't exactly panning out.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.990
You start cutting things
just to get things done.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:32.250
The artist is usually hopefully
done by now towards the end,

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.560
but they have to start
doing the promotional push.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.709
They have to start
making the illustrations,

00:44:36.709 --> 00:44:38.250
and the art, and
the graphic designs,

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:41.400
and the Steam banners,
and making sure everything

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.160
looks as best as it can so
when this game fires out

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.450
to the world, a lot
of people get it.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:49.930
As indies, I have to
make trailers too.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:52.550
Usually you have a trailer
dude for that at a big studio,

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.040
but as indies, usually the
artist has to make the trailer.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.220
So that takes up more
time you would think.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.860
On The Counting Kingdom,
Jenna came to me and said,

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.190
I need a trailer in two weeks.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.800
And that was harrowing
because I fully

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.557
animated it for some reason.

00:45:06.557 --> 00:45:08.640
But a lot of the art is
also like putting together

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.450
store assets like trailers and
banners and promotional stuff.

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.760
So sort of in conclusion, indie
artists, they fill many roles.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.390
They do lots of things.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.640
At a big studio, you have
these very specific jobs

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.020
that everyone is assigned.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.940
They go in the
morning and they know,

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.650
I'm going to be the
guy who animates

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.080
shattering glass all day.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.200
And they do it for three years
and the Avengers comes out.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.630
But at a smaller studio,
you know, all right, I'm

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.370
doing the concept
art, at the same time,

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.630
learning how to model
it, at the same time,

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.331
I'm figuring out how
the items in the game

00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:45.830
are going to work,
at the same time,

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.530
making the logo and maybe
some early illustration

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:50.800
promotional arts.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.300
And you have to like balance
a lot of these things.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.904
So is this is me in my zen
drawing state, I feel like.

00:45:56.904 --> 00:45:58.070
I don't usually get to that.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:02.520
I usually get really angry
and I don't get this calm

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.570
when it comes to that.

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.890
But yeah, indie artists, they
have so much stuff to do,

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.840
they have so much
stuff to offer.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.090
Hire artists.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.820
Don't make your game
without an artist.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.490
That's boring.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.990
If you think you
can do it yourself,

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.490
that's great, but
artists, they add a lot.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.012
They inspire you.

00:46:18.012 --> 00:46:21.880
They usually work hard if
you find the right one.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.860
And you can form long-term
meaningful partnerships

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.400
with them and it's great.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.840
Thank you.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.634
There's my email address and
my website, if anybody cares.

00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:36.542
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:38.927 --> 00:46:40.840
Cool.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.800
44 minutes.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.582
It was close.

00:46:42.582 --> 00:46:42.840
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.880
Do you got time for questions?

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.754
LUIGI GUATIERI: Sure.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.110
Nothing?

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:48.610
Really?

00:46:51.125 --> 00:46:52.452
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:52.452 --> 00:46:53.910
AUDIENCE: Actually,
quick question.

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.971
LUIGI GUATIERI: There you go.

00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:58.470
AUDIENCE: Do you ever work on
multiple projects [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.594
LUIGI GUATIERI: I usually
work on multiple projects

00:47:00.594 --> 00:47:01.632
at the same time.

00:47:01.632 --> 00:47:03.010
I guess that was a good point.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.390
I need to bring up--
that was a good question.

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.360
As a indie artist, I'm not
getting paid a lot of money.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.760
End of story.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:10.840
It doesn't happen.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.840
So usually I have to work
on more than one project

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:17.990
at the same time just
to let ends meet.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.494
Usually the work isn't full-time
because either the company

00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:26.910
can't afford to
have it full-time,

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.643
or the amount of work
they need isn't full-time.

00:47:31.643 --> 00:47:34.640
You have to juggle
a lot as an artist.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.181
I'm working on a
couple projects,

00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:38.305
doing contract work, sort
of freelance illustration

00:47:38.305 --> 00:47:38.970
on the side.

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:40.340
I'm also teaching a class.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:45.380
And you have to juggle all
these things at once to survive,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.390
basically.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.380
Because as sad as it sounds,
indie games don't make a lot

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.640
of money usually, unless
[? you're at ?] Goat Simulator.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.673
Yes, go!

00:47:54.673 --> 00:47:56.637
AUDIENCE: I didn't quite
catch what you said,

00:47:56.637 --> 00:48:01.759
2D animation is harder
than 3D animation.

00:48:01.759 --> 00:48:04.050
LUIGI GUATIERI: Have you ever
seen an old Disney movie?

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.360
They usually had
armies of what they

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:14.410
called in-betweeners, in that
there would be a key frame

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:14.910
artist.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.282
He would draw Snow
White dancing like this.

00:48:17.282 --> 00:48:18.990
And then there would
be the poor bastards

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:23.410
who had to draw every
single frame of her going

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.430
like this, all 30 or 40 frames.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:30.780
So in a game, if you want
hand-drawn animations that

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.094
look really
interesting and nice,

00:48:33.094 --> 00:48:34.760
you have to get someone
who will bother.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.020
Like, Street Fighter III
is a great exam-- or King

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.070
of Fighters-- those games
take forever to animate,

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.570
because they are
done in that Disney

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:44.090
style, in terms of
just frame by frame

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:45.530
by frame by frame by frame.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.740
But the other thing
they have to worry about

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:50.430
is to make sure that the hit
points are in the right place,

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.070
that the collision boxes
are in the right place.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:55.090
It takes a lot of
time to do that.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.160
That's why when I
mentioned tweening

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.145
as a quick way of
trying to mimic that,

00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:01.700
it doesn't look as good usually.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.090
And in a lot of games that
use a lot of tweening,

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:07.010
like Limbo, for example, they
hide it with silhouettes.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:11.576
Because you get these
weird seams and it

00:49:11.576 --> 00:49:12.450
doesn't look as good.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.783
There are obviously tools
that help with this like Flash

00:49:14.783 --> 00:49:16.320
animation.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.660
You can sort of do an in-between
of tweening and hand animation.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.950
But sort of frame by
frame, sprite animation,

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.240
takes a long time.

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.530
And 3D-- I mean, it's
easier, because it's all

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:28.660
tweening usually.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:33.180
Unless you have some character
that transforms all the time.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.565
It's the same way in 2D,
in that a 3D arm that

00:49:36.565 --> 00:49:38.530
is rigged like this
is always going

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.030
to look like this because you
can just sort of manipulate it

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:42.490
in 3D space.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.090
Doing this in 3D is really easy.

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:49.160
Doing this in 2D takes forever,
if you know what I mean.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.296
That answer your question?

00:49:50.296 --> 00:49:51.404
AUDIENCE: Kind of.

00:49:51.404 --> 00:49:52.820
LUIGI GUATIERI:
Is there something

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.065
you need me to follow up on?

00:49:55.065 --> 00:49:56.648
AUDIENCE: I kind of
see what you mean,

00:49:56.648 --> 00:49:58.064
like you have to
draw every frame.

00:49:58.064 --> 00:49:59.757
LUIGI GUATIERI: Yeah.

00:49:59.757 --> 00:50:02.172
AUDIENCE: Unity has a very
cool way to go around this.

00:50:02.172 --> 00:50:06.036
Like, [INAUDIBLE] that's
actually 3D that is snap-shot

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:07.904
into 2D, so they
don't have to worry--

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:09.820
LUIGI GUATIERI: Yeah,
that's one way to do it.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:11.800
That's one way to
solve it, but then you

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.780
have to make all your
models in 3D first,

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:17.410
and then animate in 3D, which
the modeling process takes time

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:19.120
as well.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.030
And then you have to
think about-- all right,

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.220
I have 2D artists.

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:24.160
Can I do this?

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.362
No, I need a 3D
artist to do this.

00:50:26.362 --> 00:50:27.820
It's just something
to think about.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:31.140
But yeah, that's a way around
it that a lot of people use.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.188
Yes, go.

00:50:32.188 --> 00:50:34.354
AUDIENCE: Does it make sense
for a software engineer

00:50:34.354 --> 00:50:37.672
to learn the basics of
drawing, so that they better

00:50:37.672 --> 00:50:40.376
understand maybe the artists
and give more reasonable tasks?

00:50:40.376 --> 00:50:42.584
LUIGI GUATIERI: Sorry, could
you repeat the question?

00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:44.994
AUDIENCE: So does it make
sense for a software engineer

00:50:44.994 --> 00:50:48.850
to learn the basics of drawing,
so that you better understand

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:53.200
artists and maybe give
more reasonable tasks?

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.120
LUIGI GUATIERI: Yes.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.390
Programmers, designers, software
engineers should totally

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:02.340
try to understand the basics
of art and color theory

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:07.890
and the process of making
art, so when it comes time

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:10.800
to either advising the artist
on what they need to change

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:16.360
or what might not fit, you
have some understanding

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.050
of all right, these
colors go together.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:20.220
These colors don't go together.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.530
Could you composition
this a little better,

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:26.680
so you like put these down
here and that over there.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.385
But again, a lot of art
direction is about contrasting,

00:51:29.385 --> 00:51:31.590
and composition, and
color is a big one.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:36.990
I didn't really talk about
color, color theory, too much.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.570
Like for instance, Jenna in
Little Worlds Interactive,

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.200
when I worked with
her, she already

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.470
had a pretty good graphic design
sense, which really helped in,

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.010
when I gave her
art, and the sort

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:49.570
of feedback she could give me.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.470
And also when she
utilized my art.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.590
So I didn't put
anything into that game.

00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:59.110
I wasn't directly working in
Unity on The Counting Kingdom.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:01.279
She knew how things
look good together,

00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:03.570
just because she'd already
had like a background in web

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:04.640
design.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.260
So yes.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.070
Yes?

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:13.820
AUDIENCE: You were saying
earlier that usually it's

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.070
good to have-- or it's
basically a must to have--

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.070
different people specialized
in different roles.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.570
Like, someone is
the game designer,

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.570
someone's a programmer,
and then you

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.470
have to find artists
to do all the game art.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:29.298
Do you ever find
outliers to that?

00:52:29.298 --> 00:52:30.294
Like, exceptions?

00:52:30.294 --> 00:52:33.531
Like, someone who does
everything and still

00:52:33.531 --> 00:52:35.072
comes up [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:35.072 --> 00:52:37.280
LUIGI GUATIERI: Of course,
there's always exceptions.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.740
There's always some magic
man who can do it all,

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.490
or magic woman.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.406
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:42.994 --> 00:52:45.410
LUIGI GUATIERI: An example of
an artist who can do it all.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:46.610
AUDIENCE: Like, a game.

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.068
LUIGI GUATIERI: A
game designer who

00:52:48.068 --> 00:52:50.343
can do it all-- I don't know.

00:52:50.343 --> 00:52:51.289
Can you name anyone?

00:52:56.019 --> 00:52:58.050
AUDIENCE: Other than
[? Dwarf Fortress? ?]

00:52:58.050 --> 00:52:59.800
LUIGI GUATIERI:
[? Dwarf Fortress, ?] yes.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.320
I mean, a lot of
game designers--

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.115
especially if they do
it as a hobby-- they

00:53:04.115 --> 00:53:04.990
make their own stuff.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.260
They make their own art.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:11.680
It's just a good idea
to spread the work out,

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.260
because as an indie--
and obviously,

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.410
a lot of my developer
friends-- they

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.640
have to focus so much of
their time on marketing,

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.490
and programming, and designing,
that, to also add art to that,

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:27.120
you've just extended your game
development cycle by a lot.

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:29.200
And maybe you're not
as competent in that.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.780
And people are more
apt at telling bad art

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.367
than they are from
telling bad game design.

00:53:35.367 --> 00:53:36.950
Because all you need
to be able to see

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:39.945
is just a picture of the game
or video from the game and go,

00:53:39.945 --> 00:53:41.720
that doesn't look very good.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.340
Even if the viewer
doesn't understand

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:47.820
why it doesn't look good, they
can tell that immediately.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.720
I don't like that.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.625
So if the designer, programmer
is confident enough,

00:53:53.625 --> 00:53:55.530
yeah, more power to them.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:59.220
But you're going to be putting
a lot to work on yourself.

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.430
And you're not going
to get your game done

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.760
in a timely fashion at all.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.757
And it probably won't
be the best you can do.

00:54:05.757 --> 00:54:07.340
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
one more question?

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.553
LUIGI GUATIERI: Sure.

00:54:08.553 --> 00:54:09.969
AUDIENCE: Do you
ever as an artist

00:54:09.969 --> 00:54:13.102
think about designing
a video game?

00:54:13.102 --> 00:54:16.476
Do you ever think about
making [INAUDIBLE] video game?

00:54:16.476 --> 00:54:18.890
Like, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.930
LUIGI GUATIERI: So I work
with a few developers now.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:25.180
And I'm always giving
my design ideas.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.740
I always have ideas for games.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.010
I love coming up
with ideas for games.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.390
I don't think I would
call myself apt enough

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:36.030
to design the whole
game by myself yet,

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.910
so I'm definitely still focused
on the art side of things.

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.740
But yeah, I love
designing games.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.240
It's fun.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:44.780
Yes?

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.430
AUDIENCE: What have you
had to do for an art test?

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.360
LUIGI GUATIERI: So
usually for an art test,

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.570
it depends on the game.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:55.590
So I recently did an art test
for some sort of mobile MOBA

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:58.320
game, and what they
asked-- they said

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.700
here are your
character descriptions,

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.610
design these characters.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.450
And I said, all right, that'll
take me this amount of time.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:06.700
They said, great, that's fine.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.070
This is my rate.

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:09.590
It was a quick contract.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.570
Out the door for that.

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:11.640
And I designed the characters.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.014
I didn't end up
getting the work,

00:55:13.014 --> 00:55:15.550
but I don't think
my style was really

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.574
what they were looking for.

00:55:18.574 --> 00:55:19.490
But yeah, it was that.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:20.590
I designed the characters.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.050
I did a quick turnaround.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.610
So it was like,
characters standing

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.675
this way, this way, this
way, this way, from the back,

00:55:27.675 --> 00:55:29.410
of each character.

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.987
I fully painted one of them,
and said, this is what I got.

00:55:32.987 --> 00:55:34.570
I think that's a
pretty good art test,

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:37.240
especially if you're building
a game focused on characters.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.156
If you're building a
game focused environments

00:55:39.156 --> 00:55:41.010
be like, draw this
mountain for me that I'm

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:42.380
describing in this text.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:48.490
So usually an art test is
here's a description, draw this,

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.030
especially for an illustrator
or a concept artist.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:54.200
It's not so much here's a quick
doodle I did, make it better.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:58.623
It's usually here is a paragraph
of text, make this thing exist.

00:55:58.623 --> 00:56:02.121
I feel like that's a
pretty solid art test.

00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:02.620
Yes?

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.522
AUDIENCE: You
talked about finding

00:56:03.522 --> 00:56:05.780
someone who has the style
that you're looking for?

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.195
LUIGI GUATIERI: Yes.

00:56:06.195 --> 00:56:08.278
AUDIENCE: Is that generally
the case with artists,

00:56:08.278 --> 00:56:10.860
or are there artists who
are more flexible in style?

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:14.550
LUIGI GUATIERI: So I like
to think I'm more flexible.

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:18.620
I didn't used to work on a lot
of cute games, but now I do.

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.950
That's just what happened.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:23.389
There are definitely
artists who more-- so I'm

00:56:23.389 --> 00:56:25.430
going to go back to art
school here a little bit.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:26.340
This is time travel.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.320
And I'm going to remind
myself of what my Illustrator

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:32.200
professors told me, is
to never do anything

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.840
else other than your style.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.680
Get really good
at that one thing.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.300
And don't bother
with anything else,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.574
because you need to be
the best at what you do.

00:56:39.574 --> 00:56:40.990
And I was like,
eh, that's boring.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.786
Most artists have their
style they work in.

00:56:45.786 --> 00:56:47.160
A lot of video
game artists, they

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:51.140
go for the hyper-realism
concept art--

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.155
the art movie, books, that
you see from VFX houses.

00:56:54.155 --> 00:56:56.530
That's why a lot of them can
work together in big groups,

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:58.840
because they all have a
very similar kind of like,

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.820
we're going for
realism, robots, tanks.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.860
OK, we can all work together.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:06.410
The more unique your style
is, I think, the more time

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.470
you have to spend
working on that style.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:12.740
And the more reason, if this
person's style is very unique,

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:15.846
you're hiring them for their
style, not their art talents.

00:57:15.846 --> 00:57:17.470
Again, that's why a
lot of big studios,

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:19.300
they hire people
who can do realism,

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.200
because that's a little bit
more malleable in terms of what

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.382
they can turn that into.

00:57:23.382 --> 00:57:25.590
But if you're hiring artists
for their very specific,

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:30.030
unique style, you're getting
them for that one task.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:32.490
But again, it depends
on the contract for me.

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.280
If I'm-- all right, this
is for children's magazine.

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:38.121
I'm not going to put the bad guy
from Doom in there, obviously.

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.120
That doesn't make sense.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.097
As an artist, I say
yes to almost every job

00:57:44.097 --> 00:57:45.930
that comes my way,
because I don't know when

00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.260
the next one's going to come.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.844
That's just how it works.

00:57:48.844 --> 00:57:49.760
But that's how I work.

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.259
A lot of other
people are different.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.292
All right, is that it?

00:57:55.292 --> 00:57:56.125
Thank you very much.

00:57:56.125 --> 00:57:57.320
It was awesome.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:05.270
SPEAKER 1: All right,
so take five minutes

00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:07.174
to get with your teams.

00:58:07.174 --> 00:58:09.340
If you'd like to have them
take a look at your work,

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.527
just have your computer set
aside, close to the edge

00:58:12.527 --> 00:58:13.610
so they can easily see it.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.780
And at 2:10, we'll
walk around and see

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.180
who wants some feedback
on their games from Luigi.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.080
LUIGI GUATIERI: Cool.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.530
