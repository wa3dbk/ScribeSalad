00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.670
PROFESSOR: And [INAUDIBLE]
them for next week.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
So for Monday just
to really settle

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.830
expectations for what
we're doing on Mondays,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.670
we are doing rehearsals
of presentations.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.980
You do not need to do
the demo of your game

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.280
part of the rehearsal.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.810
You do need to do
the actual talk.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.410
That means we're asking for
the visual slides, any visuals

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.630
you're going to use.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.970
Go through the full talk as
if you're going to do it.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.350
Don't try to speed through it.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.780
If it's in outline
mode, then maybe

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.670
you're testing the
actual material

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.149
that you're going
to be going through.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.690
Please pay attention to all the
talks that you're listing to.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.730
Give them feedback.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.600
Give the other teams feedback
about what they're saying.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.519
We will be here basically
kind of like The Voice

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100
but without the
cool chairs, letting

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.325
you know what we think
about your stuff.

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:09.825
Yes.

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.650
A great way to get a good
grade for the presentation

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.010
is to listen to all the
feedback and make changes,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.352
so keep that in mind.

00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:21.310
AUDIENCE: Just as a
suggestion, even though you

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.890
don't have to demo
your stuff, it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.570
might be a good idea just to
bring the computer [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.570
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.755
AUDIENCE: And test
the hardware just

00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:30.010
to make sure that the
screen resolution works out,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.570
you can go full
screen, you don't

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.150
have that Google Chrome has
taking over your entire screen.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.874
Hit Escape.

00:01:35.874 --> 00:01:36.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.040
So make sure the
game works, but you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.337
don't need to actually play it.

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:40.420
Works in a period of time.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.230
Time length for these
presentations-- each team

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.900
is given 20 minutes.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.710
You will be timed.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.190
We will flag you once
you hit 20 minutes.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.630
That's total for the entire
presentation including

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.740
the demo.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.360
Limit the game-playing
part of your presentation

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.130
to no more than 10 minutes.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.720
Anything more than
10 minutes, we're

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.520
going to make a note of
that, but please keep it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.530
under 10 minutes.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.040
It can be as short as you like.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.054
You could have someone
play the entire game.

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:11.220
You can have someone play
just one part of the game.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.636
You will have
somebody who has not

00:02:12.636 --> 00:02:15.020
played your game before
playing the game live on stage,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.610
so that's also a test of ours.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.950
Time for the actual
slides part of your talk

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.520
has to be at least 10 minutes,
so 10 is a good suggestion.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.760
Five minutes of demo, 15 minutes
of talk is also fine, as well.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.320
After you're finished
with that talk,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.028
we're going to open
it to Q&amp;A from people

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:43.160
in the group in the room,
and that will include us.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.340
So rehearsal is give
your presentation.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.300
We won't do the Q&amp;A.
We'll just do feedback.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.750
Final presentations
are the real deal.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.480
It is being recorded, of course.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.340
We are still figuring out if
we're going to live stream it.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.160
Please invite your friends on
Wednesday the 10th to come.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.380
We're sending out invites
to a bunch of people,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.940
to get some of our
local developer friends

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.574
to come in and talk, and also
some folks from our department

00:03:09.574 --> 00:03:11.490
and from some of the
other game design classes

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.250
to come and watch.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.784
Attendance for those two
days-- so attendance for Monday

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:20.950
is going to be normal like
we've just been doing it.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.845
Attendance for Wednesday--
come in at 1:00, please.

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:28.470
Let us know if you're
going to be late,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.935
like email the video
game bosses list if you

00:03:30.935 --> 00:03:33.340
are going to be
late on Wednesday

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.390
for the final presentations.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.360
We'll keep the sheet
in the back of the room

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.200
so you can sign in as
you come into the room.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.700
Anything I'm missing
from any of that?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.955
And then at the end of
all the presentations,

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.330
we'll probably going to end
up with about 30 minutes left

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.370
of class, so you can
open up your computers

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.610
and have people play
your games if you like.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.290
Totally not required,
but it tends

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.070
to be fun when we do that.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.640
Cool.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.670
So if there's no questions
about any of that,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.660
we are going to do
our last lecture.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.905
We've invited Sean Baptiste
from Fire Hose Games

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:09.430
to talk to us about community
management, marketing,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.620
and all sorts of stuff,
and basically how do you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.050
get people to play your games.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.137
And after he's done,
attendance will be back open.

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:18.970
SEAN BAPTISTE: Cool.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.970
Thank you very much.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.053
Thanks for having me here.

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:21.860
This is great.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.600
My name is Sean Baptiste.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.250
I'm a 10-year veteran of
the video game industry.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.490
My first job was
at Harmonix, which

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.200
was a huge AAA sort of deal.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.320
And now I'm at a small
indie game studio

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.740
right here in Cambridge that was
started by some former game lab

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.872
alumni, Ethan Fenn and Sharat
Chat and Eitan Glinert.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.330
I think I should probably start
how I got into the industry

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.650
in the first place.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.210
I don't have a tech
background whatsoever.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.590
I came up through theater.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.620
I was a theater major, and one
thing I've realized in my years

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.684
is that there are a lot of
theater majors in video games.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.100
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.980
I think a lot of it is that
video games and theater

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.430
both have an interactive
element where there's

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.830
interplay between the
audience and the creator

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.880
that film doesn't
have necessarily.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.640
And I think a lot
of theater people

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.280
drift towards there
when they realize

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.790
there's no money to be
made whatsoever in theater.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.030
That's how I made it.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.310
So I was working
in film and I was

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.380
working in theater and
stuff and I got sick,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.620
and just the only
game I could play

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.132
was Amplitude, which was
an early Harmonix title.

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:44.590
And as I was playing
it I was like,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.500
oh, I think people make these.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.084
Like, I don't think
games just happen.

00:05:49.084 --> 00:05:50.250
I think somebody makes them.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.790
And I realized that was-- I
lived up on the North Shore,

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.150
so it was close, and I just
started pestering Harmonix

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.890
to hire me since I was close.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.470
And they kept telling me no
until eventually I just got

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.110
a friend there who sort of
said nice things about me,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.550
which was lovely of him, and
that sort of got me in in QA.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.590
QA, I'm hesitant to say
that that's a good way

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.214
to start in the industry
anymore because I don't

00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:18.380
know if it's quite as valid.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.330
QA teams have gotten smaller
and the turnover is a little bit

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.590
difficult, so it's not
necessarily the entryway

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.150
into the industry
that it used to be,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.940
which I do think is
a bit unfortunate.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.610
I worked as a QA person on
the Karaoke Revolution series

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.450
early on and then on
the Guitar Hero series

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.690
before I end up becoming
a technical artist, which

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.710
meant that I wasn't a
programmer or an artist

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.930
but I helped make them have less
fights with each other, which

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.380
is probably something you guys
are used to at this point.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.960
So I did a lot of
that and learned how

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.000
to animate and hook things up.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.980
But then they realized-- one
of the things I was doing

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.620
was-- so Harmonix, I don't
know how familiar you

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.030
guys are with
Harmonix's [INAUDIBLE],

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.650
but this was before
Harmonix got bought by MTV.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.770
And Guitar Hero had come out,
but that handled by RedOctane

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.830
and Activision-- RedOctane,
then Activision--

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.310
and we had an outside PR
place handle a lot of the PR.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.910
And mostly we just made
games and put them out there

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.320
and there wasn't as much of a
consideration for us doing PR

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.260
from inside.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.190
But we realized as we
wanted to make Rock Band

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.110
and we're moving away
from Guitar Hero and kind

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.430
of owning our own destiny that
we were the ones who were going

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.071
to have to talk up our own games
and kind of create something

00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:43.570
about it.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.780
So I wasn't the best technical
artist, I'll be honest.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.290
So they moved me over to
running the community.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.930
From Frequency and
Amplitude, there

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.490
was a very small
community of I'm

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.700
going to say about 50 or 60
people on the Harmonixfreak.com

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.457
forums and I was only one
willing to talk to them pretty

00:08:07.457 --> 00:08:08.540
much in the whole company.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.740
So as part of my job
is technical artist,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.636
for an hour each day
I would sit and talk

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:15.010
with people on
the forums and try

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.300
to manage that community,
which was very, very small

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.787
and very angry that there
wasn't a sequel to Frequency

00:08:21.787 --> 00:08:23.870
or Amplitude, that that
was kind of a dead series.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.000
So a lot of my time
was spent apologizing,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.830
I guess is how I would-- that
my big start to community

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.820
management was apologies.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.950
So I did that for a while.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.630
And when it came up
that we were going

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.171
to have to start
doing our own stuff,

00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:43.840
I got promoted up to create
the community development

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.975
team at Harmonix.

00:08:45.975 --> 00:08:48.540
And I put that
together, and that's

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.570
when there's a big change
because then we're owned by MTV

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.690
and they have a lot of
money-- like, a lot of money.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.810
And they put a lot of money
into advertising for the game

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.870
and sending us around to,
like, every event and stuff.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.360
I went to the Grammys
and was giving out

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.820
Rock Band to Morris Day and the
Time and weird stuff like that.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.480
And it started moving
a little bit away

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.270
from just general
apologizing, daily dealing

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.260
with problems, and more
with kind of creating,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.210
or at least sustaining,
a cult of personality

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.360
around the persona
of Harmonix, which

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.360
was sort of punk rock and
kind of outside of-- it

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.662
wasn't as much like
traditional game development.

00:09:30.662 --> 00:09:32.870
Everybody there was a musician
and there was actually

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.350
kind of this identity
that we could

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.760
point to and kind of
play that up and make

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.450
that sort of the
character of the company.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.310
And we definitely did that.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.571
We played that up and because
one of the things-- and we'll

00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.570
get into that more when
I talk a little bit more

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.270
about the difference between
marketing for AAA verses

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.870
marketing for indie-- is
a lot of games in AAA,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.170
you're selling the games.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.950
As far as marketing goes,
you're selling the games.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.400
For indie, what
you're doing is you're

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.380
selling the people
who make the games,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.380
and Harmonix was in
this interesting place

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.490
where even though
it was owned by MTV,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.870
it worked a lot more
like an indie company.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.970
So once we were able
to promote ourselves,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.150
we promoted the company
as a group of people.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.900
Like, don't just buy
Rock Band by Harmonix.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.860
Buy the whole company.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.825
Buy what we do.

00:10:21.825 --> 00:10:23.200
Stick with us
because we're going

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.780
to keep making cool stuff.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.850
And I did that for
a number of years

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.620
and it was crazy-- flew
constantly everywhere,

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.570
stayed in hotels that
didn't have lice and stuff.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.900
It was nice.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.200
A lot of getting to
do really cool things.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.160
I ended up getting
sick after that

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.897
and spent a few years
away from the industry.

00:10:45.897 --> 00:10:47.480
And when I came back,
I'd been playing

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.620
so many independent games
from small indie teams--

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.990
things like stuff that John Blow
had made or Fez or just a lot

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.110
of the games-- Castle
Crashers, Alien

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.590
Hominid, those sorts of games.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.190
And I realized there was an
analog to what I was already

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.910
doing with Harmonix, which was
kind of the-- in indie games,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.890
you really do have
to sell the artist.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.030
You're selling the artist.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.510
You're trying to
get people to come

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.470
because if you don't have an
interesting story in a way

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.554
or that you can sell to
the press or to journals,

00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:23.970
you're not going to get anybody
writing articles about you

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.982
for the most part.

00:11:25.982 --> 00:11:28.500
That's just the case.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.890
The big AAA companies have
lots and lots of money

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.160
so they can plant lots
and lots of articles.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.150
And as far as indie
stuff goes, the only way

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.130
you can sell yourself
is having a good story

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.250
that a journalist wants to tell
because if you don't have that,

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.250
there's really no
upside for them

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.640
to write an article
about you or your game

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.420
or anything like that.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.690
I know that seems a little
cynical, but there it is.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.840
That is the case.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.894
So let's see-- so when
I went to Fire Hose,

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:00.810
the differences in the
marketing, like I said,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.170
was when I was at
Harmonix, a lot

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.620
of what I did in community
management was making

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.480
sure everybody was really
invested in the product,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.030
in ourselves as a team.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:22.170
But a lot of it was also
keeping our secrets--

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.640
making sure that people
weren't leaking information

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.137
from inside of the
company, making

00:12:26.137 --> 00:12:28.470
sure play testers weren't
leaking inside of the company,

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.910
making sure an unannounced
project that a coder on there

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.780
didn't go in and update their
LinkedIn profile and say,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.790
hey, we're working on
Rock Band 2 at the time

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.520
before we'd announced
Rock Band 2,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.770
and then there's a huge thing.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.950
So a lot of my
stuff was managing

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.870
what information got out.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.850
In independent games,
my job is to make sure

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.610
all of the information gets
out and that we are constantly

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.670
screaming for people to
notice us because there's

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.100
so much competition.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.350
I mean, just look
at the explosion

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.300
of independent games
in the past let's say

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.000
five years, six years.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.830
2008 I think is
really when it really

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.860
started becoming this definitive
thing that you can point at.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.520
There's a lot of people,
and a lot of people

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.517
who also equally want people
to pay attention to them,

00:13:19.517 --> 00:13:21.350
and there's only so
many outlets and there's

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.620
only so many places
where people are going

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.790
to be able to read about it.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.680
So you're really fighting.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.480
There is a sort of-- it
could very easily turn

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.120
into a sort of crabs in
the bucket situation,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.010
just everybody pulling
each other down.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.209
Luckily that's not really how
the indie game scene works.

00:13:41.209 --> 00:13:43.250
A lot of people are trying
to push each other up,

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.840
which is nice, but
you're still competing

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.240
with so many other people
for a limited amount of slots

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.610
of articles.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.400
The one thing I've learned
since I've been at Fire Hose

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.550
is that actually matters
very little if in the end--

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.120
and by that, I should
say I mean that

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.140
in terms of sales of the game.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.340
A big article on
Kotaku isn't going

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.540
to sell your game, not anymore.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.190
When I first started
in the industry,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.540
that absolutely was the case.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:17.160
A big article in GameSpot
or IGN, one of the big-- 1UP

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.040
at the time-- that
would put you over.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.860
That could definitely
help put you over.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.350
But at this point, that's
just simply not the case.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.690
And even a year ago,
I was saying that,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.500
and that everybody
should probably

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.570
put more of their marketing
time towards getting YouTube

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.320
people to cover their games.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.270
And now that's sort of
the predominant theory,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.728
but I think that's
going away, too,

00:14:39.728 --> 00:14:43.750
because everybody who likes
games has a YouTube channel

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.950
and does Let's Plays.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:51.070
So in a way, it's sort of
a reflection of what indie

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.580
is doing at the same time.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.350
Now that there's
just so many people,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.520
the market sort of flooded.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.320
The novelty has worn off.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.394
So it certainly can
help, but it's something

00:15:00.394 --> 00:15:01.560
you have to be careful, too.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.960
You can't put all of
your eggs in one basket.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.490
But with indie, too-- so
when I was at Harmonix,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.580
I ran a team of I think
at our height 12 people.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.650
So that was 12 people doing
just community management

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.260
and just doing public relations.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:25.220
At Fire Hose, I do that, all
of it, and I'm also a designer.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.311
So it's like a part
of my overall job

00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.560
and I'm the only one doing it.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.720
So I have to choose what
we do far more carefully

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.060
and I have to do it without
any money whatsoever.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.600
Certainly you can put money
into buying ads or doing

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.520
Facebook ads or
that sort of thing,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.170
but I don't think that
that's necessarily the best

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.860
use of your time all the time.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.450
And a lot of companies
don't have the budget

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.580
beyond their salaries to
actually buy these ads,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.320
so what do you do?

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.590
And that goes back
to what I was saying.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.397
It's community
management, and I guess

00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:01.980
I should get into a
little bit of what

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.120
community management is.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.370
When I started doing
community management in 2007,

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.850
it wasn't a thing really.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.610
I think there was one
video game company that

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.810
wasn't an MMO, that didn't
make MMOs, that actually

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.800
had anything approaching
a community team,

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.890
and that was BioWare.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.030
Right around Neverwinter
Nights, they put together

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.910
a community team of
two people, I think,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.800
and that was just to
manage their forums.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.054
And let's see, that's
probably around 2002/2003.

00:16:31.054 --> 00:16:32.970
And in that time, you
really only put together

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.210
a community team if you
had a large multiplayer

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.970
game, generally an MMO.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:43.660
So at the time, Asheron's Call
had something or Ultima Online

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.170
had it and early
World of Warcraft all

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.070
had these community teams.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.484
There was an element
of promotion to it.

00:16:54.484 --> 00:16:56.150
There was an element
of marketing to it,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.560
but it wasn't so much that.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.330
It was more customer service.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.760
They were really there
to deal with problems

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.350
that came up as they went.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.280
BioWare where they sort of broke
the mold a little bit was it

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.240
wasn't about that.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.640
It really was about the
company having direct access

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.940
to communicate with their
fans, and vice versa.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.960
I once was half-joking
that my job as a community

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.490
manager at Harmonix
was ombudsman

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.611
because I felt like
I had to represent

00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:28.069
the company to the
fans, and then I

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.530
had to represent the fans
to the company, which

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.610
involved being as
honest as possible

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.440
at all times with both, which
is a real difficult tightrope

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.960
to walk.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.320
So with community management,
what you try to do

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.390
is you try to build out the
people who love your games.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.840
You're trying to make
them into the people who

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.850
talk about your games online.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.185
You're basically creating
a kind of an ad hoc sales

00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:03.910
force, a word of
mouth way of promoting

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.660
your game because that's like if
you read an article on Kotaku,

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.720
do you immediately go
out and buy a game?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.690
Probably not.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.671
You might do a little
bit more research on it.

00:18:12.671 --> 00:18:14.420
You might read up a
little bit more on it.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.461
You might go to Metacritic
and check the reviews,

00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:17.320
that sort of thing.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.665
But if a friend tells
you, like just a person

00:18:20.665 --> 00:18:22.790
you know is like, "Hey,
I'm checking out this game.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:23.700
There might be multiplayer.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.075
We should check
this out," you're

00:18:25.075 --> 00:18:27.070
far more likely to buy it.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.190
Community management is the
art of managing word of mouth.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.190
You're getting people
to tell their friends,

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.273
the people that they know.

00:18:35.273 --> 00:18:37.900
You're getting people to tell
the people who trust them

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.270
that this game is good so
that those people then go on

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.820
and buy it.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.200
And join your community,
hopefully, and then they go on

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:44.960
and tell.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.070
So what started for Harmonix, a
lot of what we did is because--

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.740
and there's a
scalability aspect to it.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.210
When I created the Rock
Band community site,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.220
that was 100% forums-based.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.360
We did Twitter.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.180
We did Facebook.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.950
Like I said, we did
tons of live events,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:08.040
but everything was very much
based around the forums.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.120
Part of that was because
Twitter hasn't happened yet,

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.340
or was just happening
and not as many people

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.320
were talking about it.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.360
This was early 2007.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.620
So everything we did, we
build our this huge site.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.080
We had forums.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.860
I think I was
managing at that time

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:28.540
a registered community of about
350,000 people on the forums,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.130
and that's why we needed a team.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.057
It was big.

00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:32.890
And there was an aspect
of customer service.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.990
You might remember-- I
don't know how many of you

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.280
guys were really playing
that at the time,

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.160
but when it first
came out, there

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.740
were issues and articles
about the issues

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.110
about the instruments.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.445
Any time you debut new
hardware, there's generally

00:19:49.445 --> 00:19:51.570
going to be problems or
there's going to be issues,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:52.860
and that happens.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.927
So leading up to
it, it was very much

00:19:55.927 --> 00:19:57.510
like, Rock Band's
going to be awesome.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.218
We're doing rock.

00:19:58.218 --> 00:20:00.870
And then as soon as it came
out and those issues started

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:05.810
coming up, the job just clamped
down into 100% customer service

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.200
all the time, just trying
to manage all of that.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.470
Which was something that
having come from technical,

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.440
I wasn't necessarily
prepared to do.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.235
But I think with any
game, no matter who

00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:18.610
your audience is,
no matter what,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.529
it's very valuable to have some
sort of protocol for customer

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:23.570
service leading up to it.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:30.290
That's something I think that
you should definitely do.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:35.060
At Fire Hose, we
don't have forums.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.660
We have a Facebook page.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.830
We have Twitter.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.420
But forums, they're not
what they used to be.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.350
The communities aren't
forums, aren't the same

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.240
as they used to be,
and sometimes they're

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.180
just more trouble than
they're worth to manage.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.790
It could be it's
very time-consuming

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.080
to stop all the spam, to
get in the middle of fights

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.100
and stop people from
hurting each other.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.710
And we were very hands-on.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.135
We weren't a
website where it was

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:01.410
like, say whatever you want.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.368
Post whatever you want.

00:21:02.368 --> 00:21:07.250
We were very hands-on about
abuse and that sort of thing.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.870
At Fire Hose since we don't
have as big of an audience--

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:13.150
we don't have 350,000 people
who are following what we're

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.220
doing who are registered
users who are going to follow

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.100
everything that we
say and everything

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.340
that we do and are
really hugely invested

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.810
in the company or our games--
so we have to find other ways.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.310
One of the things that's
probably the biggest thing-- I

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:41.600
should bring this up here-- is
we started up a Twitch channel,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.020
and this was just as the
live video and live streaming

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.030
was starting to
really become a thing.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.660
So it was a couple years ago.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.527
We had Go Home Dinosaurs,
which you might

00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:53.610
have seen on the scroller.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.930
That was a game that
we put out last year.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.460
That was coming out and we
wanted to get attention for it.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.220
And we realized we
wouldn't be able to get

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.240
every the YouTube video star
to feature our dumb game that

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:12.330
was awesome-- it was awesome--
about dinosaurs stealing

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.950
barbecue from early mammals.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.830
We knew we weren't going to get
every YouTube star to cover it.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.630
TotalBiscuit did
actually, somehow,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.860
but we realized we kind of
had to build our own community

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.570
and really kind of make
our own press for it

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.330
rather than spend
all of my time.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.190
Our marketing
budget is my salary.

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.900
There's not extra
stuff where I'm

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.630
buying up ads and everything.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:41.030
So we started
meeting with Twitch.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.711
Actually, they came
out here to talk

00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:45.960
about how they wanted to get
more indie games on there

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.090
and we sort of struck up
a relationship with people

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.790
at Twitch, and that got
us front page promotions.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.280
So for instance every
day, Monday through Friday

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.990
from 12:00 to 12:30
on Twitch, you

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.270
will see my big stupid
face staring out

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.000
at you from the screen because
we're on the front page

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.320
right in the thing, and
anybody who goes to Twitch

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.870
is going to see our game first.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.980
That cost us absolutely
zero dollars.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.940
As far as budget
goes, all that takes

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.985
is my time because
we talk to them

00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:29.140
and we try to create
good content that also

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.410
helps their brand, as well.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.810
But that brings us-- you can
see so far since we started up

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.810
our channel, four million
people have watched it.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.630
Four million impressions is
way outside of our price range.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.660
It's just outside of our--
that would be tens of thousands

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.254
of dollars to get that
many people to get

00:23:50.254 --> 00:23:52.920
an impression of our product, to
get an impression of Fire Hose,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.336
to get an impression
of our games,

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.110
to get an impression of the
people who worked there.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.330
It would take that long,
and part of the way we do

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.230
is like I said, every day,
Monday through Friday 12:00

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.950
to 12:30, I put on a show.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.170
It's about Let's Quip!

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.980
That's actually my game.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.950
I should mention
Fire Hose, we have

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.330
three games going right now.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.100
We also do outside projects.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.560
We take on contract work.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.540
Right now we're working
on a project with DARPA

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.170
that's pretty cool that
actually teaches people not

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:24.960
to shoot people.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.760
It's pretty fun.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.390
But we have three eventually
commercially available products

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.140
that we're working on right now.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.424
One is Let's Quip!

00:24:35.424 --> 00:24:36.590
That's a game I'm designing.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.860
That's a comedic debating game.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.800
That's what I do
on the show Monday

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.080
to Friday 12:00 to 12:30.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.760
Just I invite local
comedians in and we just

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.910
talk about different aspects of
comedy while playing the game,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.650
and that has actually
been wildly successful.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.860
I had Jackie Kashian,
who's a very big touring

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.700
comedian who I'm a huge fan of.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:01.980
She came in on the show.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.340
And on that show, I think,
over the course of that one

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.290
half-hour, we had
something-- I want

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:11.260
to say it was 24,000
people, which is great.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.120
Like I said, I would not
be able to pay for that.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.620
I would not be able
to afford that.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.630
But all it takes is my time.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.910
We also have three
other shows that we do.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.230
So there's the Monday show.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.510
So that's 2 and 1/2
hours out of the week.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.240
And then we have a Tuesday
show in the afternoon

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.380
from 4:00 to 5:00.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.360
That's one of the other
games that we're working on.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.530
Chris Chung, who's
a local developer,

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.790
he's working on a game
called Catlateral Damage

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.914
that you may have heard of.

00:25:40.914 --> 00:25:44.280
Catlateral Damage is
really, really rad.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.450
You're basically a cat.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.590
It has first-person
shooter controls.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.650
Your family's left the
house for a little while,

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.150
so you have a limited
amount of time

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.080
to just destroy
all of their stuff.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:54.710
And it's great.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.050
You're just pouncing around
knocking things on the floor.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.050
You get points for
destroying people's monitors.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:25:59.810
It's great.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.230
It's exactly what cats do.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:08.880
It's very, very fun, and
Chris is this lovely guy.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.650
He loves cats in a way
that's sort of very honest.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.370
There's nothing
ironic about, and he's

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.090
kind of the perfect person
to host a show about making

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.980
a game about cats.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.010
So we gave him this spot, 4:00
to 5:00, where all he does

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:27.040
is he sits there with Unity
open and he shows what

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.080
he's been working on that week.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.732
And he tells people, like,
we do this, we do this.

00:26:32.732 --> 00:26:33.940
I just added in these things.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.580
This is how I did that in Unity.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.360
So it's one part demonstration
of his game and one part

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.960
tutorial, and that
brings in people, too--

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.480
people who want to learn
more about making video games

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.170
as well as people who are just
interested in a game about cats

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.387
knocking your stuff over.

00:26:48.387 --> 00:26:50.220
And that really works
for him, and it really

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.060
fits the theme of this game.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.880
The other game we have is a
game called 20XX, which we just

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.130
announced two weeks ago.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.340
If you are a fan of
games like Mega Man X

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.096
or those sorts of
platformers, it's a game very

00:27:04.096 --> 00:27:04.970
much similar to that.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.730
We're working with a team
out of I believe Maryland.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.150
It's where they
currently reside.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:16.300
So part of that is we-- I
should clarify that Fire Hose

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:22.270
Games late last year as
opposed to just a studio,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:25.360
we opened up an incubator
for independent games.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:30.190
So for the most part,
local indie game developers

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.660
who have good games that
they really want to work on

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.670
can come to Fire hose,
get a monthly stipend,

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.125
get office space,
and we'll help them

00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:40.500
with the development
of the game.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.458
We'll help them with the
promotion of the game.

00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:44.160
We help them with
kind of everything.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.930
And it's more like
a partnership.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:51.980
Both Catlateral Damage and
20XX are part of that program.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.390
And it's great working because
that's like Catlateral Damage

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.380
and 20XX and Let's
Quip! are three

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.680
incredibly different games.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.370
Like I said, 20XX has a very
sort of Mega Man X feel.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.440
It's very hardcore.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.370
It's very platformery.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.280
Catlateral Damage is
about cats, so that

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.970
has a completely
different audience.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.340
I'm sure on a Venn diagram,
there's some crossover.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.890
And then Let's
Quip! is just a game

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.560
where you write words down.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.780
Like you write
tweets and then you

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.340
try to be funnier
than other people.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:27.486
The three games have almost no
shared audience across them,

00:28:27.486 --> 00:28:29.110
so we have to approach
everything very,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.830
very differently.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.530
I think showing Let's Quip!
but actually showing comedians

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.610
playing it, that helps
because that actually

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:37.800
plays into the
narrative of the game,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.910
the fiction of the game, which
is allowing you to be funny.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.370
And then we have
comedians come in

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.036
and kind of vote on
whether you're funny

00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:49.020
or not, and that's creating
sort of a cult of personality.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.490
And at the same time, they're
also meeting the creators.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.240
So like I said earlier
when I was talking

00:28:53.240 --> 00:29:01.350
about how people pushing the
artist as opposed to the art,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.490
we sort of play into
that a little bit.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.275
Having Chris Chung come in
and just show development

00:29:06.275 --> 00:29:08.020
on [INAUDIBLE], it's so earnest.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.603
If you get a chance,
you should really

00:29:09.603 --> 00:29:14.550
watch it because he's just the
most likable, smart dude who's

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.560
just going through.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:22.712
And for a live stream where he
just basically has Unity open

00:29:22.712 --> 00:29:24.170
and he's just moving
things around,

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.440
he gets several thousand people
over the hour watching him,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.415
which is nuts.

00:29:29.415 --> 00:29:30.040
But it's great.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.660
People love it.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.750
With 20XX, we've just started.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:35.500
I'm just working
on the marketing

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.910
plan for that, the marketing map
for the next six months or so.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:47.020
And I should say that's when I'm
just planning out this month,

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.960
these are the things
we need to talk to.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.640
We need this many screenshots.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.160
We need to have a
trailer for February.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.370
We need to have this.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.800
And just coming up with those
milestones in the same way

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.240
that I'm sure you come
up with your milestones

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.272
for your project.

00:30:02.272 --> 00:30:04.480
We're doing the same thing,
but on the marketing end.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.580
These are the goals we
need to hit in December.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.160
These are the people we
need to talk to in January.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.502
If we can get an
exclusive for February,

00:30:11.502 --> 00:30:13.710
that means we're going to
need to be talking about it

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:15.940
in December and have
a pitch for that,

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:18.940
have some sort of
PowerPoint presentation

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.300
or just a really good email
with good resource screenshots

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.165
and videos and stuff that we can
send out to different outlets

00:30:25.165 --> 00:30:26.790
to try to get a little
bit of coverage.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.670
Even though I said
that articles don't

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.500
have a direct effect
on sales, they

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.960
do have a direct
effect on zeitgeist,

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.320
I guess I should say, so there
is a sort of cultural cachet

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.240
that comes from having a big
article on your games there.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.990
It doesn't necessarily
translate to sales.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.920
But if you know how to
use it and take advantage

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.020
of that cultural cachet, you
can bring more people in,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.410
which I find useful.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.540
But every single one
of these games, I

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.290
have to market differently
because they're

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.860
marketed to different people.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:07.370
Like I said, 20XX, also that
game is going to be on Steam.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:11.000
It's I think it was
$14.99, and that game

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.624
we put out in early access.

00:31:12.624 --> 00:31:14.040
That's one of the
early ways we're

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.480
trying to market it is
getting it out on early access

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.730
and getting people who are
excited about Mega Man-style

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.300
platformers really
talking about that game

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.790
and very excited
about that game.

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.710
Whereas with Let's Quip!, that's
just going to comedy fans.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.260
All I'm doing is talking to
comedians for the most part

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.287
because comedians if
they like the game,

00:31:32.287 --> 00:31:33.870
they're going to
tweet about the game.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.640
And it turns out comedians have
lots of fans who like comedy.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.730
Who would've thought?

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.790
And then with Catlateral
Damage, as far as I can tell,

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.310
the audience for that game
is every person on Earth.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.730
It involves cats.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.260
It involves mindless
destruction.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.930
It's everything the world
is asking for right now.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.070
It's just beautiful and I love
Chris and I love the game.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.950
It's amazing.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.130
But since in a way
that's a little bit more

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.350
of a mainstream game, that also
takes a completely different

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.680
approach because we're
not selling that game

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.080
to hardcore gamers.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.370
Hardcore gamers are
certainly invited,

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.360
but this is a game that
I can give to my mom

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.942
or I could give to a friend
who already likes video games,

00:32:19.942 --> 00:32:21.650
and both could get
something out of that.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.108
And that takes a
different approach

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:26.210
because you don't want
to come up with a-- like,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.400
I wouldn't want to
come up with an ad

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.810
or a promo for the game
that was like, this

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.230
is the baddest game ever.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.650
It's going to destroy your life.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.490
I'm not going to be
advertising that way

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.140
because that'll turn
off the people who

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.435
are not hardcore gamers.

00:32:45.435 --> 00:32:46.810
They're not going
to want to play

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.930
something that acts like
it's going to destroy them.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.027
Whereas also if you go too
soft on the other side,

00:32:54.027 --> 00:32:55.610
that's going to turn
off other people.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.160
So you're going to find sort
of a midway line between that,

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.980
and that's another thing
I'm working on right now

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.480
with Chris.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.900
But as far as video
goes on Twitch,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.450
I think that's
very, very helpful.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.885
I should probably start getting
ready to take questions,

00:33:06.885 --> 00:33:08.440
I think.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.190
But I guess one of the
things you asked me, too,

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:14.540
is about IGF in the IndieCade.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.190
For me, it's a hard thing
because I do certainly

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:23.840
find value in marketing for as
far as award shows and stuff,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.330
like the IGF getting awards.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.700
I personally have a whole lot
of problems with the whole

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.160
how awards for any art.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.460
I guess I think I just
have personal problems.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.170
I think it's very,
very valuable.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.940
And I think especially
for young developers

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.920
who are trying to
their name out there,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.630
getting your game into as many
festivals as possible is great.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.050
Don't break the bank doing so.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.560
A lot of them require
submission fees.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.624
So if you can find festivals
that fit the genre of the game,

00:33:57.624 --> 00:33:58.540
just do your research.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.550
Know what you're submitting to.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:05.040
Like IGF has something like
7,000 people submitting

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.110
every year, and that costs
money for you to submit.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.250
So if you think you can
compete, definitely do it.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:15.600
Otherwise, put your efforts
into a different festival

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.440
which still you
could win something

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.159
and then you can put
that on everything

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.810
that you market the game with.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:28.670
Like, the winner of
the 1989-- I don't

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.040
know why I went with 1989.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.481
I'm old.

00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:32.980
So, yeah.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.170
You just put that
award on there.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.900
I'm sure you've been
on Steam and you've

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.340
seen they have a section where
you can actually just put links

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.630
to every award you've
got, and then it shows up

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:42.929
and there's a little graphic.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:45.449
That's really good and that
can get your name out there.

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:47.600
And even though I have
a problem with it,

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.770
I can still see the value in it.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.250
IndieCade is one of the funnest
things I've ever been to.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:59.480
And every time I get really
down on this industry, which

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.410
happens, going to
IndieCade makes

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.630
me remember why I love working
with the people I love.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.400
I love this industry,
and I love the weird crap

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.220
that people come up with because
it's a great place for games

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:17.230
that were completely outside the
mainstream to exist and live.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.670
That's how I found out
about this game last year

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.240
called Dominique Pamplemousse.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.300
I don't know if any
of you have played it.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.080
It's a musical.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.970
It's an opera game, which
is adventure singing.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:34.011
It's nuts and it's
great, but people never

00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.510
would have found out about it
if it weren't for just winning

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.095
the IGF Award, for
noticing weirder games that

00:35:40.095 --> 00:35:43.880
are outside the
mainstream like that.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.380
But I think I should open things
up for questions if anybody

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.296
has anything specific.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.106
Yeah?

00:35:55.106 --> 00:35:58.090
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned about
how articles don't directly

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.718
translate [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:00.718 --> 00:36:04.533
Do you think that's also
starting to be true for AAA,

00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:07.980
or is it more of a
direct [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.446
expect to get [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:10.446 --> 00:36:12.070
SEAN BAPTISTE: I
think there's probably

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:16.240
still some value to
for AAA, and part

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.480
of that is because the one thing
that's great about being a AAA

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.250
developer is you have resources,
and lots and lots of resources.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.970
So one of the things we
would do any time you

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.400
talk about the launch
of a game, it'd be like,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:39.520
OK, so let's say
Assassin's Creed.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.610
The next one supposed to come
out on September 9, 2015.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.020
You want to own that
Newsday, and that

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.530
means you are planting
articles on it for September 8

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.670
and September 9 at every
outlet in the world

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.240
so that that day when every
person who checks video game

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.340
blogs, reads a video game
blog, the only thing they're

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.530
going to be reading
about is your game.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.840
It's basically like
playing a commercial

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:09.730
on a loop for an entire day
until you've subliminally

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.730
made that person buy your game.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.350
That's sort of the whole idea.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.270
Independence-- we
cannot own a Newsday.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:22.630
It's very difficult because it's
expensive and time-consuming--

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.350
really, really
time-consuming to own

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.540
a Newsday as an independent
because just planting

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.330
one major article in a big
thing, like say a cover

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.610
article for GameInformer--
that's so many

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.590
man hours between the person
who's negotiating that deal

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.820
and making it happen, coming up
with a story like the narrative

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.700
for the game you're
trying to sell.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:48.990
Plus also art resources,
like getting your artists

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.030
to deliver a whole
bunch of screenshots,

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:55.720
but also Photoshops of
all of the characters.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.400
That's so expensive
in time and money,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.190
and indies can't do that.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.480
So I think for us,
we can get articles.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.550
But really getting an article
in everything simultaneously

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:10.340
on the same day-- the funniest
thing that ever happened

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.780
is when Go Home
Dinosaurs came out,

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.990
I was sending review
codes out to things.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.030
And I was like, so we
have an embargo for this,

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:22.070
and one reporter literally wrote
back, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.870
We don't have that.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:27.210
We don't have the
muscle to be like,

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.330
we can back up this embargo.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.020
AAA places have a hard
time backing up an embargo,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.970
but they have the benefit
of being like, well,

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.630
if you don't adhere
to this embargo,

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.070
we're not going to give you
coverage of the next game.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.890
Whereas if you're an indie,
you would be cutting your nose

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:44.360
off right there.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.470
Like, fine, you don't
get to do the next game,

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.720
and they'll tell you
won't have a next game.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:51.840
So like I said,
there's certainly

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.439
cultural cachet I
think for indies,

00:38:53.439 --> 00:38:54.730
but it's more valuable for AAA.

00:39:02.325 --> 00:39:03.700
AUDIENCE: So
community management

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:08.910
as you described it is a word
of mouth deal for a lot of it.

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:10.810
Is part of your
purview then doing

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:15.271
bundle sales and other types of
sales where if you get somebody

00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:17.270
to play the game, maybe
they'll talk to somebody

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.100
else about the game?

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:18.933
SEAN BAPTISTE: Yeah.

00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:21.630
Doing bundle sales--
see, that's another one

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:25.090
I'm torn on because I see
the value in bundles sales,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:30.060
but I see that that value
is diminishing day by day.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.256
There are so many
bundles out there,

00:39:33.256 --> 00:39:34.880
Humble Bundle being
one of the biggest.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.650
But then there's, like, 70
other ones that you can go to.

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.320
And Humble Bundle's
great to work

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.170
with because they're very
protective of the Steam keys

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.166
that you put out, whereas a
lot of the other bundle places,

00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.540
they don't have
as much security.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.820
So what happens is you put
your thing in a bundle.

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:53.590
That bundle sells 10,000.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:59.270
You get $0.13 on the dollar for
whatever people paid, or less.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.190
Probably less--
probably much less.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.170
But you're not getting
that much money.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.840
You're selling at a discount
to try to get a huge amount.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.120
The thing is what a lot of
the people buying those are,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.519
they're overseas.

00:40:12.519 --> 00:40:14.060
And what they're
doing is they're not

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.351
buying the game because
they're fan of you or your game

00:40:16.351 --> 00:40:18.460
or they want to play it
or your game was just one

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.700
other thing in the bundle.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.430
They're buying up
Steam keys and then

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.720
they are selling them on
their own sites overseas.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.390
So basically they're buying
your game and 15 other games

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:33.100
for $5.00 total in the bundle,
and then they're selling all

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.220
of those at half
off of retail price.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.330
And that cuts into
your sales so bad

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:42.040
because when people actually
do want to play your game,

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.190
they're looking for a deal.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:46.620
So they end up going to
this off-brand site that's

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:52.160
selling Steam codes
from it, and it's rough.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.790
There's a lot of indies who've
shot themselves in the foot

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:56.530
by going to Bundle
Crazy and then

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.520
really killing the long tail
on their sales in my opinion.

00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:03.570
Yep?

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.403
AUDIENCE: How big an
impact did TotalBiscuit

00:41:05.403 --> 00:41:07.300
have on Go Home Dinosaur sales?

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.970
SEAN BAPTISTE: I think a few
more people found out about it.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.680
I don't think it had
on sales, not much.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.362
Not much.

00:41:17.362 --> 00:41:18.820
And even at the
time, that was when

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.010
that was sort of happening.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:25.257
And it wasn't the most glowing
play-through of all time

00:41:25.257 --> 00:41:26.840
that he's ever played
it, but he liked

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.717
it and he said it was
really fun and dumb, which

00:41:29.717 --> 00:41:30.800
is what we were going for.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.120
But in the end as
far sales goes,

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.050
it wasn't as big of a
driver as one would think.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:44.490
I do know of games
that TotalBiscuit

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:47.860
has covered that has had a
pronounced effect on sales,

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.780
but they're multiplayer games.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.180
Like our game, it
was single-player.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.740
Whereas if you have
a multiplayer shooter

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.530
or if you have something
like Hearthstone,

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.840
a game where people are
playing together online,

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.140
that's his audience.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.660
His audience does
care about e-sports

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:11.090
and does care about
big multiplayer games,

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.140
and ours wasn't that.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.050
So I don't know if
that was necessarily

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:17.240
the best fit, but still
nice that he liked it,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.224
nice that he played it.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.308
Oh, yeah?

00:42:25.308 --> 00:42:25.808
Go ahead.

00:42:25.808 --> 00:42:26.308
No problem.

00:42:26.308 --> 00:42:28.293
AUDIENCE: Do you also
manage the Steam forums

00:42:28.293 --> 00:42:30.780
for any of the games, or
do you solely do just--

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.430
SEAN BAPTISTE: I do you manage
the Steam forums a little bit,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:40.049
mostly for customer
service because that

00:42:40.049 --> 00:42:41.590
would be the first
place people would

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.800
go rather than emailing us.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.175
We had a link inside the game
where people could email us

00:42:45.175 --> 00:42:48.120
if they had problems,
if there were

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.740
bugs or something like that.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:50.781
[INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:53.200
But a lot of people went
straight to the Steam forums

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.910
and would talk about
their problems on there

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.120
and do direct sort of stuff.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.090
But as far as building
up the community there,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.280
some games work for that
and some games don't.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.990
I think games that
are multiplayer

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:10.390
just do better as far as
Steam forum communities.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:13.820
It's just easier to grow
a community like that,

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.760
build a community there.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.620
But where for
single-player games,

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.820
people are less interested
in, I think, talking

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.280
to other people about them.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.780
Maybe Skyrim, that sort
of a single-player game

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.532
where there's a huge expansive
world and there's more to share

00:43:26.532 --> 00:43:27.990
and it's less
linear, I think there

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.730
might be more room for
community on Steam.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.130
Yeah?

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.010
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about IndieCade as an event

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:41.070
[INAUDIBLE] rejuvenation.

00:43:43.499 --> 00:43:44.832
On Monday, we had Jenna come in.

00:43:44.832 --> 00:43:46.290
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.180
She was talking about how
she spends so much on events.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.240
And I'm wondering how
do events factor in

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.865
and how you think about events
in terms of sales, in terms

00:43:56.865 --> 00:43:57.490
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.640
SEAN BAPTISTE: So events
are difficult for indies

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:06.220
because events by their
very nature cost money

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.620
to travel to, to stay at.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:11.030
Luckily the
independent community

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.490
is great because we'll just
call up 19 other companies

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:17.490
and be like, hey, you
guys are going to this?

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.140
Cool.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.590
Want to get an Airbnb?

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.319
And then we just share it
and try to keep costs down,

00:44:22.319 --> 00:44:23.360
but it's still expensive.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.136
You can't do that for a
flight or to get places.

00:44:27.136 --> 00:44:28.260
Well, you might be able to.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.843
You shouldn't.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.680
But I will say this-- if
you can go to an event,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.300
if there's any conceivable
way you can go to an event,

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:40.030
and I mean just
about any event where

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.490
there's other game
developers there talking

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.280
about games, any sort of
game-based conference or expo,

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.280
go to it.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.220
Absolutely go to it.

00:44:51.197 --> 00:44:52.780
I've been talking
about word of mouth.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.910
One of the best ways
of word of mouth

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:55.784
is going out and meeting
other developers who

00:44:55.784 --> 00:44:58.550
have other communities
supporting their games--

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.340
talking to them
about their game,

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.215
you talking about your
game, and just sort

00:45:02.215 --> 00:45:03.355
of sharing because
then they are going

00:45:03.355 --> 00:45:04.840
and they're going to be
probably be, hey, check out

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.798
this new friend I made.

00:45:05.798 --> 00:45:07.970
He's making this game
and it's pretty cool.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.880
And you're getting more
people noticing it.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.702
And it's better to be part of
the overall game development

00:45:15.702 --> 00:45:17.410
community than it is
to be outside of it.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:19.118
But by the same token,
sometimes you just

00:45:19.118 --> 00:45:23.855
don't want to talk to
people, and that's fair, too.

00:45:23.855 --> 00:45:26.220
AUDIENCE: Actually, it
made me think, in the past,

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.299
did you play other people's
games on your FireHost?

00:45:29.299 --> 00:45:31.090
SEAN BAPTISTE: Yeah,
I should mention that.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:34.409
So when we first started
out, like I mentioned,

00:45:34.409 --> 00:45:36.200
we did it because we
wanted to sell Go Home

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.760
Dinosaurs and another game that
we had made a port of it called

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.260
Slam Bolt Scrappers.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:45.090
And so we started off with that,
and it became very apparent

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:48.070
after two weeks that
we only had two games,

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:50.450
and that's not a good show.

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:51.450
That's not a great show.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.800
So that was our Wednesday show.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:46:01.910
That was our inaugural show
on our live stream channel.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:06.445
So after those two weeks, we
were like, what else can we do?

00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.070
We shouldn't give up
on this because we

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.280
don't have two games.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.327
How do we build
our audience more?

00:46:11.327 --> 00:46:13.910
And then we were like, what if
we played other people's games?

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:17.340
And then we realized, well, what
if we bring in other developers

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.280
and then they bring in
their games with them?

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.200
And then we play their
games while they're

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.090
standing next to us, and
then we just talk about it?

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.780
And I have a
standing desk at work

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.610
and it's just two of us standing
there and playing games.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.907
And we just interview and
talk to them about the game

00:46:31.907 --> 00:46:33.490
that they made while
we're playing it.

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.510
And I've called that sharing.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.820
You create it, you bring
your own spotlight,

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.140
and then you share it.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.420
And that helps.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.450
We help get other,
smaller-- because we

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:45.720
don't do a lot of big games.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.880
It's very rare.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.390
We did Super Smash
Brothers, I think

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:53.304
is the biggest game, the biggest
marketable game, that we've

00:46:53.304 --> 00:46:54.720
had on our live
stream, and that's

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.874
just because everybody at
the office is addicted to it.

00:46:57.874 --> 00:46:59.415
But largely, we have
other people in.

00:46:59.415 --> 00:47:06.220
Like in January, we
had Zoe Quinn in.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.071
We had people before
that, like just a bunch

00:47:08.071 --> 00:47:10.570
of other developers throughout
the country because sometimes

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.653
they couldn't come in, so
we'd have them Skype in.

00:47:15.945 --> 00:47:17.320
And it's helped
them, but it also

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.720
helps us because it gives
us content for our show.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.429
It helps give them exposure
and it helps build our audience

00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:24.720
over time because they're
tuning into an exciting show.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.610
And watching game developers
talk about game development

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.140
and seeing that sort of inside
baseball is for some reason

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.260
exciting to people.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.390
I don't know why,
but there's something

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:42.345
that people enjoy
tuning into about it.

00:47:42.345 --> 00:47:44.779
PROFESSOR: Anyone else
have comments, question?

00:47:44.779 --> 00:47:45.279
All right.

00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:47.179
Thank you so much for coming.

00:47:47.179 --> 00:47:48.220
SEAN BAPTISTE: All right.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.636
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:47:49.636 --> 00:47:50.413
Thanks, guys.

00:47:50.413 --> 00:47:52.686
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:53.185 --> 00:47:55.620
Good luck on your
projects this week.

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:57.550
I look forward to seeing them.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.110
PROFESSOR: Are you going to
be able to just stick around

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.090
for a little bit, or
you have to run off?

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:01.070
SEAN BAPTISTE: Yeah,
I'll be around.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:01.165
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:48:01.165 --> 00:48:02.990
So if anybody wants
to talk to him now,

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.010
feel free to come on
down and talk to him.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.760
We're going to break
for about 10 minutes.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.860
Come down and sign up.

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.030
Other thing I should
note-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:12.220
is coming today at around 2:30
to talk to some of the teams

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.890
if you want to talk to her.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:17.070
If you have burning
questions about your game

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:21.700
that you need to get answered by
one of our clients, she's here

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.910
and available to talk you.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:25.370
Otherwise, the rest the
class period is for yourself.

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:35.920
