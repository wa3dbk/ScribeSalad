00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.366
PROFESSOR: All right, so
today is the last of our guest

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.136
lectures before we
go into, what else?

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:27.636
Sorry.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.100
Not the last day.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.052
This is Monday, right?

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:32.028
AUDIENCE: It's Monday.

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:33.778
PROFESSOR: I'm already
feeling the crunch.

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:36.420
So we've got-- this is the
last week of guest lectures.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.836
Today, we've got Michael
Carrier and Jenna

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:44.270
Hostein talking to us about the
business of Indie development.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.080
They are representatives
from PD Game Collective.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.940
That happens-- they are a
group of people who make games

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.008
together over in Intrepid Labs?

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.984
And that's over which
[INAUDIBLE] building?

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:58.460
AUDIENCE: The American
Fine Building.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.725
PROFESSOR: The
American Fine Building.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:00:59.933
They'll talk more about that.

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.487
They often have open
lunch days and things

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:03.813
like that for students to come.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.150
So I'm sure they'll talk a
little bit about that as well.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.316
They will also be available
after the guest lecture.

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:09.960
If you want them
to play your game

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.655
and get some
feedback on your game

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.800
if your game is ready
to get more feedback,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.590
they can do that.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.542
It's again entirely optional.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:19.236
If you have a
build-- hopefully you

00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:21.436
do-- I'll allow you to
play briefly and get

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:22.915
some feedback from them.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:23.901
That's it.

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:26.220
So I'm going to hand
the stage over to them.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.681
JENNA HOSTEIN: Is
my audio working?

00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:31.180
We're good?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.090
All right.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.590
Hello.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.631
My name is Jenna Hostein.

00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.564
I'm the founder of
Little World Interactive,

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:37.980
and I'm a part of the Indie
Game Collective, as Rick said.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.990
We're about six or
seven blocks north,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.100
so we'd love to see you
guys either in the evenings,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.080
or we do Friday
lunch get-togethers.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.630
Michael can fill you in on that.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.004
He is more familiar with
the details than I am.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:52.420
But I am here to
talk to you today

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.006
about the business
of Indie development.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.380
If you're an Indie
developer, you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.270
can't get away from business.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.810
When I first started, I--
I am a designer by trade

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.400
and a developer by necessity,
and a business person dragged

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.699
kicking and screaming into it.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.532
It was really something
I was interested in.

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:13.370
It remains something that I'm
not super passionate about,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.345
but it's absolutely crucial
to have any level of success.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:18.470
So I'm going to talk to
you a little bit about what

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.560
the past couple
years have been like.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.420
So first, let's talk about
the realities of time

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.710
as an Indie developer.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.060
When I worked at
a larger studio,

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.100
I used to daydream about
what it would be like to work

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.280
as an Indie developer.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970
In those dreams,
it was me by myself

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.170
sitting at my desk just
working, and that, to me,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.760
was like this beautiful,
glorious manna from heaven.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.090
I just wanted to sit
and work on my game.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.160
So this was, naively,
my expectation

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.740
going into Indie
game development--

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.090
that this was going to my life.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.500
I actually found out,
that was not the truth.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.860
So there are events all of
the time in the game world.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.450
There's PAX east, PAX south,
PAX prime, PAX Australia.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.810
GEC, Indie K, Games for Change.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.462
I could probably list
five or ten more events

00:03:09.462 --> 00:03:10.420
off the top of my head.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.130
It's absolutely crucial
that you attend these

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.620
both as an attendee
just to network

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.400
and to exhibit your game.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.880
For example, PAX
prime this year,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.380
it took probably two,
three, maybe even four weeks

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.630
full time prepping for
that, attending that,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.540
and then coming down
from that and tying up

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.910
all the loose ends.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.120
So do not underestimate
the amount of time

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.980
that it takes to actually
attend a lot of these events.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.320
Marketing.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.220
Another thing that is
really not my favorite,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.850
but I think a lot
of Indie developers

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.680
have a tendency
to make their game

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.840
their beautiful
precious baby, and then

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.310
they throw it over the
fence and they say,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.380
am I a millionaire yet?

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.890
And that's just
not how it works.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.730
It's a constant ongoing
effort to make people aware

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.239
of your game, to make people
care at all about your game.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.030
Because guess what?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.680
You're one of
thousands and thousands

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.920
of developers who are doing
exactly the same thing.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.730
So this has to be a
constant ongoing effort

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.990
to rise above the noise.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.360
Communication internal.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.399
So I discovered very quickly
that I am terrible at art,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.220
I am terrible at sound, I
am terrible at marketing.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.501
So I brought in other
people to do these things.

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:25.000
And when you work
with other people,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.290
you have to talk to those other
people, so that takes time.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.530
Communication external.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.500
There is a huge Indie
game dev community,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.140
and if you're not taking
advantage of those folks

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.020
and really learning as
much as you can from them,

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.930
then you are doomed to fail.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.892
I saw somebody recently
who has been at Indie

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:44.480
for about a year
and a half, and he

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.150
was doing this-- where he was
sitting in his house very, very

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.490
insulated and he had
created a game that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.610
didn't look wildly interesting
and clearly had not gotten

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.730
input from almost anybody.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.170
He was working on his own engine
and it looked like something we

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.070
could have built in Unity in
probably a couple of weeks.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.140
So that, to me, was
clearly a failure

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.410
of just talking to other
Indies and learning

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.304
from them what they're
doing and their successes

00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:16.095
and their failures.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.970
QA and deployment.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.970
Learning how to do QA and
learning how to deploy

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.580
was another huge hurdle for
me, and this just takes time.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.890
I have released very,
very broken builds before,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.150
and you don't want to do that.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.337
So QA is a necessity.

00:05:32.337 --> 00:05:34.170
So this chart, to me,
is really interesting,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.190
because if you look at how
squashed that bottom bar has

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.980
gotten.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.800
I spend less than half of my
time actually making the game.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.100
And that's why I got into
this in the first place--

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.540
I just wanted to
make my own games.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.360
So this is the reality
of the situation.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.590
This is not a bad thing.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.070
This is just how it has
to be to have really

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.370
any level of success.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.360
So when I first-- I developed
The Counting Kingdom-- sorry,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.220
I totally forgot to
introduce myself.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.715
I made an educational
game for kids

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:03.420
called the Counting Kingdom.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.479
Just released for iOS
recently, also on Steam.

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.020
When I first budgeted out how
long I thought that would take,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.190
it was about six months.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.770
It ended up taking about a year.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.440
And if you take into
consideration this chart,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.165
I was right on, because
given I was only

00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:22.165
spending about half my
time working on the game,

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.740
it took twice as long as I
thought it was going to make.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.410
So now, whenever I try to
estimate how long something

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.200
will take, I take my gut
check and then I double it,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.267
and that's usually
pretty accurate.

00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.346
OK.

00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:35.220
So let's talk about
working with other folks.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.820
So I discovered
very, very quickly,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.270
I'm not particularly
good at art.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.270
I'm not particularly
good at sound.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.860
So I needed to bring
in other people

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.990
to compensate in these
areas that I was failing.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.880
So I work with six people
very, very part time.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.490
Luigi does art, Will does
PR, Sam does animation,

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.080
Jonas does sound effects.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.030
Brendan does music and Emma
does community management.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.510
And all of these people
were not just random people.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.570
At no point did I
put out something

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.120
into the world saying, I'm
looking for a community

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.990
manager-- get in touch.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.410
I would never do that.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.170
That sounds like a lot of
work and just a terrible way

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.200
to actually find somebody.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.980
So both Luigi and
Will are folks that I

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.080
met through the local
games community.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.530
Luigi did the art for
Girls Like Robots,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.010
and I basically stalked
him and tracked him down.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.850
I was like, whoever did this,
I need them to make my game.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.265
Fortunately, he
was a local guys,

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:30.110
and so I got to meet
him, talk to him

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.566
and discover that he was
a great for the team.

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.190
Both Sam and Jonas
were folks that were

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.780
recommended by people I trust.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.570
Sam was an intern that I
brought into a local university

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:50.180
and Jonas was somebody that had
sent in a great portfolio piece

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.015
to another company.

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:53.640
They were not able to hire him,
but they basically put the word

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.880
out saying, this audio
guy looks amazing.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.212
If anybody is looking
for an audio person,

00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.170
you should snap him up.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.090
So that's exactly what I did.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.360
Then Brendan and Emma are people
that I previously worked with.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.310
So the lesson to take away here
is, you have to be networking.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.100
All of these folks were either
people that I knew directly

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.690
or people that knew
somebody that I knew.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.450
As an Indie developer,
I have no time.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.730
We've discussed this at length.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.810
I literally have no time.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.480
I am working more
than full time,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.280
and so I cannot
micromanage somebody,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.770
I cannot be on somebody's ass
to make sure they're getting

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.836
their work done.

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:32.669
And so, when I bring
somebody into the team,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.850
it has to be somebody that
I trust to not only do work,

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.062
but to do amazing work and to be
able to do that independently.

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:42.645
So, for me, that means working
with folks that I already know,

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:44.730
that I already
trust, and with folks

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.480
that are highly recommended
to me by people that I trust.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.910
And nobody else.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.240
So if you're interested in
working with an Indie company,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.100
don't sit around waiting for
them to put out job requests.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.600
You need to be actively
trying to meet these folks.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.610
Network.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.360
So I want to talk a
little bit in detail

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.180
about what it means for
me to hire somebody.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.930
This is how I do it--
it's not necessarily

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.799
how everybody does it.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.340
When I bring somebody
in, I have them

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.080
sign a work for hire contract.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.910
That basically just means
that they do work, I pay them,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.730
and my company owns
the work that they do.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.520
I then create
separate schedules,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.430
and that's a tiny
one page document

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.290
that says, reference all that
other stuff in the contract.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.870
Here is what needs to be
done by the contractor.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.599
It needs to be
done by this date,

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:35.140
and here's what
they're getting paid.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.850
So it's a very, very
simple document.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.050
You can do the payment in
a couple of different ways.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.720
So when I first worked with
Luigi, who's our artist,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.960
we worked by bundles.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.670
So I would say, I need
this list of art assets.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.400
When do you think you
can get them to me,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.920
and what would be
a reasonable price?

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.128
And we would negotiate both
of those last two things.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:59.210
It was usually
three or four weeks,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.100
and we would put that
up in the schedule

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.190
and then he would go
off and do that work.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.810
Right now we've
switched to hourly,

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.226
just because it made sense
towards the end of the project,

00:10:08.226 --> 00:10:11.029
because I would be like, oh,
I need this one particular

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:13.070
tiny little thing that I
completely forgot about,

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.986
and that didn't make
sense to do entire bundle

00:10:14.986 --> 00:10:16.890
for like $20 worth of work.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.640
So we switched to hourly.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.660
It's also common to
do revenue share.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.680
That could be the
entirety of the payment,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.210
or that can be on top
of hourly payment.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.990
Really depends on who
you're working with

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.200
and what make sense for you.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.102
So this is just an
example-- oh my gosh, sorry.

00:10:33.102 --> 00:10:34.185
This set up automatically.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.090
Oops, there we go.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.680
OK.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.520
So this is an example of a
bundle that I did with Luigi.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.620
You can see it just
lists in detail

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.660
all of the tiny little things
that I needed at that point.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.980
So we ended up doing
four or five big bundles

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.590
and then swapped to hourly.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.620
This was about halfway
through the project,

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.750
so you can see some things
are on the first strap,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.640
like the world map.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.610
Some things are getting
a lot more detailed,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.230
like the level backgrounds.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.000
But this is it.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.500
A schedule is not
super complicated.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.710
It's just a list of
what needs to be done,

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.280
when it needs to
be done by, and how

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.865
a person's getting paid for it.

00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:17.730
The last thing I want to
talk about is the long tail.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.010
We have this idea, I
think, in Indie development

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.120
that you're launch day
needs to be your big day.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.020
Especially in mobile, you see
these graphs where it's like,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.550
launch day the rest of the time.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.320
Those graphs are super scary,
because it means if you're not

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.700
making a huge amount of
money on your launch day,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.440
you have absolutely no income.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.060
I think this is 100% the
wrong way to think about it.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.390
When I launched The
Counting Kingdom on Steam,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.650
it sold 35 copies on launch day.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.840
35 copies.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.290
I didn't think that was
possible for a Steam game

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:57.780
to sell that few
copies on launch day.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.020
So that blew my mind, and
I was kind of like, OK,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.570
I need to really rethink
what I'm doing here.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.880
And since then, it's sold well.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.860
It's sold steadily.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.050
I've sold a lot more than
35 copies since then.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.910
But I've had to really flip
my thinking about where

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.620
the money is being made.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.420
So the point here is, this
is not a business plan.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.860
Bullet point two has to be
a lot of different things

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.716
and it has to be over
a large span of time.

00:12:24.716 --> 00:12:26.340
So for The Counting
Kingdom, we started

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.120
on Steam and the Humble Store.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.890
We got into a Humble
Weekly bundle, which

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.900
was absolutely
phenomenal, and so far,

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.800
has been where the biggest chunk
of our money has come from.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.116
Just launched on iOS, and I'm
looking towards the future.

00:12:39.116 --> 00:12:40.990
There's a lot of different
things I could do.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.448
I'm considering
porting to Android,

00:12:42.448 --> 00:12:44.610
I'm considering trying
to get into schools.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.160
I'm also talking
with other companies

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.850
about potentially licensing
The Counting Kingdom

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.580
for various opportunities.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.810
This has to be ongoing.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.310
There's the work
of making the game,

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.570
and then there's the work of
making money from the game,

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.500
and those are two
separate things.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.550
That kind of sucks, but
it takes that much work

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.960
to actually make money from
something that you've already

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.310
poured your heart and soul into.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.340
But that's just the reality of
the business of making games.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.900
So this is frustrating,
but that's just

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.575
something that, again, is a
reality of being any developer.

00:13:18.575 --> 00:13:20.970
It's something you
have to be aware of.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.640
So that is all I have for you.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.300
And Michael, come on down.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.630
MICHAEL CARRIER: So my
name is Michael Carrier.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.690
I'm the founder of
Zap Dot, Inc. I also

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.200
am one of the co-leaders
of Boston Indies

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.130
and the founder of the
Indie Game Collective.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.790
It's a, as Rick mentioned,
a small group of studios

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.570
in the Cambridge area
that work together,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.800
and we do a lot of things to try
to help ensure that everybody

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.950
is doing some awesome work
and that our products are

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.429
coming out really pretty.

00:13:58.429 --> 00:13:59.970
Some of the projects
that I've worked

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.700
on-- so I started
off at Harmonics

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.470
and I worked on a
bunch of titles there.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.170
From there, I did
an apprenticeship

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.460
with an MIT alum, [INAUDIBLE]
on the game Fallen Frontier

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.430
after he left Bungee.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:21.400
I worked with the BBC and
a company out in west coast

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.780
called Pipeworks for
Dancing With The Stars

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.490
free to play online web game.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.124
I worked with some local Indies,
Alchemy Labs on Jack Lumber,

00:14:31.124 --> 00:14:33.290
and Dejobaan Studios in a
game called Drop That Beat

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.660
Like An Ugly Baby.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.530
Another contract gig for
me was, the bottom left,

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.840
it's called Culture
Shock, which was

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.310
a game that taught
people who are

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.740
being deployed to the Middle
East cultural awareness.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.350
This is really a cool game
for a group of neuroscientists

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.830
to try to prove
that games can help

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.830
people recover from concussions
effectively and efficiently.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.720
And my two current
projects, [INAUDIBLE],

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.200
which is some contract
work and Pleasant Dreams,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:09.760
which is a digital reboot of
a physical table top game.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:21.300
Out of these-- one
second-- out of these,

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.470
the top four were
employment, and then

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.650
Dancing With The Stars,
Culture Shock, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:34.620
and this neurologist
game were contract work.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.699
So what I'd like to
do is give everybody

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.490
a little bit of context
for the information

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.660
that we'll be
talking about today.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:48.320
There is a differentiation
between AAA and Indie.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.730
I would prefer not to
use that terminology.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.180
I want to talk about big
company versus small company.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.200
Main reason being, with the
tools that are out there today,

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.280
AAA and Indie used to be
a description of quality

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.650
or subject matter, and I
really think those lines

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.010
are becoming blurred.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.800
So talking about largest
to small company really

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.370
can encompass the
type of work that you

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:16.230
will be doing at those small
companies or big companies.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.440
Either way, the
direction that you take

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.870
is going to be
really challenging

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.760
for one reason or another.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.840
So if you work at
a larger company,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.790
it's really important for
you to have a vast amount

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.712
of domain knowledge.

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:31.920
It's going to be challenging,
because you're not only

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.366
competing with local
talent, but global talent.

00:16:34.366 --> 00:16:36.240
There are people from
all over the world that

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.020
want to work at these
companies, and these

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.100
are some of the
larger companies that

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.820
do hire and have hired
in the Boston area.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.990
But if you know the story
behind some of these companies,

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.330
there is a lot of
overturn as well.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.620
You end up having
people that come and go

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.280
and are laid off from project
to project just because

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.760
of the state of
the industry being

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:05.450
more of a project-based industry
that a long-term employment

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.589
type of industry.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.420
So not only are you competing
with people all over the world,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.711
but you're also competing
with really bright people who

00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:13.349
have had years and
years of experience

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.460
at companies like these.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.520
Smaller companies are
slightly different.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.220
You have smaller teams,
you have smaller budgets,

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.810
and you have to
do more with less.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.920
Typically, what you do is you
find people doing multiple jobs

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.017
to serve a lot of roles
and share the load

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:31.850
as much as they can.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.650
With both of these, both
small and big companies,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.210
the hours are long.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.930
People don't always
respect you for your work,

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.669
and unfortunately, the
pay isn't always great.

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:46.710
Typically, you will make
a fraction of the salary

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.950
that you'd make with the same
skill set outside the industry.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.480
But you know what?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.150
That doesn't faze me.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.140
I love the challenge.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.310
Games are a really crazy field.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.860
Video games haven't been around
in the public for 50 years,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.410
and it's an incredible
medium already.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.460
You want to think about
this-- the printing

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.160
press was released or invented
or became into mass use

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.190
in 1450.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:21.550
It's 564 years later, and now
we have global information

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.420
networks and we're complaining
about these e ink displays,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.640
at how bad they are or good they
are at displaying information

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.150
to us.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.150
The medium constantly changes
on how that is distributed.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.650
Just imagine where
games can go when

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:34.960
we are so young in this medium.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.810
So I'm really here to talk to
you today about contracting.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:47.130
It has served as my company's
primary method of revenue

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.880
over the past four years.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.330
So there are some really
great benefits of it.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.710
You get to work on
a ton of projects.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.470
You meet a lot of
people, and you learn

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.869
a lot about different things.

00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:01.160
If you're going to go back
and think about the projects

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.280
that I've worked
on, I got to work

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.090
on a free to play property
with a really big company who

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.762
had a huge marketing budget, and
it was really well-known name--

00:19:09.762 --> 00:19:10.720
Dancing With The Stars.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:14.420
A lot of people know that
TV show, or that property.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.810
In terms of brand
recognition, it's great.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.880
I got to work on a game
with some neurologists

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.920
and try to help
show that games have

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.790
positive impact in the world,
and that there are hopefully

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.900
ways, if the study does
come through positively,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.300
that we can help people
recover from concussions more

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.780
effectively.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.479
I got to work on a
game with the army.

00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:37.520
Despite what you may think
about our involvement,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.580
if we can help people learn how
to work with each other better,

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:44.639
I think that's a really
awesome thing to be a part of.

00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:46.930
Now I'm getting to a point
where people are approaching

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.280
me to consult them for the
experience and knowledge

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.367
that I've gained over the course
of the past four to six years

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:53.950
that I've been in
the industry so far.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.936
So one thing to keep in
mind, is that the great thing

00:19:59.936 --> 00:20:02.560
about consulting and contracting
is that there is a ton of work

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.470
out there.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.469
There are plenty of people
with ideas and money,

00:20:06.469 --> 00:20:08.760
but they don't necessarily
have the skill or experience

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.000
to be able to bring
that to fruition.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.170
Or their ideas were
a bit too large,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.670
and they need some
more people to be

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.790
able to make those
ideas come to life.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.406
Sometimes, they just decided
they want to bring someone in

00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:23.780
to help them out
with the project

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780
that they're working on.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.910
I would also argue
that contracting,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.380
once you get into
the rhythm of it,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.610
is a very stable way to
make a long-term living

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.230
in this industry.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.850
From what I've been
doing by contracting,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.130
I'm expecting and
anticipating the project

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.220
to project work that the
industry typically creates.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.260
With the network that I've
been able to create for myself,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.710
I actually feel
very stable that I

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.820
will be able to find
something that someone will

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.270
be able to recommend me for
whenever a project ends if I

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.270
decide to keep contracting.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:03.170
Ultimately, though, my goal is
not to do contracting forever.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.800
The reason why I
created Zap Dot was

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.939
because I wanted to make
and release my own games.

00:21:08.939 --> 00:21:10.730
When I started off, it
was important for me

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.730
to start generating some
revenue for the company

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.010
so that I could
hire people who were

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:18.470
worth the-- to bring people
because they were worth it.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.970
I wanted to be able to pay them.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.820
So after the past
four or five years,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.426
I've been able to gain enough
capital for the company

00:21:25.426 --> 00:21:26.800
where Zap Dot will
actually start

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.883
working on its own titles.

00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:32.570
So I figured I would talk a
little bit about the contract

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:33.810
life cycle.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.730
Very much like
Jenna said, events

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.650
are super, super important.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.880
So you'll go to industry events
or you'll go to local meetups,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.860
and there are a ton of
options, especially just

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.040
in the Boston area alone.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.770
And you network and
you get to meet people.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.610
The best advice that I can
offer you when you're networking

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:54.530
is, to not network for yourself,
but network for others.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.290
Find ways to make introductions
between different people.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.454
Find ways to get jobs
for other people.

00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:01.870
The way that I've been able
to get such an awesome network

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.180
that I have right now is by
getting other people jobs.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.990
In doing so, everybody
comes-- a lot of people

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.400
will come to me now
for advice or when

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.150
they have a project
that needs to be done.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.280
So I become a holder
of information

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.790
in terms of the projects
that are available,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.090
which, when my company wants
to pick one of those, I have,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:23.220
essentially, the pick
of the litter for it.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.289
Also, it's really good to
continually help people also

00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:28.580
find stability in the industry.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.860
To illustrate that,
the first job I got

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.340
was because I had a conversation
in a floral shop when

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.350
I was buying some flowers
for my girlfriend.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.880
The second job was based
of a recommendation,

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.920
and the third job was also
based on a recommendation.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.184
Another job was checking the
Boston Indies email list.

00:22:48.184 --> 00:22:50.100
And the most recent job,
someone approached me

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:51.475
about doing the
work because they

00:22:51.475 --> 00:22:56.250
had heard that I deliver
on time and my work

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.895
is pretty high quality.

00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:01.930
So let's say you
do find someone.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.590
You find someone and you
want to do work with them,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.850
or they want work being done.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.250
So what you do is, you do
this really weird dance

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.090
with the client and you
talk to them for a bit

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.814
about what kind of
work they want to do

00:23:13.814 --> 00:23:15.230
and what kind of
project they want

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.480
to work on, why they want
to involve you in it,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.620
and why you should be
involved in their project.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.310
You either become really
scared about the expectations

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.280
that they have or the money that
they have to be able to spend,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.910
or you'll fall in
love with them,

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.240
or there'll be some
in-between where

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.130
this is a good calculated
decision for you

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.925
or your company, and it
makes sense to do it.

00:23:37.925 --> 00:23:39.550
From there, you take
those expectations

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.580
and you put them down to paper.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.870
Contracts are really,
really important.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.320
Never do any work or have
anybody do any work for you

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.330
unless you have them sign
some sort of contract.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.060
Essentially, what these
contracts you do is,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.450
they should manage expectations
for both you and the person

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:58.390
doing work.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.390
What happens when something
goes wrong on either end?

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.320
Be very careful with things
like non-disclosure agreements

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.040
or non-competes.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.260
I prefer to have all
non-competes written out

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.530
of contracts that I have signed.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.800
I've heard of other people
asking for multiples

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.410
of their time because the
customer wanted the non-compete

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.907
to stick.

00:24:22.907 --> 00:24:25.240
One other really important
thing to remember, especially

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.615
when you're doing
contracting is,

00:24:26.615 --> 00:24:29.410
you have the opportunity to fire
a client as much as they have

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.650
the opportunity to fire you.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.067
If people start
going off contract

00:24:34.067 --> 00:24:36.316
and they start requesting
things that they didn't have

00:24:36.316 --> 00:24:38.820
and they're not following the
rules that you've established

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.200
between your relationship,
then understand that you do

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.080
have the right to get out
of it if it goes sour.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.740
So you've signed the contract.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.830
Now you just need
to make the game.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.770
Then after you make
the game, you get paid.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.570
Jenna mentioned a bunch of
different types of payment.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.440
You can do hourly
rates-- I've done that.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.330
You can do milestone payments
where you agree, typically,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.604
on two to four weeks of work.

00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:06.020
You deliver that
work, and as long

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.780
as it is of acceptable
quality, the client

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.760
will accept it and then
you the amount of money

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.930
that you've worked on.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.150
Or you can do a full
fee for a project.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.659
I've done all three.

00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:19.700
I would definitely caution
against doing full fee

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.860
for projects, just because--
especially if you're

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.370
a perfectionist or the
client starts trying

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.130
to add more things-- scope
can creep up over time

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.640
and you-- well, typically
for a full project fee,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.330
unless you're very, very good
about your time management,

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.580
you'll end up doing more work
than what you charged for.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.500
Sometimes you'll find
out that you need help.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.540
Well, the cycle kind
of starts again.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.170
You've gone to these
events that you people.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.320
You do a little dance
with them to make sure

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.320
that they kind of fit
the situation for them.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.300
If you find someone that you
want to be able to work with,

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.621
you write up a contract.

00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:57.120
You set up expectations
for the work

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.280
that they will be coming
on to help you with.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.870
And now, as an
employer of some sort,

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.780
you have to worry about
managing two people.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.070
Not only are you
managing yourself

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.480
and the work that you are
delivering to a client,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.120
you're making sure that
your contractor or employee

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.460
is doing the same thing,
that the client's happy.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.340
Depending on how
many people you add,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.326
it can take a lot of your time.

00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:17.700
Over the past
couple of projects,

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.400
I have hired help or outsourced
some work for the projects

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.150
that I've done.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.660
I've been able to
hire about five

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.590
to six people-- not all at once,
and not all for the same thing.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.760
But some of the work that
I've had people come in for

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.315
has branched from a couple
hours to a monthly milestones

00:26:36.315 --> 00:26:38.043
that I've paid
people to work on.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.644
One really important thing
is that, with contracting,

00:26:45.644 --> 00:26:47.560
especially if you're
running your own company,

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.140
there are a lot of other
responsibilities that you have.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.950
There are taxes that you
need to worry about paying.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:57.610
Stuff that normally would be
done if you were an employee

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.126
is not your responsibility.

00:27:00.126 --> 00:27:02.000
There are definitely a
lot of different laws,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.041
especially in Massachusetts,
about hiring people.

00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:06.094
You need to be very
careful that you

00:27:06.094 --> 00:27:08.010
are treating your
contractors like contractors

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:08.800
and not employees.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.560
Otherwise, you should be
providing those employees

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.059
benefits.

00:27:14.121 --> 00:27:15.620
And then that's
also the same thing,

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.235
to make sure that the
people that are hiring you

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:18.609
are treating you
like an employee

00:27:18.609 --> 00:27:21.610
or expecting you to
act like an employee.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.010
So make sure that you
pay attention to the work

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.520
that you're doing and
really round yourself out

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.140
on the rules and
regulations around work.

00:27:32.451 --> 00:27:32.950
That's it.

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:37.040
So I wanted to open the
floor for Jenna and I

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.180
to let you jump in and
talk about any questions.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:46.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.415
MICHAEL CARRIER: Yes?

00:27:47.415 --> 00:27:48.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.470
So do you have any advice
for marketing new games?

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.165
Because I think that's a thing
that a lot of [INAUDIBLE] how

00:27:54.165 --> 00:27:58.195
do you promote your product
and where do you do it?

00:27:58.195 --> 00:27:59.570
JENNA HOSTEIN: So
I've been doing

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.227
a lot of ongoing social media.

00:28:01.227 --> 00:28:03.310
We have a Little World
Interactive Twitter account

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.620
and Facebook page.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:10.450
A lot of it depends very much on
the type of game you're making.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.434
The best approach to it is
a slow drip type of thing.

00:28:13.434 --> 00:28:14.975
You don't get a week
away from launch

00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:18.640
and go, OK, time to market this.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.550
One thing that I've seen
work very successfully is,

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.480
we have somebody else
working in the IGC who's

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.300
creating a first
person dodge ball game,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.130
and it's just wacky and fun.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.520
So he's had huge success on
Reddit and with Live Streamer.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.310
So he's an early
access, but he's already

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.630
been very, very
successful because he's

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.980
been able to tap into
those communities.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.970
It's a lot of, what
companies can you tap into?

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.650
How do you reach those folks?

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:48.330
Then going to as many events
as you can afford slash

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.570
have time to.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:54.000
In the past year, I've
exhibited at probably

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.440
a dozen different events-- some
really big, some really small.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.510
But that has been crucial
to meeting players in person

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.530
and also to meeting
the journalists

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.200
that attend those
events as well.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.750
So definitely
approach it as a very

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.390
ongoing got to put in a little
bit of effort every week

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.280
type thing.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.050
MICHAEL CARRIER: Yeah.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.320
Marketing should be a role
on itself on your project.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.360
So very many people
will leave it

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.640
towards the end, like Jenna
mentioned in her talk,

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.020
or not do it all and just
kind of expect people

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.147
to flock to your game
after you've released it.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.242
The other thing is, also as
Jenna mentioned in her talk,

00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:33.700
is that marketing
is something that

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.990
needs to start before
your project has launched

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.930
and continue after
it has launched.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.780
The more you can
kind of interweave it

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.210
into your game and the
entire development process,

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.669
the better it will be, the
more people will know about.

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:54.710
The objective is just to
get the most people know

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.080
about your title as possible.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.690
JENNA HOSTEIN: And to add one
last thing to that-- the way

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.390
that I try to
approach social media

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.130
is to give people something
that they're excited to share.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:05.817
So if you're just like, the
game's still on the store--

00:30:05.817 --> 00:30:08.150
nobody's going to care about
that tweet or that Facebook

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.030
post.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.450
But we do a lot of
cute little cartoons

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.260
of the characters from
the game, share a lot

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.020
of reviews, a lot
of testimonials

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.730
from parents and teachers.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:22.600
The NASA online
presence is phenomenal.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.000
If you want to see how
to do social media well,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.200
follow the NASA Twitter feed.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.849
It's seriously
astonishingly good.

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:31.390
They just did
something the other day

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.250
where they have a new upcoming
mission called Orion, I think.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.270
And they did the ABCs of Orion.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.660
So they did 26 tweets-- one for
each letter-- and each tweet

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.630
had this beautiful graphic
image of like, A for-- I

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.400
don't remember, I didn't
look it at all of them.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.220
But it was very, very clever.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.860
I ended up re-tweeting
the letters, S-P-A-C-E,

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.140
just because that
made me feel clever.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.620
But they got me to re-tweet
five of their tweets.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.600
That's a win for them.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.470
So little things like that,
you have to think about,

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.790
what content can you
make that other people

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.830
are going to be really excited
to share with their networks?

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.630
Yes?

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.650
AUDIENCE: What's the
street off of [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.820
and Massachusetts right now?

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.910
I know that there was some
stuff going to state legislature

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.580
about whether that's
actually enforceable.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.730
MICHAEL CARRIER: Sure.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.880
I've heard about that.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.950
I don't think it's
completely unenforceable yet.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.425
I don't think that
that's passed to make

00:31:33.425 --> 00:31:34.550
non-competes unenforceable.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.946
AUDIENCE: So there's debate?

00:31:35.946 --> 00:31:36.863
MICHAEL CARRIER: Yeah.

00:31:36.863 --> 00:31:39.196
JENNA HOSTEIN: Yeah, that's
a really good point, though.

00:31:39.196 --> 00:31:42.170
You have to look very carefully
at any contracts that you sign.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.040
A lot of companies will put
wording in there-- well,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.710
studios will put
wording in there

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.650
that they own anything you
make regardless of whether you

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.682
make it at work or at home.

00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:53.140
So especially if
you're someone who

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.850
likes working on side projects,
that can be very dangerous.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.226
So just something
to be aware of.

00:31:59.226 --> 00:32:00.600
MICHAEL CARRIER:
Especially ideas

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.076
that you've come up with during
working on their project.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.770
There can be a large--
the more vague they are,

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.882
the more dangerous it is to you.

00:32:18.256 --> 00:32:20.686
AUDIENCE: We have
another question.

00:32:20.686 --> 00:32:23.620
AUDIENCE: Have either of you
worked with either state grants

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.720
or small business
grants-- organizations

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:33.040
that basically give money
for help for new companies?

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.484
What's the experience
like working some projects

00:32:36.484 --> 00:32:37.781
if you have?

00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:39.030
JENNA HOSTEIN: I have not yet.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.490
That's something I'm actively
looking into for the next game.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.990
The thing that's
holding me back is,

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.024
it looks like a lot of work in
a subject area I don't know.

00:32:47.024 --> 00:32:48.440
I don't know how
to write a grant,

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.310
so that's something I would have
to learn for a shot at money.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:58.880
So that's what's had we
not pursue that so far.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.530
I'm going to be looking into
education-specific grants,

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.113
which I think I would just have
a better shot at, because it's

00:33:04.113 --> 00:33:05.510
a more narrow field.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.420
But-- not yet, but maybe.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.120
MICHAEL CARRIER: The
neuroscientist game

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.350
that I worked on
was funded in part,

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:18.140
I think, by a grant
of the National

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.530
Institute of Health-- NIH.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.363
AUDIENCE: I got you.

00:33:22.152 --> 00:33:23.610
JENNA HOSTEIN:
Yeah, and I've heard

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.320
of a few Indies who are
working with institutions

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.150
who have gotten grant money.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.780
But I don't know
of too many Indies

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.650
who have gotten grant money on
their own in the United States.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.850
So other countries like
Canada and Australia--

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.850
though, I think, Australia--
maybe not anymore--

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.840
how government-funded
grants for the arts,

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.816
so they include games in that.

00:33:42.816 --> 00:33:45.510
But we do not, unfortunately.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.411
I would love some
government money.

00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:49.660
AUDIENCE: How common is it
for studios to be acquired,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.500
and is that something
they target?

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.400
MICHAEL CARRIER: So
I would say, it's

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.065
uncommon at a smaller level.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.690
Definitely, the way that you're
going to make money as a studio

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:05.400
is not from an exit
strategy of being

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.630
purchased by a larger company.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.560
It's more along the
lines of the revenue

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.560
that you'll be making
from either your contracts

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.993
or the profits from your game.

00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:18.159
That being said, some
companies have been purchased.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.440
I know one of the
other subcontractors

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.989
I worked with Dancing With The
Stars was purchased by a larger

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:26.070
company.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.570
I know that Amazon has purchased
a few game companies when

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.960
they were launching the
Kindle to try to bring games

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.460
in for their platform.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:42.059
So it's not impossible, but it's
definitely not an exit strategy

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:43.600
that most people
would start a studio

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.969
with the expectation of having.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:46.760
JENNA HOSTEIN: Yeah,
and there's definitely

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.870
a group of Indie studios
who are generally

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.409
between 6 to 12 people and
they have an actual CEO

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.350
who can go out and raise money.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.520
Those are Indie in
the sense that they're

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.140
small and self-owned and
independently publishing,

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.690
but it's kind of a
different class of Indie,

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.420
because they can be raising
potentially millions of dollars

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.380
to fund their games.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.296
So those are the types
of companies that would

00:35:12.296 --> 00:35:14.310
be most likely to be purchased.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.360
Little Worlds Interactive
is just me and my games,

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.360
and so if somebody were
to purchase my company,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.820
they would just be
hiring me, basically,

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.450
and like, purchasing my games.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.620
So that's probably not something
that's going to happen,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.837
though it's not
unheard of entirely.

00:35:33.837 --> 00:35:35.920
MICHAEL CARRIER: And I
guess a tangential approach

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.710
that you could have-- that
is, actually taking your games

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.650
and licensing them out
for other properties.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.452
Yes?

00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:47.100
AUDIENCE: How long were
you guys in the industry

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.910
before starting to
do your own thing?

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.290
JENNA HOSTEIN: So I
was in the industry

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.850
for-- it depends
on what you count.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.370
So, grad school for two years
and working for four years,

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.717
and then I've been
an Indie for two.

00:35:59.717 --> 00:36:01.300
MICHAEL CARRIER: I
worked at Harmonics

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:06.170
for just under two years before
I started doing consulting.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:12.190
The Culture Shock game was
my first project out of it.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:14.440
JENNA HOSTEIN: A lot of
people-- just to add onto that

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.710
and then look at you up
there-- a lot of people

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.090
go straight from
undergrad to Indie,

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.090
and that's a totally
valid approach.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.090
But there is also so much
to be learned in a studio.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.760
Even if that is not
your ideal environment--

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.470
it certainly wasn't for
me-- but I regularly

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.010
use things that I learned in
my time working at a studio.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:39.040
So I wouldn't necessarily
recommend just

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.180
going directly Indie
straight from undergrad.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.430
MICHAEL CARRIER: And this
is part of a different talk,

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:48.550
but-- I didn't go into that.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.387
But it's a bad idea,
just because there

00:36:50.387 --> 00:36:52.470
are a lot of mistakes that
you'll make on your own

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.761
that you could have learned
from a larger company who's

00:36:54.761 --> 00:36:57.600
already made those mistakes
and can teach you better ways.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.433
Not that they'll have
all the right answers,

00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:04.180
but-- and it's not to say
that you won't be successful

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.030
if you were to do it
right out of school.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.752
It's just much harder to hit.

00:37:08.752 --> 00:37:10.676
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering, Jenna--

00:37:10.676 --> 00:37:14.374
what did you work on
before you became an Indie?

00:37:14.374 --> 00:37:16.207
What were you doing,
or what was grad school

00:37:16.207 --> 00:37:17.900
and then after that experience?

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.316
JENNA HOSTEIN: So
after undergrad,

00:37:19.316 --> 00:37:22.180
I worked at a local startup
called Hangout Industries

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.930
and we were making one of the
original 3D virtual worlds.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:31.610
So it was meant to be a social
chill place for teen girls.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.636
It crashed and burned hard.

00:37:33.636 --> 00:37:35.510
Most of the lessons I
learned at that company

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.770
were how not to do the
things we were trying to do,

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:39.810
which is valuable.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.250
Which is a very valuable lesson.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.985
So then I went to
Indiana University

00:37:42.985 --> 00:37:45.900
and got my master's
degree in game design,

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.780
and then came back here and
worked at Stomp Games, which

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.390
was formerly Tencent Boston.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:55.850
We did Robot Rising-- and
that was a diablo-esque game

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.580
with robots on Facebook.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.420
So I've kind of bounced
all over the place.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.350
I've made mobile titles,
I've made Facebook titles.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:05.830
I had an internship at Turbines
where I've worked on MMOs.

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.710
And like I was saying before,
that experience really

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.880
has just given me a breadth
of knowledge that I've

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.590
been able to apply to Indies.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.404
AUDIENCE: So a number
of the other people

00:38:15.404 --> 00:38:17.172
we brought into class
were talking a little bit

00:38:17.172 --> 00:38:18.550
about the internships
that they had

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.758
[INAUDIBLE] larger companies.

00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:21.430
Can you talk a little
bit about-- so you

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.657
mentioned you used an intern
for your process, Jenna.

00:38:24.657 --> 00:38:26.970
I forget if you
mentioned [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.270
MICHAEL CARRIER: I have
not used interns yet,

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.607
but it's something that
I am very excited about.

00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:33.190
AUDIENCE: So can you
talk a little bit

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.915
about how it works
for your small studio

00:38:34.915 --> 00:38:36.290
and what the
experiences might be

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.998
for being an intern
at one of you studios

00:38:37.998 --> 00:38:39.167
compared to a larger studio?

00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:40.000
JENNA HOSTEIN: Sure.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.500
So the intern that I
worked with was Sam.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.710
He was an animator, and he went
to school at a local animation

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.640
school, I don't remember
what it was called--

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.680
and I knew one of
the teachers there.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.160
As part of their
graduate requirements--

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.370
I think they called
it a co-op-- they just

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.240
needed to put in a
certain number of hours

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.345
with a local studio.

00:39:00.345 --> 00:39:01.970
The expectation was
that it was unpaid,

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.590
because they were basically
getting course credit for it.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.400
So for me, it was a
risk-free situation.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.027
Like, basically, I could get
somebody to do art for me

00:39:11.027 --> 00:39:13.360
for free, but they were getting
something out of it too,

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.901
so I didn't have to
feel too horribly

00:39:14.901 --> 00:39:16.670
guilty about not paying them.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.210
And it worked out phenomenally.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.960
So one of the big
differences with working

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.280
with an Indie versus
a large studio

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.870
is that, I basically
said to him,

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.250
I need animation in my game.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.640
If you could do that,
please, that would be great.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.320
So he did all of the animation
in The Counting Kingdom,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.630
first as an internship, and
then as a paid contractor

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.420
down the road.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.510
So he got a massive
amount of responsibility.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.680
The only door art direction
I gave him was, like,

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.710
make it cute, but also scary a
little bit, but not too scary.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.220
So he had just a huge
amount of creative control.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.820
The downside to that was,
we all worked remotely,

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:56.942
and so I saw him maybe
once every couple of weeks.

00:39:56.942 --> 00:39:58.400
But we stayed in
touch to make sure

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.160
that he knew what was
going on, I was going on.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.710
So at a larger
studio, he would have

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.430
more face-to-face
experience, but be

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.860
working on a much
smaller slice of the pie.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.030
Given that Indie
budgets are zero,

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.141
basically, I would not be able
to bring in a paid internship

00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:15.640
intern.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.510
As much as I would like to,
it's just not a reality.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.590
If I'm paying
somebody money, I have

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:23.690
to know that they are
going to be able to produce

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:25.390
incredibly high quality work.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.100
So unless you're
very, very cheap

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.160
and you already have an
astonishingly good portfolio,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.312
it's not something I can afford.

00:40:33.312 --> 00:40:35.520
MICHAEL CARRIER: I would
say one of the major reasons

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.940
why we haven't brought
in-- why Zap Dot hasn't

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.770
brought in any interns right
now is for the same reason.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.890
I would want to try
to pay something,

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:47.760
and I've not been able
to be in a position

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.730
where I could bring
someone in to give them

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.090
a specific set of tasks
to be able to work,

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.900
or to have a project that
is ready to do research

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.770
and development.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:02.990
I think one thing that
is great for interns

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.820
that I'm very interested
in is actually

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:09.030
having them do prototypes to
test ideas that the company has

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.724
for future plans and to
get a good feel for that.

00:41:12.724 --> 00:41:14.140
Because I think
it could encompass

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.681
lot of things that are great
for interns-- being able to have

00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:18.740
a project, being able
to deliver on things,

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:21.510
and then also being
able to have something

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.180
that may have some
progress going forward

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.430
in a project that is released.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:26.971
JENNA HOSTEIN: That
being said, a lot

00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:29.390
of times, we think about
internships as kind of an all

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.510
or nothing type thing.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:33.070
But a lot of us
could use somebody

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:36.320
a couple of hours a week to help
out with things here or there.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.930
So if you genuinely are looking
for the experience-- and again,

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.969
I hate not paying people--
but if you do just

00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:45.010
want some experience
working with an Indie studio

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.262
and you're willing to give just
a couple hours a week, come

00:41:48.262 --> 00:41:48.970
to Boston Indies.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.970
Comes to Boston Unity Group
where we're all there.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.090
Come talk about the projects
you're interested in

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.030
and where you might be
interested in helping.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.820
MICHAEL CARRIER: And those
things can turn into paid work

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.240
as well, as Jenna's intern did.

00:42:04.537 --> 00:42:06.421
PROFESSOR: Any last questions?

00:42:06.421 --> 00:42:07.762
Three or four.

00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:09.762
AUDIENCE: So both of you
are located at the IGC,

00:42:09.762 --> 00:42:13.680
but the impression I'm getting
is that not all the people

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.718
you work with are physically
in the IGC [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:17.718 --> 00:42:19.972
Can we talk about
how you balance that?

00:42:19.972 --> 00:42:22.065
And I guess [INAUDIBLE]
the whole communications

00:42:22.065 --> 00:42:28.639
part of it, but what does that
work flow look like with some

00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:30.347
of your people right
next to you and some

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.993
of those people on Skype?

00:42:31.993 --> 00:42:32.993
JENNA HOSTEIN: Go ahead.

00:42:32.993 --> 00:42:34.917
MICHAEL CARRIER: Want
me to go for that one?

00:42:34.917 --> 00:42:37.569
JENNA HOSTEIN: Go ahead.

00:42:37.569 --> 00:42:39.110
MICHAEL CARRIER:
Many of the projects

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.300
that I've done have
been remote work.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.470
When I was doing
Dancing With The Stars,

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:45.010
that was a bunch of people.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.270
So New Hampshire,
Oregon and Florida.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.180
Jack Lumber was
Manitoba, Canada.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.470
Then my apartment,
and then Alex's

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.470
apartment as well, before
we had the opportunity

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:00.717
to work together.

00:43:00.717 --> 00:43:03.050
Typically what you need when
you're working remotely is,

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.990
you need a couple of things that
are set in stone, essentially.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.534
You need a schedule, you need
deadlines that people actually

00:43:08.534 --> 00:43:11.075
make, and you need to make sure
that you have the people that

00:43:11.075 --> 00:43:13.470
are working on those projects
be very, very good at time

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.010
management in the sense that
they know they have work to do.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.110
They don't necessarily need to
have co-workers working around

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.090
them.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:25.960
So what you find is, you find
a lot of tools being reused.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.910
So Google Docs for
shared collaboration,

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:35.010
Trello for task management,
and then Skype for group chats,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:35.530
I think.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.030
Or Google-- we've done
Google Hangouts as well

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.906
for different projects.

00:43:39.906 --> 00:43:41.280
But essentially,
having something

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.910
that allows the team to
communicate with each other

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.490
and knowing what
the expectations

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:48.260
are throughout the project.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.300
Especially when the
contracting work is remote.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.360
Like, I'm going to do the work
because I want to get paid.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.860
I guess it's just
a matter of making

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.980
sure you have really good work
ethic and a schedule that you

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.654
stick to or update
as things change.

00:44:01.654 --> 00:44:03.070
JENNA HOSTEIN:
Yeah, it definitely

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.720
varies from person to person.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.990
But having the right tools
to make your life easier

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.570
is crucial.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.280
So I'm on Skype all the time,
and I also use BitTorrent Sync,

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.280
I think is what it's
called-- where basically, I

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.550
have a shared folder
with my contractors.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.907
Any time they update a
file on their computer,

00:44:18.907 --> 00:44:20.240
it'll be updated on my computer.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.820
So it's just a
very, very easy way

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.549
make sure we have the most
recently updated files,

00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:26.090
and don't have to
keep renaming them,

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.266
like, final-- final two--
final, really final.

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:30.640
It just keeps all
nice and clear.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.534
So having the right tools--
just as a few examples,

00:44:33.534 --> 00:44:34.950
because that'll
probably be easier

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.860
talk about with Luigi, who
is the artist-- we would

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.530
sit down and talk either
in person or on Skype

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:43.265
before every new big major task.

00:44:43.265 --> 00:44:45.390
That made sure that we were
both on the right page.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.410
We both had a similar
thing in our heads,

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.880
and any design requirements,
I was able to specify.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.090
He was able to ask questions
about some of the things

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.660
I would forget about.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.990
So making sure you have those
regular face-to-face check-ins

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.450
every time you're starting
something new is crucial.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:06.470
Emma, who is my social media
guru, works four hours a week

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.720
and she basically keeps our
Twitter and Facebook pages

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.300
updated.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.660
We check in regularly, if
there are any sort of campaigns

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.660
that I want to kick off.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.652
But part of the reason
I brought her on board

00:45:16.652 --> 00:45:18.860
is because every time I
would sit down with a Twitter

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.950
account, I'd be like, I have no
idea what I'm supposed to say.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.950
Like, still working on the game.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.450
And so her job is to come
up with creative ways

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:29.200
to be like, just a reminder,
the game is still out there

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.470
and you should purchase it!

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.930
In a way, it sounds
like something people

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.760
should be excited about.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.890
So her job really is to
work a little bit more

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.174
independently and come up
with that stuff on her own,

00:45:39.174 --> 00:45:41.090
but then there are some
times, like, I totally

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.864
want to steal this
NASA ABCs thing--

00:45:43.864 --> 00:45:45.530
and so I'm going to
talk to her about it

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.470
and plan that out and
put that together.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.197
So she does a lot
of independent work,

00:45:49.197 --> 00:45:51.280
but then any major projects,
we check in for that.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.124
MICHAEL CARRIER: Not
steal-- appropriate.

00:45:53.124 --> 00:45:54.040
JENNA HOSTEIN: Borrow.

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.540
Borrow.

00:45:58.549 --> 00:46:00.340
PROFESSOR: Thank you
so much for your time.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.381
JENNA HOSTEIN: All right.

00:46:01.381 --> 00:46:02.204
Thank you.

00:46:02.204 --> 00:46:05.225
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:05.225 --> 00:46:07.725
PROFESSOR: You can go ahead and
keep the microphone on, just

00:46:07.725 --> 00:46:08.800
in case.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.577
So we've got a
five minute break.

00:46:11.577 --> 00:46:13.910
Come back down here and sign
in if you haven't signed in

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.780
for class yet.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.030
They're available to play
your games if you are

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.260
ready for that sort of thing.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:23.950
So if you are, find them,
bring them to your computer,

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.094
and have them play.

00:46:25.094 --> 00:46:27.510
MICHAEL CARRIER: We'll leave
a bunch of our business cards

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.490
up here.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.390
If you want to send a
portfolio, a resume,

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.134
just get some feedback,
please feel free.

00:46:32.134 --> 00:46:33.800
I'll answer any email
that comes my way.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.070
PROFESSOR: And I'm going
to email this out to them,

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.970
I haven't done it
yet, but there's

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.390
a party coming up, right?

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.820
MICHAEL CARRIER: Yes.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.570
PROFESSOR: Can you mention that?

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:39.486
MICHAEL CARRIER: Yeah.

00:46:39.486 --> 00:46:41.090
The Indie Game
Collective-- there's

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.381
actually two parties coming up.

00:46:42.381 --> 00:46:43.990
PROFESSOR: Mention both.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:45.740
MICHAEL CARRIER: The
Indie Game Collective

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:50.280
is having a party at the
Aeronaut Brewery in Somerville.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.030
It's in between
Porter and Union.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.660
It is on December 11, starts
at 5:30, goes until 11:30.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.457
It's Thursday, so
you'll probably

00:46:59.457 --> 00:47:01.082
have to leave a little
early so you can

00:47:01.082 --> 00:47:03.550
get to class early on Friday.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:07.282
But the-- ah, no one
laughed, even politely.

00:47:07.282 --> 00:47:09.490
AUDIENCE: I think that's
after the last day of class.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:10.490
MICHAEL CARRIER: Oh, OK.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:11.800
Cool.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.220
So the collective is
doing a bunch of art

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.910
and interactive installations.

00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:19.950
It's games that are
not our own games,

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.450
but they're just
fun things that we

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.090
wanted to make for
the sake of art,

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:27.070
not necessarily making money.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:32.390
Bit Fest Boston will also have
20 old school arcade cabinets

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.660
there.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:39.640
We will have a funk
band and a food truck

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.660
that has gluten-free, vegan, and
non-alcoholic options as well.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.930
On the Monday following, which
I think is December 15th,

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:54.260
Boston Indies is having
their holiday festivus

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.070
where people will be
just playing games.

00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:58.714
It'll be some
local Indies who'll

00:47:58.714 --> 00:48:00.380
be demoing some games
that they've made,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.470
but we'll also just be
playing really fun games

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.800
like JS Joust or Hokra.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.700
Jenna did an Artemis
game last year.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.577
So who knows what type of
table top or digital games

00:48:10.577 --> 00:48:11.160
will be there?

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.410
But it'll be a lot of fun too.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:18.240
And that's going to be-- that
is in the new Bocoup office.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:20.260
Go to bostonindies.com
and join the community

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.180
in terms of finding out
more information about that.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:24.550
I'll be sending it out shortly.

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.470
PROFESSOR: Thanks.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.860
So take five minutes.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:32.526
2:05, 2:10 we're going
to take that thing away.

00:48:32.526 --> 00:48:34.005
All right?

00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:35.748
[CHATTER]
