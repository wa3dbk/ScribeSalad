00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:22.160
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.660
So I am really happy to
say that we've got SWERY.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.520
Do you go with SWERY or Swery65?

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.472
SWERY: SWERY please.

00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:30.180
PROFESSOR: SWERY.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.340
Swery65's Twitter.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.540
Your Twitter account.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.324
SWERY: Yes.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:34.490
INTERPRETER: So a developer.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.220
He's visiting us from Japan,
visiting for the Video Game

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.173
Orchestra, which Shota-- is
he in the room right now?

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:42.860
SHOTA: I'm here.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.210
PROFESSOR: There he is-- is
organizing that orchestra.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.549
They're playing tomorrow.

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:47.090
That's right?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.220
Yeah.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.020
So we sent you
the code for that.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.990
So please, if you're
interested in attending,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.775
please do attend that.

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:53.608
It'll be really fun.

00:00:53.608 --> 00:00:56.030
They'll be playing some of
the music from SWERY's most

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.380
recent game.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.170
SWERY's from Access Games?

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.850
SWERY: Yes.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.040
PROFESSOR: And previous
games he's made

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.750
include Spy Fiction,
Deadly Premonition,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.800
and the Deadly Premonition
director's cut.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920
And a few others.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.850
SWERY: To Japan.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.780
Ace Combat.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.110
Or [? Ganda. ?] Something.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.062
PROFESSOR: So from Namco Bandai.

00:01:17.062 --> 00:01:18.020
Those were Namco games.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.519
Yeah.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:21.229
So he's made a bunch of
different types of games.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.770
We really like, at
the lab, we really

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.870
enjoy the Deadly
Premoniton game.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.120
It's a great open-world
simulation game

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.310
that it plays a lot
differently than if you're used

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.700
to the normal Grand Theft Auto.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.129
So if you haven't played
that, Deadly Premonition,

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:37.170
he'll be talking about
some of those games today.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.544
But definitely
check out YouTube,

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:40.044
and check out playing that.

00:01:40.044 --> 00:01:40.960
We have it at the lab.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.480
So if you'd like to use the
lab and play that game at all,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.170
you're more than welcome to.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.211
They're going to also be
demonstrating their most

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.880
recent game on the Kinect once
we get our tech issues fixed.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.910
So we'll start with lecture.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.660
We'll have some Q&amp;A
at the end of that,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.035
and hopefully
we'll have a chance

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:56.850
to play their latest game.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.795
So I'm going to give you this.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:03.490
INTERPRETER: You can
just clip it anywhere?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.187
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just clip
it like-- near the top

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:07.740
of your-- yeah.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.633
INTERPRETER: OK.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.091
PROFESSOR: And feel
free to hold it

00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.476
if you don't have
anywhere else to put it

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:13.407
INTERPRETER: OK.

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:13.907
SWERY: Hi.

00:02:13.907 --> 00:02:16.050
Nice to meet you guys.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.320
I can't speak English well.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.280
Sorry.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.134
I need a translator.

00:02:20.134 --> 00:02:21.460
INTERPRETER: Hi.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.855
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:23.855 --> 00:02:26.864
INTERPRETER: I'll be
speaking in Japanese.

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:28.250
So I will translate.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.512
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:37.240
INTERPRETER: As the teacher
has said, that he makes games.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.882
So in order to
accommodate everyone

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:42.340
who might not know
the games, we've

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.272
presented this
picture over here.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.718
Can you hear me OK?

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:50.200
Is this good?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.350
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.850
INTERPRETER: These
are all the games

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.240
that he's worked on previously.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:42.560
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.560
INTERPRETER: You're familiar
with these games, here?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.092
You know, some were only
released in Japanese market,

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:49.592
also.

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:10.256
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:15.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:26.850
INTERPRETER: We've been making
games for about 20 years, just

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.720
like these games up here.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.011
And today, we'd like to talk
about the very newest game

00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.340
using the Xbox Kinect
in the front there.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:52.885
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:52.885 --> 00:04:54.260
INTERPRETER: So
this is basically

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.250
the structure of today.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.500
We want to start
with a small lecture.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.949
If we can get the video going--

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.990
PROFESSOR: They're here
to set that up right now.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.698
INTERPRETER: Yay!

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:04.290
We can play it, and then
have a short Q&amp;A at the end.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.790
SWERY: Yep.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:18.426
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:20.550
INTERPRETER: So for some
of you who might not know,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.255
D4 is a game that was
designed for Xbox One Kinect,

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:27.439
so that you can play using your
motions from the very beginning

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:29.730
all the way to the very end
in an action-adventure kind

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.370
of story.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:43.723
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:05:43.723 --> 00:05:45.306
INTERPRETER: So this
is a type of game

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:47.310
that you actually don't have to
hold the control in your hand.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.643
Everything is hand-motion based.

00:05:48.643 --> 00:05:55.290
So it has this sensor with
the Xbox One Kinect bar.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:09.740
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.490
INTERPRETER: So the
Kinect, it actually

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.020
takes a skeletal image of you.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.915
And then, using that,
it allows for it

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:20.540
to detect the motion of the
person who's playing the game.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.419
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.460
INTERPRETER: It's kind of
like an all-in-one kind

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.180
of sensor device.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.264
It doesn't only have
just the body movement

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:33.680
sensor, but also
has a microphone,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.580
a camera, all the
different kinds of things.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.100
So it could accurately
capture what you're doing.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:53.050
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.750
INTERPRETER: So in
one rough sketch,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.280
this is pretty much
all the sensors

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.779
that are incorporated into
the Xbox Kinect sensor.

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:00.570
As you can see, there's
a hand-tracking one

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.195
with the three
different options there.

00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:05.230
Face-tracking, mic sensors-- all
of this is inside that little.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.827
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.160
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.429
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.720
INTERPRETER: We don't actually
know what it's used for,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.957
but there's also a glasses
tracking device sensor.

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:18.040
SWERY: Doesn't make sense.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.740
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.400
INTERPRETER: So in order
to come to this point,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.340
we've had a lot of different
input methods that we used.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:44.462
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:45.920
INTERPRETER: So
this is, basically,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.630
all the different devices,
from the very beginning all

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.990
the way to 2014.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.260
So all these devices have been
previously made up to now.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:04.549
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:04.549 --> 00:08:06.590
INTERPRETER: So basically,
at the very beginning,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.020
if you look over there,
there's games that

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.340
only have a couple buttons.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.880
And then we've progressed
all the way over here.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.773
Do you know Femicon?

00:08:13.773 --> 00:08:15.840
It's on the corner there, too.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:23.109
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:23.109 --> 00:08:25.650
INTERPRETER: Yeah, in the very
beginning of the 90's, there's

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.010
also this rifle controller
thing down here.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.200
That's all very interesting.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.210
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.020
INTERPRETER: He
understands how much we all

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.880
love shooting games.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:47.012
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:49.470
INTERPRETER: And then, if you
look at the next decade over,

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.390
or the next
generation, you notice

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.040
that there's
actually controllers

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.765
device for each specific game.

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:57.750
So we have the new gun
controllers over here,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.410
and then the actual handheld
controller over here,

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.880
specific to whatever game
that you are designing for.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:13.614
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:13.614 --> 00:09:15.030
INTERPRETER: And
then in this era,

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.340
you can see that they
also utilize a piano

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.490
keyboard up top.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.200
So you use all different
kinds of medians

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.820
in order to play these games.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:42.270
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.220
INTERPRETER: And then,
in the 2000 onwards,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.270
you noticed that we actually
have these kind of controllers.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.860
Basically, everything
has some kind

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.520
of screen panel attached to it.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.960
And then you have
guitars and drum sets,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.630
and things that we see
nowadays in gaming.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.240
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.760
INTERPRETER: That's Kinect.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.522
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:07.980
INTERPRETER: So the Kinect is
over here underneath the Wii.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.740
So perhaps it's like whoever
made the slides preferences.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.853
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:21.012
INTERPRETER: So probably
whenever we game nowadays,

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:22.970
we have something similar
to this, where you're

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.950
holding a handheld controller.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.246
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:33.120
INTERPRETER: Also, the
other is like when you

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.629
use actual computer-- PC games.

00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.670
And you have a mouse and
a keyboard to play with.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:43.460
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.880
INTERPRETER: And then also
nowadays, a particular style

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.540
is to use these kind of
things, like a pad over there,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.110
or a guitar to play
the games nowadays.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:11:01.624
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:01.624 --> 00:11:03.790
INTERPRETER: So now we have
a question about Kinect.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.020
Is it one of those games
that you have something

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.936
like a guitar in your
hand and you're playing,

00:11:07.936 --> 00:11:10.035
or is it something
controller-based in your hand?

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.120
What do you think?

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.780
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.488
INTERPRETER: Anyone
that thinks that it's

00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:21.920
like a gamepad device?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.804
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:23.804 --> 00:11:26.220
INTERPRETER: Something that's
very specific and different.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.570
Anyone?

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.530
So there's two sides here.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.037
We have a couple hands.

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.120
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.370
INTERPRETER: Some brave souls.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:40.127
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:40.127 --> 00:11:41.710
INTERPRETER: In his
opinion, he thinks

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.310
that Xbox One is traditional.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.100
It's more traditional,
and not special.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.090
It doesn't have those
different elements to it.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:12:15.360
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.325
INTERPRETER: So in
his opinion, there's

00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:19.450
two distinct differences
between a traditional game

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.780
and a not-so-traditional game.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.020
The not-so-traditional
game would

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.290
be something that
does not-- you're not

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.740
designing the game based on
the medium that you're using.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.323
And then the other
way around, if it's

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:33.292
a nontraditional device,
it is based-- sorry.

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:34.000
I got that wrong.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.170
Sorry.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.810
A traditional device
would be a game

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.390
that you play based
off of the medium

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.848
that you're using
to play the game.

00:12:39.848 --> 00:12:43.520
And a nontraditional device is
not dependent upon the medium

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.600
that you're using,
but something else.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:56.753
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:12:56.753 --> 00:12:59.253
INTERPRETER: He feels that a
special device-- a special game

00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:01.430
would be something like, let's
say then Guitar Hero, when you

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.638
pick up a guitar, and you
have a guitar to play with,

00:13:03.638 --> 00:13:05.930
you automatically know
that this is a music game.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.250
It's not going to
be a fighting game.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.770
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.770
INTERPRETER: We're going
to explain a little bit

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:20.950
about why the Kinect is
considered a traditional game.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:28.120
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.690
INTERPRETER: So a game is made
by having the players input

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.440
a code through a different
medium into the game itself.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.792
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:40.250
INTERPRETER: So the symbols--
like pushing this button will

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.080
fire this missile.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.400
Kind of shorthand symbol.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:52.460
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.080
INTERPRETER: So
then in D4, instead

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.417
of actually having a
motion mean something,

00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:58.000
it is more like you
follow the arrows.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.520
So if you wanted to turn the
page, you follow the arrow,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.436
and it will go around.

00:14:01.436 --> 00:14:04.060
So it's like a symbol based.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:22.190
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.450
INTERPRETER: So there's
also, like Minority Report

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.940
and Iron Man that came out,
it's not necessarily a game

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.375
that you use because it's
based off of this Kinect,

00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:32.560
but kind of like a
halfway semi-using

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.100
the Apple products and
the OS, iOSes in order

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.330
to make the games.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:47.700
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.779
INTERPRETER: So if you
kind of really focus into

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:52.570
whether you're going
to make a special game

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.704
or a traditional game, and
you narrow your vision,

00:14:55.704 --> 00:14:57.870
your game is probably going
to become kind of small.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:59.630
In his opinion, he
thinks that in order

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.090
to make it a bigger deal,
and make it a bigger thing,

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.340
you should break that boundary
between traditional and

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.740
special, and find
something that works really

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.490
well with the medium
that you're using.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:16.875
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:18.500
INTERPRETER: So with
D4, what he wanted

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.980
to challenge was not only
the actual game play itself,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.960
but how the players
interact with the device

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.760
in order to make actions happen.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:36.945
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:38.320
INTERPRETER: So
instead of having

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.730
the user have a handheld
controller to click on buttons,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.550
he wanted to find a way that
you can actually have the people

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.890
interact with the game by
having these hand gestures,

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:52.350
or motioning a bat, and
having a story go along.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:53.607
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:56.470
INTERPRETER: Are you interested?

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.160
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.310
INTERPRETER: Do you
have a preference?

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.370
Does anyone like
Kinect, particularly?

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.455
Hate Kinect?

00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:06.172
Have an opinion about Kinect?

00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:07.168
It's good?

00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:10.690
I saw the-- over there.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:21.389
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:22.930
INTERPRETER: So now
that we've piqued

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.280
your interest a
little bit, I think

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.810
that some people are
probably thinking,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.684
yes, let's incorporate
motions into our game.

00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:29.710
But actually there's a
bunch of little problems

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.600
that come up when you
want to use motion.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:41.670
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.930
INTERPRETER: The Kinect is,
as you see, stupidly honest.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.270
It only registers the exact
motion that you are doing.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.377
So you have to be precise
when you play this.

00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:53.460
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.180
INTERPRETER:
There's a function--

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.203
especially like in D4, where if
you take from an outside hand

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:19.619
motion, and you
swipe to the left,

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.730
the camera will also follow you.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.950
Your vision will change as well.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:32.800
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.030
INTERPRETER: So let's
say if I was going

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.950
to swipe from my
right to my left,

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.310
the camera will move this way.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.860
And if you move from
your left to the right,

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.110
the camera will move that way.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.511
It didn't really work out.

00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:43.510
Have you tried to do it?

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:51.940
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.350
INTERPRETER: So I know
some people probably

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.930
have this, if you're a gamer--
I know I've experienced this.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.712
But if you try to
use one motion.

00:17:58.712 --> 00:18:00.420
Like, OK, I'm going
to slide to the left.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.128
That didn't work.

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:02.310
Let me try it again.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.630
When you try it again, this
second sensor also catches.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.880
So then your computer's just
moving around like crazy.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.380
Instead of having
a one reset, it

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.920
registers this backwards
motion as well.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:21.120
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.520
INTERPRETER: So in order
to try to compensate,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.100
or to change this
method, he tried

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.960
to make it so that if
you swipe really fast,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.220
the camera will react.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.860
But if you swipe really
slow, it will not react.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:41.410
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.057
INTERPRETER: But at
first, he thought

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:44.140
this was a brilliant plan.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.350
But when you're really
hyped up and energized

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.277
about playing a game, adrenaline
pumps in, and then everything

00:18:50.277 --> 00:18:51.110
becomes really fast.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.550
Or if you have maybe an older
person who maybe cannot move

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.140
their hand quite so fast.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.580
It doesn't react.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:07.430
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.080
INTERPRETER: So
then he thought, OK,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.900
let's try having a
little bit of time.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.480
So once you move the camera
angle, if you don't do anything

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.840
you'll be OK.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.960
It won't move.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:25.350
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.680
INTERPRETER: So it didn't
work, because this speed

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.050
limitation was also one thing.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.660
But once it--
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:42.490
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.590
INTERPRETER: And then,
even if you do something,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.048
and then you're
like, OK, I'm going

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:48.190
to wait two seconds before
I do to my next action,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.745
it actually just goes back
to what it was originally.

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:51.910
It reverts back.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.480
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.760
INTERPRETER: So just from
this one swiping action,

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.454
he's changed it this many times.

00:20:01.454 --> 00:20:15.960
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.770
INTERPRETER: So in the game D4,
in order to select something,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.377
like back or next, you actually
have to grab the back or next.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:23.876
There's a hand that
hovers, and then

00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:26.280
he makes this grabbing
function, and it pushes "Enter"

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:26.780
pretty much.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.294
But then, in order
to differentiate

00:20:28.294 --> 00:20:29.960
between the swipe and
the grab-- or some

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.220
people do a combination
of a swipe and a grab

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.960
at the same time.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.270
So it didn't work per se.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.860
And so even if you're doing
one small action, like swiping,

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.320
it caused this much different
trial and errors that came up.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:54.280
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.780
INTERPRETER: So
what he wants to say

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.250
is that even though
there might be

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.810
some negative
views about Kinect,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:04.430
it's just basically
maybe certain developers,

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.740
directors can't design
well for the game.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.810
However, these things
could possibly easily

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.850
be overcome with
a software change.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:23.230
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:28.220
INTERPRETER: And so if you try
to find a game designer who

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.970
doesn't think about
changing the software,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.511
and actually only concentrates
on the hardware version of it,

00:21:32.511 --> 00:21:35.450
then they're going to have
to make a game specifically

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.450
designed towards the
hardware, instead of having

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.850
the simple solution of let's
just change something else

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.680
to make it better.

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:21:53.092 --> 00:21:55.550
INTERPRETER: So instead of how
to make a good game, instead

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.133
of thinking, "How do I use the
hardware that they've presented

00:21:58.133 --> 00:22:00.417
me?" well, using that
hardware incorporating

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:02.750
a different software trying
to find a different approach

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.790
to make the hardware
itself more stand out

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.626

00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:14.574

00:22:14.574 --> 00:22:15.073
OK.

00:22:15.073 --> 00:22:18.210
If this works, we can play D4.

Oh.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.060
Oh, oh yeah.

You all have to raise
your hand at the Kinect,

00:23:16.304 --> 00:23:17.220

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.020

maybe, as you said,

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.850
no one here has really
played this game.

if this doesn't work

do is-- it wouldn't

work for today,

00:25:25.075 --> 00:25:26.325

00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:34.685

supposed to look like that?

00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:34.811
INTERPRETER: Yeah.

00:25:34.811 --> 00:25:35.595
It has to look like that.

00:25:35.595 --> 00:25:36.980
PROFESSOR: So it's the white.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.300
There's a whole layer of
color that's not being shown.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.170
AV PERSON: Right.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.696
So if it looks fine
on that screen,

00:25:41.696 --> 00:25:43.695
and then it doesn't look
fine on another screen,

00:25:43.695 --> 00:25:46.503
then I can't say that it's the
connection that's the problem.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.169
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:48.475
So it could just be the--

00:25:48.475 --> 00:25:49.850
AV PERSON: It's
possible it could

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:50.940
be the HDMI cable as well.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.912
But there is two things
that I could suggest.

00:25:52.912 --> 00:25:54.884
We could actually [INAUDIBLE].

Great.

00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:15.148

00:26:21.955 --> 00:26:22.621
INTERPRETER: OK.

00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:24.556
It was a really fun game.

00:26:24.556 --> 00:26:25.056
Yeah!

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.050
So we're actually going to
try to do this one more time,

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.880
but we have about 5 or 10
minutes while they figure out

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.810
the technical aspects.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.620
But if anyone has
any questions, we

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.101
can entertain them right now.

00:26:42.949 --> 00:26:47.800

adjustments to the software

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:54.386
that you made to
the Kinect firmware.

00:26:54.386 --> 00:26:58.362
Is that something that--
is it very accessible?

00:26:58.362 --> 00:27:01.326
Is it easy to change the
software that it comes with?

00:27:01.326 --> 00:27:07.122
I would think Microsoft wouldn't
want people messing with--

00:27:07.122 --> 00:27:09.060
and they muck it
up or something.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:15.220

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.400
INTERPRETER: So it's actually
pretty easy to change,

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.650
apparently, the software part.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:31.510
But in order to think about how
it could be better-- like why

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.600
it's buggy, or what
could be better--

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.963
what could make it smoother,
in order to even make D4,

00:27:35.963 --> 00:27:37.200
it took three years.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.440
So coming up with all
the different things

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.510
that could possibly go
wrong is more of an issue.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.135

problem with the camera.

00:27:52.661 --> 00:27:55.620
How did he finally fix it?

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:02.300
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:23.739
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:26.030
INTERPRETER: So basically,
it's just a bazillion trials

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.190
and errors, asking people--
like any users, hey,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.910
let's play Testament a bazillion
times over, and just trying

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.400
to somehow come up
with the solution.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:48.560
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.120
INTERPRETER: So actually,
with the Kinect,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.500
it registers everyone's height
and weight kind of things.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.545
So if you go to
Japan, where everyone

00:28:57.545 --> 00:29:01.390
tends to be a little
bit vertically smaller,

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.590
as opposed to if you
go to America, Europe,

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.190
and the people tend to
be a little bit bigger.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.340
So he has to go to all
these different countries

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.800
and have play tests done
at those specific countries

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:17.308
in order to adjust
for physical problems.

00:29:17.308 --> 00:29:19.612
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the input device

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.070
affecting how you
design your game.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.730
What would you do if you had
a brain-computer interface?

00:29:26.872 --> 00:29:28.580
INTERPRETER: You would
laugh, apparently.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:53.192
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:29:53.192 --> 00:29:55.650
INTERPRETER: So he actually
wants to challenge it sometime.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.627
But even with the
motion sensors,

00:29:57.627 --> 00:29:59.460
you have so many problems
that are going on.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.330
So as a game designer, if you
were to use the brain sensor

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.260
ones, you'd have to even
think of one step even ahead

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.310
of the player in
order to get it to go.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.430
So it'd probably
be very difficult.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:26.176
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:30:26.176 --> 00:30:27.550
INTERPRETER: But
even in D4, when

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.260
we have even like an
arrow, people, humans,

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.654
we tend to automatically
follow the arrow anyways.

00:30:34.654 --> 00:30:36.570
So if there's just an
arrow and no directions,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.160
you just kind of
follow the arrow.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.990
So perhaps there is
a way to actually

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.152
have it so that we can
do the brain sensors,

00:30:42.152 --> 00:30:45.496
because of existing
motor recognition.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.558
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that you have

00:30:51.558 --> 00:30:55.530
this more generalized input
devices and specific input

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:56.839
devices.

00:30:56.839 --> 00:30:58.005
What's your opinion on that?

00:30:58.005 --> 00:31:00.645
Even for the generalized
input devices, some of them

00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:02.955
are better for some
games and not others.

00:31:02.955 --> 00:31:06.640
For example, keyboard and
mouse works well for strategy,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.192
but you can't really
do StarCraft II

00:31:09.192 --> 00:31:13.494

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.040
INTERPRETER: So his opinion
is it doesn't really

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.400
change based on having one
set-- the design for what

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.210
you want to make.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.510
But as a designer,
you definitely

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.314
should think about which
one is going to work better.

00:32:06.314 --> 00:32:08.480
As you said, StarCraft would
not really work so well

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.640
with a handheld controller.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.840
And so that's kind
of up to the designer

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.690
to decide whichever is better.

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.120

"Go play Kinect, everyone!"

instead of having

this is one option,
by using the Kinect,

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.790
how can we make it so

feels more like they
are playing in the game,

actually, controlling
the character,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:49.640

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.511
and what you just
said about having

00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:06.080
to think carefully about
which controls do you use.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.676
Is there something about
the Kinect's motion

00:33:08.676 --> 00:33:10.800
detection that you
think really contributed

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.839
to the feel or the
atmosphere of the game?

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:15.880
And then you talked a
little bit about immersion,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.595
but something maybe a
little more specific

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.053
than that-- something
that you feel

00:33:19.053 --> 00:33:20.780
like, because I used
the Kinect, I really

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.363
got to do something
specifically cool?

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:46.420
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.170
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:56.250
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:12.190
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.935
INTERPRETER: So
with the D4 game,

00:34:14.935 --> 00:34:16.560
let's say if you
wanted to use a mouse,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.270
and you can actually follow
the mouse with the arrows,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.866
or use the control of the
D-pad and follow around

00:34:22.866 --> 00:34:23.690
with the arrows.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.330
But with Kinect,
what is really cool

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.550
is that you can
actually move your hand

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.719
and click on something,
or do an action based off

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.889
of Kinect functions.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:47.520
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.050
INTERPRETER: So let's
say by using the Kinect,

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.489
there is-- it's kind
of easier if you

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.560
have played this before--
as with everything.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.070
But there are
certain things that

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.150
happen-- like real-time,
different events that

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.840
are triggered because of another
thing that you have done.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.430
And with Kinect, it's
actually smoother.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.750
Like your emotions, if you feel
really on edge about something,

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:15.000
it kind of reflects in
your body movements,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.740
and then it catches that.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.080
So with the Kinect,
there's a little bit more

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.210
in your personal-- like you're
in the game kind of thing,

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.738
as opposed to a controller.

00:35:24.738 --> 00:35:45.680
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.720
INTERPRETER: And then, so if you
had a controller in your hand,

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.870
or a mouse or a
keyboard, the only way

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:52.902
to make something harder--
to raise difficulty--

00:35:52.902 --> 00:35:54.610
is to increase the
speed of your tapping,

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:57.387
or something has to--
that kind of thing.

00:35:57.387 --> 00:35:58.470
There might be other ways.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.830
But for the most part,
we increase the speed.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.250
However, with the Kinect
you actually physically

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:07.470
have to emotionally gut
yourself into it in order for it

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.576
to increase.

00:36:09.576 --> 00:36:11.324
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:36:11.324 --> 00:36:11.990
INTERPRETER: Oh.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.250
SWERY: You?

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.726
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:17.726 --> 00:36:19.694
In my experience with
these kind of things

00:36:19.694 --> 00:36:22.154
where you have no
direct control over what

00:36:22.154 --> 00:36:26.582
several users may have-- like
you talked about the grandma

00:36:26.582 --> 00:36:28.550
and speed up.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.256
So, in my experience,
the way you do it is you

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:32.978
make sure that
that is a variable.

00:36:32.978 --> 00:36:34.946
And I'm asking, why is
it not possible here?

00:36:34.946 --> 00:36:36.914
So, for example,
before the game starts,

00:36:36.914 --> 00:36:39.989
you ask the grandma to
register how fast she

00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:41.774
can do this with the camera.

00:36:41.774 --> 00:36:42.440
INTERPRETER: Oh.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.750
Like a Windows
double-click speed testing?

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:45.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.750
So you set up all those
things as variables.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.750
And when the game starts the
grandma can go at her pace,

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.125
the young guy can
go at his pace.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:37:03.247
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:37:03.247 --> 00:37:04.330
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.640
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
You can in D4.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.813
In D4 you can.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:18.720
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.420
INTERPRETER: But they still
took an average, pretty much.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.030
So most people would be
able to still play it

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:29.160
without having to finagle
though all the settings.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:37.220
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
Any other question?

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:43.196
AUDIENCE: What's the cost
for an average game that,

00:37:43.196 --> 00:37:46.184
say, like cost, like D4?

00:37:46.184 --> 00:37:50.168
What's the cost in
terms of capital,

00:37:50.168 --> 00:37:54.650
number of people you need--
developers, artists, whatever?

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.895
INTERPRETER: You want a very
large number, basically.

00:37:56.895 --> 00:37:59.020
AUDIENCE: How long would
it take to develop a game?

00:38:00.855 --> 00:38:05.780

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:09.850
INTERPRETER: Many zeroes.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:22.368
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:22.368 --> 00:38:24.840

SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:42.185 --> 00:38:44.060
INTERPRETER: So it's
kind of difficult to put

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.724
a number to how much it costs.

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.890
This is kind of hard for
me explain, so bear with me

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:49.660
a moment.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.860
But if you were to say
how many people were

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.520
to work on this game,
and then kind of use that

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.420
as a monetary
equation, in one month

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:59.920
if you were going
to make this game,

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.580
you'd probably have
about 600 peoples' worth.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.480
Does that make sense?

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.310
So if you only had 20
people, and 20 people worked

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.400
on one game for one
month, it would maybe

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.306
take 30 months to finish
this game kind of thing.

00:39:14.306 --> 00:39:15.180
Does that make sense?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:23.960
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.580
INTERPRETER: So D4 is
still a smaller-- it's not

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.310
a huge, giant, giant game.

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:32.190
So if you go to maybe
PlayStation, like a big company

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:35.080
game, it might be 300
people, one month,

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.340
for 30 months kind of thing.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.550
So it kind of depends.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:40.550
And it's a roundabout,
not really a good answer.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.050

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.960
INTERPRETER: So he has a special
ability to go back in time.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.036
And just now, when he fell,
he just came back from back

00:47:17.036 --> 00:47:17.820
in time.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.330
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:22.830
INTERPRETER: So by
using Kinect, you

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:25.970
can interact with the characters
by using these hand signals.

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:32.100
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.297
INTERPRETER: And then
there's an exclamation point.

00:47:35.297 --> 00:47:36.880
If you hover your
hand over it, you'll

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.630
be able to see
important information.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:51.990
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.240
INTERPRETER: He's a detective.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.310
Basically, his wife was
killed two years ago,

00:47:56.310 --> 00:48:01.630
and he's looking for the
true murderer of the case.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.116
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER:
My name is David Young.

00:48:04.116 --> 00:48:06.121
Former narc with the Boston PD.

00:48:06.121 --> 00:48:07.912
INTERPRETER: It takes
place in Boston, too!

00:48:11.848 --> 00:48:15.784
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: My likes
include 100% agave tequila.

00:48:15.784 --> 00:48:19.720
My dislikes are mainly
drugs and chewing gum.

00:48:25.132 --> 00:48:30.544
Two years ago someone
killed my wife.

00:48:30.544 --> 00:48:32.840
Since then I've been using
every second of my life

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.970
to solve the case.

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.748
SWERY: My name!

00:48:38.748 --> 00:48:39.748
INTERPRETER: That's him!

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:50.985
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:48:50.985 --> 00:48:52.860
INTERPRETER: Just by
moving your hand around,

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.580
you can pick which one you
actually want to interact with.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.250
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:03.280
INTERPRETER: And then, if
you clasp your hand together,

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.450
it's enter.

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.340
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.861
INTERPRETER: And if you follow
the movement of the arrow,

00:49:09.861 --> 00:49:14.100
it moves the character's hand.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.410
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: It's
been broken since that day.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.645
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:18.645 --> 00:49:20.145
INTERPRETER: You
can use both hands.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:25.230
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.480
INTERPRETER: If you wanted
to change the camera angle,

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.920
you put your hand all the way
to the side and swipe across.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.292
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:34.292 --> 00:49:36.700
INTERPRETER: And then if
you tried to swipe it twice,

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.840
it'd be
back-forth-back-forth-back-forth

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.012
instead of having this basically
holding it and sliding over.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:50.369
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:49:50.369 --> 00:49:52.160
INTERPRETER: Of course,
you're not actually

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.390
shutting something physical.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.890
But by using the
arrows, you kind of

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.785
have the feeling that you are
shutting the toilet seat down.

00:49:57.785 --> 00:50:00.755
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: In
a slightly different form.

00:50:00.755 --> 00:50:03.230
Like all these forgotten
treasures, mementos.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.964
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:50:11.964 --> 00:50:12.630
INTERPRETER: OK.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:16.350
Put your hands up,
it closes the screen.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.647
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:50:19.647 --> 00:50:21.730
INTERPRETER: We're going
to skip this serious part

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.221
and just go into action.

00:50:26.139 --> 00:50:28.222
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: No
results this time either.

00:50:28.222 --> 00:50:30.677
This case is in the clear.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.530
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:50:46.674 --> 00:50:48.840
INTERPRETER: So there's a
lot of things in the rooms

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.964
that you can interact with.

00:50:49.964 --> 00:50:52.260
And if you're not sure
which one you should do,

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.600
if you put your
hand like this, it

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.786
activates a thing called
Vision, which is actually

00:50:56.786 --> 00:50:57.660
voice-commanded also.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.144
You can say "Vision on,"
and it will turn on.

00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:02.060
And it shows you the
different options of what

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.850
you could pick up or touch.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:16.497
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:51:16.497 --> 00:51:18.330
INTERPRETER: So usually
with the controller,

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.860
you use like Y button or
something to enter something.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.380
But with the Kinect, by
using an actual hand gesture

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.259
you can connect with that
even better, the characters.

00:51:27.259 --> 00:51:29.092
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER:
There's only one thing

00:51:29.092 --> 00:51:30.972
I need at the moment.

00:51:30.972 --> 00:51:31.472
Tequila.

00:51:31.472 --> 00:51:32.910
Straight up.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:34.450
SWERY: Me too.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:35.366
INTERPRETER: Him, too.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:59.194
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:51:59.194 --> 00:52:01.610
INTERPRETER: If you had to do
a gesture every few seconds,

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:02.950
it might get kind of annoying.

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.540
But as you see, it's
like spaced out.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.415
It's only occasionally
you do these gestures.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:12.492
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:52:12.492 --> 00:52:13.950
INTERPRETER: This
is his dead wife.

00:52:18.357 --> 00:52:20.398
WIFE IN VIDEO GAME: Maybe
I'll just try a little.

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.350
Oh!

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:38.750
[LAUGHING]

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.670
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:44.420
INTERPRETER: Yeah.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:45.878
Everything he does
is very violent.

00:52:52.725 --> 00:52:55.575
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: I have
no memories of that day.

00:52:55.575 --> 00:53:01.459
When I came to, I was
already lying in the ICU.

00:53:01.459 --> 00:53:05.355
The only thing I do remember
are the words that little Peggy

00:53:05.355 --> 00:53:08.764
whispered as she died.

00:53:08.764 --> 00:53:15.914
"Look for 'D.'" Who is "D"?

00:53:15.914 --> 00:53:17.330
INTERPRETER: Which
we tried to do.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.795
But no one's name
started with "D."

00:53:19.795 --> 00:53:20.295
So sad!

00:53:33.498 --> 00:53:34.965
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER:
At the time,

00:53:34.965 --> 00:53:36.921
there's no compelling evidence.

00:53:36.921 --> 00:53:39.880
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.558
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:53:41.558 --> 00:53:44.990
INTERPRETER: Such
a depressing story.

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:47.156
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: Under
the right circumstances,

00:53:47.156 --> 00:53:50.285
I now have the capability to
solve even a dead-end case.

00:53:50.285 --> 00:53:52.076
INTERPRETER: He even
has an accent, though.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.916
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER:
I'll do everything

00:54:01.916 --> 00:54:04.868
in my power to find this "D."

00:54:04.868 --> 00:54:06.344
I swear I will.

00:54:06.344 --> 00:54:09.296
And when I do, oh, Peggy.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.160
Amanda?

00:54:18.876 --> 00:54:26.292
SWERY: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:54:26.292 --> 00:54:28.500
INTERPRETER: So we're going
to investigate this door.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.330
Huh!

INTERPRETER: And then
he's going to [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:00.503 --> 00:55:04.175

You can't escape now.

This is Amanda.

00:55:14.976 --> 00:55:16.100
She just suddenly started--

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.080
INTERPRETER: And you
can move your body

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.806
and change the camera angle.

00:55:18.806 --> 00:55:21.389
VIDEO GAME CHARACTER: Sometimes
goes out and gets food for us.

00:55:21.389 --> 00:55:23.243
And that's something
of a lifeline for me,

00:55:23.243 --> 00:55:25.215
because I don't
really go outside.

00:55:25.215 --> 00:55:30.967
Just who she is, though-- well,
my memory holds no answers.

00:55:30.967 --> 00:55:32.050

00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.970

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:34.930

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:41.519

00:55:41.519 --> 00:55:43.810
INTERPRETER: Again, the game
does take place in Boston,

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.260
so it's kind of adorable.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.910

INTERPRETER: So if
you can get a chance

00:56:00.907 --> 00:56:02.490
to maybe play around
with it sometime,

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:03.120
it would be wonderful.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.703
If you can experiment
around with what

00:56:04.703 --> 00:56:07.090
we talked about today, and
see how the interaction

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:08.430
will change your game-play.
