00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:21.755
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.020
Welcome to class.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.090
Some very quick announcements.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.100
We had the date wrong
on the vision statement.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.840
The vision statement you
guys worked on on Monday

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.070
is due today.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.510
We had the date
wrong in Stellar.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.070
So it will not be
late as long as it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.240
turned in by tomorrow morning.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.090
We have adjusted
the date on Stellar

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.360
so now it shows the real date.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.230
But since we made that mistake,
it's not late until tomorrow.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.630
But we will expect them all in
by the end of the day today.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.570
Secondly, the things
that are due next Monday,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.940
you will be expected to be
turning in a product backlog.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.523
We're going to work on creating
product backlog in class today

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:06.430
and then you will have some
time to refine and think

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.110
about it as you're working on
the project over the weekend.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.050
One thing you should be
working on along the way,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.720
remember we require a design
change log for this project

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.640
as well.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.530
So you should have
already started it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.490
because you probably made
some design decisions

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.120
in your meeting on Monday.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.680
So don't forget that and
don't try to do it at the end.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.220
I think that's all
the announcements.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.990
Yeah?

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.510
OK.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.925
So today's class is
going to be, we're

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:43.450
going to start talking
about project management.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.450
What we are trying to do
with project management

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.460
is give you the just
in time version of it.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.600
Which is to say, we're
trying to give you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.140
the pieces of project
management you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.401
need for the project you're on
right now in the state it's on.

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.150
And we're going to be
just in time project

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.397
management for project two.

00:01:58.397 --> 00:01:59.980
And then on project
three, we're going

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.330
to expect you to use all those
pieces from the beginning

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.000
and all the way
through on your own

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.630
so that you'll have had a
walkthrough on project two,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.889
a practice run on project
three, and then on project four

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.060
hopefully you will need
it and it will all work.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.310
That's sort of the philosophy.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.393
So we are giving it out
to you in bits and pieces,

00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:19.200
and I acknowledge that.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000
I suspect that between today's
lecture and Monday's lecture,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.110
we will have covered
sort of all the things we

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.420
expect you to be doing as
far as project management.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.580
But today's lecture's
sort of the first half

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.610
and then Monday's will
be the second half

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.620
and tidying it all up.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.750
So we're going to do
a brief history of how

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.290
project management was done
in the past in the software

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.470
industry.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.880
We're going to talk about agile,
which is where many software

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.610
companies are using
now or moving to

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.180
with various levels of success.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.636
Not all of them, unfortunately.

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:56.010
Then we're going
to start getting

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.280
into the nitty gritty of
the agile management system

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.760
that our lab is most familiar
with, which is Scrum.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840
And we'll start walking through
all the aspects of Scrum.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.882
We will concentrate today
on product backlogs.

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:11.340
We'll take a break
from our lecture

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.950
and you guys will have the
opportunity in about a half

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.220
an hour to make your
own project backlogs

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.490
and then do very quick
presentations of sort

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.320
of, OK, here are the top
features that we found

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.820
in our product backlog when we
sat down and actually thought

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.160
about our game.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.690
Then unfortunately I will get
up and start talking again.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.696
We'll go over the meetings
in Scrum, how they run,

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:36.320
and what they are,
and why you do them,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.430
and their level of importance.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.150
And when we hit the
end of that, we'll

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.720
have you run a
small one yourself

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.610
and then we will actually get
to use the rest of time in class

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.420
for working in your groups
and working on your projects.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.650
OK?

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.990
Any questions?

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.720
And let's go.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.330
Now that we have the
class interest guides,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.180
I can mostly skip that slide.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.200
OK.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.400
So you all took
this class to learn

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.960
how to create video games.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.400
We, however, created this class
to teach project management

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.189
in video games.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.230
Fortunately, we're all
going to get what we want,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.530
because you really do need
some good project management

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.821
skills to successfully
make video games.

00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:21.279
The better your
project management,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.570
the better your chances of
coming out with a good game.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.810
It won't guarantee it.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.810
You need a lot of other
good things as well.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.143
But I can pretty much guarantee
that without any project

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:33.800
management, your attempt to
make a game is going to fail.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.732
So do try to listen.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.190
I know this is some of the less
interesting stuff we cover,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.350
especially coming after the
high of prototyping and making

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.070
games.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.965
But this is just as
important as prototyping.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.990
So what is project management?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.790
Let's start by explaining what
the heck I'm talking about.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.100
Project management is the
work on the project that's

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.920
devoted to planning, organizing,
securing, motivating,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.980
and controlling the resources
to successfully complete

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.910
a project.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.790
You've all heard of fast,
good, cheap, pick two.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.030
Most projects are actually lucky
if they manage to choose one.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.560
And it's project
management allows

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.976
them to figure out
whether they're

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:14.700
going to be fast or good or
good or cheap or whatever.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.160
Project management is
all about predicting.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.230
I knew the definition up
there says controlling,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.540
but you really can't control
a whole lot of things.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.110
What you can do is you
can make some estimates,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.910
make some predictions, plan for
the risks you're going to run

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.479
into and then deal with them.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.270
So it's really about
predicting what you're

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.290
going to need to do when
you're going to need to do it

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.990
and how you're going
to need to do it.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.210
If you follow game and
other large software project

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.450
releases, you know
how rarely they

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.470
actually manage to
come out on time

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.180
with all of their features.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.090
Games are especially
famous for coming out late,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.324
for being over
budget, and for often

00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:56.740
under delivering the shiny
things that they had mentioned.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.080
Can anybody think of a
couple of games recently

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.940
that have done that?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.970
No?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.886
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.530
SARA VERRILLI: Yep.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.790
OK definitions may vary.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.830
But yeah, it is
really, really common

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.970
for games to come out
late and over budget.

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:25.340
Here's another one.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.630
Anybody name a tripe A
game that shipped on time?

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.360
I'm not actually sure
I can do this one.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.140
With all the features
that they predicted.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.858
Can anyone name one?

00:06:33.858 --> 00:06:34.774
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.460
SARA VERRILLI: Call Of Duty.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.730
OK.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.690
That's impressive.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.320
OK, so how do you manage
to plan what you're

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.970
going to need to do, get all
of your resources in order,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.670
have them all in the right
place at the right time,

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.720
and get them working together?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.880
The old model of doing
this, which is actually

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.500
the model that I worked at
in several studios and I've

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.820
seen several other
studios that use it.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.210
And it doesn't work very well.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.040
But sort of the
model that things

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.590
started with in the industry
and grew from is waterfall.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.480
And I want to talk
about that because it's

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.370
where some studios still are
and it's where a lot of software

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.460
projects still are.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.870
And so it's good to understand
what the history of project

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.490
management is so you understand
some of the problems that

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.450
were found in that model that
the agile model is trying

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.000
to fix.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.240
Agile has its own problems
and we'll talk about them.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.330
But let's start with waterfall.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.450
So the very traditional
tool is waterfall, where

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.960
you prepare for every stage.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.570
You sort of finish
every stage 100%

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.080
and then you move on to the
next stage to see what happens.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.910
First you need your spec.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.500
You need your requirements.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.561
Which in game design is sort
of your concept and your design

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.060
phase.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.940
You figure out what
you want to make,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.279
you figure out what
all the features are.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.820
You also figure out
other constraints

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.200
like what is your
budget, how long

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.040
you're going to take, what
can the people on your team

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.716
actually do.

00:08:10.716 --> 00:08:12.340
If you don't have a
physics programmer,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.330
you probably don't want
to make a physics game.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.800
All that pulling all
those constraints together

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.650
to make a design
that is reasonable

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.649
that works with the things
that you think you're

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.740
going to have to work with.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.720
That concepting
and design is going

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.980
to flow into pre-production
where you sit there

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.260
and you made a whole
lot of assumptions

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.190
in design and concept.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.689
And in pre-production,
you test them

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:33.959
in very small scale usually.

00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:35.500
You figure out if
people can actually

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.030
do the things they said
they were going to do.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.940
You figure out if the
software you were going to buy

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.720
is actually going to work or
not and all those other details.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.700
Using the data you
gathered in pre-production,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.530
you create a whole lot
of big fancy schedules.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.330
And using those schedules,
you hire up your team

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.530
and you go into production,
and you implement everything

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.350
and you get it all built.
Well, you get most of it built.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.832
Then in game processes,
you go into alpha

00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:05.540
when you've got most
of your features in.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.720
And that's when you usually
bring on a few small testers

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.511
to do a little bit of
testing and make sure

00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:11.540
your code is working the
way you expect it to.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.000
Then when you've got
all your features in,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.583
it's mostly working,
you go into beta.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:17.110
You bring on more testers.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.610
In big studios these
days it's often

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.240
common to have open betas.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.610
If you're looking at
some sort of massive game

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.110
where you're not going
to hire 100,000 testers.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.750
So what you do is
you have an open beta

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.120
and you let people play the
game for free in exchange

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.820
for testing it.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.870
That hopefully nails out the
rest of your big problems

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.990
and then you ship it.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.440
Does anyone see the big problem
with games in this model?

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:46.680
It's a little subtle,
so it's easy to miss.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.660
It's OK if you don't.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.643
Yeah?

00:09:48.643 --> 00:09:49.559
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:59.147 --> 00:10:00.230
SARA VERRILLI: That is it.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.880
Almost all of the testing
is here at the end at beta.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.340
It's a little late to
change your design if you're

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.397
doing all of your
testing at the end.

00:10:09.397 --> 00:10:11.230
if you're doing all
your testing at the end,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.650
the team can't respond to it.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.200
They can't fix things.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.126
And that is where a lot of
schedules get stretched out

00:10:17.126 --> 00:10:18.750
and a lot of budgets
get stretched out.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.480
Because all of the
planning you had goes out

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.177
the door somewhere
around early alpha

00:10:24.177 --> 00:10:26.260
and you have to start
reworking your whole system.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.240
The problem here is, of
course, you can't predict fun.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.430
You can't design an
engaging experience

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.540
without interacting
with the people who

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.500
are going to be
using it, which means

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.550
not just the people
on your team,

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.320
not just the small
group of pre-prod.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.000
I mean, in waterfall
they do do testing.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.367
In pre-production you
test, in design, you test.

00:10:47.367 --> 00:10:49.700
But you're almost always
testing with a very small group

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.780
of people.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.545
The other designers
on your team,

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.920
the other people
in your company.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.747
You're not going
for any big testing.

00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:57.330
You're not going for
any user testing.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.685
You're not finding
out how the people who

00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:00.370
are actually going
to use your product

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.240
are going to react to it.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.650
So in many ways
it's doomed to fail.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.110
There's not a lot
you can do about it.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.570
None of these problems
are unique to games.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.290
It's why big software
projects often run over budget

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.630
and run into a lot
of feature creep.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.000
But games have the
really unique problem

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.710
that their primary feature,
their primary goal,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.160
is to be interesting
and engaging to use.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.880
If you are looking at business
software, and it's hard to use

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.920
and it's annoying, but it does
all the calculations you need

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.570
and it's the one that the tech
department bought and deployed,

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.454
you're going to use it.

00:11:42.454 --> 00:11:43.870
There's just no
getting around it.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.490
But nobody has to
play Call of Duty.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.160
Nobody has to turn on a
particular game on their phone

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.390
and play it.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.500
So if a game fails in that
sort of user connection,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.230
it has completely failed.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.370
There's nothing else you can do.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.770
It really kind of comes down
to, if your users aren't happy,

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.905
it's not a good game.

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:07.879
Your design changes,
your schedule changes,

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:09.420
and your project
management has now--

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.110
all of the time you put
in project management has

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.360
mostly a waste of time.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.270
So what do you do instead?

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.900
First of all, you think about
building design iteration

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.660
into your project
management model.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.470
You assume that you're going
to be iterating and changing

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.940
your design all the way around.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.120
That is what the agile project
management movement I guess

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.561
is the right way to put
it was invented from.

00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:39.310
There are actually
several different types

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.622
of project management
that call themselves agile

00:12:41.622 --> 00:12:43.830
and there are several
different techniques and tricks

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.490
that call themselves agile.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.750
The one thing that
they have in common

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.300
is they try to follow the
agile manifesto, which

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:58.210
is individuals interactions
over processes and tools.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.560
Does anyone want to--
let's just go ahead.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.080
Working software over
comprehensive documentation.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.220
Customer collaboration
over contract negotiation.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.940
And responding to change
over following a plan.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.920
So for the first one,
individuals and interactions,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.940
means it's better to get
up and talk to someone

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.120
than to send a whole lot
of change requests over.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.560
Working software.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.180
That's why we ask for
paper prototypes and vision

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.450
statements instead of
a big design document.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.180
It's why we want to see what
it's doing rather than having

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.770
you tell us what it will do.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.120
You don't really have so
much customer collaboration.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.210
So you don't even have
to worry about signing

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.335
contracts and getting people
to observe milestones.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:47.750
That's less of a problem
in a class specifically.

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.770
And responding to change
over following plan

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.412
means that if you discover what
you're doing isn't working,

00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:54.870
you sit down and
you figure out how

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.744
to fix it rather than continuing
to go down the rabbit hole.

00:13:59.744 --> 00:14:03.720
PROFESSOR: I just want to
state that everything on this

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.624
are good things to do.

00:14:05.624 --> 00:14:09.440
Even the things that are
sort of low in priority.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.890
It's good to have
processes and tools.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.562
But it's more
important that you have

00:14:15.562 --> 00:14:18.460
good interactions between the
individuals in your group.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.196
Say if you are saying,
no, I can't actually

00:14:22.196 --> 00:14:24.120
get up and talk to
this person because we

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.855
have a process that
we have to follow.

00:14:25.855 --> 00:14:29.735
Then you're now prioritizing
incorrectly [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:33.615 --> 00:14:39.187
I guess the [INAUDIBLE]
a lot of your classmates

00:14:39.187 --> 00:14:42.400
are going to be people who
are going to play your games.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.170
And you [INAUDIBLE]
collaboration

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.910
is important in that sense
because you just replace that

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.420
with work with your players.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.970
Work with the people who
are going to play your game.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.792
And yes, we did specify this
is what we want you to see.

00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:01.500
This is what we wanted
to see in the game

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.220
that they are going to create.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.750
That's my contract.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.750
Well, that's less important
than actually coming and talking

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.757
to us about problems
that you might

00:15:10.757 --> 00:15:13.490
be having and [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.266
Don't just use our syllabus as a
laundry list of things that you

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:19.350
have to do [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.190
SARA VERRILLI: Yeah.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.000
Yeah.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.510
Thank you.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:29.870
So the model of making
a software project.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.580
I keep wanting to say game,
but this is for any software,

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.720
actually, agile model.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.200
Is that the project start you've
got your vision and your idea

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.400
what you're making.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.500
And then on every
iteration, you go

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.850
through every step, essentially,
of the waterfall process.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.719
You do a little bit of design,
a little bit of detailed design.

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:51.260
You do a little bit
of implementation

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.780
of that particular chunk of
the design you've just created.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.780
Then you spend some time
testing it to make sure

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.940
that, A, it works the way
you expect it to, and B,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.560
it's achieving the
result you want to get.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.730
I.e.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.290
the feature does
what you expect it

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.600
to do as far as improving
the quality of your project.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.730
Then you spend some
time reviewing what

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.131
your overall project is doing.

00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:14.630
Is it still going
the same direction

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.090
you thought it would be going
at the start of project?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.280
Is that the direction
you want to be going in?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.530
And then you can modify
your plan accordingly

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.280
and you start over
with another iteration.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.880
The big savings you have
here and the way in which

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.590
agile management
tends to save time

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.800
over waterfall management
in this project

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.910
is you spend less time designing
features that people don't want

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.157
and more time working on the
features that people do want.

00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:45.240
And that's actually where
the big time savings is.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.190
Agile can't make you
write code faster.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.840
What it can do is make sure
that the code you're writing

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.830
is the code you want
as opposed to the code

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.913
that you end up cutting
at the end of the project.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.070
Some caveats before
we start actually

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.990
talking about how this applies
to you and your project.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.069
Agile is good, not perfect.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.730
Which means once you've
learned the tools and processes

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.530
for agile development,
you will want

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.280
to keep adjusting
and improving them.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.790
You may discover
that we're going

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.650
to give you a set of outlines
and a baker's list of things

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.119
to follow and a recipe
to do project management.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:22.829
And you may discover
that following

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.160
some portions of this
recipe does not work well

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.800
for the group you're in.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.940
Well the right thing to do
is to set those pieces aside

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.120
and figure out a way
to work around it.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.640
A good agile team is always
adjusting their processes

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.790
and trying to improve them.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.800
Agile assumes that
all of your developers

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.470
are interchangeable,
which they're not.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.460
Different programmers
have different skills.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.710
And on a game project
especially, you

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.454
have people who can do art,
people who are better design,

00:17:57.454 --> 00:17:59.370
you have people who are
better at x or y or z.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.070
They're not all interchangeable.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.630
Which means that
it takes more work

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.650
to set up what your task
set that you can get done

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.850
in any particular period
of time on a project

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:12.930
than pure agile was.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.440
Agile says, OK, you've
got this list of tasks.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.110
You've got enough
time to do them.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.822
They'll get done.

00:18:17.822 --> 00:18:19.280
When you're making
a game, you have

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.946
to look more closely
at the dependencies

00:18:20.946 --> 00:18:23.580
and who can get each of
those tasks done to make sure

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.140
that you have not in fact
arranged for two of your team

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.480
members to do
nothing this sprint

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.910
and two of your team
members to do twice as much

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.330
as they actually have time for.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.020
Sprint is the iteration cycle.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.700
I will explain it again later.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.300
I'm trying not to
jump ahead and use

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.990
jargon I haven't introduced,
but it's sometimes a challenge.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.750
Let me know if I use a phrase
that you don't understand,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.790
because I will explain it
or redefine it for you.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.440
Finally, and this
is a problem you're

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.200
likely to run into a
little bit less in class,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.440
but you are more
likely to run into when

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.430
you go into the outside
world and you work

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.760
on teams with different people.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.020
People trained in
different disciplines

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.560
communicate differently.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.970
They have different terminology.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.900
On game teams, this
is really hard.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.000
Because you will often
find, and I'm not actually

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.310
trying to stereotype all
programmers talk like this

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.210
or all artists talk like that.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.449
But it is the case
that the people

00:19:20.449 --> 00:19:21.990
who do programming
and the people who

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:26.970
are creating your assets, be
they art or design or audio,

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:31.200
often will talk past each
other on specific problems.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.150
The artist will not
be able to explain

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.130
why they can't meet
the programmer's

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.880
technical requirements
and the programmers

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.590
will be unwilling
to figure out why

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.090
it is the artist can't meet
those technical requirements.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.798
They've given the
technical requirements.

00:19:44.798 --> 00:19:48.830
Why don't you just make
something that works in it?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.200
Since agile depends on
really good communication

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.700
and the willingness to
solve problems like this,

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.800
this can create a huge tie up,
especially in an agile team.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.380
It can pretty much stop
anything from getting done.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.766
So that's another big red
flag to be aware of when

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:05.890
you're using these methods.

00:20:09.904 --> 00:20:11.400
OK.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.860
So there's more than
one agile system.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.220
The one that we
use, that we have

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.850
the people work in our
labs [INAUDIBLE] use,

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.660
is called Scrum.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.440
Is anybody familiar with Scrum?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.860
Yay, there's a few people.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.360
Anybody used it at internships
and things like that?

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.200
OK.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.700
All right.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.610
So you guys can help your teams
out a little bit hopefully.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.780
So Scrum has three buzz
words, and I may as well

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.113
go ahead and call them buzz
words, because that's really

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.410
what the are, that are
supposed to define it

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.540
and let you understand
what it is about.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.070
They are transparency,
inspection, and adaptability.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.380
You can think of them as
Scrum's vision statement.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.590
Much shorter than a document.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.710
Essentially, if you
are doing Scrum right,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.650
all of your decisions and
processes are transparent.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.110
Everyone on the team who needs
to be involved in a decision

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.960
is and anyone on the team
who wants to understand

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.310
why something was done can.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.840
No one on the team should be
able to say at any point, well,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.850
no one told me about that.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.130
Because it's both the
team's responsibility

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.940
to share information and each
team member's responsibility

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.850
to stay informed.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.840
Everything done by the team
is inspected at some point.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.650
Decisions, processes, team
actions, deliverables, code.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.430
The team thinks proactively
about what they're

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.250
doing, how they're doing it.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.810
And if the team
discovers a problem,

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.470
for example, the build keeps
being broken every night,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.530
the team doesn't just say,
oh, we'll work around it.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.450
Instead it takes responsibility
figuring out how, why,

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.210
and fixing not just
the broken build,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.040
but the processes that
led to the broken build.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.050
And finally, which feeds
back into the other two,

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.540
the team is willing to adapt
any processes and decisions

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.970
to the reality they're
actually dealing with.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.332
When they find a
structural problem,

00:22:04.332 --> 00:22:06.540
for example, how does art
assets getting in the game?

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.170
Well right now we're having the
programmers hand load them in

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:14.430
and we're losing six hours of
programmer time every week.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.100
Instead they sit down and
say, well, how do we fix this?

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.510
Do we take 12 hours
next sprint to code up

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.040
a tool that allows the
artist to put it in,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.370
and then we'll save all
that time going forward?

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:30.120
Do we teach the artists how
do put their art in directly?

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.660
I've had this discussion
on a team in which we

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.030
were losing an awful lot of
time to programmers putting art

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.724
in game.

00:22:39.724 --> 00:22:41.140
And the programmers
were convinced

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.890
it would be faster to
just keep putting it in

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.181
because it would take too
long to teach the artists how

00:22:45.181 --> 00:22:47.880
to do it, despite the fact
that it was eating eight or 12

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.490
hours of programmer
time every week.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.300
I still think they were wrong.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.270
Anyway.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.810
Note that I keep saying
team and team members.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.960
In Scrum, the responsibility
for project management

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.591
doesn't sit with a producer or
design lead or the programming

00:23:04.591 --> 00:23:05.090
lead.

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.490
It's the team's responsibility,
guided by the team members,

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.670
to manage their own project.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.390
That doesn't mean
that a Scrum team

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.170
gets to do whatever they want.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.540
They still have constraints,
requirements, expectations,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.920
project handouts handed down
to them from managers, clients,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.055
instructors, and other people.

00:23:22.055 --> 00:23:24.430
But in exchange for taking
responsibility for the project

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.170
management, Scrum
teams do get to explain

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.890
to the producers, managers,
executives, and outside forces

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.040
just how much they think they
can achieve in a given time.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.860
So you can go ahead
and ask a Scrum team

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.690
for the sky, the earth,
the stars, and the moon,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.110
and an experienced and
empowered Scrum team

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.660
will explain that, OK, in
that time and on that budget,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.140
we can get you a terrarium
with a fancy night light.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.150
So how does this work?

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.540
With vocabulary.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.750
There may or may
not be a quiz later.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.890
So the project cycle.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.960
This is the cycle of a whole
project with the internal cycle

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.007
right there in the middle
where you can see it.

00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:12.090
Looking at it from sort
of the whole project life,

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:17.070
you've got pregame sprint, which
is-- let me start with this.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.810
Let me start with
what a sprint is.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.740
So a sprint is the way that
a Scrum project divides up

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.480
its design iteration cycle.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.530
Sprint length depends
on the project

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.930
and what the team wants.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.120
One month was an early standard.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.760
But a lot of people are now
using two weeks instead.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.240
In this class, we
encourage one week sprints,

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.520
given the length of the
projects and the sort of reality

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.660
of how much you can or
can't get done in a week.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.340
So a six month project can
be divided into six one

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.256
[INAUDIBLE] sprints,
12 two week sprints

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:51.880
depending on what
the team wants to do.

00:24:54.496 --> 00:24:55.870
So much like a
waterfall project,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.330
you've got your design
and vision time.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.700
You've got your
development time and then

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.530
you've got your wrapper time.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.770
Your vision time
is going to be when

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.250
you're coming up with the
idea and the overall outline.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.120
In many ways, that's
what you did on Monday.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.210
That was kind is
you formed teams,

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.580
you got a vision statement.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:19.080
Some people were
even sitting around

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.260
and making feature lists.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.010
That's really your pregame
staging sprint right there.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.870
In the development
sprints, that's

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.980
when you're actually
making the game.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.880
And you're taking a couple
of features every sprint.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.020
You're getting them working,
you're testing them,

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.930
and then you're moving on and
grabbing a few more features,

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.720
getting them working,
and testing them

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.970
until it all comes together.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.510
Product backlog.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.590
Does anybody here know
what a product backlog is?

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.712
Go ahead and tell me.

00:25:53.712 --> 00:25:54.628
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:58.052 --> 00:25:59.010
SARA VERRILLI: Exactly.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.684
Actually not in a
sprint, in the--

00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:02.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.500
SARA VERRILLI: In
the overall project.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.020
Yeah, the product
backlog is in fact

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.720
the feature list
for the whole thing.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.540
Once you've got it,
you take bits of it

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.680
off to make your sprint backlog.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.040
The sprint backlog is what
gets done in every sprint.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.340
Eventually hopefully your
product backlog is at 0.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.710
And some teams, I'm afraid
of your teams are probably

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.545
not going to have
luxury of this,

00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:26.295
take what's called a
wrapper sprint or two

00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:27.775
to kind of hardening.

00:26:27.775 --> 00:26:29.880
You can think of it as
polish and hardening.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.540
Taking the time where you're
not putting in any new features

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.020
but you're making sure that
all the systems really do work.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.050
They're kind of shakedown crews.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.665
So that is the
overall project plan.

00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:45.790
What does it look like on
the inside of the spirit?

00:26:48.315 --> 00:26:50.190
Let me see if I can see
what that looks like.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.900
There we go.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:58.667
So here we have our big
pile of definitions.

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:01.250
So since you're doing a little
bit of project planning, design

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.177
implementation and
testing in every sprint,

00:27:03.177 --> 00:27:05.010
you have to figure out
when and where you're

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.270
doing those things.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.310
Scrum has a fairly I
don't want to say rigid,

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:11.540
but they do have a very well
defined set of processes

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.970
and tools to do that with.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.580
So to handle project
planning and communication,

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.850
every sprint involves a set
of standardized meetings.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.450
Sprint planning, daily
Scrum, sprint review,

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.780
and the retrospective.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.960
To handle the features
and task management,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.010
Scrum teams create and
use a set of tools.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.530
Artifacts is what it's called.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.700
The product backlog, the
sprint backlog, the task list,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.170
and a Scrum board.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.910
At the start of its
development sprint,

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:43.060
the team turns to its
product backlog, which is,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.630
like we said, the feature list.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.820
Holds what's called a sprint
planning meeting in which they

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.600
decide just how many of those
items that can get done.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.250
That list of items that they're
moving from their product

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.640
backlog becomes
the sprint backlog.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.840
From there they
break those features.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.356
Because features coming off of
a backlog, usually fairly large.

00:28:08.356 --> 00:28:10.730
So they'll break them down
into much smaller items called

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.940
tasks.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.350
A task is just a
chunk of work that you

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.860
can estimate fairly well.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.610
Having gotten that
big list of tasks,

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.430
they start working
their way through it.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.036
Every day while they're
working on the project,

00:28:29.036 --> 00:28:30.410
you'll hold a
daily Scrum meeting

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:35.080
where you talk about what you're
doing, how you're doing it,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.260
what you hope to get done.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.380
At the end of the
sprint, you end up

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.949
having a sprint
view where you take

00:28:41.949 --> 00:28:43.240
a look at what you've got done.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.270
You compared what you wanted to
get done with what you actually

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.240
did.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.590
You go ahead and you adjust your
product backlog if you need to.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.940
And then you hold a
retrospective meeting.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.900
And that's where instead of
talking about the product

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.431
and specifically you're
talking about the team

00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:00.180
and the processes.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.540
That's where agile
tries to improve

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.270
the way the team
is working together

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.019
is the retrospective meeting.

00:29:07.019 --> 00:29:09.310
And then you're ready for a
new sprint planning meeting

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.893
and the whole thing
starts over again.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:19.312
OK, I'm almost done
throwing vocabulary at you.

00:29:19.312 --> 00:29:20.770
And then I'll go
back and make sure

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:25.030
that I actually did define
all the vocabulary I've used.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.910
So on the team, I
claimed that the team

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.160
was responsible for all
of its project management.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.150
That's not quite true.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.767
Teams typically have
three kinds of members.

00:29:36.767 --> 00:29:38.600
There's you're sort of
average everyday team

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.308
member, who's someone
on the team working

00:29:40.308 --> 00:29:42.590
to keep things running.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.550
The team has a product owner,
may have a product owner.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.460
In classic Scrum, you
always have a product owner.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.230
Your teams probably won't.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.720
It's much harder to have a
product owner on a student

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.580
team.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.746
And the reason for that is
because the product owner

00:29:58.746 --> 00:30:02.230
is the person who holds the
sole vision of the product.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.240
For classic Scrum
teams, the product owner

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.980
is the person who creates
the product backlog,

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.400
helps them prioritize
it, and lets

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.450
them know which of their
features are the most important

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.550
and whether or not the
features as implemented

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.440
are working the
way they need to.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.010
Your team may be
lucky enough to have

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.900
someone who has a good
enough grasp of the project.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.014
And if you do, it's
really, really valuable.

00:30:27.014 --> 00:30:29.430
It's really helpful to have
one person who you can turn to

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.010
and say, is this going to
work or is this working

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.897
or is this what we had in mind?

00:30:34.897 --> 00:30:37.480
And have one person answer that
instead of having a big debate

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.940
over whether it does or not.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.470
But on student teams, it
can be really hard to have

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.692
someone in that position.

00:30:45.692 --> 00:30:46.900
So that's your product owner.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.990
The other unique person on
your team is a Scrum master,

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.510
and you will need one of those.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.580
The Scrum master is the lucky
person who runs the meetings,

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.520
serves as the facilitator
and the mediator,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.810
and is in charge of making
sure that Scrum is followed

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.530
and the team is working
reasonably smoothly.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.390
They frequently get
stuck with updating

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.050
product backlog, sprint
backlogs, task lists, Scrum

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.970
boards.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.000
Whatever record
keeping paraphernalia

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.720
the team feels it needs to have.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.970
Setting up meetings and
making sure they happen.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.980
Try to think of the Scrum master
as a bit of the team coach

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.060
and as the keeper of
documents rather than

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.240
as the producer or the person
in charge of the project.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.370
Just trying to keep
the backlogs straight,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.400
keeping meetings flowing, and
keeping communication following

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.260
is a lot of work for one person.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.500
You don't also want
to burden that person

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.217
with being in charge
of leading the team

00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:48.675
and making all the
final decisions.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.570
They often end up
drifting together.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.870
And we see a lot.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.920
And we also make
a slip of calling

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.670
the person who's serving
is the team Scrum

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.990
master as the producer.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:03.610
See if you can try to keep
those two roles separate.

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:05.190
If you can let the
Scrum master just

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.020
be the person keeping
the team running

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.500
and you can let someone else
step into that kind of vision

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.371
holder, guide the team role.

00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:15.870
OK?

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.900
All right, I think
that that is, in fact,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.630
what I have to say on that.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:31.580
Everybody think they have at
least a definition or an idea

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.180
for all of these words?

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.430
Here's the quiz later you see.

00:32:37.314 --> 00:32:38.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.892
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

00:32:41.892 --> 00:32:43.350
Should I be mean
and choose the one

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:47.690
that I haven't defined
that nobody admitted to?

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.810
OK, who can tell me
what a Scrum board is?

00:32:57.326 --> 00:32:58.242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.522 --> 00:33:08.230
SARA VERRILLI: That's
exactly what it is.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:16.370
So what a Scrum board
is is it's frequently,

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.620
if you've got a team that
all works in the same place,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.790
it's usually a
big physical board

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:28.290
that you have room to put cards
with all the tasks on it on.

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.170
And you just have it
divided up into sections

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.670
and show the status
of each task.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:36.250
By using a Scrum board, teams
can figure out exactly how far

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:38.230
along they are, what the
state of their project

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:41.520
is by just looking at the board.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.230
Teams that are going
to end up working in

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.040
a much more distributed
fashion and who

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.360
don't have a designated
place to sort of leave

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.452
a Scrum board set up.

00:33:49.452 --> 00:33:50.910
For example, you
guys are not going

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.326
to be able to Scrum boards up
on the back of the classroom

00:33:53.326 --> 00:33:55.610
and come in and check up on
them every couple of days.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.010
There are a couple
of online options.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:01.660
And I will talk about
them when I actually talk

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.175
about Scrum boards
a little bit more,

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.941
asking you to get one set up.

00:34:05.941 --> 00:34:07.982
PROFESSOR: Just out of
curiosity, who has already

00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:09.401
got something like that?

00:34:09.401 --> 00:34:12.888
Like an online site with
all your tasks on it?

00:34:12.888 --> 00:34:14.747
AUDIENCE: We're using Trello.

00:34:14.747 --> 00:34:16.830
PROFESSOR: Trello uses
exactly a Scrum board style

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.583
visual representation.

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:20.219
AUDIENCE: There's
also a Scrum plug

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.265
in for Trello for Chrome
that we can get points

00:34:22.265 --> 00:34:23.002
if you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:23.002 --> 00:34:23.984
PROFESSOR: I did not know that.

00:34:23.984 --> 00:34:24.480
That's new.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.730
SARA VERRILLI: Oh, that's new.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.953
AUDIENCE: It's called Scrum
for Trello or something.

00:34:27.953 --> 00:34:28.536
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:34:28.536 --> 00:34:29.702
PROFESSOR: Scrum for Trello.

00:34:29.702 --> 00:34:30.528
I'll google that.

00:34:30.528 --> 00:34:31.524
What else?

00:34:31.524 --> 00:34:34.014
I thought I saw
another hand go up.

00:34:34.014 --> 00:34:35.508
What are you using?

00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:36.294
AUDIENCE: Asana.

00:34:36.294 --> 00:34:37.002
PROFESSOR: Asana?

00:34:37.002 --> 00:34:37.998
OK.

00:34:37.998 --> 00:34:39.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.498
So is that just [INAUDIBLE]
card like representation,

00:34:42.498 --> 00:34:44.386
or is it more like spreadsheet?

00:34:44.386 --> 00:34:46.746
AUDIENCE: It's more
like a [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:49.947 --> 00:34:51.613
PROFESSOR: And
multiplayers can do this?

00:34:54.511 --> 00:34:56.856
SARA VERRILLI: Yeah, I
haven't used that site.

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:59.336
PROFESSOR: I don't
know any alternatives.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.740
SARA VERRILLI: I will actually
talk about Scrum boards

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.360
a little bit more when we
actually have gotten around

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.460
to making our sprint
backlogs and task lists

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.880
and talking about the techniques
you used to make them.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.610
OK, so we're finally
actually getting

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.037
to the action part
of this story.

00:35:20.037 --> 00:35:20.870
And I'm lying there.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.940
I'm not actually talk about
time boxing right now.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.100
I went back and
updated my lecture

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.350
without updating my slides.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.615
But we are going to
talk about user stories.

00:35:29.615 --> 00:35:31.740
So let's talk about how
you make a product backlog.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.440
Because it is not
just a feature list.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.290
There's actually some
very important differences

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.830
between a feature list
and a product backlog

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.830
that makes a product backlog
a project management tool

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.140
as well as a design tool.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:52.030
So it's an organized,
prioritized feature list.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:55.170
So the team always knows what
the most important next feature

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.300
is.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.000
So if I actually sat down and
looked at one of the product

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.680
backlog you've turned in,
every feature in your game

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.820
should be described or mentioned
in the product backlog.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.170
And each item should
have a priority status

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.920
indicating how important it is,
when are you going to do it.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.480
Are you going to do it first
or you're going do it last?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.257
Or is this the one
that's going to get cut

00:36:18.257 --> 00:36:20.715
when you realize you don't have
time to finish the project?

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.640
So how do you decide what goes
into it and how do you estimate

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.279
and how do you prioritize?

00:36:30.279 --> 00:36:31.320
There's the big question.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.880
So here is a sample
project backlog.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.374
It's not for a game
but it's for some sort

00:36:40.374 --> 00:36:41.540
of log in page or something.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.700
But it serves pretty
much the same purpose.

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:47.620
This is sort of the
minimum you should

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:50.200
have in your product backlog.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.140
Some people get
fancier and include

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.410
lots of extra information,
but that's not necessary.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.574
Keeping it simple,
especially to start,

00:36:58.574 --> 00:37:00.240
will make your life
a little bit easier.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.480
If you discover there's
more information

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.710
you want to track here,
go ahead and do that.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.682
But start with the basics.

00:37:05.682 --> 00:37:08.970
The basics are an ID number.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.050
ID number's not its priority.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.929
It's actually in the order
of which we thought up

00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:14.470
the features.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.280
This is the fifth
feature we thought of.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.740
IDs come in useful when
you start moving tasks off

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.260
of your backlog and
into your sprint backlog

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.660
and breaking them down
into smaller tasks.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.590
So you can use your ID number
to know, oh yes, this feature is

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.670
the same as it is on
the product backlog

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.422
and all of these eight
tasks that came out of it

00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:38.630
are all related to each
other, because they all still

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.005
have the ID number that goes
back to the original product

00:37:41.005 --> 00:37:42.820
backlog.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.800
Then you need a description.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.480
This backlog is
using user stories,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.460
which I'll explain in a moment.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:51.460
But they all have sort
of the same pattern.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.370
As an authorized user, I
want to create new account.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.580
As a authorized user I want to.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.510
As an unauthorized
user, I want to.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.075
So that.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.430
So there's your description
of what the feature is.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.340
Then you need an estimation
of how big a job this is.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.290
For the product backlog,
we don't actually

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.165
recommend trying to do
really fine estimation.

00:38:13.165 --> 00:38:15.300
They're using numbers
in this backlog.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.390
I should make a new one that
uses my preferred system, which

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.680
is actually just using the word
small, medium, large, extra

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.160
large.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.350
And how big is small?

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:29.080
I'm not really sure.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.670
When you first
create your backlog,

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:32.100
you won't be really sure either.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.870
But you could probably
tell the difference

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.530
between a small feature
and a medium feature

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.840
and an extra large feature.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.565
So when you go through and you
write down all your features,

00:38:43.565 --> 00:38:45.690
you can say what are all
the smallest features here

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.080
and call this small.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.420
What's bigger than that?

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.640
That's probably a medium.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.450
What's the biggest
feature I can see here?

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.080
Make that a large.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.439
When you're making
the product backlog,

00:38:56.439 --> 00:38:57.980
you don't want to
spend a lot of time

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.980
figuring out estimation
and trying to figure out

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.710
exactly how many hours
it's going to take

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.760
and how many subtasks
are involved.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.690
What you want to
do is get a feel

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.760
for the overall size of
the features and a feel

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.820
for how big they are in
relation to each other.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.820
Because if you're
fairly good at saying

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.200
this is about the same size
feature is this and this

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.790
is about the same
size feature as that.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.580
Once you realize that feature
A took you three hours

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.910
and you have four
other small features,

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:28.940
it's not that hard
to go, oh, so that's

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.540
a total of about 12 hours
between those four features.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.360
So that is the format
of a product backlog.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.068
Are there any questions?

00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:44.400
No?

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.086
OK.

00:39:45.086 --> 00:39:47.169
PROFESSOR: Just want to
point out occasionally you

00:39:47.169 --> 00:39:50.904
come across a feature that's
actually not one feature.

00:39:50.904 --> 00:39:53.394
It's actually a whole
bunch all rolled up in one.

00:39:53.394 --> 00:39:55.732
Like multiplayer or
something like that.

00:39:55.732 --> 00:39:56.815
SARA VERRILLI: Networking.

00:39:56.815 --> 00:39:59.014
AUDIENCE: It's not
a single feature.

00:39:59.014 --> 00:40:03.104
It's a whole bunch
of different things.

00:40:03.104 --> 00:40:06.331
If you come across features that
clearly warp everything else

00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:07.705
that you've got
on your list, you

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:11.855
should try to bring those down
and do small and large chunks.

00:40:11.855 --> 00:40:14.414
So you can be like
multiplayer [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:14.414 --> 00:40:17.805
multiplayer matchmaking.

00:40:17.805 --> 00:40:19.590
All of these things
are separate features.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.610
SARA VERRILLI: But I
will say that when you're

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.920
making your first pass
at a product backlog,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.080
it's OK to stick multiplayer
on there as a feature

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.360
and then right next to
it, extra, extra large.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.840
And realize you're going to come
back and break it down later.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.920
When you're making your
first product backlog,

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.670
you don't want to be
worrying about, well,

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:38.909
what are all the little sub
features of multiplayer?

00:40:38.909 --> 00:40:41.450
But you do want to go ahead and
acknowledge that, oh my gosh,

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:45.370
we've just put something
ginormous on the list.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:48.240
And using a very
rough estimation tool

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.020
lets you do that and move onto
getting all of your features

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.520
in.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.020
And then you can come
back and honestly

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.540
estimate them a lot more
finely when you're actually

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.382
thinking that you
might put them in

00:40:58.382 --> 00:40:59.840
or when you're
actually determining

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:04.150
what their overall priority is
and how badly you want them.

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.650
Because if you end up deciding
you want to drop multiplayer,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.780
there's no point having
spent a lot of time

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.820
dividing it up into 12
or 14 different features.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:16.740
All right, so I
mentioned user stories

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.980
and I did not actually
define them very well,

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.480
and that's because I was going
to come along and define them

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.060
here.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.220
So a user story is just
a very specific way

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.140
to describe a feature.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.530
It is, I think, unique to Scrum.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.660
Although there may be
other agile methodologies

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.130
that have stolen it as a
way of describing a feature.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.030
And we're going to ask
you use user stories

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.190
for project two at least.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.350
Just to get you familiar with
it and understand why we think

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:46.020
they're a neat idea.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.510
You may end up deciding that you
don't like them and that's OK.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.220
But we want you to at
least experiment with them.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:59.630
So the goal of the user story is
to help you phrase your feature

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.120
in a clearly testable
and understandable manner

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.530
to someone who did not help
you write the document.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.220
OK?

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:15.700
So a user story
follows the formula

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.960
of as the person who is going
to use this feature, which

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.540
could be the user.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.314
It could be the designer if
you're creating a level editor.

00:42:25.314 --> 00:42:27.730
Could be the artist if you're
creating something for them.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.250
It could be another
set of coders

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.720
if you're creating tools.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.820
But the important
thing is to recognize

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.176
who are you making this feature
for and who is going to use it.

00:42:37.176 --> 00:42:40.590
Then you want to describe
what it's going to do.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.550
And that description should
be something you can test.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.220
So that when someone goes ahead
and gets this completed feature

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.780
on the other end, they
can go in pretending

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.310
to be whoever that person
is, use that feature,

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.290
and confirm that it works.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:02.400
Finally, you want
the end third, which

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.070
is so that-- explain the reason
why you want the feature there.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.381
What is the purpose of
this feature in your game?

00:43:11.381 --> 00:43:12.255
What is it achieving?

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.520
Can anybody think
about why this is

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.770
an interesting or useful format
for stating a feature in?

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.432
Can you see any benefits in it?

00:43:23.432 --> 00:43:25.890
I can go ahead and tell you
what we think the benefits are,

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:27.848
but I'm wondering if you
guys can think of any.

00:43:30.768 --> 00:43:34.184
AUDIENCE: It's testable
and focused on the player,

00:43:34.184 --> 00:43:36.640
or other relative entity.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.540
SARA VERRILLI: Yep.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.250
That's one.

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:44.250
OK.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.130
So it's testable,
which means that you

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.560
can confirm it's working.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.601
It's focused on the person
who's going to use it.

00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:51.990
We're going back to that
sort of user oriented

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.510
creation of product.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.025
And finally, having
the reason there

00:43:56.025 --> 00:43:59.130
means that if the person
who originally asked

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.430
for the feature did not
understand the game well enough

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:06.360
and asked for a lousy feature
or one that doesn't work well

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.420
with the game, the person
who is going to implement it

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:14.150
can come back and say, hey,
you asked for a physics engine.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:19.140
But you want it so the player
can drop rocks into a pool

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.680
and watch the rocks sink.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.140
That's the only use of
your physics engine.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.700
We can make this a
lot faster and easier

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.600
if I write an animation hack
that shows this happening.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.520
And we can give you
some sliders to control

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:38.920
how fast it falls depending
on the weight of the rock.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.850
And people will often
say they want something

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.820
that is bigger or smaller
or doesn't actually

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.220
do what they want it to do.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.220
It's really common when
you're writing features.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.480
It happens all the time.

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.714
And so having that
reason there means

00:44:51.714 --> 00:44:53.880
that the team can go back
and do a double check when

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.770
they actually go to implement
it that the thing that's

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:59.870
being asked for is something
that is really needed.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:04.080
And so it puts a double check
right back in the feature.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.110
And it's not as good as
going back and talking

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.860
to the person who
wrote the feature,

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.812
but it's at least a
warning signal telling you

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:12.520
that you might want
to go talk to someone

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.120
and make sure this is
really what they need

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.203
and really what they want.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.320
So I think I already
just went over this.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:29.225
So because user stories
have that check in them,

00:45:29.225 --> 00:45:30.600
you can make sure
you're actually

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.435
doing the work you want to
do and not some other work.

00:45:33.435 --> 00:45:35.560
One of the things that
agile is really trying to do

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.006
is focus on making sure that
you're not doing extra work.

00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:40.130
You're not doing work that
doesn't need to be done,

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.000
that's going to
get cut later on.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.380
And so a lot of the tools
and a lot of the processes

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.060
and a lot of the language
and a lot of meetings

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.350
are all about making sure
that before you go out and put

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.220
a lot of time into something,
it's really the thing that you

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.450
want to be doing.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.790
And user stories are
just one more way

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:00.260
to add that check
into your process.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:10.410
I'm going to skip on time
boxing right now because I've

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.410
got a better discussion.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.812
It's more relevant to meetings.

00:46:12.812 --> 00:46:14.520
And I'd rather talk
about it in meetings.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.880
So we'll skip talking
about it there.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.450
OK, that is actually
the first two thirds

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:21.964
of the lecture for today.

00:46:21.964 --> 00:46:24.380
And I was going to propose
that we take a 10 minute break.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.796
And when you come
back, it will be

00:46:25.796 --> 00:46:30.270
time to make a product
backlog for your team.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.655
I'm going to give you
half an hour to do it in.

00:46:33.655 --> 00:46:37.830
And that half an hour
will also include the time

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.550
to prepare a two minute
presentation on what

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.110
the features for
your product are

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.589
and what an updated
vision statement

00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:48.880
for your game, since things
may have shifted a bit when

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.270
you added new people.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.350
No visual aids.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.490
Just come up, talk
for up to two minutes.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:54.884
It's OK if you talk for less.

00:46:54.884 --> 00:46:56.550
The faster we get
through presentations,

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.880
the faster we get
to other things.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.106
And then we'll move on to
talking about meetings.

00:47:04.106 --> 00:47:06.439
AUDIENCE: Is there a sample
on Stellar, a sample backlog

00:47:06.439 --> 00:47:07.340
on Stellar?

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.780
SARA VERRILLI: There is not
the sample backlog on Stellar,

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.770
I think.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:12.521
We think there is?

00:47:12.521 --> 00:47:14.103
AUDIENCE: If there
is, we'll put it up

00:47:14.103 --> 00:47:15.924
by the time we get
back from break.

00:47:15.924 --> 00:47:18.390
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:22.210
Yeah, in many ways I actually
recommend you go into Google

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.600
and create a Google spreadsheet.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.270
Give it an ID and priority and
status and going from there.

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:31.686
But yeah.

00:47:31.686 --> 00:47:33.090
OK.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.290
SARA VERRILLI: Is it there?

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.510
Yes, sample product backlog.

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:39.090
OK.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.290
It is there.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.770
Thank you, Rick.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.970
I forgot to check on Stellar.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.220
All right, that
said, it is 1:52.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:51.211
Come back in 10 minutes and
start working on your product

00:47:51.211 --> 00:47:51.710
backlogs.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.970
But go stretch your
legs a little bit.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.310
OK so it's 2:02.

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.570
If you are not already sitting
in your project groups,

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.110
you should probably go
ahead and get together

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:08.500
in your project teams.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.410
At 2:32.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.160
2:35, we'll give you
some to move around.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.960
2:35 we will go ahead and we'll
make a list for signing up

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.690
and we'll run through
the presentations.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.342
OK?

00:48:22.342 --> 00:48:24.800
If there any questions or you
want to know what's going on,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.030
if you'd like some advice, we'll
be all hanging on down here.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.630
So please feel free
to come and ask us

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.610
for any advice or any
help or anything you need.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.524
OK?

00:48:34.524 --> 00:48:35.023
OK.

00:48:44.476 --> 00:48:45.300
One moment.

00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:51.615
We don't need that
plugged in right now.

00:48:51.615 --> 00:48:52.115
OK.

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.825
So let's go ahead.

00:48:56.825 --> 00:49:02.290
I'm guessing everybody's
ready for presentations.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.240
OK.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.655
Then let's ask Comcastic
to come on down.

00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:16.620
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.690
So the goal of
Comcastic is to be

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:22.240
able to place internet
service stations into towns

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.660
so that you can service
neighborhood and get money.

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.570
And then eventually you want
to build your monopoly cable

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:29.280
empire to become very wealthy.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.580
And so the core features
that are necessary

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.830
in order to enable us are being
able to look at the town map.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.014
You need to be able
to place pieces.

00:49:38.014 --> 00:49:39.680
You need to be able
to rotate the pieces

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.150
because the orientation
does matter.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:45.400
You also need to be able to
have some kind of [INAUDIBLE],

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.790
so you want like an end turn
button or something that

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.800
happens when you place a piece.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.890
And that will also give you the
money results for that turn.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.360
You also need to be able to
know how much money you have

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.370
and be able to place
pieces only on legal spots

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.480
and to be able to
start the game,

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.570
quit the game, things like that.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.692
So those are the core
features of Comcastic.

00:50:05.692 --> 00:50:07.656
SARA VERRILLI: Thank you.

00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:10.111
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:12.566
All right, Blind Alien.

00:50:18.934 --> 00:50:20.350
STUDENT 2: Blind
Alien's team goal

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.000
is to create a creepy
and enthralling game.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.176
In order to do
that, we first need

00:50:25.176 --> 00:50:27.300
to have really basic
structure, which is what we're

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.840
going to focus on this week.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.220
We're going to focus on having
first a start menu, where

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.660
we can just say the
instructions really fast

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:36.580
and input the number of
aliens, which is going

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.230
to be important for testing.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:41.770
Because you need to be able
to change things quickly.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.570
And then we're going to have
the main screen, a character,

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.740
character movement,
aliens, alien movement,

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.200
and then this
weekend we're going

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.230
to get up together and
work on the interactions

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.750
of those aliens
and the character

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.800
and then work on shooting.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.240
So that's what
we're focusing on.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.862
Thank you.

00:50:58.862 --> 00:51:01.838
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:03.822
SARA VERRILLI: All right.

00:51:03.822 --> 00:51:04.405
Plunder Winds.

00:51:12.254 --> 00:51:13.270
STUDENT 3: Hi.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:17.370
So for Plunder Winds we're
implementing a similar game

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:18.870
to our paper prototype.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:24.700
So we're a grid based, or
tile based, turn based game.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.530
And built around
three core mechanics.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:31.452
Our mechanics are a
random encounter mechanic

00:51:31.452 --> 00:51:34.240
where every square possibly
has either treasure or pirates.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.860
A exploration mechanic
where you revealed

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:41.910
the risk level of nearby tiles.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:44.630
And so that can
change what pirates

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.680
will do to you if you actually
land on that square, something

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:48.390
like that.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:50.750
And then a wind
mechanic, which controls

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:53.800
which directions you can move.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.960
And so our goals
for this week are

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.510
to try and implement as much as
our core mechanics as possible

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:05.854
so that we can possibly
look into stretch goals

00:52:05.854 --> 00:52:08.020
for our games, like possibly
implementing one or two

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:13.280
unique abilities to improve
playability over next week.

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.774
SARA VERRILLI: Thank you.

00:52:14.774 --> 00:52:16.766
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:19.256 --> 00:52:20.252
Lost Underground.

00:52:24.209 --> 00:52:25.375
STUDENT 4: Lost Underground.

00:52:30.025 --> 00:52:30.890
Scared for a second.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.360
The overall goal is to create
a game that people will like.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.200
It'll be random and
will allow exploration.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.690
Our goals for the
weekend are to create

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:48.490
the basic bare bones you
could walk around a map,

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:51.040
you can drop bombs.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:53.760
Make the most basic part
out and then build up

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.160
on everything else.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.570
The features that we're
thinking of planning.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.340
The most important
features of the game,

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.390
which are the ones we'll
be working on this weekend,

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.600
will just be being
able to move around

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:08.540
the board, a board, a general
board, dropping bombs,

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:16.822
and possibly the most basic,
nice looking art that we can.

00:53:16.822 --> 00:53:19.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:23.648
SARA VERRILLI: Beaver Evolution.

00:53:23.648 --> 00:53:26.791
PROFESSOR: Just a quick
point, the most basic art

00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:28.624
that you can make is
probably not the nicest

00:53:28.624 --> 00:53:29.665
looking art you can make.

00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:31.014
So just [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:36.972 --> 00:53:38.680
STUDENT 5: All right,
so Beaver Evolution

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.830
is a 2D turn based game
where you're trying

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:43.960
to progress your beaver colony.

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:46.454
And one of our main core
mechanics of this game

00:53:46.454 --> 00:53:48.120
is that you have three
different choices

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.810
you can make every turn
in order to progress

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.230
to one of the many wind
conditions we have in the game.

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:56.020
So this is going to be
one of our main focus

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.960
for this weekend.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.450
We want to be able
to implement a board,

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.890
want to be able sort of
select how to build our dams,

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.650
and we want to
make it really easy

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:07.890
to incorporate the three
different choices we

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:09.880
have every turn.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:15.240
So our main focus will be
also on creating a UI, which

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.550
makes it really to sort of
figure out what you can do,

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:22.227
what sort of resources
you have, like how far

00:54:22.227 --> 00:54:24.320
is your beaver
colony progressing.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.730
And I think our
second main mechanic,

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.520
which is including
the randomness

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:37.650
factor, such as the disasters
and that kind of stuff.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.709
That sort of stuff can be
added later in the projects.

00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:43.000
We don't need to focus on that.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.750
Right now we just
want to focus on being

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.620
sure we can play
through the game,

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.190
make sure that's not
confusing to the player,

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:51.200
and that you can
do it without sort

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.602
of adding any sort
of the features that

00:54:54.602 --> 00:54:55.812
require more balance.

00:54:58.716 --> 00:55:01.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:02.354 --> 00:55:03.395
SARA VERRILLI: Magi Dice.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.230
STUDENT 6: Hi, we're Magi Dice.

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:18.210
We want to make a fun,
engaging puzzle games where

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:20.425
the player moves around
dice on a board to try

00:55:20.425 --> 00:55:25.470
and using modular arithmetic
create 0's and set

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.740
of combo chains.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.130
So our goal for the first
week is, first of all, just

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:31.610
set up the board and the
dice so that the player can

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:32.960
see what they're doing.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.220
And then our immediate
following goal

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.170
is to incentivize
players to create combos

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:41.940
that multiple moves earn them,
like, create 0s in a row.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.410
And we want to do this by
giving them more points

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.040
and having a pretty UI
so they're incentivized

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.465
to set up and do fun stuff.

00:55:51.568 --> 00:55:54.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:55.229 --> 00:55:56.645
SARA VERRILLI:
Sparkly Redemption.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:06.020
STUDENT 7: OK,
Sparkly Redemption.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.290
2D real time game
where you shoot

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.272
monsters and pick up sparklies.

00:56:10.272 --> 00:56:12.730
And the important thing is that
when you pick up sparklies,

00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:15.950
you either get a different
weapon or the monsters

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:17.330
change their behavior.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:19.730
That means the core thing
we really need to implement

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:24.340
is to have a [INAUDIBLE] you
can move around, have monsters

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.300
with at these two
different behaviors,

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.240
because the swapping
is important,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.530
and have sparklies
that you can pick up.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.160
[INAUDIBLE] needs at least
two different attacks.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.690
So that's probably what we're
going to focus on at this time.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:43.920
I guess it'll also be sort of
important to have it be easily

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.640
visible at a glance
the difference

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.610
what the current
monster behavior is,

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:50.750
what your current
attack is, and I guess

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.310
how many sparklies you have.

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:55.780
And so I guess it's not the
most, most critical thing

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.870
to have this week, but
we're probably also going

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:02.570
to try and get it so that
you can see what's going on

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:06.465
and not just have to
sort of guess at it.

00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:09.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:26.623 --> 00:57:27.664
SARA VERRILLI: All right.

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.580
OK.

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.435
So you did product backlogs.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:50.822
On Monday you did a fair
chunk of your planning sprint.

00:57:50.822 --> 00:57:53.030
You finished up sort of the
second half of that today

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.030
by getting your product
backlog pulled together.

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:04.320
To close out today, I'm going
to talk about the meetings that

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.990
are involved in Scrum.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.190
We're not actually going
to have you hold them

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:12.960
all here because A, they
wouldn't be very useful.

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.570
It would take a lot of time.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:20.500
And because we're introducing
Scrum alongside the project,

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.036
the timing doesn't fall
well as we introduce things,

00:58:23.036 --> 00:58:24.410
would be the right
way to put it.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:29.460
We are hoping you will use
these meetings in project three

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.620
as you start planning
out your project

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.030
and figuring things out.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:35.950
So I do want to
talk about how you

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:37.930
run the meetings we
talked about that

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.950
occur within a Scrum cycle.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:47.570
But first I'm just going
to talk about meetings.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:51.270
And meetings as a force for good
as opposed to how most of us

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:54.130
probably think of
them, which is, let's

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:57.000
be honest, as a force for evil.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.402
As a force for evil, they
suck away a lot of time.

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:01.610
If you have a six person
team and you have a one hour

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:06.900
meeting, that's six
hours of work gone.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.360
So you want to make sure
that those six hours of work

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:13.930
are actually good and
useful hours of work.

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:20.790
There are three primary
tools to do this that we're

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.120
going to talk about here.

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.150
We're going to talk about time
boxing, having a clear agenda,

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:29.250
and having involved
participants.

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:33.410
Has anybody here
heard of time boxing

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.260
and do you know what
that concept is?

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:38.830
OK.

00:59:38.830 --> 00:59:43.790
Timeboxing is when you decide
before you have the meeting

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:47.340
or before you start any
particular activity how

00:59:47.340 --> 00:59:50.710
much time you're
going to let it take.

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:53.100
You give the task a
time budget and you

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:56.020
don't exceed that time budget.

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.860
For example, sprints are
just one big time box.

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:00.829
You're defining that.

01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:02.870
Here's the set of things
we're going to get done,

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:04.249
we have a week to do them in.

01:00:04.249 --> 01:00:05.790
When we're done with
that week, we're

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.770
going to stop and see
how much we got done,

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:11.990
and we're going to move on
from there and reevaluate.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:14.600
Meetings can do this too.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.200
And all meetings in Scrum
should be time boxed.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.280
It's one of the
classic Scrum rules

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.640
is that meetings are time boxed.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.940
They have a limited amount
of time you spend on them.

01:00:27.489 --> 01:00:29.030
Time boxing acknowledges
that there's

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:30.529
sort of a maximum
amount of time you

01:00:30.529 --> 01:00:33.020
can spend on any particular
problem before any time

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.490
after that is wasted.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.380
It does mean that
you won't always

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.120
reach the perfect solution.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.047
Because if you've given yourself
an hour to discuss a problem

01:00:45.047 --> 01:00:46.630
and you've talked
about it for an hour

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.970
and you haven't quite
come to a great solution,

01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:51.870
you stop talking anyway.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.130
You decide what the
most reasonable solution

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:58.280
you've talked about is and
you go ahead and do that.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.270
It's sort of an
implementation of a theory

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:04.280
that the perfect is
the enemy of the good.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.300
It may be that if you went ahead
and talked for another hour,

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:10.877
you would find the perfect and
ideal solution to the problem.

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:12.710
But it's also very
possible that you're just

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.870
going to spend another
hour talking about it.

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.270
It may be better and
it usually is better

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.460
to go ahead with the
best solution you

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.960
came up with and start
implementing that

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.140
and see how it works.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.780
So that's the idea
behind time boxing.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.760
Clear agendas.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.710
If you don't know why
you're having a meeting,

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:33.820
you probably shouldn't
be having it.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.030
The meetings that
Scrum recommends

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.167
come with a built in agenda
for what you want to do.

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:42.000
You'll probably have
to have other meetings.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.400
Because at point you'll
have to talk about

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.650
to figure out how your
version control is working

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.510
or how this feature is working
or how the art assets go

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.260
into the game or what
kind of sound assets

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.790
you're going to have.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:53.637
Before you go ahead
and have that meeting,

01:01:53.637 --> 01:01:55.220
make sure you know
what the goal of it

01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:00.800
is, what you want to come
out of it with, and honestly,

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.600
leading into the next
point, who actually need

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.290
to be there at the meeting.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.920
Not all meetings
require the whole team.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.270
A lot of meetings are really
good as just one on one

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:14.016
conversations or just a
small group of people,

01:02:14.016 --> 01:02:16.390
a subgroup of people who are
working on a particular task

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.806
and get together
and talk about it

01:02:17.806 --> 01:02:20.550
without including everyone else.

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.280
The other half of
involved participants

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.040
is if you are in a
meeting, be in the meeting.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.830
Don't be coding
in the background.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:31.770
Don't be checking your cell
phone and texting something.

01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:33.620
Don't work on a problem set.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.750
Go ahead and be there.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.460
Accept that you have dedicated
the next 15 or 20 minutes

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.080
to working with your
coworkers to solve

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.680
this particular problem.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.335
Get the problem solved, get the
meeting over, and then get back

01:02:45.335 --> 01:02:48.020
to doing useful things.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:53.219
So those really are the
ways to make meetings useful

01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:55.260
and to make them work for
you rather than working

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.980
against you.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.500
All right, that
said I'm now going

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.510
to go ahead and talk a little
bit about each of the meetings.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:04.990
So starting at the
sprint planning meeting,

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:08.630
which you've actually
already mostly done.

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:12.325
We will do it in class
on-- you've already

01:03:12.325 --> 01:03:14.950
done a good chunk of that, which
is making the product backlog.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.700
We're going to do
this on Monday.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.490
We're actually going to go ahead
and take your product backlog

01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:23.070
and break it down into
a sprint task list

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.150
and start making tasks.

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:26.500
So we will have a in class
sprint planning meeting

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:30.600
for your next sprint next week.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.870
But a sprint planning
meaning sets the team's goals

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:37.640
for the sprint and has
the deliverable, its goal,

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.940
of a sprint backlog
and an estimated task

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:40.810
list for the sprint.

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:43.070
So you know exactly
how many hours of work

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:46.280
you think you are going to
get done over the next week.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.500
And it is time boxed
to one to two hours.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.530
For a team your size,
one hour's probably good.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:54.160
For an inexperienced
team your size,

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:58.400
1 and a half hours might
actually be better.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.260
So the more you do
this, the faster

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.235
you get at it because
the easier it gets.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:12.100
At the end of the sprint,
on the other side of it,

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.620
is the sprint review meeting.

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.000
It has the deliverables of
demonstrating your working

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.940
product, in this case
your finished project two.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.280
It is a chance for your team
to stop and review and evaluate

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.870
your product and decide if
that's actually what you want.

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:30.076
If you have clients to go
ahead and say yes, that's

01:04:30.076 --> 01:04:31.950
what we want, keep
working in that direction.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.019
Or to say, oh my gosh,
this is exactly not

01:04:34.019 --> 01:04:35.060
what we were thinking of.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.410
Quick, change everything.

01:04:37.410 --> 01:04:40.050
So the other thing you do
in the sprint review meeting

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:41.580
after you've
reviewed the product

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.757
is change and update
your product backlog.

01:04:43.757 --> 01:04:45.340
Because it may be
some of the features

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.740
that you thought were
really important before you

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.460
went into this sprint
have turned out

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.160
to be less important.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.600
Or it might be that you
thought of five new features

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.580
that you really need
to put into the game

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.810
and that it's worth cutting
some of the other features you

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:00.960
already had on the list.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.700
So the sprint review meeting
sets up your sprint planning

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.590
meeting by getting your
product backlog in shape

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.500
to go and prepare
for the next sprint.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.280
It also is time boxed
to about one hour,

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.655
again, for a team your size.

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:22.609
The other end of sprint
meeting is the retrospective,

01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:24.400
which is not the same
as the sprint review.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.860
A lot of teams try to
smash a sprint review

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.990
meeting and a retrospective
meaning into the same one.

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.580
And they have very
different purposes.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.220
Sprint review meeting is all
about reviewing your product.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.092
The retrospective is about
reviewing your process.

01:05:39.092 --> 01:05:43.100
It's about talking
about the team.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.830
Ideally, it kind of
recognizes the things

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:46.663
that went right, the
things that went wrong,

01:05:46.663 --> 01:05:50.800
and generates a short list,
at least one or two items,

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.666
of things to do
differently next time

01:05:52.666 --> 01:05:54.790
because they will improve
the things that happened.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:01.277
So it's a forward looking
meeting despite its name.

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:02.360
The name is retrospective.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.000
It's looking back at
what happened in the past

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.880
to see what you can do
better in the future.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.150
If you do your team
retrospective well,

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:12.040
it actually will
be a lot of what

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:16.190
we're asking for in our
postmortem write ups.

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:19.630
Because really that's what we're
looking for in the postmortems

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.270
is understanding what
you did, why you did it,

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.187
how it could be improved.

01:06:24.187 --> 01:06:26.020
We want to know what
sinkholes you fell into

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.645
and how you climbed
out of them and how

01:06:27.645 --> 01:06:29.811
you would build a bridge
over the sinkhole next time

01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:30.996
so you don't fall into it.

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:36.990
Finally, there's
the daily Scrum.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:39.410
And this is the meaning
that happens it regularly

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:40.590
over the sprint.

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:43.560
Every day, or if your team
is not meeting every day,

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.080
every time your team meets.

01:06:48.147 --> 01:06:49.730
The goal of the daily
Scrum is to keep

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.440
the team accountable
to each other

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.830
and to encourage
communication across the team.

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:57.152
If everyone's being
honest at the daily scrum,

01:06:57.152 --> 01:06:58.610
there's really no
excuse for anyone

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.850
to not know the full state
of the project, especially

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:05.610
when it's combined with a Scrum
board with all the tasks up.

01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:07.110
Daily Scrum are
also actually called

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:09.231
daily standups,
because a lot of teams

01:07:09.231 --> 01:07:11.230
do them standing up in
order to keep them short.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.350
Classically it's time
boxed at 15 minutes.

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:19.370
For teams your size,
five to six minutes

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.440
is probably actually enough.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.170
Because all each
person has to do

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:29.340
is stand up and answer
these three questions.

01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.610
What did you yesterday or
since our last meeting?

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:33.940
So what have you gotten done?

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.710
What are you going to do today?

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:37.480
What's on your task list?

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:43.550
And finally, what is keeping
you from getting things done?

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:44.440
What's blocking you?

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.412
How come you can't
get things done?

01:07:46.412 --> 01:07:47.870
And sometimes the
answer is nothing

01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:50.310
and sometimes the answer
is something, in which case

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.570
it needs to get dealt with.

01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:54.890
The place where daily Scrum
often go wrong and end up

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:57.620
taking longer than their
five minutes or 15 minutes

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:00.400
is when people start mentioning
what they're being blocked by

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.459
and everyone jumps in to
help them solve the problem.

01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:05.500
That's not actually what
you do at a daily Scrum.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.000
You don't solve the
problem at the daily Scrum.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.090
You mention it, someone
makes a note of it

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.900
so everyone's aware of it,
you get the meeting over,

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.550
and then the people
who actually need

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.180
to be involved to
solve the problem

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.420
talk to solve the problem.

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.210
Once again, it's invoking
that principle of,

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:23.910
if you don't need to be at a
meeting, don't be at a meeting.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:30.120
So that is my comment
on daily Scrums.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.859
And I was going to have you
guys try and do one today,

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.729
but I actually don't think
that would be very useful.

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:39.479
I think you've already really
probably done a lot of that

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:42.600
in sitting down and talking
about your product backlogs.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:45.600
So I think I would prefer
to go ahead and close out

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.760
my lecture here and give
you the rest of the hour

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.679
to continue working in your
teams on your projects.

01:08:50.679 --> 01:08:52.220
PROFESSOR: One thing
we can recommend

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.082
is that since most
of your teams seem

01:08:55.082 --> 01:08:57.184
to be planning on meeting
up sometime between now

01:08:57.184 --> 01:08:59.181
and Monday-- and I
certainly encourage

01:08:59.181 --> 01:09:03.130
that-- plan to do this
during that next meeting,

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:06.800
if it's on the weekend, if it's
on Friday, if it's tomorrow.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.616
Whenever that is, do this
and ask every single person

01:09:09.616 --> 01:09:10.614
these three questions.

01:09:10.614 --> 01:09:12.610
And be prepared,
personally prepared,

01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:14.302
to answer all of
the three questions.

01:09:14.302 --> 01:09:16.218
The thing that could be
blocking you is you've

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:18.830
got a horrible head cold.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.160
Your computer just fried.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:21.660
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.930
I have a problem with
my web game engine.

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:31.454
And there's probably
somebody else

01:09:31.454 --> 01:09:34.356
on the team who can help
you figure that out.

01:09:34.356 --> 01:09:36.120
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.522
It could be another class
that's giving you problems.

01:09:38.522 --> 01:09:40.939
That's also a
perfectly fine answer.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:43.461
You want your team to
know what's preventing you

01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:45.319
from getting stuff done.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.270
SARA VERRILLI: The other thing
you should do over this weekend

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.689
and have chosen by the
time you come in on Monday

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:54.480
is a Scrum master for your team.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.694
And from the instructor's
point of view,

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.110
that's the person
who is primarily

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:02.010
responsible for
uploading documents,

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:04.870
vision documents, product
backlogs, design change

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:08.339
logs, making sure that we
have a link to your project

01:10:08.339 --> 01:10:09.380
when the project is done.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.600
Because we don't need
everyone on the team

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.200
to do the joint team turns.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:15.010
We really only need
one person to do it.

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.470
From the team's point of
view, should be the person

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:20.440
helping you do Scrum.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.610
And that's all I have for today.

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:25.293
So do you have
anything else, Rick?

01:10:25.293 --> 01:10:26.376
RICK EBERHARDT: Deadlines.

01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:28.659
So turn in your
vision documents,

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.200
the ones you just
worked on, that you

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.634
updated with you new team.

01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:34.272
Turn them into Stellar by the
end of class today please.

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:35.730
SARA VERRILLI: I
was telling people

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:38.690
since we had the date wrong,
in case something went horribly

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:41.420
awry, they had until the
end of the day today.
