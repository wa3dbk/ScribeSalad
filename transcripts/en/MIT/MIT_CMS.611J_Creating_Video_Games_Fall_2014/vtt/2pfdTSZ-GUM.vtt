00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.340
PROFESSOR: All right, so let's
go ahead and get started.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.450
A couple quick announcements
before we jump into the day.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.700
We had a couple
questions about what

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.200
happens if one of
my team members

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.655
dropped out of the class
for this first project?

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:36.530
Has anybody had that?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.500
OK, so if somebody
drops out of your team

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.320
at any point in next first
two projects, that's OK.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.560
You're not going to be penalized
for having fewer people.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.880
You're not going to be propped
for having fewer people.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.900
It's basically we're
not necessarily

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780
grading the quality of the
games for this first project

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.666
right now.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.290
Double check the
project one assignment

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.500
to see what the grading
rubric is for that.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.770
What we are checking is
are you doing iteration?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.660
Have you tested the
game multiple times?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.650
Do you have multiple
versions of the game?

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.170
So that's basically reflected
in your design change log

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050
that you're doing
for this class.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.270
There's also an
individual write up.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.750
So we're asking you
to write a one page

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.660
paper about your experience
with the requirements for that

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.460
are in the assignment.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.404
We want to know what happened
when your teammate dropped out.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:29.320
Did it feel different?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.450
If you had two people
versus three people,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.290
do you feel like
you had fewer ideas?

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.373
That's actually a really
interesting thing for you

00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:36.210
to understand about.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.584
When you're coming together
and working on group projects

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:40.390
and you're doing
collaborative projects,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.920
what does team size do to
the kind of ideas you have,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.170
the number of ideas you have,
and the quality of ideas

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.646
you have?

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:49.145
In all the later
projects, your team

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.970
is going to be big enough
that dropping one member

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.550
isn't going to be
huge difference.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.970
Dropping two might.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.377
So if that happens, just
let us know about it.

00:01:57.377 --> 00:01:58.460
We'll talk you through it.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.230
It'll be OK.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.094
We'll get through it.

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:02.760
ANDREW GRANT: If I
may, this is actually

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.690
part of the experience
of working on a team.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.744
Sometimes you lose people, and
sometimes that's a problem.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:11.410
I like to call it the
hit by a bus test.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.332
If your team can't stand losing
one person-- any one person--

00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:16.290
then you have to plan
around that and make sure

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.784
you can handle it.

00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:19.950
Other people like to call
it the winning the lottery

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.866
test because that's nicer,
but basically one person

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:23.990
gets taken out of equation.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.448
You do have to adapt to that
and be ready for it to happen.

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:30.000
Again, on this project, it's
a relatively-- the teamwork

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.640
is easier, because it's
a simpler deliverable

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.557
and a simpler project.

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:35.306
PROFESSOR: But things
are going to come up

00:02:35.306 --> 00:02:37.552
throughout the semester--
somebody falling sick,

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:39.010
somebody going away
for interviews,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.079
especially seniors going
for job interviews.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.620
Those are things
you're going to plan

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.012
for to react to and have
alternate plans, just in case

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:47.970
something like that
happens during the project.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.470
So just be aware of that
throughout the class.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.180
So what are we doing today?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.900
Today's a very,
very busy day that's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.210
going to involve lots of
movement on your part.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.715
We're going to do a
workshop on version control

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:04.250
that Drew is going
to walk you through.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.220
We're going to go
into discussion groups

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.170
and talk about the
game engine tutorials

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.120
that you all completed
before today,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.720
and they'll be a mechanism
for talking about that.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.500
Basically people talking
about forming groups

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.460
in the same project and then
later on forming groups where

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.359
we can have people
compare-- somebody

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.900
who worked on Unity talking to
somebody who worked on Flixel.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.030
Things like that.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.815
After that, we're going to
have project one play test.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.690
So this is going to be
an informal play test.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.230
Basically it's a check.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.320
Can you play your game today?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.920
If you can't, then
play what you've

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.210
got, because you're going
to be forced to play it.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.950
Maybe you have some
rules written down.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:43.780
Great.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.030
Just act them out in that
15 minute block we give

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.220
you to act out those rules.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.803
And maybe within
that 15 minute block,

00:03:48.803 --> 00:03:50.530
come up with a few
different rules

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.040
or a few different pieces.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.760
So that's going to
happen, and we'll

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.510
go through how that's
going to work later.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.051
And then at the end
of the day, we're

00:03:58.051 --> 00:03:59.330
going to do another workshop.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.080
Sara is going to lead
us on that-- talking

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.350
about vision statements.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.920
So this is a tool
that we use to help

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.300
large teams understand what
it is we're actually creating.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.790
So with that I'm going to
switch slides and bring it over

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.902
to drew.

00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:15.360
ANDREW GRANT: So
the first thing, I

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.470
see a lot of laptops,
which is pretty awesome.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.649
How many of you
brought a computer

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:26.730
that actually has the code you
used for you tutorials on it?

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.040
That is more than half.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.540
Awesome.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.190
So you get the short version of
presentation, not the long one,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.660
as soon as we get it
up there and going.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.367
Let's see.

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:37.200
Any other questions?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.330
Who here has used version
control or source control

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.650
before.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.210
Most of you.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.820
Fascinating.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.195
Who here feels
confident that you

00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:45.770
know why you used
version control,

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.478
and that it was awesome,
and you're cool,

00:04:47.478 --> 00:04:49.680
and you're good at this?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.170
OK, the hands went
up and started

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.630
to come down slowly,
which would make sense.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.046
That's what they
should have done.

00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:54.921
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:54.921 --> 00:04:56.420
All right, so I'm
not actually going

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.840
to talk about the nitty gritty
details of exactly which

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.390
commands you type,
because there's

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.140
a bunch different
version control systems.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.319
They all work very
similarly, but you're

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.360
going to basically need
to read the documentation

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.190
on the particular one
that you're using.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.160
I recommend today, if
you're familiar with one,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.390
that you stick with
that if possible,

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.830
but don't worry about
it if you can't.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.590
So let's see.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.340
I'm going to give a
high level description

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.180
of what is revision control.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm going to use
different words for it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.460
Source control, revision
control are the big ones.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.690
The basic notion is that-- and
this is a very simple notion--

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.360
that you've got one copy of the
source on your local machine,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.610
and you've got one copy of
the source somewhere else,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.772
and that copy out there
is the perfect copy.

00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:44.730
That's the true copy of
what you're working on.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.680
That's the platonic
ideal of your project,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.460
and your job is to copy
files down from it,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.440
change them, and copy
them back up to that one.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.590
Not much going on there, right?

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.772
All right.

00:05:57.772 --> 00:05:59.230
I'll get into more
details on that.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.380
So we started with a
whole bunch of words

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.600
that go along with this topic.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.010
Revision control system, RCS,
is often used as a generic term.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.980
It's also a specific
piece of software

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.672
that you probably won't use
because it's really old.

00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:17.505
Source control, revision
control, and you'll

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:23.670
also see SCM as a common TLA
for source control management.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.600
CVS, the concurrent version
system, is also older,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.470
but one you might
actually see used.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.680
It's mostly command line only.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.969
SVN is a more recent open
source version of CVS.

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.260
I think CVS may have been, too.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.301
I'm not sure on that one.

00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:38.530
SVN is more usable, and
I highly recommend it.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.720
Perforce is one that's used
quite often in the games

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.054
industry, and then
you're going to see

00:06:44.054 --> 00:06:45.470
Git and Mercurial,
which are often

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.960
mentioned in the same breath.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.900
They're both what's called
distributed source control.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.691
We'll get to that, but
they're interface is

00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.774
very similar to all
of the above actually.

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:56.690
Almost all have a command
line interface where

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.780
you can do it everything from
command line, and most of them

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.370
have a GUI that you
can use as well,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.050
but you're going to see a
bunch of different words used

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.010
to talk about the stuff.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.724
So again, in its most basic
form, you've got a server.

00:07:07.724 --> 00:07:08.640
You've got your local.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.310
You copy stuff back and forth.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.332
Pretty basic.

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.790
And it's a little bit easier
to see why you might want that

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.970
when you've got more than
one person on the team.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.730
It's a really good way to
make sure your files are

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.271
synchronized.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.244
It's even more important
the bigger your team.

00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:25.660
So what's really,
really important

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.730
is that that server copy
of your code is useful.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.680
So you want to make
sure that you are only

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.070
contributing to that
central repository of code

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.880
the useful pieces.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.690
Now, what we really
want to do is

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.370
that central version
of the code is

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.220
sort of what's considered,
as I mentioned,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.940
ideal version of your code.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.980
It's authoritative.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.210
It's the one you can trust.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.420
So that actually becomes
a little bit more

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.587
than a backup system, right?

00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:56.044
So a backup system
is quite useful.

00:07:56.044 --> 00:07:57.930
If you lose something
or you make a mistake,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.250
you want to be able to
revert to a previous version

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.458
of your code, and that is
certainly one of the things

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:04.090
that source control
does for you.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.690
And we'll also talk about how
it's a way to share your code,

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.481
but it's actually more
important than that.

00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.354
So the history of
your project is

00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:12.020
one of the big things
you get out of it.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.527
When you submit your files,
which can be source code

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:16.610
file-- it could be images.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.540
It could be anything.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.420
When you submit them,
you should include

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.010
a comment about what
the heck you've done.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.704
And this is one of the things
I find new programmers have

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:25.620
the hardest time with.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.230
In fact, I know plenty of old
programmers that can't do it,

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.900
but really it's useful,
and the reason it's useful

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.949
is all because of this.

00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:34.740
We're going to talk
about different methods

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.809
of communication
throughout this course,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.195
and I've talked about-- or
I will talk about the fact

00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:42.070
that your source code
is a way to communicate

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.000
with other people.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.820
But it turns out your comment
log in your version control

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.290
system is also great way to
communicate with your team.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.270
So for example, if you
submit a whole bunch of files

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.681
and it's not obvious what
that did to your game,

00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:55.680
that comment can tell
everyone else on your team

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.860
what just happened.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.000
Maybe you rewrote the entire
AI so that the bad guys now

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.780
run away from the player.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.655
And it may be that
someone else on your team

00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:05.960
is trying to figure out why are
the bad guys' AI broken now?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.060
And the answer is
it's not broken.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.685
They're just doing
something different.

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:10.727
And when they do get that
code from the server,

00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:13.060
they're going to see that
comment and say, oh, I get it.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.810
The AI changed.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.220
So if you fail to report
that in a Scrum-- or maybe

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.314
you don't have a Scrum
because you did it

00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:19.740
in the middle of
the night-- this

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.880
is a great way to
communicate with your team.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.560
Even more than that, that
history is also really useful.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.200
Let's say you check
in this code that

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.627
causes bad guys to run away,
and then a couple days later you

00:09:30.627 --> 00:09:32.460
find out that there's
some problem in the AI

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.020
where things actually crash
horribly if the game sits there

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.870
for an hour.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.799
Well, where do you begin
looking for that bug?

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.340
You may not know
that it's in the AI.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.570
You may just have
some clues, but you

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.484
know that it changed
in the last two days.

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:46.400
This behavior started.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.060
So you can look at
the log and say,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.874
what happened in
the last two days?

00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:51.790
And someone further
discovers that, well, it's

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.520
crashing somewhere in AI.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.789
Then you can have a hint
that it's in the AI system,

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:58.330
but more than that, you go to
the exact last change in the AI

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.400
system and look at those
files, and that's probably

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.860
where your bug is.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.240
That's pretty handy.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.580
And let's say that you do
something really, really

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.200
horrible.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.985
You also get an undo
button out of this.

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:11.110
You can say, you know what?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.860
That version two days ago--
let's go back to that.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.820
That's better than
what we have right now.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.737
You don't often do that,
but it is really nice

00:10:17.737 --> 00:10:19.945
to have that kind of security,
especially when you're

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:21.220
working in your local version.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.917
Let's say you're
trying to find a bug.

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:25.500
You need to change 15 files, and
putting into debug statements

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.870
everywhere to figure out
what the heck's going on.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.600
And then you find
the bug finally,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.300
and you realize it's
a one line change.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.010
Well, it's easier just to revert
back to the server version

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.135
and make that one line
change than to make sure you

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:38.510
undo every little piece.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.290
Let the computer be your memory.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.860
Let the computer be
your undo button.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.290
You don't need to
rely on knowing

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.289
which files you changed.

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.760
It will tell you.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.139
And this is the cool thing that
is kind of scary, but pretty

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:52.180
awesome-- is you can
actually simultaneously edit

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.550
the same files if
they are text files.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.790
This involves a merge
process afterwards

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.494
which is a little
bit frightening

00:11:00.494 --> 00:11:01.910
the first several
times you do it,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.204
but actually the
tools are pretty good.

00:11:04.204 --> 00:11:06.620
As long as you're not modifying
the same line of the file,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.700
it's pretty good about figuring
what should happen, but you do

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.990
need to manually check
it with your eyes

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.730
to verify it didn't
do anything stupid,

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.355
but it's actually
pretty common to work

00:11:13.355 --> 00:11:15.490
to be able to work with
same file with two people

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.340
and actually have
it work out OK.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.150
The exception to that is
extremely complicated text

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.850
files or binary files--
you can't merge changes

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.990
to a PNG of GIF.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.130
That doesn't make sense,
at least on the file level.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.950
And a lot of the
data files in Unity,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.284
especially the scene
files and prefab files,

00:11:33.284 --> 00:11:34.950
are going to be too
complicated probably

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.910
for you to actually
manage to emerge.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:37.950
So for those, you need
to be a little bit more

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.550
careful about it, but it's
actually a really useful tool

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.040
to lean on that.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.630
So we're going to talk about
the various operations very,

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.809
very quickly.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.350
When you copy things
from the server,

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.570
different source control systems
will call it different things.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.300
You're going to see the term
get to mean pull the files down

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.540
from the server.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.900
Update, pull, and checkout
in different systems

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.070
will mean that same thing--
copy files from the server.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.160
I also have in there
the word revert,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.026
which is kind of a
fancy special case.

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.650
When I said you can
undo your changes--

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.565
you've got a whole
bunch of files changed,

00:12:09.565 --> 00:12:11.170
and you don't like
those changes--

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.980
you can revert to the
server version, which

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.800
is-- under the covers, what's
really going on there is you're

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.730
copying down from the
server, but you'll

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.688
call that revert because
it's going to ask you,

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:21.260
wait a minute, you
changed that file.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.480
Are you sure you really
want to wipe that out?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.330
And at that point, you
should say yes or no

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.140
depending on how sure
you are that you really

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.806
want to do that.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.140
Similarly, when you
have decided that you've

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.580
finished with your
changes locally

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.121
and you want to copy them out
to the server for everyone else

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:40.500
to see, that's going to be
called submit, commit, put,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.852
push or check in.

00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.060
Generally speaking, people
talk about that copying up

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.300
to the server directionally.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.840
The reason they use some
fancy words like commit

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.490
is that they want you to
realize that this is not-- I'm

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.970
just copying a file.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.170
You're copying a file
for everyone to see.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.560
So you want to ensure that
your changes are good.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.841
This one's easier.

00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:06.090
If you want to find out the
status of what's going on,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.255
almost all the source controls
use the word status for that.

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.630
But basically what you can do
is you can say things like,

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.004
so I've changed
a bunch of files,

00:13:14.004 --> 00:13:15.439
and I forget what I've changed.

00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:16.730
I'm sure there's a lot of them.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.730
You can actually ask your
source control system,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.760
what did I change?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.420
And it'll say, well, these
five files have changed,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.090
and in fact, you can even get
more information from that

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.940
if you want to compare what
those actual changes are.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.560
And diff is the term for that.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.840
Locking files so no one else can
change them is not often used

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.012
in source code, but
it's very useful

00:13:40.012 --> 00:13:41.470
for-- as I was
talking about, there

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.120
are some files that are so
complicated that it can't

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.650
automatically
merge them for you,

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.290
and the binary files as well.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.200
You may find that some
source control systems don't

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.690
automatically lock these for
you, and so in that case,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.665
you might want to make
as your team policy

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:56.040
that you want to lock the file
so that no one else messes

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.630
with it.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.070
So again, I'll go back
to Unity as an example.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.540
If you're changing the main
scene file for your game

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.417
and it's this complicated
gigantic XML thing,

00:14:04.417 --> 00:14:06.500
you might lock that file
so no one else changes it

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.624
while you're working on it.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.960
And then finally, merge is
the last thing that you'll do.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.100
And I talk about, if you're
changing one code file

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.470
and someone else changes a code
file while you're working on it

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.140
and checks it in
before you do, you're

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.300
going to include their
changes into your version,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.383
and that's called a merge.

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:25.820
Most of them have tools that
do it for you automatically,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.740
but if there's a
conflict, it will then

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.306
force you to do what's called
a resolve, which is to say,

00:14:30.306 --> 00:14:32.430
hey, this file changed more
than I could figure out

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.580
automatically, so a human
needs to interfere with it,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.310
and that point--
that's called resolve.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.370
And that's what the
process is called, too.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:43.130
You'll have to go through
that manually a couple times.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.465
So we talked about how this
is an authoritative server,

00:14:45.465 --> 00:14:49.620
and that's true for
Perforce And Subversion.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.640
And basically there's
the one server

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.634
that's going to be
taking care of you,

00:14:53.634 --> 00:14:55.550
but it's not always true,
especially if you're

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.620
looking at Git and
Mercurial, which

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.730
use what's called
distributed source control.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.319
There actually is no
difference between your version

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.360
of the code, and the
servers version of the code,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.600
or your teammates
version of the code.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.390
It's just a bunch
of lists of changes,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.550
and you can send
them left, and right,

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.674
and upwards, and downwards.

00:15:10.674 --> 00:15:13.050
It doesn't matter.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.020
But if you actually
do this, you're

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.560
in trouble, unless you're
really careful about it.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.190
So whenever you do
a sideways shift--

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.690
you send some code
to your teammate,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.240
but you don't send
it to the, server

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.240
you want to make sure you
know what you're doing

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.406
and be very careful with it.

00:15:27.406 --> 00:15:29.907
So I recommend, if you're using
a distributed source control

00:15:29.907 --> 00:15:32.031
system, until you're really
comfortable with what's

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.950
going on there, that
you mostly treat it

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.270
like a standard server based
system until you're really--

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.710
and make sure if you do
any other kinds of cross

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.650
submits that you know
what you're doing

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.760
and you think about
it a little bit.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.530
The cool thing
about these systems,

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.880
though, is that,
if I make a change

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.577
and I send it to my
teammate, and both of us

00:15:51.577 --> 00:15:53.410
submit it to the central
server, it actually

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.243
keeps track of that.

00:15:54.243 --> 00:15:55.740
It says, oh, it's
the same change.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.110
I don't need to apply it twice.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.040
It's actually a really
very clever technology.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.920
It's very, very cool
and very powerful,

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.378
but like many
powerful technologies

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:03.650
it can be very confusing.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.890
So as I say, start out here, and
if you're feeling really cocky,

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.470
go there.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.659
A couple quick rules about this.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:17.200
They're not going to apply to
you yet, because you're not yet

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.130
writing code in teams, but
the policy is for most teams

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.945
never ever, ever
break the build.

00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:25.320
And when I say
break the build, I

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.650
mean you want it to be the case
that that one canonical copy,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.240
the perfect copy of
your project, anybody

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.965
can go to an empty machine,
run a get, get all the files,

00:16:34.965 --> 00:16:36.840
hit the Build button
for whatever environment

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.050
you're using, and have it
build and work perfectly.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.370
That is the goal.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.945
That's what you always want.

00:16:42.945 --> 00:16:45.070
And if you ever submit
something to the server that

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.500
makes that impossible,
it's highly likely

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.570
that you have just made everyone
else in your team have to wait.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.830
And that's a big
pain because they're

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.160
going to be sitting there
wishing they could get work

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.260
done, but they did a get to make
sure they could do the merge,

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.801
and then all of a sudden they
can't get any work done at all.

00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:04.310
So you want to make 100%
sure that you can always,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.540
always, always do that build.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.089
Another thing--
and this is me sort

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.819
of stepping aside to my
coding hat-- you should always

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.310
have zero errors
and zero warnings

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.895
if at all humanly
possible in you project.

00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:20.770
A lot of times I see
programmers who are just

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.540
starting out who think
that warnings are optional,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.530
and it's true.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.859
Unfortunately, most of
them are kind of optional,

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:30.000
but there's two problems with
leaving them in your build.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.750
Problem number one is
some of them are optional,

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.560
but they do in fact
highlight an issue

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.865
that you should think about.

00:17:36.865 --> 00:17:39.910
And if you leave it there
on the screen and ignore it,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.560
you might be ignoring
an important tool

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.219
that'll help you find a bug.

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:45.510
But in the second one, I
think it's even more important

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.500
actually-- is that
as soon as you

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.530
get used to seeing warnings
in your build every time,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.617
you start ignoring
all the warnings.

00:17:52.617 --> 00:17:54.950
So let's say there are five
warnings that pop up in your

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.949
build every time you build
it, and this has been

00:17:56.949 --> 00:17:58.450
true for a week and a half now.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.700
And you're writing some code
and you add two warnings,

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.000
and you don't notice
because there are warnings.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.840
Five to seven, you didn't
notice the difference,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.070
but one of two
warnings that you added

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.764
might be really important.

00:18:09.764 --> 00:18:11.430
So if you can get
down to zero warnings,

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.200
as soon as you had
one morning, it

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.550
will instantly hit your
brain, and your brain

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.790
will say, oh, wait a minute.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.300
I did something
that the computer

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.620
says is a little bit risky.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.510
And in computer
science, you want

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.337
to avoid a little bit
risky, because it's

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:25.920
going to come back
and bite you, and I

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.770
promise it's easier to fix a bug
10 minutes after you wrote it

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.970
than a day after you wrote it.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.970
And a week after you wrote
it, it's even harder.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.040
We in this class won't get
to a year after you wrote it,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.010
but sometime in your
career, you probably will,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.840
and you won't enjoy it.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.680
Avoids bugs the first
time if you can.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.220
So therefore I call
use a check build.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.910
On a team, you might say
to someone sitting next

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.730
to you, hey, can you
do a get and build

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.344
and make sure I
didn't mess it up?

00:18:51.344 --> 00:18:53.260
That's one easy way to
do it, but actually you

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.682
don't need to do that.

00:18:54.682 --> 00:18:56.140
On all these source
control systems

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.389
you can have more than one--
what we call-- workspace.

00:18:58.389 --> 00:19:00.580
It might be your local
version of the code.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.260
You can have two
workspaces-- one

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.468
where you're doing your work.

00:19:03.468 --> 00:19:05.200
You check it all into
the central server.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.820
Second one, you go to
the second workspace.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.778
You pull the code down.

00:19:07.778 --> 00:19:08.550
You do a build.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.760
You verify that
everything still works,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.020
and that's a safety way that
you can in a couple minutes

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.520
verify that you aren't about
to make the entire team wait

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.180
and lose time.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.034
Couple little tips that,
again, you probably

00:19:23.034 --> 00:19:24.616
won't need a little
bit, but I'm going

00:19:24.616 --> 00:19:26.990
to talk about it very quickly
now so you don't forget.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.050
All these things
I'm talking about

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:29.200
are things you're probably
going to have to look up

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.410
the details on how
to do them, but I

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.360
want you to at least
have heard the words,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.026
so that when you see
them on the screen,

00:19:34.026 --> 00:19:38.120
they'll look familiar to you and
you'll know what you can find.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.840
Ignore unneeded files is
a really powerful thing.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.410
Almost all these systems
can ignore types of files.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.540
For example, if
you're working in C#,

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.740
there might be some
object files or whatever,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.530
and you don't want
to check those in.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.150
It doesn't help you
to check them in.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.525
In particular, if you're using
Perforce, checking them in

00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:59.260
is actually problematic, because
one of the things that Perforce

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.840
does that the other
systems don't do

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.920
is Perforce uses
the read only flag

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.370
as a way on your local machine
to tell you whether or not

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.290
you have a file checked
out for changes.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.924
So if a file is read
only, it's saying

00:20:09.924 --> 00:20:12.340
you haven't told me that you're
going to change this file,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.786
so I'm not going to let you.

00:20:13.786 --> 00:20:16.276
If you try to do a build on
a bunch of read only files,

00:20:16.276 --> 00:20:17.900
your build environment
has two choices.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.420
It can ignore that,
which is kind of scary,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.480
or it can just fail.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.840
So that's kind of annoying,
but more to the point,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.270
there's no reason to check
in these gigantic product

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.811
files that are all part of your
build when you could actually

00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:32.870
build everything
from the bare source.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.760
The only things you want
to actually check in

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.380
are the original source
files for your project,

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.764
whether that be art,
audio code, whatever,

00:20:40.764 --> 00:20:42.930
but you want to be able to
rebuild the entire thing.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.620
And all the intermediate
files or the final result

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.290
files-- generally speaking,
you don't want to check those

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.220
into source control, unless
you've got a special build

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.144
folder or something.

00:20:50.144 --> 00:20:51.560
You want to have
one folder, which

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.420
is purely pull down the
project and build it,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.920
and it contains
all the information

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.569
necessary to regenerate
everything that you can.

00:20:58.569 --> 00:21:00.610
So if you can ignore all
the files that you don't

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.120
want to check in, that's good.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.850
This is particularly
a problem with Unity.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.330
You don't want to
check in anything

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.310
but the asset folder and
the project settings folder.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.270
There's a bunch of
gigantic folders in Unity

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.110
that look important,
and they are important,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.734
but Unity will
regenerate them for you,

00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:17.420
and you don't want
to check them in.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.370
And then finally, I talked
about locking before.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.630
Lock you binary files
and your big text

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.140
files that don't merge well
just to avoid headaches.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.891
If you don't do that and more
than one person touches that

00:21:28.891 --> 00:21:30.640
file, eventually you'll
get in a situation

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.973
where you lose your changes
because someone else checked

00:21:32.973 --> 00:21:34.280
in something over you.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.600
Similarly with a
merge be careful.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.770
If someone has checked
in a-- even to text file,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.470
and you do get it
down to the server,

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.590
and it has to merge with your
changes, and you don't do that,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.423
and you just say, nah,
forget their changes.

00:21:46.423 --> 00:21:46.960
Use mine.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.020
That's going to be a
problem, because someone

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.401
just loss some work there.

00:21:50.401 --> 00:21:52.650
Luckily with source control
you can recover from that,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.241
but it won't be smooth teamwork.

00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:56.490
No one will be happy that
you wiped out their changes.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.322
That is the quick
version, and now we're

00:22:01.322 --> 00:22:02.530
going to go on to a workshop.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.780
So you should be sitting
near people who used the game

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.560
engine that you used.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.800
Hopefully most of you
actually did this thing.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.840
So what we want to do is team
up in pairs with people ideally

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:14.750
who used your engine.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.833
If there's only three of
you who used your engine,

00:22:16.833 --> 00:22:18.660
I guess you're a triplet.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.020
And what we want to do
is-- ideally two ways,

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.220
but one way will do.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.670
One of you should say,
yes, I've got working code.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:28.680
It's pretty cool.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.180
Run it.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:29.830
Show everyone.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.870
See it works.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.630
And then pick a source
control engine of your choice.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.380
I recommend GitHub, because
it's easy to get things set up.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.620
Check in your code, have the
other people check it out,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.000
and see if they can build it.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.370
And then if you succeed at
that, swap and do the other way

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.120
around.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.230
Actually, you can do
this simultaneously.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.440
Everyone can start
checking in to new projects

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440
and then pull down.

00:23:05.706 --> 00:23:08.280
Well I'll take that as a
cue that I can start talking

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.770
a little bit, but not for long.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:10.554
I promise.

00:23:10.554 --> 00:23:12.970
So the next step we want to
do is discuss the game engines

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.319
that you did the tutorials for.

00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:15.860
You probably did a
little bit of that

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.484
already because you've
been hanging out

00:23:17.484 --> 00:23:19.000
with people near
you who use them,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.980
but I want you to try
to get into groups

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.162
of five to six people.

00:23:23.162 --> 00:23:25.370
If you can't, that's fine,
but try to balance it out.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:29.490
There probably should be about
two groups per game engine.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.040
And talk about what
your experiences

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.880
were with the tutorials.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.030
So things like, what was easy?

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.910
What was hard?

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.159
What was more difficult
than you expected?

00:23:39.159 --> 00:23:41.450
Compare your experiences on
different operating systems

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.767
if you happen to
have that experience.

00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:46.100
Compare your experiences if
you used different tutorials

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.641
or the same tutorial,
but basically I

00:23:47.641 --> 00:23:50.180
want you to get an idea of
what other people's experiences

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.900
we're like compared to your own.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.670
And the main reason
for this is that you

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.859
want to figure out
something a little bit more

00:23:55.859 --> 00:23:57.900
about your game engine,
because after this, we're

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.410
going to shuffle and
get into groups where

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.750
we've mixed up the game engine.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.675
So for example, if
you used HaxeFlixel,

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.050
you'll be in a
group with someone

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:06.841
who used Flixel and
someone who used Unity,

00:24:06.841 --> 00:24:09.230
and you want to compare
and contrast those engines.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.080
And so think of this
first discussion as a way

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.770
to figure out how to talk
about your game engine

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.840
and maybe learn more about other
people's experiences with it.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.450
So I believe that we're
already seated mostly

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.680
near each other in
the game engines.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.362
I think that's all I
need to say really.

00:24:28.362 --> 00:24:30.820
So split up into groups of five
or six in your game engine,

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:32.484
and if you need help
with that, we'll help.

00:24:32.484 --> 00:24:33.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.834
ANDREW GRANT: 15.

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:38.250
15 minutes of that,
and then we'll

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.492
swap in to do multiple-- we'll
help you with that part, too.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.850
PHILIP TAN: Your
attention, please.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:24:59.740
May I have your
attention, please.

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.980
So I think a lot of you-- I
see quite a few groups are

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.750
winding down on their discussion
within the same game engine.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:14.950
Now what we're going to do
is ask you to gather back

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.140
in your original brainstorming
groups, which is probably

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.800
going to be pretty close to
the combination of the teams

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.530
that you are currently in.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.560
So remember when we did
brainstorming on Monday?

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.970
Those people?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.865
You are going to
gather with them,

00:25:31.865 --> 00:25:33.240
and hopefully
you're going to get

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.864
a good spread of
different game engines

00:25:34.864 --> 00:25:36.330
within that discussion group.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.880
And what we want you to do
is share your experience

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.540
having used that game engine.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:43.040
First, take a quick survey
around of which game

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.380
engines are being
represented, have a talk so

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.770
that you know which game
engines you're discussing.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.680
Then talk about
what you found good,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.930
what you found terrible
about those game engines,

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.600
and what you recommend it for.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.100
OK?

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.020
PROFESSOR: As a primary
motivator for this,

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.140
project two starts
next Monday, and you're

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.140
going to choose an engine
and make a game in it.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:04.930
And you're going to be committed
to that engine for about 2

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:05.730
and 1/2 weeks.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.430
So that's the whole reason why
we're talking about this stuff.

00:26:11.965 --> 00:26:13.840
ANDREW GRANT: This might
not need to be said,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.680
but if half of you used one
game engine, do some swapping.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.330
I would like to see we can
put a final couple of details

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:45.590
as to what we discovered here.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.710
If you were to try to describe
the experience of Haxe

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.300
in a sentence like
thumbs up, thumbs down,

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.860
what was the hardest thing?

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.746
Anybody?

00:26:56.746 --> 00:26:57.245
Please?

00:26:57.245 --> 00:26:59.428
AUDIENCE: There weren't a
lot of resources out there

00:26:59.428 --> 00:26:59.970
[? for it. ?]

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.511
ANDREW GRANT: Not
a lot of resources.

00:27:01.511 --> 00:27:03.535
So you couldn't find help
me when you got stuck?

00:27:03.535 --> 00:27:04.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.120
It's pretty [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.453
ANDREW GRANT: OK, I've heard
that the install process is

00:27:07.453 --> 00:27:09.691
painful.

00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:10.190
Let's see.

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.920
What else have I heard?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.670
Anything else?

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.340
Anything to recommend it?

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.690
AUDIENCE: Once you got it
up and running, it was easy.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:18.990
ANDREW GRANT: Once you got it
up and running it was easy.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.232
All right, cool.

00:27:20.232 --> 00:27:23.184
AUDIENCE: Personally
I was on a Mac,

00:27:23.184 --> 00:27:25.644
and I found the
installation really simple.

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:30.986
It was just a couple
of [INAUDIBLE] calls,

00:27:30.986 --> 00:27:35.585
and it seemed like it was
really useful for a simple game.

00:27:35.585 --> 00:27:38.080
I'm not sure how [INAUDIBLE]
will get when we were trying

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.074
[INAUDIBLE], but for getting a
very simple game running fast,

00:27:41.074 --> 00:27:41.574
it's nice.

00:27:41.574 --> 00:27:43.657
ANDREW GRANT: So it sounds
like there's some mixed

00:27:43.657 --> 00:27:44.970
experience on the install.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.080
Mac may be the difference.

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.857
I don't know.

00:27:46.857 --> 00:27:49.065
AUDIENCE: I was also on a
Mac, and once I figured out

00:27:49.065 --> 00:27:52.090
how to install on a Mac,
it was extremely simple,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.110
but the thing was the
tutorial was just for Windows.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.110
Install Flash [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.610
Do this.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:59.110
Do that.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.161
I was like, OK. [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:01.161 --> 00:28:02.910
ANDREW GRANT: So the
main thing I've heard

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.200
then is the support is limited.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.620
The install may or may not be
hard, but if you get stuck,

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.953
the support isn't going to
help you through it, at least

00:28:09.953 --> 00:28:12.722
in that experience.

00:28:12.722 --> 00:28:15.180
The main reason why I think
HaxeFlixel might be interesting

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.740
is because I actually know
that Flixel is interesting,

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.823
but you guys may have a
different opinion on that.

00:28:19.823 --> 00:28:21.080
So Flixel.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.122
Any other big picture
takeaway for Flixel?

00:28:25.122 --> 00:28:27.080
You're all going to
disagree with me now, which

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.027
is fine, but say something.

00:28:29.027 --> 00:28:31.770
AUDIENCE: I think it's
support is also limited.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.426
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:28:33.426 --> 00:28:35.050
And one of problems
I've seen in Flixel

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.600
is that it, in fact, has evolved
over about five or six years

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.100
now.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.960
And so if you look
for a bug in Flixel

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.050
and try to figure out
what was going wrong,

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.134
it'll say, well, in Flixel
4, you want to do this.

00:28:44.134 --> 00:28:46.216
It does end up being a
little bit more complicated

00:28:46.216 --> 00:28:46.775
there, too.

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:48.150
So in addition to
there not being

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.700
as much support as there
is for, say, Unity,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:51.870
it's fragmented support.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.250
And then of course, Flash
is one of those technologies

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.010
that people are
considering to be aging.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.570
I will say, however, that in
my experience for 2D stuff,

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.520
Flixel is really, really easy
to pick up once you get going,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.705
and it can really do the
2D stuff pretty well.

00:29:09.705 --> 00:29:12.080
On the other hand, we have a
new contender there, Phaser,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.080
which I heard the [? trial ?]
was really, really

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.170
good for Phaser.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.031
Does anyone have any
takeaway on Phaser?

00:29:20.031 --> 00:29:20.970
The trial was good.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.386
It handled 2D stuff pretty well.

00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:24.010
We haven't gone in
depth on collisions.

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it
was definitely good for 2D.

00:29:26.176 --> 00:29:30.996
It's very intuitive, and it's
all written in JavaScript,

00:29:30.996 --> 00:29:33.491
so not too complicated.

00:29:33.491 --> 00:29:36.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.094
ANDREW GRANT: Does anybody
know if it supports TypeScript?

00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:40.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.718
ANDREW GRANT: It does
support TypeScript.

00:29:41.718 --> 00:29:43.551
Did anyone use
TypeScript for Phaser?

00:29:43.551 --> 00:29:44.050
No?

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:44.690
Oh, you did?

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:47.730
ANDREW GRANT: Right, I just
talked to you about that.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.340
In fact, you were able to
use a debugger with Phaser

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.784
through Visual Studio, right?

00:29:52.784 --> 00:29:54.450
That actually I find
pretty encouraging.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.800
Someone's put some
thought into that.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.590
How about support?

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.610
Where there are a lot
of people using Phaser?

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.270
Enough that you can get
some help through searches?

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.240
Yeah.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:05.950
OK, cool.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.920
So it sounds like Phaser is
a-- I haven't heard about many

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.869
of the HTML5 engines
that I would actually

00:30:10.869 --> 00:30:12.410
want to recommend,
but it sounds like

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:13.540
so for your
experiences with Phaser

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.815
have been pretty positive,
which is pretty cool.

00:30:15.815 --> 00:30:17.795
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about Phaser.

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:19.200
What about the install process?

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.950
Any thoughts on that?

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:25.845
[INAUDIBLE] files could just
[? be ?] [INAUDIBLE] HTML

00:30:25.845 --> 00:30:28.182
[INAUDIBLE] scripts.

00:30:28.182 --> 00:30:30.390
ANDREW GRANT: So you just
copied it in, and it works?

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.848
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so Phaser has
version control pretty much

00:30:33.848 --> 00:30:36.770
[INAUDIBLE] because you have
to pull everything from Git.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.195
The second tutorial of
making the game was great,

00:30:39.195 --> 00:30:42.105
but as a couple of us
noticed, the first tutorial

00:30:42.105 --> 00:30:44.900
had installation-- like
setting up a web server

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.576
and then choosing your ID was
a little bit more obfuscated.

00:30:50.576 --> 00:30:52.370
It's like, why are
they telling us

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.170
to do these things [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.170
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, right.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:55.670
Right.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.600
Yeah, because I do
think that-- there

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.750
was somebody said if
you set up a web server,

00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:59.870
this is how I would do it.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.203
And I think the answer is
there are easier ways to do it

00:31:02.203 --> 00:31:03.779
than they have
suggested, especially

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:04.820
if you're an MIT student.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.430
You can copy it to
your web locker,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.275
and whoa, you've installed
it-- is a fine way to do it.

00:31:10.275 --> 00:31:11.191
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:18.149
With the TypeScript installation
it enables to [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:21.650
copy paste in [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:24.280
ANDREW GRANT: Cool.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.970
All right, and then I split
Unity into concentrate on 2D,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.295
concentrate on 3D, but
fundamentally there

00:31:30.295 --> 00:31:33.860
is a difference between those
two-- that Unity pretty much--

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.070
and I heard someone even saying
that Unity is designed for 3D,

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.920
and they've kind of pasted
2D on top of it, which

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.027
I think is an accurate criticism
about usability on that.

00:31:45.027 --> 00:31:47.110
Has anyone experienced
the-- trying to use the 2D,

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.901
was that a problem?

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.231
Are you going to still need to
think in 3D to make it work?

00:31:54.231 --> 00:31:56.564
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the other
thing was the initial learning

00:31:56.564 --> 00:31:59.785
curve was pretty-- took a
while to get something simple

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:01.240
started.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.635
[? But I feel ?] like
there's a lot of potential

00:32:04.635 --> 00:32:07.060
making more complex 2D stuff.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.866
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:11.754
AUDIENCE: It definitely
doesn't feel lacking.

00:32:11.754 --> 00:32:14.184
It's like Photoshop in
the sense that there's

00:32:14.184 --> 00:32:16.630
all these features, and you
maybe not even 10% of them,

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.301
but they're there
if you need them,

00:32:18.301 --> 00:32:19.843
which may or may
not be a good thing,

00:32:19.843 --> 00:32:21.759
because that can be very
intimidating and sort

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:22.499
of hard to work.

00:32:22.499 --> 00:32:23.290
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.248
I agree with that 100%.

00:32:24.248 --> 00:32:25.835
There's too much there, perhaps.

00:32:25.835 --> 00:32:27.460
If you're trying to
do a quick project,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.711
you might be tempted to
use more than you should.

00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:31.960
Also [INAUDIBLE] some things
get lost in the features.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.848
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in
some of the videos

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:35.630
they demonstrate
how you can actually

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.840
have 3D objects in
the 2D environment

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.580
when you're developing
2D games, which I

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.210
guess they were excited about.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.810
And they were just like, hey,
you can do this cool thing,

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:50.269
but I think it has the opposite
effect in that it intimidates

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.769
people.

00:32:50.769 --> 00:32:55.030
There's a lot of options that
were built originally for 3D,

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.390
and looking through
menus and looking

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.840
through all drop down
things, most of them

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.880
are things you can'
touch or you can't

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.290
use, because they're
meant for 3D,

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.605
and there's no way you can
restrict the UI to be only 2D.

00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:14.040
So I feel like
they should instead

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.780
make it into a standalone
Unity 2D software, which

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.004
would be easier.

00:33:20.004 --> 00:33:22.045
ANDREW GRANT: I understand
why they don't turn it

00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:23.510
into standalone
Unity 2D software,

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.340
but I think your
point is well taken.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.232
I think that it would
help with their uptake

00:33:27.232 --> 00:33:29.190
if they were to try to
limit their feature set,

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.190
oddly enough.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.440
This is not the first time
this has happened actually.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.239
Way back when there was Torque,
which is a 3D game engine.

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:38.530
It was really cheap indie--
one of the first indie game

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.807
engines for like $100
for use it all you want.

00:33:41.807 --> 00:33:44.140
And they started with their
big fancy Torque 3D package,

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.480
and everyone said,
wow, this is awesome.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.300
And a bunch of people bought it,
and they never made any games,

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.460
because 3D is, as
we've mentioned,

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.370
more than three
times as hard as 2D,

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.120
and so they came out with Torque
2D, and that did a lot better.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.545
Again, because developers--
3D is an extra hurdle

00:33:57.545 --> 00:33:59.630
to jump over, and when
all the developers have

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.960
to deal with a short
time frame, and that 3D

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.190
can get in your way.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.900
So I think the takeaway
for me on Unity

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.270
is basically the same,
which is it's a lot.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.746
You can do a lot with it, but
it's got a learning curve.

00:34:10.746 --> 00:34:12.620
It's going to be a little
bit harder for you,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.020
so you might want to think
twice about doing that,

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.540
especially if
you're concentrating

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.199
on a 2D game, which you probably
should be doing, if you can,

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.415
this semester.

00:34:21.415 --> 00:34:22.873
Unity also has a
couple things that

00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:23.679
are a little bit different.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.319
I think mostly
Flixel certainly--

00:34:25.319 --> 00:34:30.159
and sounds like Phaser has
a little Flixel blood in it.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.699
They're both designed for 2D.

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.820
Very simple, straightforward
implementations

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.699
in an object
oriented kind of way.

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.241
Unity has this crazy
component system

00:34:39.241 --> 00:34:41.032
where you've got one
object, but you staple

00:34:41.032 --> 00:34:42.360
anything you want to to it.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.810
And it's really,
really powerful,

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:46.929
but also it takes a while
to your brain around it.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:50.400
So long story short, I
would say that, if you

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.969
can do what you want
to do without taking

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.230
on a big engine like
Unity, I kind of recommend

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.447
that, but obviously
if you need to do it

00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:00.780
and will kind of-- the reason
[INAUDIBLE] if you tell us

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.800
that you do need to do it,
but if you do need to do,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.850
it's worth
considering, because I

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:06.141
think it is a very powerful
and useful friendly engine.

00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:08.170
AUDIENCE: Which one
has [? faster ?]

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:10.272
development cycles?

00:35:10.272 --> 00:35:11.980
ANDREW GRANT: Good
question, but I'm only

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:17.260
going to guess at this point
in our experience we have not

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.050
used Phaser in a class before.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.840
I know Flixel is
faster than Unity.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.420
It sounds like from the
feedback we're getting here

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.340
that Phaser might
be a good contender,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.807
so I would recommend
in project two

00:35:27.807 --> 00:35:29.890
you might want to take a
look at those two engines

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:34.570
as your first go to
things and check it out,

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.924
because there's
not good options.

00:35:37.924 --> 00:35:40.340
I would go there first, though,
rather than going straight

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.360
to Unity, unless
you've got a team that

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.558
really wants to take it on.

00:35:44.558 --> 00:35:46.980
AUDIENCE: Are we limited
to these options [? that ?]

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.480
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.604
ANDREW GRANT: Yes, you're
limited to these options.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.410
So let's see.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:58.850
I think our next step
then is something else.

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.474
PROFESSOR: Yes, it is.

00:36:00.474 --> 00:36:01.670
So congratulations.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.630
You've gotten through the
first 2/3 of class today.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:06.442 --> 00:36:09.160
Yay.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.110
And that was our
gaming tutorial,

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.680
so keep all of these
thoughts in mind

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.329
as we start up
project two next week.

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:17.870
The remainder of
class is going to be

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.619
devoted to finishing
up project-- or doing

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:21.237
more work on project one.

00:36:21.237 --> 00:36:23.320
We're going to do two
activities that we mentioned

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.403
at the beginning of class.

00:36:24.403 --> 00:36:26.390
We're going to start
off with play test.

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.090
So if you have something
testable, great.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.265
You're ahead of the game.

00:36:30.265 --> 00:36:31.640
If you don't have
something testable,

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.473
we're going to give you
a little bit of time

00:36:33.473 --> 00:36:35.250
to get you to
something testable.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.670
What do we mean by testable?

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.380
It means somebody
else that is not

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:40.450
on your team with a
little bit of guidance

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:44.560
by somebody on the team can
make things happen in the game.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.070
That gives you feedback
that says that was cool.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.230
That's what we were going
for or that's really broken.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.140
That's awful.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.320
Let's not go that direction.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.930
That's all we're asking for
you to do for class today.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:02.090
So at 3 o'clock, we are
going to start the play test.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.950
It is 2:47 PM right now.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:06.930
Ignore that first part.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.513
Basically what we're going to
do is set up your in your teams.

00:37:09.513 --> 00:37:11.270
Every team should
have their game set up

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.030
and ready to play at 3 o'clock.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.080
The team that is
closest to them--

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.795
you're going to first
one team is going

00:37:16.795 --> 00:37:18.982
to play the other team's game.

00:37:18.982 --> 00:37:22.430
You can have 15 minutes
to do that and then swap.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:25.285
If you followed project
one's examples correctly

00:37:25.285 --> 00:37:27.390
and you have a five
minute game play

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.850
game, so your game can be
played in five minutes or less,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.280
you can get three
tests done today.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.450
Awesome.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.280
But if you only get
one or two, that's OK.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.740
You've got the whole weekend
to finish up on that, too.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.920
So come back into this room 3
o'clock with your game set up,

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.330
and we'll start the play test.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.520
Does everybody have
a playable game?

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.767
Yes?

00:38:00.767 --> 00:38:02.100
Thumbs up if you're ready to go.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.380
OK.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.400
All right, so we are not
just playing our games.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.000
We are play testing
our games, and we

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.540
are following the
Wizard of Oz method

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.430
that Philip mentioned on Monday.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.590
By that what we mean
is all of your games

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:20.680
probably have some
kind of computer

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.370
that's doing
something in the game

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.554
that the player is
interacting with the computer.

00:38:25.554 --> 00:38:27.970
What that means is there is
some constrained communication

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.607
between the computer
and the player.

00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:33.190
This is a time where
you want to think

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.290
about what are the things
that the player knows

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.540
versus what are the things
that the computer is doing.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.780
There's going to be a little bit
of a difference going on there.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.855
Don't let the player
know what the computer

00:38:42.855 --> 00:38:47.000
is thinking, unless it's
actually part of the game.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.250
If you could imagine the
computer saying here's

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.190
a screen with an icon on it
that says some stuff, that's

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:53.382
something the player knows.

00:38:53.382 --> 00:38:54.840
If it's just some
calculation going

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.381
on in the background, that is
not something the player knows.

00:38:57.381 --> 00:39:01.240
So just think about it that
way when you're doing this.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.865
So how many teams do
we have over here?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.370
One, four?

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:10.510
OK, so pair.

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.130
How many teams do
we have in here.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:17.034
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:39:17.034 --> 00:39:18.650
Is that right?

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.260
So pair to your
closest, and then pair.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.170
And how many teams over here?

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.640
One, two-- is that three total?

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.290
All right, instructors
will test the back one.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.490
So you have 15 minutes
to play one game.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.410
I'm going to come back in at
3:15 PM and tell you to switch.

00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:01.640
SARA VERILLI: OK,
so we're going to do

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.945
the shift from the
very fun play testing

00:40:04.945 --> 00:40:08.405
and working on games to talking
a little bit about project

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:08.905
management.

00:40:08.905 --> 00:40:11.900
And as he said, we're
trying to get the project

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.079
management in it bit by bit.

00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:16.370
Hopefully the point at which
it becomes helpful in each

00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:17.980
of your projects.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.090
So the first thing we're
going to talk about here

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.380
is vision statements.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.470
Why are we talking
about vision statements?

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:31.440
I'd rather be play testing
someone else's game.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.640
The very short answer is
because it's good for you

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.750
and because it's good
for your project.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:40.060
The longer answer is because
a vision statement is really

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.760
one of the shortest
and simplest ways

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.989
to make sure that you,
the people on your team,

00:40:45.989 --> 00:40:48.530
and the person you are making
the game for-- assuming you are

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.910
making the game for a client,
or an instructor or someone else

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.790
who might be interested in
it-- are all on the same page

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:59.330
and understand that understand
what they expect to get

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.650
at the end of the project.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.137
It can't guarantee
that you all believe

00:41:06.137 --> 00:41:07.720
you're getting the
same thing, but you

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.655
can get started by
being on the same page.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.030
Another very common early
design document for games

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:18.350
is the design doc.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.540
Has anybody here heard of
design documents, I assume?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.040
Yeah.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.123
Do you know what they are?

00:41:24.123 --> 00:41:28.400
Does anyone not know what I
mean when I say a design doc?

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.207
OK, traditionally--
and this is actually

00:41:31.207 --> 00:41:33.165
going further and further
back into the history

00:41:33.165 --> 00:41:35.890
of game development,
for which I am thankful.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:39.190
Traditionally, a game
design doc was a document,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.540
usually a big word page
that might occasionally

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:43.480
get printed out, that
pretty must described

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.870
the game from start to finish--
everything that was going

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.230
to happen in it, all the
mechanics, all the characters,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.900
all the stories, all the
interactions, everything

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.930
that's going to happen.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.670
It was traditionally
a very big, long file

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:00.290
that, A, either someone spent
a lot of time maintaining

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.760
and nobody be spent
any time reading,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.980
or, B, nobody spent
any time maintaining

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.800
and nobody spent
any time reading.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.790
So it was not what I would
call a very useful investment

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.300
of time, but a lot of time
tended to get invested in it.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.995
So you may ask, why?

00:42:17.995 --> 00:42:19.870
At least partially
because people feel better

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.040
when things are written down.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.040
They'd like to have a place
they can go to look at to say,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.814
am I doing what I think
we're supposed to be doing?

00:42:27.814 --> 00:42:29.230
I'd like to go
check the documents

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.188
and see if that's true.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.054
Unfortunately, a
really long document

00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:37.220
that tries to detail
everything is not the right way

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.700
to try and do this on a game.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.410
Games change too fast.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.560
And the thing you're
trying to get to,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.840
the end product of the
game, is not written.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.340
It's not something that's going
to be something you look at.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.310
It's something that
happens in action.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.340
So our proposed substitute--
and if someone comes up

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.320
with a better solution,
I would love to hear it,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.940
because vision statements are
also not the perfect thing.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.000
They're just better than
anything else I've seen.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.160
Our solution to this
is a vision statement.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.710
We tend to think that,
in between a prototype,

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.800
and a vision statement,
and really good project

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.010
communication, that's about--
and really good communication

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.590
on your project, that's most
of the design documentation

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:21.090
you need.

00:43:26.914 --> 00:43:29.330
All right, so we're going to
talk about vision statements,

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.510
and then we're
going to make one.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.820
So there you go.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.050
I forgot that I included
the animation on the slide.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.320
I did not time it right.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.300
Oh well.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.480
That's what I get for
trying to be fancy.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.100
So if a vision
statement is going

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.360
to define the project-- so
vision statements defines

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.130
the project-- or the game if
it's for a game-- for the team,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.720
for the client,
and its investors.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.710
What do you think it ought
to include to do that?

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.290
I see my chalk boards
have already been used,

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.930
and the chalk has been hidden.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:02.740
There it is.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:03.770
All right, any ideas?

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.640
Any suggestions?

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.060
What would you like to
have in such a document?

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.190
You're the ones using it.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.005
AUDIENCE: Goals.

00:44:10.005 --> 00:44:11.820
[? Scope. ?]

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.010
SARA VERILLI: Goals.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.770
Scope.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:14.425
I heard ideas.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:17.865
What kind of ideas?

00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:22.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.458
SARA VERILLI: The game.

00:44:23.458 --> 00:44:24.840
AUDIENCE: Goals, ideas.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.460
SARA VERILLI: Goals,
ideas, the game.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.210
So I've got goals.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:27.680
I've got ideas.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.305
I've got scope.

00:44:28.305 --> 00:44:29.973
I heard game.

00:44:29.973 --> 00:44:30.720
AUDIENCE: Theme.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.553
SARA VERILLI: Theme.

00:44:31.553 --> 00:44:32.070
Theme, OK.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.861
Theme, that sounds like
a really good idea.

00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:38.340
AUDIENCE: Core mechanics.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.220
SARA VERILLI: Core
mechanics, yeah.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.040
Anything else?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.640
AUDIENCE: The story
if there is one.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.473
SARA VERILLI: Story.

00:44:53.112 --> 00:44:54.070
AUDIENCE: The audience.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:55.028
SARA VERILLI: Audience.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.940
Anything else you
think you really need?

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
characters.

00:45:07.315 --> 00:45:08.356
SARA VERILLI: Characters.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.570
I think this is actually
pretty darn good list.

00:45:15.965 --> 00:45:17.590
The tricky part with
a vision statement

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.078
is trying to get most of
that in on one page or less.

00:45:24.652 --> 00:45:26.360
The other thing that
you vision statement

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.950
may want to include that is
less relevant to the vision

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.530
part of the statement and
more relevant to the team

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.570
is, who's working on the game?

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.930
What's the name of the game?

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:38.700
What is each person
on the team going

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.597
to contribute to the
game, so that the vision

00:45:41.597 --> 00:45:43.930
statement becomes both a
contract about what the game is

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.430
going to be and what the team
is going to do to get it done.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.140
So surprise, surprise.

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.240
We actually have
a format for this.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.010
Actually, we have
two different formats

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.720
to help you get all of these
things crammed in on one page

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.260
and hopefully express it well
enough that you will understand

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.760
and be able to use it.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:12.260
We have what we call the back
of the box vision statement

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.280
and a high level design
doc, and you guys

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.260
are welcome to choose to
use either one of those two

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:17.950
frameworks.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:18.866
They're up on Stellar.

00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:21.437
They can be downloaded, and
once I finish talking at you,

00:46:21.437 --> 00:46:23.770
I will pull them up so you
can see them up on the screen

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:27.470
and actually see what
the files look like.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.090
The idea behind the back
of the box vision statement

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.090
is it takes a marketing
pitch approach.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.410
Instead of actually
stating here's the goals,

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.201
here's the theme, here's
the core mechanic,

00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:40.070
here's the scope, the
team comes together

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.390
and tries to find three,
or four, or five bullet

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.820
points that would go on
the back of the box that

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:50.470
capture those ideas
within the bullet points.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:52.300
You've all seen
the box-- OK, maybe

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.740
you haven't seen the
back of a game box

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.930
these days because half the
games are being so downloaded

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.970
from Steam, but they still have
the little marketing pitches

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:07.090
where it says fire
38 different guns,

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:11.010
form teams with your
friends and back stab them.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.114
That sort of thing.

00:47:12.114 --> 00:47:14.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:19.220
But if that is the way your team
thinks and your team envisions

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.970
the game back, that
can be a very good way

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.495
to formulate and encapsulate
all of those ideas,

00:47:24.495 --> 00:47:26.120
especially if you
can really drill down

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:28.800
to what are the four things
you want people to say

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.090
about your game, and
then every time you make

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.890
a decision about your game,
every time you add a mechanic,

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.050
every time you add a story,
a character, a setting,

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:39.260
you make a change of the way
the game works, you can go back.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:42.300
Read those four or five
bullet points and say,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.260
is this change actually
enhancing and working

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.910
with that pitch?

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.160
And if it is, it's
probably a good change.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.780
And if it isn't, it
probably is a bad change.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.470
It gives you something
to really have

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.110
a core of your game around.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.741
Some people don't
think like that.

00:48:00.741 --> 00:48:02.990
Some people don't think in
terms of marketing pitches.

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:07.717
They'd much rather have a better
spelled out this is my goal.

00:48:07.717 --> 00:48:08.550
This is the setting.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.240
This is the mechanics.

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.610
A high level design doc is
the solution for those people,

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.410
and in it, it asks for a
goal statement for your game

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:21.740
as a short paragraph written
out, rather than as pitch.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:27.700
It's got a little less bang,
but it is often more precise,

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.450
and both of them are
equally effective.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.820
What really depends
on is which one

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.800
resonates with the team,
which one the team thinks

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.680
works well for them.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.180
That's why we have both of them.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.240
They're really covering
the same information.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.860
You don't save anything
by choosing one format

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.930
over the other.

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:45.770
It's just how are
you presenting it

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:48.260
to yourself and to your team.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.160
Both documents also ask for
a little bit of game play.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.510
A risk assessment-- what are
the big risks on your game?

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.750
They may be related
to your team.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.833
Hey, we're trying an engine
we never tried before.

00:48:57.833 --> 00:48:59.510
We may not be able
to get to run.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:01.090
It may be related
to the game play.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.200
We are going to try and do
a mechanic no one has ever

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.380
managed to do before.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.410
Whatever your big risk is.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.610
Just one or two sentences of it.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.510
And then some space
for your team members

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:13.468
to put in your names,
what they're going to do,

00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:14.477
stuff like that.

00:49:14.477 --> 00:49:15.560
It's really pretty simple.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.820
And the next step is, in
fact, to do exactly that.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:27.880
So as a three person
team, go ahead

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.180
and decide which format
you're going to use.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.200
Create your vision document.

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.012
Decide who's going to
upload it for Monday.

00:49:36.012 --> 00:49:37.720
Make sure you've got
people's names on it

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.780
so we know who did what, because
if we're only uploading one

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.735
document, that means
we're only getting

00:49:42.735 --> 00:49:44.610
one document for every
three people in class,

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.443
and we would like to
give credit to everyone

00:49:46.443 --> 00:49:48.216
for having worked on them.

00:49:48.216 --> 00:49:50.590
And you're going to have until
the end of class, so about

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.300
20 minutes.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:58.840
Let me see if I can find where
Rick has hidden the forms.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.620
Are they--

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.578
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sorry.

00:50:00.578 --> 00:50:01.661
Don't look at my calendar.

00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:03.820
SARA VERILLI: I'm not
looking at your calendar.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.320
Oh no.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.970
I am looking at your calendar.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.410
I'm sorry.

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.490
I'm not looking at the calendar.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.110
You're looking at the calendar.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.640
I'm sorry.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.890
PROFESSOR: I don't know how
well they're going to fit.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.280
SARA VERILLI: Well, we'll
do them one at a time.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.000
We'll just do them
one at a time.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.860
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
kind of look.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:23.090
AUDIENCE: To clarify, the
upload comes before Monday.

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.569
Not before the end
of class, right?

00:50:24.569 --> 00:50:25.360
SARA VERILLI: Yeah.

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.570
Yeah, the upload--
the turn in date

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:32.262
is for Monday, before the
start of class on Monday.

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.970
And the main thing is
you're not actually

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.530
writing division doc for
the prototype you just made.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.590
The prototype you
made is the core--

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.860
is the core mechanics for the
game you envision being made

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.120
with it for project two, OK?

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.050
So this is your vision document,
your sort of pitchy document,

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:54.260
for project two-- with
the game that will

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.552
be made for project two, OK?

00:50:56.552 --> 00:50:59.010
All right, anyway so here's
the high level design document.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:04.640
I think that there's both an
RTF format and a Word format

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.180
up there.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.760
When you upload them, we
much prefer it to be in PDF.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.530
That way easy for us to read.

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.987
I love trying to do this
while not being able to see

00:51:13.987 --> 00:51:15.195
what I'm doing on the screen.

00:51:18.805 --> 00:51:19.930
PROFESSOR: Look on Stellar.

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:21.700
SARA VERILLI: I like mice.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:22.510
I much prefer mice.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.259
I hate touch pads.

00:51:23.259 --> 00:51:25.180
PROFESSOR: I also make
mine kind of wonky.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:25.875
SARA VERILLI: Oh, thanks.

00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:26.430
PROFESSOR: You're
trying to scroll.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.910
SARA VERILLI: Thanks.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:28.201
OK, yeah, I'm trying to scroll.

00:51:28.201 --> 00:51:30.413
So this is basically the
high level design doc,

00:51:30.413 --> 00:51:33.570
and what it's got-- vision,
breakdown, major game play

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:37.840
concepts, 30 seconds of game
play, and then your risks,

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.644
and the team responsibility
and breakdown.

00:51:39.644 --> 00:51:41.810
Let's go ahead and jump
over to the vision document.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.660
And here's the
vision statement one.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.410
Basically all of
that-- goal, and stuff

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.660
needs be contained in your
back of the box advertisement.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.957
And then the rest of it
is pretty much the same.

00:51:58.957 --> 00:51:59.540
Any questions?

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:06.895
OK, if there's no questions, go.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:28.052
PROFESSOR: OK, before
you leave, just

00:52:28.052 --> 00:52:29.510
want to make sure
we all understand

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.260
what is due tomorrow,
because all of our projects

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.909
are pretty complex.

00:52:33.909 --> 00:52:34.700
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow?

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:35.570
PROFESSOR: Monday.

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:36.070
Monday.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.510
Thank you.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.030
You're awake.

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:44.220
So for project one on
Monday before class

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:46.660
starts-- so before 1:00
PM-- turn into Stellar

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.490
the following three things.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.700
An individual post
mortem-- so this

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.570
is a one page write up of
your experiences working

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:54.740
on this project.

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.140
The specifications are in
that project one assignment.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.930
That's so we can know what
you got out of this project.

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:02.260
The design change log.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.740
You made some changes today.

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.800
So on your change log,
you should at least

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.800
have one entry on
it at the end today.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.140
Now you've got two
entries on it hopefully.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.780
Test your game this weekend.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.390
Make some changes to the
prototype this weekend.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.910
Add them to the change log.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.180
Only one per team.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.530
So appoint one person to
submit all the team documents,

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.027
submit it, make sure all
of your names are on it.

00:53:25.027 --> 00:53:26.610
The vision document,
which you've just

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:29.300
been working on-- one per team.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.820
And again, it's a little
weird for project one

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.910
because you're
talking about what it

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:35.700
would be like for project two.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.450
So under team roles
and responsibilities,

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.489
project two is a
six person project.

00:53:41.489 --> 00:53:43.780
If you have an idea of what
are the complex things that

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.450
are going to be
needed for project two

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:47.800
that those mystery three
people would be working on,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.570
put them down-- or in
your case, four people.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.341
So imagine that you are working
on this project for project

00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:53.840
two.

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.510
Question?

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.785
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so for the
vision statement things,

00:53:58.785 --> 00:54:02.257
are we-- for the vision
documents [INAUDIBLE] write.

00:54:02.257 --> 00:54:03.840
PROFESSOR: Can you
hold on one second?

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.195
I can't hear.

00:54:05.195 --> 00:54:07.498
AUDIENCE: For the vision
document that we have to hand

00:54:07.498 --> 00:54:09.838
in on Monday, are
we assuming that--

00:54:09.838 --> 00:54:11.682
for the team
responsibility break down,

00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:13.640
are we assuming that
we'll be working on this--

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.715
PROFESSOR: Assume you are
working on this as-- yes.

00:54:15.715 --> 00:54:17.798
AUDIENCE: Splitting up
responsibility [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:17.798 --> 00:54:19.390
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.760
Now, what we're doing
in class-- one minute

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.427
to pitch your game as a
project two contender.

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:27.010
You're going to come up here and
just give us a quick elevator

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:27.590
pitch.

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:28.640
What is the game?

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.140
Why is the game exciting?

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.160
How does the game do
what it's going to do?

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.090
Based on this vision document.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.250
And then you're going to
give us a demonstration

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:37.620
of the prototype,
and that's actually

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.550
going to happen in this
big-- basically how

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:40.735
we did play testing today.

00:54:40.735 --> 00:54:42.110
You'll be
demonstrating the game,

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.760
and more people will play your
game so that we can figure out

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.700
which games we want to work on.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.324
Question there and
then question there.

00:54:47.324 --> 00:54:50.090
AUDIENCE: So does it
have to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:51.530
PROFESSOR: Has to be paper.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:52.620
This project one is paper.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.745
Project one is non-digital.

00:54:53.745 --> 00:54:56.908
AUDIENCE: So when do we know
which projects everybody is

00:54:56.908 --> 00:54:58.154
going to be working on.

00:54:58.154 --> 00:55:00.570
PROFESSOR: By the end of class
on Monday, all of the teams

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.240
will be formed for project two.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.160
So project two-- again,
it's a single player game,

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:06.950
project two.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.140
Some of you have made
multiplayer games.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.257
That's OK.

00:55:10.257 --> 00:55:12.840
Imagine what the game is going
to be like for a single player.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.320
Are those other players AI?

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.860
Make them AI, but project
two [? as a ?] digital game

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.620
is only a single player game.

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.720
Do not turn in a multiplayer
game for project two.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.680
For project four, we're going
to relax that, but for two

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:27.320
and three, just
to make sure we're

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:30.840
getting some games in here
let's make them single player.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.659
Again, five minutes
of game play.

00:55:32.659 --> 00:55:33.950
Again, planning for randomness.

00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:36.860
Is your game right now-- if
project one doesn't quite

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:40.180
fit that planning for
randomness theme, that's OK.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:43.395
In your vision document, what
would you do for project two

00:55:43.395 --> 00:55:46.470
to beef that up to make
that really pop out.

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:49.090
And again, project
two-- those four engines

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.720
that we worked on today.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.950
Not photon, Phaser.

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:53.300
I miswrote that.

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:56.487
Those are the game engines
we're working for project two.

00:55:56.487 --> 00:55:57.820
So I kept you a little too late.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:58.554
Sorry.

00:55:58.554 --> 00:56:00.220
If you want to keep
working in the room,

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:01.886
I don't think anybody
has it afterwards,

00:56:01.886 --> 00:56:02.950
so feel free to work.

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:04.500
Feel free to leave.
