00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.780
PROFESSOR 1: So we want
to maximize time today,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.370
both to make sure
that we're doing--

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.140
all of the presentations
get good feedback,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.916
but also so you
have time afterwards

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:33.790
to make some changes.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
So, if you haven't
signed in yet,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.170
come on down sign
up while I talk.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.920
Just get that out of
the way really quick.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.310
Schedule for today is,
we're going to probably be

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.650
done with rehearsals by 2:30.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.950
After 2:30 we are going to
have Luke from OpenCourseWare

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.990
interviewing teams and producers
from teams about the class.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.489
So, we're thinking about
how many minutes per team?

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.397
LUKE: Not too long.

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:08.213
10 to 15, casual chat.

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.920
PROFESSOR 1: Yep,
casual chat is optional,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.350
but I would appreciate
it if at least people

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.500
who did production and Scrum
Master roles would talk to him.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.940
But it could be the entire
team talking with him,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.040
and maybe one or two people
dominating the conversation.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.690
That's OK.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.590
The goal for this
is for people who

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.910
are looking at the
OpenCourseWare site,

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.170
particularly teachers
who might want

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.270
to use these materials
in their classes,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.800
to find out from the student
perspective what students got

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.374
out of the class.

00:01:38.374 --> 00:01:40.290
Because it's kind of
like student evaluations.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010
We're going to be out of the
room for that period of time.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.380
So that means after 2:30
we're out of the room,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.070
Luke's doing interviews,
and your teams

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.570
are doing whatever
teamwork you need

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.060
to do to get ready
for the demonstrations

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.536
and presentations on Wednesday.

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:57.810
PROFESSOR 2: Whatever
you say to the camera,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.677
we will not even get
a chance to see it

00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:00.760
before we give you grades.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.005
So you can whale
on if you'd like.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:07.040
PROFESSOR 1: Please do.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.280
Or at least, please be
honest-- let's try for that.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.180
I should also note,
student evaluations

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.330
are available online.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.805
Please fill those out.

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:18.680
We're going to-- actually
it's a great period

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.550
of time from 3:00
to 4:00 in class

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.370
today to just open
up your browser

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.420
and fill out your
student evaluation,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.009
right here and now so that
you get that out of the way.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.550
And again, that feedback's going
to be really helpful for us.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.924
It's going to
change how we teach

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:33.600
the course in the next year.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.430
We change it every year based on
feedback we get from students.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.675
So topics you thought you
wanted to hear more about,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.300
topics you thought
we covered too much,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.690
whatever feedback you have
for us, do let us know.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370
Last announcement we have
a guest here, [? Leigh, ?]

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.730
from Odyssey magazine.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.706
GUEST SPEAKER: It's a
kid's science magazine

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.188
for kids aged 9 to 14.

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:56.152
And we're doing an
issue devoted to gaming.

00:02:56.152 --> 00:03:00.104
And [INAUDIBLE]
graciously allowed me

00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:02.080
to come and observe
you guys as you

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.336
rehearse your presentations.

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:05.044
And I'm going to be
taking some pictures,

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:06.526
and I may ask some questions.

00:03:06.526 --> 00:03:08.666
I have some photo releases
I'm going to need you

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:09.889
to sign if I use your photos.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:10.972
So I'll pass those around.

00:03:10.972 --> 00:03:14.430
The good news is, if you don't
want me to use a photo of you,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.418
don't sign it.

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:17.888
Because I can't use
your picture without it.

00:03:17.888 --> 00:03:20.358
So that's just an easy
way to handle that.

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.828
So, I'm just going to pass
a pile of these around.

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.298
And if you're willing to
let me use your photograph,

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:26.774
fill one out.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:27.274
Thank you.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.120
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.030
All right, so for our order of
presentations just for today,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.780
not necessarily for
Wednesday-- we'll

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.255
figure out the actual order
by the end the class today.

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:42.210
We're going to start
with Heat Wave,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.830
then Hello Waves, then SNAP!,
then saving Gora Gora, then

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.200
Cholera Control.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.305
What we're asking
you to do is come up,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:52.680
plug-in the computer
that's going

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.721
to be used to demonstrate
your game and make sure

00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:56.760
your game works
on the projector.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.070
The display resolution the
native display resolution

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.100
is 1280 by 1024.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.050
If you're doing a 4 3, or
1280 by 768 if you're doing

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.984
widescreen.

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:08.150
It shouldn't make a huge
difference for your slides,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.670
but it might be a
problem for your game.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.220
So, make sure you're
coming up, doing

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.636
a quick two- or
three-minute check

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:16.170
to make sure the game works.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.589
Afterwards, plug-in
your slide presentation,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.440
and we'll just go step by step.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.300
One thing I'd like to
know from each team

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.675
is how many speakers
do you think

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:29.716
you're going to have--
how many main speakers you

00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:30.920
have in your presentations.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.200
So, starting with Heat Wave,
how many speakers do you have?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.700
One.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.210
Hello Waves?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.111
Two.

00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:42.610
SNAP!?

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.511
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:45.760
PROFESSOR 1: Saving Gora Gora?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.515
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:49.310
PROFESSOR 1: Five.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.815
And Cholera Control?

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:53.252
AUDIENCE: One for
now, maybe two.

00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:55.742
Not sure.

00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:59.180
PROFESSOR 1: So, for Heat
Waves, Hello Waves, SNAP!

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.530
And Cholera Control--
actually for all of you,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.720
whoever is doing
the most speaking,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.560
strap this little thing on.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.170
For everybody else,
when you speak,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.390
make sure you are standing
on the normal spot in front

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.110
of this, so that the
microphone can capture you.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.010
If you have-- for volume
control, it is over here.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.510
Hopefully you've
used this before.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.012
It's set at about midway.

00:05:26.012 --> 00:05:27.720
Take a note of all
the different settings

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.719
you are using when you're
plugging in your stuff

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.480
to the projector, so we can make
things go fast on Wednesday.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.974
Any questions?

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.890
All right take four more
minutes in your teams

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.770
to get yourself
ready, and Heat Wave,

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.775
please come up at 1:15
to plug-in your game.

00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:45.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.780
PROFESSOR 1: No, so time
yourself with the clock.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.150
Take a note of your own time.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.010
We're not enforcing
time limit right now.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.270
We're concentrating on content.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.009
GUEST SPEAKER:
Well, hello, my name

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.800
is Mary [? from Providence ?]
and today I'm

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.550
representing team Heat Wave.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.650
We made a game about heat
waves, not surprisingly.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.480
And these are the
people on our team.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.080
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in a minute.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.300
So, first of all, our
game was about heat waves,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.470
and the main goal our game was
to educate Red Cross workers

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.830
about what to do when a heat
wave was upcoming or was

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.910
currently in progress.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.962
How do you prepare
for it, and also what

00:06:21.962 --> 00:06:23.730
do you do to deal with it.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.690
And while we focused
on these goals,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.380
our design goals were more
specifically usability, play--

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.255
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:31.005
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.960
How did I get that
far without someone

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.027
pointing that out to me?

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:37.961
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:40.763 --> 00:06:43.890
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, we're going
to start over if that's OK.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.980
Do you mind?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.920
I really didn't get that
far in, so that's OK.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920
Heat waves-- oh, but now
I can't see the slides.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.460
OK.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.890
Heat Waves, this is our team.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.730
Heat Waves is a game to talk
and explain to Red Cross workers

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.630
what to do in order to both
prepare for heat waves,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.730
and also what to do once
you're in a heat wave.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.280
And that was the
purpose of our game.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.300
And while we had those goals
for our game educationally,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.740
our goals overall for
the design process

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.100
were playability,
usability, and education.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.649
Usability was first, because
if the game isn't usable,

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:20.690
no one's going to use it.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.730
Same with playability, if you
can't play through the game,

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.700
then it's kind of useless.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.510
And finally, our main
goal was education,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.170
because we really
wanted this game

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.900
to serve a purpose, which
was to educate people.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.201
For our design process,
we did the same process

00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:39.950
that most of the people
in this class did.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.430
We started off
with brainstorming.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.790
Then we went into team
formation, responsibilities

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.330
breakdown, and then
just constantly

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.720
updating, using Trello and
different Scrum features.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.219
I'm going to talk
about all of these

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.550
in a little bit more depth.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.040
So first of all,
brainstorming, we

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.290
started off right on the
get-go, drawing on the board.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.914
What do we want this
game to look like?

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:00.765
What are going to be
the main parts of it?

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:04.290
And we actually settled on a
somewhat complicated design,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.690
with the main screen
a dialogue system,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.280
and then kind of
an options menu.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.141
And once we had this, we
actually formed our team.

00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:16.640
This is our team minus-- I don't
think Joe's in this picture

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.450
because he was sick that day.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.210
And one thing you notice is
we had a team of nine people.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.380
So it was a lot of people
doing a lot of stuff.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.450
So we had to really
deal with that.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.080
And one way we dealt with
that was using Scrum.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.610
We had a lot of emails.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.250
But the way we managed that is,
we learned from previous times

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.020
that if you have one giant email
thread it gets overwhelming,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.150
you don't see everything.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.809
So we separated it, had a
couple different email threads

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.920
based on different
topics and subgroups.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.740
And then also we
updated our Trello.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.580
One thing we realized
really quickly

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.440
is that Trello is not so good
for listing every single Scrum.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.910
So you kind of have to
have a to-do, a done,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.370
and a working on right now,
just for future reference.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.530
And that's kind of how we
organized ourselves later on.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.280
And then just
because it's Scrum,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.690
it's an iterative process,
which is the picture.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.590
Next, we had a lot
of group meetings.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.060
And something we spent
not as much time in class

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.240
because we spent a lot
of time outside of class.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.850
We had a bunch of meetings
where we had snacks,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.050
and we would all just sit around
for like three, four hours,

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.184
and work.

00:09:22.184 --> 00:09:24.100
And those were really
productive times for us,

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.270
because it was a time where
everyone who was there

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.840
was really dedicated
to fixing bug

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.710
after bug, issue after
issue, getting things done.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.780
And they were really what
made our game come together

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.670
as much as it did.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.570
So, focus test, we
ran four focus tests.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.420
And each of our focus tests
had a different theme.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.160
So once we had our team together
and we were building the game,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.540
there were different things
working at different times.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.810
So for the first focus test,
we had a low-fidelity prototype

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.730
that with digital, and
it was a Python game.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.570
And we've tested concept--
I'll talk a little bit more

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.740
about that in a second.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.820
The second one we tested
our initial unity game,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.850
and we looked for
over-arching issues.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.090
The third test, we worked
on visuals, just how can

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.190
we emotionally resonate
with our audience.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.170
And the fourth test
was game balancing,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.980
because at the end of the
day, once you have everything

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.870
together, it's really easy to
ignore if the game is balanced

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.760
or not.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.310
So the first test we ran was a
concept of general mechanics.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.670
So as I said earlier, our
general focus was education.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.310
It was our big
goal, and we wanted

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.360
to make sure the type
of game we were building

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.460
could really convey
information and teach

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.260
the audience about something.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.560
So if any of you played
our Python test game,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.567
you would remember
that you basically

00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:42.650
had a bunch of people you
could choose to talk to.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.450
And if you talked to them, you
could offer them water, tell

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.340
them to go inside.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.550
And they'd either listen
to you or ignore you.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.980
And you just went
that way in loops

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.280
until either everyone fainted
or everyone went inside.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.770
And what we learned from that
was, first of all, it worked.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.450
People were noticing,
OK, I'm going

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.960
to focus on the
drunk guy, I'm going

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.440
to focus on the older person,
try to get them water first.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.970
Because they faint more quickly.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.335
And the other thing
we noticed right away

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.876
is something we did try to try
to make this game more lively,

00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:12.450
is we had fun dialogue.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.100
So for example, the
first quote up there

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.320
was like a more
factual, drinking water

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.930
even when you're
not too thirsty is

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.402
important in this type of heat.

00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:22.110
That's a very true
fact about heat waves.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.800
You're just supposed to drink
more water than you need to.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.610
And then the second
one is just more fun

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.920
trying to make it more
lively, hide your wife,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.300
hide your [? kill, ?]
it's heat wave.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.310
So that's something we
experimented with early-on,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:37.260
having fun or dialogue
to kind of increase

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.220
the excitingness of the game.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.650
So, the second
focus task we really

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.240
were looking for
overarching issues,

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.330
and it was our first
unity-based game,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.040
so we are working with issues
with our dialogue system,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.080
issues with how is
the playability.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.400
Does this concept of interacting
and thinking about education

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.430
still work in this
unity-based game, where it's

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.220
less of like a, oh, there's
just these old person

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.247
or young person,
which one do I choose?

00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:07.705
Instead now you
have these figures.

00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:09.480
And we tested this
out a little bit.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.580
We found the educational aspect
was still coming through,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.670
but we had a lot of playability
and usability issues.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.770
So, we needed to
majorly revamp that.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.100
So then we got our
focus test three,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.850
where we focused on the visuals.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.870
So once we went
through play test two,

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.100
we realized, OK, we can fix a
lot of this usability stuff.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.400
And now we want to see, can
we make this game emotionally

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.800
resonate with the players.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.690
And make it feel like
less of just kind of like,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.230
I'm sitting there looking at
this red screen and it's like,

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.630
argh.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.480
So we had this, and
what we were looking

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.860
to talk to people about was
the different characters,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.950
were they still
prioritizing in this scene.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.640
And it turns out they weren't,
because those labels didn't

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.860
move with the people.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.484
And even if the
labels had moved,

00:12:58.484 --> 00:13:00.400
people said the labels
were too small to read,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.010
they were confusing-- really
should just get rid of them,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.540
and instead either add
little icons or caricatures

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.554
of different types of people
in order to choose who to help.

00:13:10.554 --> 00:13:12.470
So those were the kinds
of questions we asked.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.400
And we actually showed
them a sample artwork

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.040
of a redone homeless
person drawing.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.310
And people said that, that
was a lot more informative

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.910
and that way we didn't have
to have like little text

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.340
that no one could read.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.380
So focus test 3 was
really about the visuals,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:32.910
and we really re-did a lot
of our visuals based on that.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.840
Sorry, this mouse is a
little non-responsive.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.330
Finally, focus
test four-- I think

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.890
you all probably
had one of these--

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.910
was just game balancing.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.890
The end condition of
our game is basically

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.410
when people faint, how
many people have fainted.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.610
And if a certain number
of people have fainted,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.890
then we stop the game.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.800
And the problems with that was
that it was, at first, there

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.250
was too many people, and
everybody was dying right away.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.330
And then we instead of ramped
up the number of people,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.460
and then there was an
issue where, you were fine,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.490
you were fine, you
were fine, and then

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.362
suddenly everyone died
on the fourth day.

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:09.320
Because there were suddenly
100 people, and you

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.060
could not help them all.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.760
So focus test four
really focused on that,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.420
and trying to
balance the game out.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.660
Along the way, we
made some bad choices.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.860
Every team does.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.740
And the main ones we
made was, we decided

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.600
to depend on external code.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.140
And while we thought
it would allow

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.770
us to make a more
complicated game,

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.550
we didn't really
foresee how much

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.730
we would have to
adjust ourselves

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.630
around the external code.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.570
It's a two-way street.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.030
And so it kind of impeded
our progress sometimes.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.410
It added a lot more
complexity, things

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.460
that we weren't expecting.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.410
And then the other thing
we made a mistake on,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.920
which I'd like to
emphasize, is we

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.200
focused on education, which
was a great thing to do,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.540
but we forgot to focus on fun.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.350
And one thing we did
to compensate for it,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.360
as I mentioned, is add
that dialogue, that banter,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.540
that makes something
that's kind of dull

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.120
a little more interesting.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.252
But even so, I think one
thing that if we went back

00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:07.710
and we did things
differently, we'd

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.810
focus on fun as a
number-one priority,

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.220
along with playability,
usability, and education.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.915
So ours became a pretty
standard learning game,

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.787
as we talked about them.

00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:19.620
Good choices, we had a
lot of group meetings

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.560
with snacks, great idea.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.920
Turns out people come
if you have snacks.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.680
Just if you were wondering.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.130
And then we prioritize.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.305
So everybody prioritized.

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:30.180
But one thing we had to
deal with, because we

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.490
had such a large
team, was not everyone

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.290
was available at the same time.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.000
So it was really
prioritizing not only

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.740
based on what needed
to be done but even

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.970
if something kind of had already
been assigned who can actually

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.201
work on this right now and
get it done, and like when

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:44.450
are they going to get it done.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.230
So we really worked
with that and kept

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.580
iterating and
figuring out, based

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.570
on what needed to get done right
now, who was going to do it.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:59.632
So the game itself is composed
of really three screens

00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:01.340
but a couple of them
have sub-components.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.780
So, the Start screen with
an instruction screen;

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.080
the main game, which has the
daytime screen and a newspaper

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.250
scene in it, which is like the
end of each day you see that;

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.650
and then the end
screen, just you

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.190
can take a look at all of these.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.290
So originally, this
was our start screen.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:19.720
Main feedback with that
was, it was not pretty,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.920
and it was not informative.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.855
So when we redid it, we
added an instruction screen,

00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:26.980
which is actually still
having a little bit of bugs

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.790
with the readability.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.610
But what we did
was we added a way

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.690
for players who didn't play the
game before to find out what

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.430
they actually needed to do.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.365
And then the actual game, the
original, we had-- I showed you

00:16:42.365 --> 00:16:44.250
on our focus test two
and then our focus

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.880
test three with the people
moving, but the labels not

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.380
moving.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.260
We really iterated
the main game to make

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.410
that as usable as possible.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.750
And our final result-- well
this is actually in progress.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.770
So one thing we updated
in progress that I almost

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.220
forgot to mention, was that
we saw in focus test two

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.442
and focus test three that
visuals really important.

00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:05.900
And one thing we
weren't displaying

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.800
at all that was
very educationally

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.079
important, that Pablo
actually mentioned,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.190
was that as people are about to
faint, they usually get sick.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.186
If you see somebody
who's about to faint,

00:17:16.186 --> 00:17:19.450
they'll like start sweating, and
turn red, and all this stuff.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.180
And in our game, they just
kind of keeled over and died.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.375
So, we needed a way
to implement that.

00:17:25.375 --> 00:17:27.750
But we couldn't necessarily
like draw a million different

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.369
character art.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.080
So, we decided on
the simple solution

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.784
was just to add a little-- that
little circle, like the thing

00:17:33.784 --> 00:17:36.200
above their heads, you can all
see it with the exclamation

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.160
point.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.320
And that was something
we did in progress.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.890
And finally we integrated that
with the new character art,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.642
and this is the
final game-- I don't

00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:47.850
know what those squares are,
they're not in our game.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.180
But you can see the people
are a lot more descriptive.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.760
I think that's pretty
obviously that's an old person,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.850
they have a walker.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.780
And we had to rely on these
caricatures of people, which

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.459
really worked out in terms of
like getting visual feedback

00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:03.500
when we talked to people.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.280
They were much more responsive
to this than like labels

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.620
or even like little symbols.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.705
They really liked the art.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.110
And finally-- not finally,
but the other part of our main

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.350
game was the newspaper scene.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.990
And initially we just had a
lot of information displayed,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.720
and no one actually read it,
because they didn't think they

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.250
could do anything about it.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.490
And they also just didn't
like looking at it.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.440
It was confusing.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.510
So we re-did that, and so
made it a little more visually

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.070
appealing.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.130
And something we did
that I didn't mention

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.650
on the previous side
about the main scene,

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.940
is that we actually added
more longer-term options.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.050
So this was more relevant
as you were playing.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.610
Because if it was
cooler on a day,

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.080
you could start
installing umbrellas.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.470
And then you would
actually be like, OK, well,

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.452
it's actually 115
today, so I'm not

00:18:50.452 --> 00:18:51.910
going to install
any umbrellas, I'm

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.534
just going to try to
give people water.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:15.080
And then finally-- so
originally at the end

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.650
of our game, as you can
see, there was no end scene.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.470
And that's kind of important.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.947
So, people really
wanted feedback

00:19:21.947 --> 00:19:24.030
as to-- they didn't just
want the game to restart,

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.920
they wanted to
know how they did.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.350
Even if it's educational,
part of that fun that

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.370
was something we
obviously didn't focus on,

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.150
was just knowing, oh, I
actually did pretty well.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.580
This many people-- like
I lasted this many days,

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.894
or this many people like
went inside because of me.

00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:41.810
And that's because we
weren't focusing on fun,

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.590
we didn't even think about the
importance of an end screen.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.280
Right?

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.780
So, when we re-did it,
we added this end screen,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.910
and it tells you how
long you survived.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.140
So, two hours, five days, you
can get a sense of how long

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:01.660
can I keep it up and make sure
everybody was working out well.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.840
So that's our whole game.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.980
And looking back at this
whole process, something

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.710
we've discussed as a team
that we would do differently,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.430
is passion.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.460
So one thing about heat waves we
all thought initially, oh, it's

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:16.640
such cool topic, heat
waves, it gets hot.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.730
And then we read about
it, and it was actually

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.620
a surprisingly
simple phenomenon.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.560
It gets hot, people drink water,
go inside, and that's about it.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.260
There's not really a lot
of complexity to the issue.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.014
And so a lot of us lost
our passion very early on.

00:20:31.014 --> 00:20:32.930
And I think if we were
going to do this again,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.711
we'd somehow incorporate
something in addition

00:20:35.711 --> 00:20:37.210
to the heat waves
that would make us

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.180
more passionate about the game.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.900
The other thing we'd do
differently is accountability.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.500
Just making sure that--
with such a large team

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.190
you have to really keep track
of everyone doing everything.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.010
We really focused
on prioritizing

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.640
who was like actually
had time to give

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.070
and making sure they got tasked
on-- which worked out really

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.370
well.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.060
But at the same time,
there were people

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.240
who sometimes were
kind of lost and didn't

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.061
know where the game was going.

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:04.810
Because we weren't
always on the same page

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.210
with such a large team,
nine people's a lot.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.790
But it still worked
out really well.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:15.170
And I'd say that
given everything, we

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.172
did pretty well with it.

00:21:16.172 --> 00:21:17.880
And if we were going
to do more features,

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.070
something we talked about
was more long-term options,

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.130
people like those.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.090
They made it more
fun, because you

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.750
had more of an
optimization problem

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.840
if you had more
long-term choices.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.340
Those were kind of hard to
think of, because in heat waves

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.310
there aren't that many.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:34.700
Like you can install an
AC unit, and then maybe

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.810
a water fountain.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.260
But we were thinking maybe we
can make this a bigger scope

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.350
game, add multiple
environments so you

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.900
have more long-term options.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.420
And really build up the
complexity over time,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.760
so this game can be more
realistic of a community

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.000
as a whole instead of
a single environment.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.650
And that's really
what we wanted to do.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.800
Thank you so much.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.020
Are there any questions?

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.498
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:59.498 --> 00:22:05.012
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, so
comments about presentation.

00:22:05.012 --> 00:22:05.720
Anybody up there?

00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:11.060
Yes, so can you load up your
game make sure your game works?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.850
Can somebody come down here
from the team and do that?

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.420
And you can answer questions
while we-- so feedback from us

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.804
then about the presentation.

00:22:24.804 --> 00:22:26.220
The main question
I had-- like you

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.800
covered a whole
bunch of stuff, which

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.610
is really good-- the
things we're asking for,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.431
what went right,
what went wrong,

00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:35.472
you did in a different
format, but you got to it,

00:22:35.472 --> 00:22:37.800
and that was fine,
that was good.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.240
The one thing I would have
loved more information on,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.020
if you can fit it, is
the external code issue.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.540
Specifically, what
was the external code,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.250
why was it in there,
what did you think

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.500
it was going to help you with?

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.180
And then what did end up
like-- just a couple lines

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.522
of those details about

00:22:52.522 --> 00:22:53.730
GUEST SPEAKER: More specific.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:54.855
PROFESSOR 1: More specific.

00:22:54.855 --> 00:22:56.840
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes,
definitely. [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.970
PROFESSOR 1: And really
what is it giving you

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.972
that basic unity
wasn't giving you.

00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:05.828
GUEST SPEAKER: OK,
absolutely. [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:05.828 --> 00:23:07.840
PROFESSOR 2: Let's see,
I like the structure,

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.622
as [? Rick ?] said,
you got to everything.

00:23:09.622 --> 00:23:11.580
But actually the way how
you structured it also

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.080
works really well
for all the points

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.019
that you intended to hit.

00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.727
If we are following
this particular order

00:23:16.727 --> 00:23:17.832
of presentation--

00:23:17.832 --> 00:23:19.290
PROFESSOR 1: We're
not necessarily,

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.380
we're going to figure
out what the order is

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.540
after we do the all.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.020
PROFESSOR 2: Whoever
goes first will probably

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.637
need to explain who
Pablo is to the audience.

00:23:26.637 --> 00:23:27.720
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, sorry--

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.680
PROFESSOR 2: No, no,
no, it's not something

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.388
that you would
necessarily have expected.

00:23:31.388 --> 00:23:34.090
But whoever goes
first on Wednesday,

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.066
if you talk about
any of the clients,

00:23:36.066 --> 00:23:37.940
you have to assume that
your audience doesn't

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.540
know who the clients are.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.359
And different teams
had different clients

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:42.650
that they were talking to, too.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.902
So do just explain [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:44.902 --> 00:23:47.360
PROFESSOR 1: We'll introduce--
basically we're making games

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.330
about the topic, but
your specific topic--

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.080
GUEST SPEAKER: If I
have to mention Pablo,

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.000
I should say who it is, or I
shouldn't mention him directly.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.920
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.700
PROFESSOR 2: Yes, or just
give his name and who he is,

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.290
that will do wonders.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.997
Something for anybody who's
using Google Presentations,

00:24:04.997 --> 00:24:06.955
Google Slides or whatever
that thing is called,

00:24:06.955 --> 00:24:09.860
I think the Ask button
brings up your notes.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.767
So if you have notes-- I wasn't
sure if you were relying on--

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:15.350
GUEST SPEAKER: No, I just wanted
to be able to see the slides.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.805
That's why [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:16.805 --> 00:24:19.710
PROFESSOR 2: You also get
a little preview slide.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.870
So if you hit the Ask
button, you bring that up.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.030
Also it automatically
brings up the,

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.690
"Google Drive is
using full screen,

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.750
click this to make
it disappear."

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.000
And that's really distracting.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.869
So whoever is using Google
drives, make sure you do that.

00:24:33.869 --> 00:24:35.410
And you may want to
use the keyboard,

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:36.680
because the mouse was not--

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.606
GUEST SPEAKER: It
was flipping out.

00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:39.390
PROFESSOR 2: Yes, it was
there was not cooperating.

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.354
GUEST SPEAKER: I brought it
for the actual game play,

00:24:41.354 --> 00:24:42.895
but we're not playing
the game today.

00:24:42.895 --> 00:24:45.915
PROFESSOR 2: OK, so
recharge, and if it

00:24:45.915 --> 00:24:48.120
starts to give you that
same problem, for the slides

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.210
at least, you may want to
just avoid using the mouse.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.251
PROFESSOR 1: Actually,
putting it in mirror mode,

00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:54.290
too, instead of two
screens, would at least

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.980
give you a full-screen
version of the slides.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.937
The speaker notes give
you a very tiny version

00:24:58.937 --> 00:24:59.200
of the slides.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.800
PROFESSOR 2: Yes, it was
very hard to see, actually.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.900
So mirroring your
screen back and forth

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.316
will also make it so that you
don't every have to do that.

00:25:05.316 --> 00:25:06.950
GUEST SPEAKER: Can
you write that down?

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.430
PROFESSOR 2: I can email this
actually, at least these notes.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.480
At the beginning of
your presentation.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.710
If you can just--
when you introduce

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.880
that your game's
about heat waves,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.810
before you go into
the things that you

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.400
did, if you can just
very briefly talk

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.111
about what Red Cross workers
have to do in heat waves.

00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:28.110
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, yeah.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.840
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah,
of course, if that's

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.410
after you demonstrate
your game, then

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.790
that may not be so necessary.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.072
But just to give
people an-- just

00:25:35.072 --> 00:25:37.280
to make sure that before
you start talking about this

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.721
is what your team did, just
give people an idea of this

00:25:40.721 --> 00:25:42.345
is what you're going
to do in the game.

00:25:42.345 --> 00:25:44.680
PROFESSOR 1: And you
all have a choice

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.952
of demoing the game before
the presentation or after.

00:25:46.952 --> 00:25:48.910
It's whatever works best
for your presentation.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.230
PROFESSOR 2: So if you're
showing the game first

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.620
you may not need
to describe this,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.869
but it if you're showing the
game after your talk then

00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:56.790
you definitely need
to explain that.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.360
When you say, "over-arching
issues," as a bullet point,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.910
that tells me nothing.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.780
It's like, you had a big issue.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.780
But then later on of
course you went into detail

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.405
and talked-- oh, it
was about dialogue,

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:09.200
it was about learning,
and stuff like that.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.366
I think the first time you
introduce a bullet point,

00:26:11.366 --> 00:26:13.480
say over-arching
issues, and you say,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.270
such as, the dialogue, bugs,
and the learning, very quickly,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.890
just so that bullet
point means something.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.640
[? Rick ?] had already mentioned
the thing about external code.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.660
When you talked about how
you swapped your art assets,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.010
and you said, we talked
to people about the art.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:34.934
Did you the mean play testers,
or did you mean your client,

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.350
or did you mean
your team members?

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:36.940
Right?

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.740
They're all people,
so which people?

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.430
Yeah.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.520
I was assuming play testers
based on the context.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.040
And finally, this has nothing
to do the presentation.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.756
Does the game still
use Fahrenheit?

00:26:49.756 --> 00:26:51.699
GUEST SPEAKER: Can
we change that?

00:26:51.699 --> 00:26:53.074
PROFESSOR: What
was the question?

00:26:53.074 --> 00:26:53.548
GUEST SPEAKER: Fahrenheit?

00:26:53.548 --> 00:26:54.980
I don't think we have changed--

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.910
PROFESSOR: The game is
still on Fahrenheit.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.620
GUEST SPEAKER: It's
still on Fahrenheit.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.203
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:59.203 --> 00:27:01.990
GUEST SPEAKER: We can
change that today.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:06.280
PROFESSOR: It's a bit risky
to change it at this point.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.240
You might want to list
that on your things

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.410
to change in the future
maybe, just add [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.410
PROFESSOR: That's enough.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's enough.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.500
I wouldn't touch the code.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.833
PROFESSOR: Don't touch the code.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.187
Please don't touch the code.

00:27:17.187 --> 00:27:18.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.257
Just acknowledge
that, because that

00:27:20.257 --> 00:27:21.840
was one of the big
pieces of feedback,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.960
is that only the
US uses Fahrenheit.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.400
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:26.900
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.400
PROFESSOR:

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.330
PROFESSOR: I'm not following,
so he got [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.217
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:31.800
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.610
PROFESSOR: So make
sure it actually plays.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.250
So you're going to demonstrate
it in unity rather than

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.771
as a web hosted version?

00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:42.812
GUEST SPEAKER: We might
do a [INAUDIBLE] version,

00:27:42.812 --> 00:27:43.680
but we haven't had luck yet.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.450
PROFESSOR: OK, cool.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.380
GUEST SPEAKER: We're
meeting after class.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:45.850
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.058
But it looks like whatever
you're going to run it in,

00:27:48.058 --> 00:27:50.390
it's going to work
at that resolution.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:51.620
And is there audio for it?

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.453
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:27:52.453 --> 00:27:54.386
There is.

00:27:54.386 --> 00:27:57.160
But it's not playing right now.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.023
Oh, there's some.

00:28:02.023 --> 00:28:04.440
GUEST SPEAKER: One of the
things got lost, apparently.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.820
PROFESSOR: So at
least it's not muted.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.020
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm sorry.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.974
PROFESSOR: It looks
like heartburn.

00:28:10.974 --> 00:28:13.505
It looks like it
ate something bad.

00:28:13.505 --> 00:28:14.880
GUEST SPEAKER:
Thank you so much.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.628
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:18.352
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:18.352 --> 00:28:20.060
PROFESSOR: And thank
you for being first.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:20.726
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:20.726 --> 00:28:23.010
PROFESSOR: I'll
email you the notes.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.730
PROFESSOR: "Hello
Waves," come on down.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.560
GUEST SPEAKER: So it's
a little light on there,

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.440
but our game is "Hello Waves."

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.820
It's a game about forecast
based financing that we're

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.800
developing for the Red Cross.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.530
The idea of forecast
based financing

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.340
is using the idea of a forecast
about the future in order

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.230
to make decisions that are more
effective than just reacting

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.160
to disasters when they happen.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.865
So I'd like to show you a
play through of our game.

00:28:54.786 --> 00:28:56.160
It should open up.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:56.745
Great.

00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:59.211
And let me turn on the sound.

00:28:59.211 --> 00:29:02.480
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.300
So this is "Hello Waves."

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.790
Here are the instructions.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.290
We would have done a tutorial
if we had enough time,

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:16.939
but this gets the idea across,
and designing a good tutorial

00:29:16.939 --> 00:29:18.480
that actually teaches
the player well

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.570
is hard to do in a logical flow.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.420
So we have these instructions
that explain how to play,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.030
what the point of the game
is, and a couple of tips

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.840
about how the game works.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.020
So if we go into
the play screen,

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:36.110
you see something similar
to what we showed you

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:39.600
a couple weeks ago, where you
have all these different toys

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.980
out there, castles.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.720
And as you go through
the days, you'll

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.790
see a forecast of
what the water level's

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.870
going to be at over time.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.560
And so you can see
that right now.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.560
They're gathering candy.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.450
The water level changed.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.210
This character is underwater,
and so he takes damage.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.000
And so what you
actually want to do

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.110
is you want to move
toys out of the water

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.780
so that they don't get damaged.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:04.310
However, they can only move
one castle over at a time.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.495
So because we didn't
think ahead well enough,

00:30:06.495 --> 00:30:08.120
we'll see that this
truck will actually

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.989
take damage on the next term,
because he's underwater.

00:30:11.989 --> 00:30:13.530
Actually, he ended
up not underwater.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.840
We got lucky there.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.200
But theoretically,
he would have.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.740
And so as you go through
it, the end goal of the game

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.950
is to build a castle.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.580
And so every toy
when they're home

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.370
can either choose
between gathering candy

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.880
to feed evacuated toys
or building the castle

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.780
to reach your end
goal of the game.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.440
And then the idea
of the forecast

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.460
is that you want to use
the forecast in order

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.460
to know how much candy
you're going to need over

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.680
the next couple of days and
to use it to know when you're

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.720
going to need to
evaporate various toys

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.885
from their variously
hidden homes.

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.805
So back to the presentation.

00:30:51.805 --> 00:30:54.810
Full screen.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.280
So we had a couple of challenges
in the design process.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.890
The first and the
major one is really

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.720
that we were trying to teach
about forecast based financing,

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.600
which was a bit of
an abstract topic.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.240
It's a little different than
just thinking long term,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.940
because you have to use the idea
of there's some information we

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.210
know about the
future that we want

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:15.585
to use to make
optimal decisions,

00:31:15.585 --> 00:31:19.790
or at least decisions based on
some idea of the risk that's

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.170
out there.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.234
But we also wanted
to avoid things

00:31:23.234 --> 00:31:24.650
like just pushing
a button to win,

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.190
where you have all
the information

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.990
you ever need, and
there's just one option

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.090
that you know you're
going to pick every time.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.609
And the game has no
thought whatsoever.

00:31:32.609 --> 00:31:34.150
And we also needed
to think about how

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.510
we were going to communicate
the forecast to the player

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:40.680
so that they could then
use that to make decisions.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.740
One of the problems that we
also ran into related to this

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.240
was that we focused a lot on the
idea forecast based financing

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.180
as the topic, and then
tried to build a game built

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.680
on top of that topic instead
of building a game that

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.930
used forecast based financing.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:56.320
So that held us back
a lot in the beginning

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.670
when we were trying
to come up with ideas.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.960
We also had a really difficult
initial target audience

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.310
of policymakers-- 50,
60-year-old government

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:09.490
officials, or people at NGOs who
were going to be using forecast

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:10.970
to make decisions of some sort.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.345
And it was supposed
to teach them

00:32:12.345 --> 00:32:14.957
about how they can use forecast
to make these decisions,

00:32:14.957 --> 00:32:16.790
except this was a really
difficult audience,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.780
because they don't
generally play games.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.134
And they don't
have a lot of time

00:32:21.134 --> 00:32:22.550
to learn about
this kind of thing.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.670
And so we couldn't
really expect to get

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.420
them to sit down for
a long period of time

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.380
and play around with our game.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.072
In order to deal
with these problems,

00:32:31.072 --> 00:32:32.530
we came up with a
couple solutions.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.310
The first thing was that we
had no idea what kind of game

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:37.890
would work, or would make
sense, or anything like that.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.720
So what we did is we
just broke our team up

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.110
into multiple groups
and came up with a bunch

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:44.720
of different prototypes.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720
On paper, we had two
different prototypes.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.770
One that focused on
the idea of managing

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.000
a city, and its resources,
and its response to disasters,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.860
versus focusing on
individual people,

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.860
and how you're going to
move them around to keep

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.070
them safe from the disasters.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.936
And then we went
into a whole bunch

00:32:58.936 --> 00:33:00.310
of different
digital prototypes--

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.270
one that was a text based
game about managing a city.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:07.720
We had one that looked
like this, where

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.270
you had two different
cities, and you

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.320
were specifying what
workers were going to do,

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.610
or when they would leave the
city in order to stay safe.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.360
And then we would take
the different ideas

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.980
that we were learning from
both of these prototypes,

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.990
combine them together,
take things out.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:25.880
And our final prototype actually
uses ideas from all of these.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.880
Another solution that
we got lucky with

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.759
is when Pablo came
to play our game,

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:33.300
he told us that we
actually shouldn't

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.549
focus on the policymakers,
because he wasn't confident

00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:38.450
that he could actually
get them to play the game.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.160
And so we switched our target
to being grade schoolers, which

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.060
is why you saw the cutesy art
with the beach and the toys.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.430
This actually made it
a lot easier for us,

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.727
because we could target
people who probably

00:33:50.727 --> 00:33:52.810
had some experience with
games, or at least wanted

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.510
to do something fun, and
would be curious to learn

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:58.200
about our topic.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.020
GUEST SPEAKER: So
for our development

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.462
process-- or I can
just speak here, right?

00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:07.961
Yeah.

00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:09.252
You can speak right from there.

00:34:09.252 --> 00:34:10.270
That's fine.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:12.560
GUEST SPEAKER: So
another big issue,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.250
another set of challenges
that we ran into

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.510
was through our
development process.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.874
And so we had initially
issues with communication

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:23.110
and facilitation.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:27.510
Our team had a wide variety of
experiences and backgrounds.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.310
Some were hardcore gamers,
some mostly mobile gamers.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.929
And so there were initially
a lot of disagreements

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.499
on what level of game
we wanted to create,

00:34:37.499 --> 00:34:40.400
and what sort of
game, casual versus

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.330
hardcore that we
wanted to create.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.719
And so we needed to
overcome challenges

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.699
of facilitation and
communication within our team.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.530
Another major challenge
in our development process

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.960
that we had to face came
from our design issues,

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.170
where for a very
long time, we had

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.380
a vague vision of what to do.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.890
We didn't know what kind
of game we wanted to make,

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.160
and so we purposely tried
to keep our game ideas vague

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.230
as we built prototypes.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:13.340
But then we ran into issues
where we would have solutions.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.360
But no consensus on
which solution was best,

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.340
and where we went for
long periods of time

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.050
without having a clear
direction of where

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.830
we wanted our final game to be.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:30.560
So our solutions
for the challenges

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.140
proposed by development
were a team structure.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.350
And so we structured
our team loosely

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.680
into three subteams-- a
production subteam, which

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:47.230
would take care of production,
like the deliverables,

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.790
and making sure that
all the game ideas are

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.670
being communicated properly.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.270
A technical team, which
worked primarily with the code

00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:59.980
and making sure
the game got done,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.790
and then a user
experience team, which

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:05.520
handled art, UI, and sound.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.050
And so we kept our
responsibilities flexible.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:15.430
So as team members got
busy over the semester,

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:18.170
or as changing conditions,
lots of different people

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:22.910
contributing,
responsibilities were

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:26.780
able to easily flow between
teams and team members.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.219
And additionally,
another idea we

00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:32.010
started with in the
beginning with the idea

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.640
of sub-team leaders.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.760
[INAUDIBLE] the two people
marked with the l's.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.080
But that was an idea
we later abandoned

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.830
in favor of just having a
more flexible team structure,

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.490
or a flat team structure.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:49.310
Another solution for helping
our development process

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.030
was the use of good
code practices.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.330
And I cannot emphasize enough
that this really helped speed

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:59.330
up our development, because we
didn't run into trouble with

00:36:59.330 --> 00:36:59.830
code.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.510
It was mostly with design.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:08.750
So we used Yeoman, which is
a JavaScript module system.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.350
And basically, it allowed
our code to be interoperable.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.920
We can write one module
separately from another module.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:22.110
So that solved a lot of issues
with dependencies, or people

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.420
working in parallel,
because it allowed people

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.960
to work in parallel without
overriding each other's code.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.420
We also used good code practice
with state machines and NBC,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.280
which is motor vehicle control.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.460
And so we had a very object
oriented code, very modular.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:43.710
And when we did need to change
our code, rip it all out

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.710
and put it back in, it
actually didn't turn out

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.310
to be too painful, because we
just had to switch a couple

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:49.030
objects around.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:58.850
And then one final solution
that we used for our development

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.050
processes were Slack and Scrum.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.200
So Slack is like a
modernized IRC chat room,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.400
and it's very feature rich.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.040
It has a lot of integrations
with GitHub, and Google Drive,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.260
and things like that.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.370
And so that real time
communication actually

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.500
made it so that we didn't
really have to meet

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.880
outside of class too often.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.940
If someone was working, we
would just email out saying,

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.530
I'm on the Slack.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.510
And then people could
meet on the slack.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.330
And it was full featured enough.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:33.320
We could send attachments
and things like that.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.400
Most of our communication
in person communication

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.390
could be done in class.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:45.710
And in class, we adopted a daily
Scrum format, where we simply

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.160
said what we had done
since the previous class

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.220
and what our goals
were until next class.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.920
So in the end though, we did
have to cut some features.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.940
These features mainly
were the idea of again,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.080
a tutorial, or multiple levels,
simply because they'd just

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.970
be too much content that we
need to play test in order

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:14.660
to make sure that it was
a consistent quality got

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:19.090
our message across,
and also, trying

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:24.170
to add more individuality
to the toys that you saw.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.770
They have different
graphics, but that's as much

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.750
as we could do, given
the time constraints.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.400
So kindly just bring it back.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:41.380
And our three worst
decisions were first,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.340
we did end up
spending a lot of time

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.850
on code and assets
that never got used.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:53.160
We maybe used 10% to
20% of our final work

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.900
in our final project.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.120
Actually, maybe that
is a bit overkill.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.970
But maybe 30% of our
final code and assets

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.770
in our final project.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.590
This really was due to
this second bad decision,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.480
that we kept the game
and its direction

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.200
too vague for too long.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.490
We always were holding
out that oh, maybe we'll

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.590
be able to come up with
a better game idea.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.280
Or maybe we'll find
some magic solution

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.900
to how we can make forecast
based financing into a game.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.180
And because of
this mindset, we'd

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:31.830
spent probably the first half
of the project just staying

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.320
too vague, and that
hurt us in the end,

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.620
because we spent so
much time going in all

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.430
these different directions.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:45.240
And really, the decision that
captured those first two though

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.010
is the fact that we tried
to make a game on top

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.440
of forecast based financing.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.110
So we had forecast
based financing.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.020
And we were like, how can
we scan this as a game?

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.030
Whereas once we switched
that mindset and thought,

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.970
let's have a game,
and how can we

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.150
put forecast based
financing into it?

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:07.380
I think that was the moment that
we then came together as a team

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.830
and really started making the
final game that we wanted.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.040
So our best decision.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.738
GUEST SPEAKER: So one
of our best decisions

00:41:18.738 --> 00:41:21.897
was that we chose good tools
at the beginning, which

00:41:21.897 --> 00:41:25.120
meant that as we went through
all these different prototypes,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.150
we actually didn't have to
completely rewrite our game.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.086
We could pull out the
way that workers worked.

00:41:30.086 --> 00:41:31.710
In one game, we could
pull out the view

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.246
that we were using
in another game.

00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:35.120
And then we could just
combine them together,

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.078
and that allowed us to
move quickly whenever we

00:41:37.078 --> 00:41:39.920
were changing our prototype.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:43.472
We also weren't afraid to trust
each other, both, in terms

00:41:43.472 --> 00:41:45.314
of what everyone was
working on, but also,

00:41:45.314 --> 00:41:47.230
in terms of the decisions
that we were making.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.660
And so when we said that we
had to throw something out,

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.906
we all understood that it was
for the good of the project.

00:41:53.906 --> 00:41:55.530
And we didn't have
a lot of complaining

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:58.232
or hurt feelings when
something didn't get put in,

00:41:58.232 --> 00:42:02.494
or when we decided to throw
out our assets or code.

00:42:02.494 --> 00:42:04.730
And when we got
to the end, we had

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.410
been through enough
of this vagueness

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.200
that we were all
frustrated with it.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.921
And we realized that we had
an idea that we all liked,

00:42:11.921 --> 00:42:14.170
and we really got on board
with it and made it happen.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.420
Once we started working
on our final idea,

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.397
we saw that it worked.

00:42:18.397 --> 00:42:20.105
Basically, every
decision from that point

00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:22.530
on was how do we make
this game better?

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.788
And we were all on
board with that vision.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.270
Thank you.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.764
Any questions?

00:42:30.764 --> 00:42:34.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:35.246 --> 00:42:38.732
[? PROFESSOR: Anyone in the ?]
audience have [INAUDIBLE] first

00:42:38.732 --> 00:42:39.806
before--

00:42:39.806 --> 00:42:41.222
AUDIENCE: We can't
see [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:41.222 --> 00:42:42.879
across the [? room. ?]

00:42:42.879 --> 00:42:43.712
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:42:43.712 --> 00:42:45.660
We'll have to make all
of our slides darker.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:46.326
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:46.326 --> 00:42:47.164
Yellow and white.

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:47.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.790
Like the yellow and white
on your early screen,

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.790
I was doing this on [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.900
I realize that's the game,
not the presentation.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.899
But wow.

00:42:58.899 --> 00:43:01.190
PROFESSOR: It's also a little
faded in the game itself.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.190
It could be the display
resolution you're using,

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:05.950
so after class, after
we're done with everything,

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.050
try different resolutions.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:07.765
See if it makes a difference.

00:43:07.765 --> 00:43:08.100
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:08.766
That's be great.

00:43:11.284 --> 00:43:13.700
PROFESSOR: The music in the
game development was too high.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.110
It was overpowering your voice.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.610
So I think you were
almost hollering just

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:19.815
to be able to be heard.

00:43:19.815 --> 00:43:21.380
It doesn't need to be that loud.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.380
So you can just crank
down the volume right down

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:27.680
on the computer or on
the controls over there.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.400
Something that I
had a question for.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.180
You don't have to
answer it today.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.290
But you might want to put
it in your presentation.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:39.330
How long was the design
of what you eventually

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.740
established on the table before
you decided that this was

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.410
the thing you were going for?

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.690
Because I'm assuming it
was one of your vague--

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.170
it came up during
your vague idea phase.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.930
And you're implying that you
were in that mode for too long.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.950
But I don't know how
long it was on the table,

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.030
or was it only something
you figured out

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.470
at the end of the
vague idea phase?

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.970
Because otherwise,
you wouldn't have

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:04.060
been able to switch to
this idea if it was not

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.393
on the table in the first place.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.740
And how did you decide this
was it, that the same household

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.820
game was going to
be-- I understand--

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.020
I think you very clearly
explained the benefits

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.500
of deciding this was it.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.652
But how did you come to
the conclusion that it was?

00:44:21.652 --> 00:44:23.360
That's stuff I wanted
to hear more about.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.124
But you don't have
to answer it now.

00:44:26.124 --> 00:44:26.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.290
And just a little
bit of specificity.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.755
You mentioned you spent too
long on that design phase.

00:44:31.755 --> 00:44:33.636
I wonder how long that was.

00:44:33.636 --> 00:44:35.719
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:38.010
PROFESSOR: You said Pablo
switched your target audience

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.080
for you, telling
us whether that was

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.350
because of the game that he saw,
or because of something else.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.550
If you know that information,
throw it in there.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.880
If you don't know that
information, that's fine.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:51.994
Knowing why you
dropped the team lead--

00:44:51.994 --> 00:44:54.160
you mentioned you dropped
it, but you didn't exactly

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.100
say why again.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:59.030
Really quick, we weren't
getting [? blah ?] out of it,

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.810
or the flexibility
was more, whatever.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.720
And defining your terms.

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.280
You were saying things like
casual versus hardcore.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.950
Give a little bit a definition
of what you mean by that.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:11.820
It means different
things for everybody.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.184
So what is your use of that?

00:45:13.184 --> 00:45:14.600
PROFESSOR: I think
he specifically

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.700
said hardcore and mobile.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.446
But there are hardcore
mobile players out there.

00:45:19.446 --> 00:45:21.070
PROFESSOR: And casual
can be considered

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.180
a version of hardcore,
just in a different way.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.249
So just be a little
more clear, because I

00:45:25.249 --> 00:45:27.290
think you were talking
about the target audience,

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:29.914
and the kind of players, and the
kind of games they might play.

00:45:29.914 --> 00:45:32.800
So just be a little bit
more focused on what exactly

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.152
you mean by that.

00:45:34.152 --> 00:45:36.198
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:45:36.198 --> 00:45:37.466
PROFESSOR: That's it for me.

00:45:37.466 --> 00:45:38.882
PROFESSOR: So we
can start testing

00:45:38.882 --> 00:45:40.590
for observations in
the young man who's

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.518
not relaying [INAUDIBLE]
module frame [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:43.518 --> 00:45:45.958
It's just a system to
generate the project,

00:45:45.958 --> 00:45:48.398
and it posts in the
front [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:48.398 --> 00:45:50.110
So again, just show that.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:50.860
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.930
PROFESSOR: So that's a
terminology issue then.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.166
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:55.540
PROFESSOR: Clearly,
it worked out

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.780
for your team, so we're not
saying, don't mention Yeoman.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.950
It was clearly a good thing.

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:00.770
But just check your
definition of what

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.310
it is, because it'll be more
helpful for other people

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.650
to understand what it is so
that they can think about

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.250
whether the want to
use it in the future.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.850
PROFESSOR: So your demo--
you spent about three minutes

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:12.890
doing it.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.720
We are going to have a
player from [INAUDIBLE] play

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.220
your game live, without
getting a lot of help.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.760
You can talk over it.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.895
You can, after a while,
start helping them.

00:46:23.895 --> 00:46:25.270
We want to see
them at least just

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.810
start playing it on their own.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.710
Decide when you're going
to put that demo in.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.700
You could actually
combine them both together

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.290
if you do it at the
beginning or end.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.720
But if you do that, give the
player a little bit of time

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.370
before you start talking.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.190
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:40.524
Sure.

00:46:40.524 --> 00:46:41.690
PROFESSOR: That's all I got.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:42.440
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:42.960
Thanks.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.300
PROFESSOR: Snap, come on down.

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.670
GUEST SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.840
I'm part of the Snap
team, and this Sabrina,

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.640
who will talk about
the front end aspects.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.925
I'll talk about the
back end aspects.

00:46:59.925 --> 00:47:02.550
So I think we actually wanted to
start with a demo of the game,

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.110
and we'll do a real
demo right now.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.498
So could everybody
go to snapgame.org?

00:47:10.498 --> 00:47:13.956
GUEST SPEAKER: You should
turn on your volume, as well.

00:47:13.956 --> 00:47:15.940
It'll be interesting
to see [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.200
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, nice.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.220
My screen's hidden.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:30.722
And I will also play the game.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.040
Everybody ready
who wants to play?

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.810
So the way this game works
is I'll explain it again,

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.380
in case anybody hasn't
heard this before.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.400
We're going to give you
a topic, and then you're

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.950
going to enter words
related to that topic.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.460
Whenever you enter the same
word that somebody else entered,

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.580
you'll get a point,
which we call a snap.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.590
And the topic is algorithms.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.730
And you can cheat by looking
at my screen, but please don't.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.480
I have no idea how I'm doing.

00:48:47.002 --> 00:48:47.710
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.190
What happened?

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.200
GUEST SPEAKER: What happened?

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:51.883
Oh.

00:48:51.883 --> 00:48:52.383
Oops.

00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:55.840
AUDIENCE: We found a UI bug.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.790
GUEST SPEAKER: I think
it's this resolution.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.194
Probably.

00:49:01.194 --> 00:49:02.190
I did test this.

00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:05.690
I'm sorry.

00:49:14.387 --> 00:49:15.720
I never entered this many words.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.900
I can't scroll.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.441
I think we're going
to stop this one.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:30.353
Wow.

00:49:30.353 --> 00:49:31.186
That was impressive.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:44.350
Justin won, followed
by Rodrigo, and Rachel.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.790
This is what you guys submitted.

00:49:54.269 --> 00:49:56.257
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.525
This is a very MIT heavy.

00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:17.450
Domain.

00:50:21.982 --> 00:50:23.606
GUEST SPEAKER: Someone
put [? socks. ?]

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.936
GUEST SPEAKER: So
that's our game.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.640
So the way we did
this project was we

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.460
split up into back end
and front end teams

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.340
from the very beginning.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:44.480
This was a bit of a
challenge for new features,

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.750
because initially, we both were
really highly interdependent.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:50.200
But eventually, it
became really nice,

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.270
because it was simpler to manage
a front end and a back end team

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.065
individually, and
they generally didn't

00:50:55.065 --> 00:50:57.666
need to talk to each other
once the back end was

00:50:57.666 --> 00:50:58.290
off the ground.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.610
I think that
structuring our team

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:06.240
with more individual
roles, besides just having

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.470
generally back end and front end
people would have been helpful.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.840
UI design was something that
we didn't think about early

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:15.870
on enough, and that's why
the UI is not as polished

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.130
as it could have been.

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:18.880
We could have had
somebody just dedicated

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:21.819
to taking information between
the back end and front end,

00:51:21.819 --> 00:51:24.110
say, documenting the back
end and making sure everybody

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.950
knew how it worked.

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.900
We also definitely had
problems with paperwork,

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.430
which would have been
nice to have somebody

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:32.959
who was really on top of that.

00:51:32.959 --> 00:51:35.000
And then the game design,
as well, was something.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.810
In addition to UI
design, we also

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.000
could have had somebody
just looking at the game

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.139
and thinking about the core game
concepts, things like scoring

00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:44.930
and what we're going
to display to players.

00:51:47.396 --> 00:51:49.020
We did a pretty good
job with planning.

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.870
We used Asana and Asana
worked really well for us.

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.880
It was quite flexible, let
us manage independent task

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.460
lists for front
end and back end,

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:59.060
which we think worked well
all the way from the beginning

00:51:59.060 --> 00:51:59.560
to the end.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.220
So separating out the task
lists we liked, Asana we liked.

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:07.920
Our project had a
lot of dependencies,

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.340
and this was something
that Scrum inherently

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.050
had a problem with, and our
tools also had a problem with.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.530
It was hard to
know, for example,

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:16.834
when a task on the front end
and back end were dependent.

00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:18.750
There wasn't a good way
to encode that and see

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.010
that the back end
needed to get something

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:25.490
done more quickly, because
the front end could use it.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.940
We also had trouble
just creating tasks.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.130
I think that there was a
diffusion of responsibility

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.680
as to who would
be creating tasks

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.582
and who would be assigning them.

00:52:34.582 --> 00:52:36.790
Once the task got assigned,
then it went pretty well.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:41.690
But we had trouble just getting
all our tasks listed out.

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:43.820
I think the core of
all these problems

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.150
was really getting people
invested in the project

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:48.710
and making sure that they
treated it as a priority

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:53.040
and really spent
some effort on it.

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:58.490
Want to talk about this?

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:59.323
GUEST SPEAKER: Sure.

00:52:59.323 --> 00:53:02.660
So we also used Slack for
communicating as a team.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.602
And I think it was
really helpful.

00:53:04.602 --> 00:53:06.810
I liked the fact that we
could have multiple channels

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:09.095
so that people working
mainly on the front end

00:53:09.095 --> 00:53:11.740
didn't have to get all
the communication going on

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.630
with the back end.

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:16.700
And then we also had channels
for our Asana and GitHub

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.100
so we could see what
was going on with that.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.710
Some problems though where
I feel like people weren't

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.359
as active as they
could have been--

00:53:24.359 --> 00:53:26.400
I feel like maybe everyone
should have downloaded

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.125
the mobile app, or at least
signed up for notifications

00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.583
so that everyone's
aware constantly

00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:32.740
of what was going on.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:35.340
And if someone mentioned
them in a post.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:38.780
They were quickly able to
respond and get back to them.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:42.300
And that's the main thing that
I think we could improve upon

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.860
if we use this in the future.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.997
GUEST SPEAKER: So going
a little bit specifically

00:53:49.997 --> 00:53:52.330
into the back end, what went
right for us was definitely

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.660
our technology.

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:56.900
We used node.js as the
server and socket.io

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.150
to do the two way communication
so that you could receive snaps

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:01.430
from other players.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:02.750
And we deployed on heroku.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.500
All those three things
worked really well.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.542
We had no problems with them.

00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:08.750
And the design of the back
end also went pretty well.

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.429
It's a pretty simple
server to implement,

00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:12.970
and we did a good
job of figuring out

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.807
what it needed to support.

00:54:14.807 --> 00:54:16.640
We didn't document as
well as we could have,

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.660
in terms of what
is the published

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:21.290
API that the front
end should be using.

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.710
So in socket.io, you
send all these events,

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:25.580
and the names and the
formats of the events

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:28.897
were not well documented
for a long time.

00:54:28.897 --> 00:54:31.480
There wasn't a lot that I would
change on how the back end was

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.110
structured and how it went.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.160
But I think maybe we had
too many people working

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.734
on it for the small amount
of work that it was,

00:54:37.734 --> 00:54:39.650
and it would have helped
if people more people

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.530
had worked on the front end.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.689
That's also part of
finalizing and freezing.

00:54:44.689 --> 00:54:46.730
If we had just finalized
and frozen the back end,

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.510
then we could've stopped
worrying about it

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:50.890
and just moved on.

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:52.610
Networking was
explicitly forbidden

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.140
in the rules of the
class, which we did break,

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.800
and we intentionally
broke it quite early on.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.010
Networking really didn't
give us very many problems.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.680
We had a couple
heroku issues, where

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.350
we had to quickly do a
deploy, or there was a bug,

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.490
such as the one you just saw.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:09.650
But really, heroku went
really well for us,

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:11.526
and you could easily roll back.

00:55:11.526 --> 00:55:13.150
And heroku gives you
good documentation

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:18.310
on what code exactly
ran every single time.

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:21.150
We actually have been
deploying to the client.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:24.620
The client has been using
this for a while now.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.560
These are some of the
tests they've run.

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:28.870
And you can see
that they're quite

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.110
different, in terms of
how many teams there were,

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:32.440
how long they went.

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.270
I'm not really sure what the
really long games were like.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:38.567
We still need to talk to Pablo
about his feedback for those.

00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:40.400
But indeed, there were
words being submitted

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.606
for those entire three hours.

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.980
And just to give
you a sense, I'd

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.949
actually like to show
one of these word clouds.

00:55:46.949 --> 00:55:48.490
So these are much
more serious topics

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.190
than algorithms, where
actually, looking at the words

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:52.690
will give you a
sense of what people

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.330
are thinking about a
topic that you care about.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.013
So for example,
I think I'll just

00:56:02.013 --> 00:56:03.762
include screenshots
of those, because that

00:56:03.762 --> 00:56:06.850
doesn't work very well.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.770
So here, the topic
of this conference

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.950
is zero poverty, zero
emissions within a generation.

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.740
And you can see,
education seems to be

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.780
a big theme in this conference.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.360
I can tell that just by looking
at the word clouds, of several

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.110
of them, actually.

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:30.350
And a lot of our effort ended up
being focused on the client, as

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:31.210
opposed to the class.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.668
I think that's part of what
made our paperwork fall behind,

00:56:33.668 --> 00:56:37.760
is that I've been working a lot
on supporting these runs that

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:40.700
happened in the
past four days, as

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.470
opposed to the
deliverables of the class,

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:45.586
because I thought that
this was important.

00:56:45.586 --> 00:56:47.190
It's part of why we
have snapgame.org.

00:56:51.735 --> 00:56:53.360
GUEST SPEAKER:
Developing the back end,

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.730
we were really successful.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.750
But I felt when it
came to the front end,

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.110
we struggled a little bit.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.860
I think a main
challenge was the game

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:05.205
is game that was intentionally
made to play person to person,

00:57:05.205 --> 00:57:06.800
and have that communication.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.480
And representing that
in a digital game

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.510
was a big challenge
that we had to do.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.160
So in our first
design, we decided

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.610
we were going to use Phaser, and
it looked something like this.

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:20.100
And obviously, Phaser wasn't
even really being used,

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.900
so what was the point?

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.890
So we dropped
Phaser, and then we

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:28.170
went to just using Bootstrap.

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:32.633
Here, we're just using
Bootstrap in JavaScript

00:57:32.633 --> 00:57:36.740
to handle all the
input from the users.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.250
And then in our final
design with as you saw,

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.850
the dots and the drawing, we're
using a JavaScript library

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:45.350
called 2JS.

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:53.590
So what went right was I think
we had really good people

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:55.400
to do UI design.

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.030
But we didn't really
begin thinking about that

00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.380
until later.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.920
And it took us a
really long time

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.060
to be able to represent
the game in a really

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.930
good way to the user.

00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:10.070
There were a lot of challenges
we faced in doing that.

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:14.040
So I will come back to this.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:16.700
Some of the first
ideas that we had

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.110
for how we're going to represent
the information to the player

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:22.540
was by using a word cloud
that we used on the end,

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.640
but blurring out the words until
they actually submitted a word.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.960
Then we would display it.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.330
But this is actually
really, really challenging,

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:33.630
and so we didn't want to
spend our time doing something

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:34.670
like that.

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.730
Then we considered
having some sort of line

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.760
where you're racing
against the other players

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.380
to get to the top.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.790
But this isn't
entirely interesting,

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.580
so we considered
including both of them.

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:48.440
But then again,
the word cloud, we

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:51.150
ended up deciding that
was too difficult.

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:54.410
So we came up with the
idea of everyone's a dot,

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.240
and your score
would be represented

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.920
by how big your dot is.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:00.030
But if you're playing
with 100 people,

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:02.310
this is just unreasonable.

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.700
And so then we finally came
up with this last idea,

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.970
which is nearly complete,
where the height of your dot

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:14.280
represents where you are in
relation to the max score.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.260
And the lines are
representing snap connections

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.640
that are going along
with the other players.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:28.530
So basically, I think for future
projects for the front end,

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.100
we definitely need to
think about design sooner.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:34.380
This process happened really
slowly and really close

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.340
to the end.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.245
We were very focused
on the functionality

00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:40.090
of our game and the
mechanics, and not

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:43.080
a lot about the player's
interaction with the game.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.000
It would have been awesome if we
did some prototyping early on,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.660
because we had some other ideas.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.710
And we just never put
them into fruition,

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.110
and we never tested them out.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:52.950
So it would have been
interesting to make

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.134
those and see what
users thought of them.

01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:03.230
GUEST SPEAKER: So
I think working

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.430
with a large group was
definitely difficult.

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:07.050
And splitting it
up was a good idea.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.750
But I think that having more
responsibility and roles

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:12.390
within those people would
have been very helpful.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.390
We also should have thought
about design sooner.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:18.460
I think also, from Miriam's
presentation, the idea that we

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.530
should have thought about
the game and making it

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.390
fun was something we
should have focused on,

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.400
as opposed to just thinking
about porting a game

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.700
that we had seen.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.280
We really should have focused
on what makes this a fun game,

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.100
and what could we
do to improve it?

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.151
Because the core
game can be done

01:00:32.151 --> 01:00:34.150
very quickly, and within
the first couple weeks,

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.196
we had the core concept done.

01:00:36.196 --> 01:00:38.320
So I think more quickly,
we could have figured out,

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:41.701
what feedback should
we give to players?

01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:43.200
How can we make it
more competitive,

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.880
which I think it makes it
more interesting as a game,

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.110
as opposed to as a
tool to collect data?

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:51.920
That's all we have.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.006
Are there any questions?

01:00:54.006 --> 01:00:57.338
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.956
PROFESSOR: Anybody
else from the class?

01:01:02.956 --> 01:01:04.835
Any suggestions?

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.080
No?

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:10.991
Well, we've got some.

01:01:10.991 --> 01:01:11.866
You want to go first?

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:20.210
PROFESSOR: So one
thing that I noticed

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:24.750
was there was a screen where
you had the [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.370
didn't future.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:28.080
That made no sense to me at all.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.635
I stared at that
slide for a while.

01:01:29.635 --> 01:01:31.510
And then I heard what
you were talking about,

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:34.140
and then ah--what worked, what
didn't, what are we going to do

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.652
in the future.

01:01:35.652 --> 01:01:37.360
I can see how you
might do it, because it

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:40.580
fits with the snap theme of
having just a single word.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.612
But wow, that was
really confusing.

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.320
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's
why all [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.344
are in small letters.

01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:47.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:48.660
It took me a while to
realize what was going on.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:49.550
I'm guessing that.

01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.530
I don't know for sure.

01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:52.175
PROFESSOR: Is that what
you were going for?

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.165
GUEST SPEAKER: Not really.

01:01:53.165 --> 01:01:54.331
It was just for consistency.

01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.182
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:01:56.182 --> 01:02:00.250
PROFESSOR: Slightly more
clarity would be helpful.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:02.130
You talked about
the task diffusion,

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.710
having a hard time
getting tasks assigned.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.045
But when you talked about
dividing your team into groups,

01:02:09.045 --> 01:02:13.209
you didn't talk about what
the structure was running

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:14.250
those groups or anything.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.537
You didn't have any of
that was what was going on.

01:02:16.537 --> 01:02:18.870
But you might want to be maybe
more explicit about that.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:19.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah, like
how did somebody take

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.704
a task from Asana, by the way.

01:02:21.704 --> 01:02:22.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:23.550
PROFESSOR: Was there
a process for that?

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.966
Did that actually
happen that way?

01:02:24.966 --> 01:02:26.010
Or was it an assignment?

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:26.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.953
Was there one person
generating tasks?

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.333
Or did the groups generate
tasks collectively?

01:02:31.333 --> 01:02:32.722
That sort of thing.

01:02:32.722 --> 01:02:36.850
I think that's most
of what I have.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.995
PROFESSOR: So first of all,
the demo for the game probably

01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:42.370
is what we're going to have
to do on the real day itself,

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.220
because it's such
a large scale game.

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.870
So it's not going to be like
two people playing the game.

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:49.422
So we can probably run
the demo pretty much

01:02:49.422 --> 01:02:50.297
the way that you did.

01:02:50.297 --> 01:02:50.868
GUEST SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] that's

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:51.909
what we were [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:51.909 --> 01:02:55.997
PROFESSOR: Is that the way that
they do it when they run it?

01:02:55.997 --> 01:02:57.080
GUEST SPEAKER: It depends.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.580
So Pablo has been actually
doing a limited number of words.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:06.060
And only at the World Bank
are they doing it like the way

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:08.190
we are doing it, where
everybody's submitting.

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:09.523
And that, they haven't done yet.

01:03:09.523 --> 01:03:11.480
That's actually this afternoon.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.279
PROFESSOR: You might
want to talk a little bit

01:03:14.279 --> 01:03:15.570
about the history of this game.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.210
Everyone in this room right now
has played the original game.

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.126
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:20.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.440
Similar to some of the things.

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.880
I have it-- why are all your
subheadings in small letters?

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.110
Because it really,
really threw me.

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.860
Now, maybe it was
unintended to make it look

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.900
like your game [? snap, ?]
but it actually

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.565
does make it hard to
read, your slides.

01:03:36.565 --> 01:03:41.566
All caps would be even easier
than all small letters.

01:03:41.566 --> 01:03:43.690
There's one slide where
you talk about adding roles

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:46.550
for specific game design,
UI, and everything.

01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:49.780
But the heading
just says, future.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.290
The big takeaway is
more specific roles.

01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.690
You'll see it.

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.412
So that should be on your slide.

01:03:56.412 --> 01:04:01.050
Your slides move
really fast on average.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:03.810
And some of your slides are
more word-heavy than others.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:04.560
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.518
PROFESSOR: So for the
ones that are word heavy,

01:04:06.518 --> 01:04:10.730
them up a little longer,
or make them less wordy.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:11.540
One or the other.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.110
Otherwise, I'm trying
to read everything,

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:14.900
and I can't even listen
to what you're saying

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.149
before the next slide changes.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.000
When you described
the mobile app,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.250
I'm assuming you meant
an Asana mobile app?

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.440
GUEST SPEAKER: The
slack mobile app, yeah.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.300
PROFESSOR: The slack
mobile app, OK.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.770
Just be specific, because
it wasn't entirely clear

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:35.000
what you meant by that.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.517
So yes, put screenshots
into your presentation

01:04:37.517 --> 01:04:38.725
instead of switching windows.

01:04:38.725 --> 01:04:41.710
That will just
make things easier.

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.330
There are maybe
people in the audience

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:47.080
who actually haven't used
Phaser or know what Phaser is.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.810
So when you say, Phaser clearly
isn't doing anything useful,

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:52.440
well, they don't know
what Phaser does.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.430
So just explain.

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.370
Phaser's a sprite-based
game engine.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.611
We have no sprites,
something like that.

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:05.780
Two points about
the game itself.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.255
First of all, how do you
tell which dart is yours?

01:05:09.255 --> 01:05:11.397
GUEST SPEAKER:
It's the green one.

01:05:11.397 --> 01:05:11.980
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.140
I think because of
the peripheral vision,

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.067
I really did not even notice
there was a green dot.

01:05:17.067 --> 01:05:17.900
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.140
PROFESSOR: So maybe it's
just my eyes or something.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:22.030
PROFESSOR: I didn't
see it either.

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:22.613
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:05:22.613 --> 01:05:24.880
How many people actually
noticed a green dot?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:25.990
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
mine was so small.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.198
AUDIENCE: There was a random
green dot in the screen,

01:05:28.198 --> 01:05:32.141
and I couldn't do anything
to it, so I kept [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:32.141 --> 01:05:33.890
PROFESSOR: There is a
green dot on screen,

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:35.940
and it's really hard
to see a green dot.

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.630
There's something
about the way how

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:40.650
the human vision works on that.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:43.070
GUEST SPEAKER: I think it's
also because there are so

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:43.900
many people.

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.876
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:44.876 --> 01:05:46.250
GUEST SPEAKER:
We've never tested

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.165
with more than five
people, and there

01:05:50.165 --> 01:05:52.810
are a lot of dots
on screen when I

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:55.180
don't know how many
people were in that game--

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.804
PROFESSOR: I think
it's cool that there

01:05:56.804 --> 01:05:59.460
is a dot that is yours, and
that it has a meaning to it.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.400
But just being aware
that that dot even

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.720
exists and is
different from the dots

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.760
is more challenging than
you might have realized.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.400
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.664
PROFESSOR: And then finally,
one thing about the networking

01:06:13.664 --> 01:06:15.330
thing. it's actually
really, really neat

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:16.705
that [? Heroku ?]
and [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:18.310
seems to have solved
problems that we

01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.890
traditionally, in
this class, have just

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.330
derailed entire teams.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:26.437
So it's a possibility that
you just have an awesome team.

01:06:26.437 --> 01:06:27.270
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:28.811
I think one thing
I forgot to mention

01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:30.620
is that we have a
lot of experience

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.740
in all of these technologies.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.262
And so that helped.

01:06:34.262 --> 01:06:35.720
PROFESSOR: What
happens if somebody

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.510
who doesn't know anything about
node.js or hiroku decides,

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:40.176
they're going to make
a networking game?

01:06:40.176 --> 01:06:41.670
GUEST SPEAKER: I have no idea.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:43.670
PROFESSOR: So you might
want to talk about that.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:49.870
PROFESSOR: Mine, to reiterate--
client support versus class

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.230
deliverables was a good point.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:55.690
Speak more about the client,
and what you did for them,

01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:58.200
and what their role
was on the team.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:01.347
It sounds like they
had a more active role.

01:07:01.347 --> 01:07:03.930
And dependencies-- when you talk
about dependencies and scrum,

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:06.350
having difficulty with
that, absolutely true.

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.380
What did you do to get past it?

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.090
Explain that.

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:12.280
Or if you didn't do anything
to get past it, say that.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:15.140
But say whatever it is,
rather than-- you do

01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.130
a lot of [INAUDIBLE] does this.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:19.380
But you don't go into the how.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:24.660
So go a little bit into the
how for at least that point.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.420
Thank you.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.504
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:28.504 --> 01:07:29.920
PROFESSOR: Would
you need a break?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.630
Or are we good on time?

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.556
PROFESSOR: No, let's
just hammer through them.

01:07:33.556 --> 01:07:34.710
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:35.580
"Saving Gora Gora?"

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.560
PROFESSOR: "Saving Gora
Gora," come on down.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.410
GUEST SPEAKER: So we're the
"Saving Gora Gora" team, us

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:45.450
plus some devs in the audience.

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:50.240
And I'm Liz, and I'll be
starting you guys off.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.200
So quick overview of our game's
goals coming into the project.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.270
We wanted to inform
players about a cholera,

01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:01.990
and specifically, the
causes, and the systems,

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.260
and the prevention
of the disease.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.140
And our audience, we wanted to
narrow that down really early.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.060
Specifically, we were more
interested in targeting

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:16.250
the younger age
range of 8 to 13.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.830
And we had specific
issues of that, which

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:20.930
we'll talk about later on.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:24.930
And mainly, we wanted to have
all these education goals

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:30.830
and audience goals; be
a part of a fun game,

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.769
basically, like we wanted
our game to be fun,

01:08:32.769 --> 01:08:34.810
and not one of those
educational games they play,

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.706
and then you fall asleep,
and it's basically a poster.

01:08:38.706 --> 01:08:43.920
A quick overview of what the
game ended up looking like.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.530
This is "Saving Gora Gora."

01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:49.210
It's a children's
game, and you are

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:53.550
visiting a village of
animals which is falling ill.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:56.750
And as a player, your
goal is to help figure

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.529
out what is causing
the illness and trying

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:03.800
to defend the character
in the game, which

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.186
we'll talk about now.

01:09:05.186 --> 01:09:08.149
A big part of our
game is narrative,

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:10.609
which is why we're going
to do the demo later,

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:12.609
because we wanted to ease
you into the narrative

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:14.990
without having you
read all the text.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.370
Everyone in Gora Gora is sick.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.315
We have this monster that
is being blamed for it.

01:09:19.315 --> 01:09:21.950
He is totally a cool
guy though, and he

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.790
wants you to help you
prove his innocence.

01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:25.300
You're Kojo.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.029
You're a little
bunny kid, and you

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:34.250
need to work with the
town to prove to the town

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:37.319
that it's not Sal that's
making everybody sick.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.414
It's actually cholera.

01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:45.020
Basic gameplay is you're
the main character.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.500
This is Kojo.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.754
And you'll unlock minigames
by exploring the map.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.170
Each minigame will
give you a clue

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:56.700
to prove that Sal is innocent,
and your ultimate goal

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.860
is to convince the mayor
that Sal is a cool guy,

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.247
and he shouldn't be in that cage
that you see in the background.

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.780
GUEST SPEAKER: So
our first minigame

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:10.160
was about water filtration.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.650
And the basis of the minigame
is that friends and neighbors

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:15.794
in the village are bringing
water to Kojo's mom,

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.210
because they don't know whether
it's safe to drink or not.

01:10:18.210 --> 01:10:20.880
So the goal of the
game is to have

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.500
the player decide
whether each water

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.010
source is safe to drink from.

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:27.605
And along the
process of developing

01:10:27.605 --> 01:10:30.270
that minigame, we had
to actually iterate over

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:33.690
the physical design of
the minigame quite a bit,

01:10:33.690 --> 01:10:37.380
because our first idea was
since it's water filtration,

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.180
we wanted to make it
perhaps a facility.

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.230
But we realized that
wasn't relatable.

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.070
It wasn't culturally
relevant to all the kids

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:48.889
who would be playing this
game, so then our final design

01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:50.430
ended up being
outside a home, as you

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:53.575
can see in the background.

01:10:53.575 --> 01:10:55.620
So a couple other
challenges we had.

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.980
First, we had it working
in real time, where

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.900
the player had to rush to get
things done in the minigame.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:04.570
But we thought
that that took away

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.070
from the overall purpose
of teaching the kids,

01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:09.310
so we made it a
lot more relaxed,

01:11:09.310 --> 01:11:12.093
a lot less time constrained,
and allowed player

01:11:12.093 --> 01:11:14.020
to play at their own pace.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.590
And lastly, we wanted to make
sure that the game was clear.

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:18.620
The game plan was clear.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.220
But we didn't want to
make it too text heavy.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.020
And we considered
making a tutorial,

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.450
but we didn't have enough time
to actually implement that,

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:30.320
so we added some instruction
text boxes on an overlay

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.106
to just try to get the
player a brief overview.

01:11:33.106 --> 01:11:34.480
And then during
the game, they're

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.690
also able to go back
into these instructions

01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:41.262
and reread it so it
becomes more clear.

01:11:41.262 --> 01:11:42.720
GUEST SPEAKER: So
the next minigame

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.390
is a water collection game,
where Kojo, the main player,

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.480
needs to help his friend
find a safe water source,

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.310
since you have to
go look for water

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:54.660
and figure out where to
drink, or where to get it.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.560
He basically helps
his friend choose

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.800
where to get the water from.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.860
So they basically show
you a village map,

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.020
and you would choose which
places on the village

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.340
map you would want to
get the water from.

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.900
In terms of challenges and how
I started developing the game,

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.030
we wanted to make sure
it was "fail-safe"

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.550
so that even if the player
chose the wrong choice,

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.590
then they would get feedback.

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:19.326
They would learn why that
wasn't the right choice,

01:12:19.326 --> 01:12:21.200
and then be able to
continue playing the game

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.650
until they made
the right choice.

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:26.206
Originally, we did
have an excreter.

01:12:26.206 --> 01:12:29.680
You had to find where
you would also excrete.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.709
But we cut that feature
pretty early on,

01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:33.250
since we thought it
was less crucial,

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:36.150
and we wanted to focus on water.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.730
And then other challenges
were, as Kevin said,

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:42.470
we had some cultural
issues, in terms of design,

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:44.906
so we revamped our images.

01:12:44.906 --> 01:12:47.322
And also, we wanted to provide
more feedback to the player

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:48.310
as they were playing.

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:51.730
So throughout our
development process,

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:55.110
we added things like helper
texts and more explanations

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:57.640
about why you did or
didn't do things correctly.

01:13:00.815 --> 01:13:02.190
GUEST SPEAKER:
Our third minigame

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.320
is focused around understanding
the symptoms of cholera

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:07.100
and understanding
how important it is

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.770
to act early on these symptoms.

01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:13.100
So in the game, the doctor
of the village, Dr. Quasi,

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.026
is very busy, and he can't
go out into the village

01:13:16.026 --> 01:13:18.275
to help patients, because
he has so many patients that

01:13:18.275 --> 01:13:19.590
are coming to him already.

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:22.434
So he asks Kojo to go help him
find sick patients to go talk

01:13:22.434 --> 01:13:24.850
to his friends and see if they
have any of these symptoms,

01:13:24.850 --> 01:13:29.270
tell them to come to the clinic
so that they can get treated.

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:30.840
During the development
of this game,

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.423
we initially started
off with the idea

01:13:32.423 --> 01:13:34.690
that you'd be helping the
doctor diagnose patients

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:35.600
at the hospital.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.640
But then we realized that this
would quickly turn into a quiz

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.600
and wouldn't be as
engaging or as fun.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.100
And it would
essentially be the same

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.620
as reading off of a pamphlet.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:45.390
So we wanted to add
more of a game aspect

01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:47.510
to it, so we decided
to make it such

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:49.560
that you are going out
and trying to find people,

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.090
and suggesting to them that
they go to the doctor's office.

01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.689
And then another one
of the cultural things

01:13:56.689 --> 01:13:58.980
that we ran into is initially,
you're playing as a kid.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:00.742
But we initially had
it such that you're

01:14:00.742 --> 01:14:02.700
going around and talking
to some of the adults.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.800
And as Pablo pointed
out to us, there's

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.020
a much stricter social
hierarchy in Ghana,

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.650
and it might seem appropriate
that we are suggesting to kids

01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:14.230
that they demand that their
parents go to the doctor's

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.730
office, because
that's not something

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:18.730
that would necessarily happen
in the Ghana social structure.

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:21.450
So we decided to change
that around to you're

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:23.970
talking to your friends,
who are the same age as you.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:25.940
And you're talking
to your friends,

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:28.522
and you're having them go
to the doctor's office.

01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:29.980
Some of the challenges
we ran into,

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:34.060
since this is a very
conversation based game,

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.312
making sure that the dialogue
UI was understandable,

01:14:36.312 --> 01:14:39.199
and that you knew when you
had choices available to you,

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:40.740
to choose, and when
you were talking,

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.690
versus the other
person was talking.

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:43.980
This was something that
we had to integrate

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:44.860
over multiple times.

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.400
And finally, making sure
that the dialogue was

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.140
age appropriate.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.902
Since these kids
don't speak English

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.860
as their primary language
and they're children,

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:54.030
we wanted to make sure that
the dialogue was simple enough

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.177
for the children to
understand-- but also, still

01:14:56.177 --> 01:14:57.760
had the meaning
behind it so that they

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:03.120
realized what actions they were
taking through their dialogue.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.176
And now, we're going to
start our demonstration.

01:15:08.050 --> 01:15:10.980
GUEST SPEAKER: So it starts
out with the monster hiding.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:15.480
And the monster is
hiding from Kojo.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.980
And Kojo's like,
why are you hiding?

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:20.070
And so you see,
people are blaming him

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.610
for everyone's sickness.

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:26.802
And so you say you'll help
and you know who to talk to.

01:15:26.802 --> 01:15:28.510
But then when you
bring him to the mayor,

01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:30.600
he's locked up by the mayor.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.740
And you're trying to convince
the mayor that he's not

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:36.060
the actual monster.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:39.990
So you can see the beginning
dialogue really sets up

01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:42.510
the scene for the story.

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.483
And now, as Kojo, I'll
say, I don't know,

01:15:44.483 --> 01:15:45.760
but I'll figure it out.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.980
And so now that you're in the
town, you can explore the town.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.120
And you might be able to
talk to some of the people.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.430
And so the people around
town will give you

01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:58.990
things that will help you.

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:03.070
So this dog is
giving you matches.

01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:05.780
And you might figure
out later, oh.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.990
And now, you see of
matches in your inventory,

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.360
and you might be able
to use that later.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.760
So for example,
we can also click

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.740
on the different buildings.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.780
And now, we realize that your
friend is missing a bucket.

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.310
So you tell them
you'll go look for it.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:22.754
And we see that oh, the
monkey has a bucket.

01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:32.550
So then you can get the
bucket from the monkey.

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:36.690
And then now, you can go back
and tell your friend, oh.

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:37.677
You found the bucket.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:48.220
And so this brings you
to one of the minigames,

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.190
the collection minigame.

01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.930
And you can see, you
can drag the bowl

01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.280
to different locations.

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.795
And you can also click on the
locations to see what they are.

01:16:58.795 --> 01:17:00.940
And you might say, I'm done.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.900
But it looks like this
water spot is rusty.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.900
So that's where the
fail safe part comes in.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.310
And if you eventually drag
it to a good source of water,

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.640
it'll say, thanks.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.660
And you've acquired a clue.

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:19.190
So then the next minigame,
as Kevin was talking about,

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.990
is you have to purify water.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:30.980
And so as you see, there's
a lot of help or text

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.840
to help you get started.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.350
And you can just drag the water.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:37.450
It says it's discolored, so I
think we'll have to boil it.

01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:39.990
And eventually,
the game, you have

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:43.820
to figure out what to
do with all the water

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.802
and collect enough water.

01:17:46.802 --> 01:17:48.510
And so I think we'll
just cut that short,

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:51.300
since we're a little
short on time,

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.900
and then we'll show
the rest of the game

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.196
for the final presentation.

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:09.270
GUEST SPEAKER: So in terms of
like too technical challenges

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:13.280
we ran into first is like
the states and stays there,

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.940
obviously, there
are six of these are

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.940
and we have to find
a way to work around

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:20.650
keeping a lot of paired
data, in terms of clues

01:18:20.650 --> 01:18:23.740
and which games
you had completed,

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.720
what dialogues you were on,
which dialogue should show up.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.260
So that was something-- that
was a little bit of a challenge

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.090
that we figured out.

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.820
And then additionally, balancing
difficulty with accessibility.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:37.690
So we mitigated that by using
things like helper texts,

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:40.060
and using a hand
cursor when you're

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.510
allowed to click on
things-- stuff like that.

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:46.270
GUEST SPEAKER: So
one of the other

01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.234
biggest problems that
we had, or I would say,

01:18:48.234 --> 01:18:52.162
the biggest problem we had
is that our target audience

01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:55.600
and [INAUDIBLE] are completely
two separate groups.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.426
We're targetting 8 to
13-year-olds in Ghana.

01:18:58.426 --> 01:19:00.322
We're college students
in the United States.

01:19:00.322 --> 01:19:02.218
There's this complete
different culture.

01:19:02.218 --> 01:19:04.566
And so we had to do
a lot of research

01:19:04.566 --> 01:19:08.220
to make sure that our game was
connecting to this audience.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:10.605
I think we did a good job.

01:19:10.605 --> 01:19:11.980
I think we could
do a better job.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.480
We don't know.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.700
We didn't get to play-test
with our target audience.

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.493
So unfortunately,
we aren't 100% sure

01:19:19.493 --> 01:19:22.210
that this game's going to
connect to these people.

01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:25.615
And another challenge is
playing meaningful-- again,

01:19:25.615 --> 01:19:26.656
just because [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:30.114 --> 01:19:33.510
So things that went wrong.

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.196
Our communication
was really good,

01:19:35.196 --> 01:19:39.322
but we never talked about
deadlines for things.

01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:40.780
We would say, oh,
we will have this

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.330
done by the end of the week.

01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:44.330
But then somebody would
need [INAUDIBLE] assets,

01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:45.380
and it wouldn't be done.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.560
Sorry.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:51.190
Or we would want to play test
the game at a certain date,

01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:53.930
and there wasn't a
running game at the time.

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:57.260
So I think one of the things
that we had a problem with,

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.850
just making deadlines, making
sure people were doing things

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:01.910
on a timely manner.

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:04.893
And then we were having
good communication, just not

01:20:04.893 --> 01:20:05.851
constant communication.

01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:10.125
We were using several
tools, but unfortunately, I

01:20:10.125 --> 01:20:12.175
think that's the next slide.

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:15.836
We were using Trello,
meeting weekly.

01:20:15.836 --> 01:20:17.084
We did use Slack.

01:20:17.084 --> 01:20:18.792
Unfortunately, not
everyone was on Slack.

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:21.588
Not everyone was
using Trello, and not

01:20:21.588 --> 01:20:23.470
everyone was able to
go to the meetings,

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:25.560
and so sometimes,
we would communicate

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.869
with three fourths of
the team, but there

01:20:27.869 --> 01:20:32.310
would be people that were
completely out of the loop.

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:33.850
So things that went right.

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:36.920
We did separate our
team into basically two

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.260
different sub-teams.

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.590
There were four people
coding, and then me and Liz

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:43.680
were doing the art.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.592
She was doing character art.

01:20:45.592 --> 01:20:48.460
I was doing background art
and all of the other assets.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.820
Then we'd have someone
doing the [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:53.400
And so just by
separating the team,

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.799
it made things a little easier.

01:20:55.799 --> 01:20:58.090
You didn't have eight people
touching code and breaking

01:20:58.090 --> 01:21:01.860
things or five different people
making the art for something

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.740
and having completely
different styles.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.030
We had a meeting every
week, pretty much.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.580
Not everyone was
always there, but it

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:13.300
was very useful to
just get up to date

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.160
on what everyone was doing.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.950
And then something that
we did early was just

01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:19.240
cut a few features.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.460
We cut a fourth mini game that
was picture matchmaking, which

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:27.180
didn't really make sense, so
we just completely cut it.

01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:31.340
Just cutting things
like choosing

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:35.853
where to dispose of your waste,
something that we did early

01:21:35.853 --> 01:21:36.890
on that helped us.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.210
So then moving forward, things
that we would want to do

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:47.620
is just test the game more.

01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:49.392
We would have loved
to find someone

01:21:49.392 --> 01:21:51.200
familiar with our
target audience

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.380
or to play test with
our target audience

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.790
just to make the game better.

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:58.330
Then changing things like
difficulty and making sure

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.578
the game is culturally relevant.

01:22:01.578 --> 01:22:05.010
I know I would want to play
test more and then change

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:06.860
some of the elements
that I don't

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.840
think are too great right now.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:12.610
And then even going further,
just expanding the game

01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:14.895
and making it more interesting,
having more mini games

01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:19.072
and having more, an
interesting mystery, rather

01:22:19.072 --> 01:22:20.805
than little paragraphs.

01:22:20.805 --> 01:22:24.270
That's all.

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:28.725
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:28.725 --> 01:22:30.730
RICK EBERHARDT: Thanks.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:32.588
Any questions?

01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:33.496
Comments?

01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:34.691
I didn't think so.

01:22:34.691 --> 01:22:35.190
OK.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.900
The demo that you
did mid-presentation,

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.100
you might want to
rethink how you do that.

01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:45.110
Again, you're going
to have somebody

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:46.110
playing the game anyway.

01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:49.380
Maybe you could put
some of that description

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.970
while they're playing the game.

01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:55.512
Maybe you just demonstrate
the map and say,

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:56.970
here's a mini game,
and then you'll

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:59.370
see these mini games in play.

01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:00.800
Or if what you're
trying to do is

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.510
help us understand
what the games are,

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:03.720
just give us a screenshot.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.860
That's probably enough.

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.530
I don't think we
needed it when we

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:10.464
were watching the
presentation to understand

01:23:10.464 --> 01:23:11.630
what you were talking about.

01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:13.338
I think you did a
pretty good job of that

01:23:13.338 --> 01:23:17.180
when you were talking
about individual things.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.910
And then my big question,
what I'd like to know more,

01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:23.710
is you mentioned the big
thing as being the research

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:27.630
you did for cultural
appropriateness, what was it?

01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:29.445
Tell us what you did
in the presentation.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.201
Maybe even give
it its own slide.

01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:35.450
I think it's pretty important.

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:37.250
ANDREW GRANT: The
social hierarchy example

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.680
was a very good,
specific example.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.730
We need more of those.

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.050
So what changes you actually
had to make once you

01:23:44.050 --> 01:23:46.360
realized that was a problem.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:49.530
You've got it in this umbrella
category of cultural issues,

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:54.380
but the specific
stuff is really cool.

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.919
RICK EBERHARDT:
That's it for me.

01:23:55.919 --> 01:23:56.710
ANDREW GRANT: Sara?

01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:57.460
SARA VERNILLI: No.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.464
I think Rick actually
got most of what I was--

01:23:59.464 --> 01:24:01.380
ANDREW GRANT: You might
want to move the Tools

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:04.510
slide before What Went Wrong
because all the way things

01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:06.950
worked out, you just
covered that first.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.670
The water filtration
picture, where

01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:16.640
you say you can see it
in the background, no.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.931
We can't see it the background.

01:24:17.931 --> 01:24:20.340
The background for
that particular slide

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.790
was totally invisible
on this projector,

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.970
so increase the
contrast on that image

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:28.920
or actually put
it in as an inset.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.940
You two need to warm
up before you present.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.960
Your voices get
louder as you speak,

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.230
so practice outside
of something.

01:24:38.230 --> 01:24:40.260
Warm it up and
you're more audible.

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.760
This is more of a
game design thing.

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.300
There is a bucket
right next to the well

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.270
while you are trying
to find a bucket,

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:53.307
and every player is going to
say, why isn't that bucket

01:24:53.307 --> 01:24:54.015
just good enough?

01:24:56.850 --> 01:25:00.810
Stick a hole in the bucket
or something, whatever

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.200
is the easiest way to
solve that problem.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.735
That's pretty much all I had.

01:25:07.659 --> 01:25:08.450
RICK EBERHARDT: OK.

01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:09.416
Thank you.

01:25:09.416 --> 01:25:11.360
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.332
All right.

01:25:12.332 --> 01:25:13.999
Last up, Cholera Control.

01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:15.040
STUDENT 2: Hi, everybody.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:17.860
We're Cholera Control.

01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.650
We're going to make
this really simple.

01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:23.980
Our game was about cholera
and it is a strategy game.

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.330
You have to sort of
manage many villages

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.550
and try to tell them what
they should implement in order

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:32.650
to help prevent cholera
within their village.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:35.420
And so we're going to
just go through what

01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:37.790
went right, what went
wrong, what we learned,

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:40.360
and any future
changes we would make.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.680
So firstly, what went right.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:48.002
What happened over the
course of the class

01:25:48.002 --> 01:25:49.460
is we simplified
the game, and that

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:52.076
was one of the best
decisions we made

01:25:52.076 --> 01:25:53.200
that was really hard to do.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.326
Adjusting scope is
really challenging

01:25:55.326 --> 01:25:56.700
because there are
a lot of things

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.710
you want to have in your
game, you want to happen,

01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:01.512
but when you realize
you just can't do it,

01:26:01.512 --> 01:26:02.970
it's like a load
off your shoulders

01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:05.996
and you can really focus on
the things that are important.

01:26:05.996 --> 01:26:07.370
One of the things
we did simplify

01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:09.226
is what the player can do.

01:26:09.226 --> 01:26:10.600
They have less
actions, and we'll

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.610
show that when we
have some screenshots,

01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:17.655
but they're more meaningful.

01:26:17.655 --> 01:26:20.030
What the player is doing has
a bigger effect on the game,

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.446
and so they don't feel like
they're just clicking buttons.

01:26:22.446 --> 01:26:23.650
They're actually thinking.

01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:25.670
They're strategizing
rather than just,

01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.060
oh, I need to click
these as fast as I can.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.730
And it's also more
fun for the player.

01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:31.700
There's not too many.

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.780
There's just enough.

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:37.572
The iteration was really
one of the other things

01:26:37.572 --> 01:26:38.530
that went really right.

01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:40.920
It was the best
experience in the class

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:45.120
as a whole for changing the game
is when you do that iteration,

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.330
it feels really good
when you look back

01:26:48.330 --> 01:26:51.200
and you see, wow, look
how far our game has come.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.990
Look at the changes we've made.

01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:58.850
And comparing those really helps
you realize the choices we made

01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:59.610
are good.

01:26:59.610 --> 01:27:01.750
Some of them are bad, but
most of them are good.

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:05.482
And we also had design
meetings that were occasionally

01:27:05.482 --> 01:27:07.690
a struggle for everyone to
attend, but when they did,

01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:11.400
they were really productive
and really helped the group

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.090
know what was going on,
know what had to be done.

01:27:15.090 --> 01:27:17.940
And lastly, the
huge design change

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:22.724
we did halfway through
the eight weeks,

01:27:22.724 --> 01:27:24.640
this is what it originally
looked like when we

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:27.990
had a full digital prototype.

01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:30.070
It was really confusing.

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.510
There are four villages.

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:32.822
They had little bars over them.

01:27:32.822 --> 01:27:34.280
People didn't know
what that meant.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.702
There's text in the top
corner of the screen

01:27:36.702 --> 01:27:38.410
that you can't read
and you couldn't even

01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:40.480
read when it was
screen that told

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.900
you your money and the
population of each village,

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:46.090
and then those two buttons
that people weren't really sure

01:27:46.090 --> 01:27:51.140
were buttons, so that
was really difficult.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:52.750
This is what it looks like now.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:53.830
It's much clearer.

01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:55.650
There's a nice bar at
the top telling you

01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:59.030
your money, how many days,
and a nice little pause menu,

01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:00.730
and then there are
only four villages.

01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:01.980
They take up the whole screen.

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:04.370
It's very obvious that
you want to click those.

01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:06.670
And also, there's a lot
of indicators as to what's

01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:08.240
going on in each one.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.940
Before, you had to click
on each village and then

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.480
up in the corner,
that text would

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.730
change to tell you what's
going on in that village,

01:28:15.730 --> 01:28:17.620
and now, you can see it.

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.010
It was a quick overview
when you're watching.

01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:22.660
And so you have the
population that's sick

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:26.990
and that's not sick, and the
green bar is healthy and red

01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:30.145
is infected, and then
an arrow telling you

01:28:30.145 --> 01:28:32.270
the direction in which the
infection rate is going,

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.250
whether it's going towards
more people getting

01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:37.200
healthy or more
people getting sick.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.340
And then you also have
those little circles

01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.400
beneath each locality.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.530
We call them localities.

01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:44.500
It's a better term
than "village."

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.790
We wanted it to be very
neutral, and that's

01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.950
what our clients told
us we should use.

01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:52.290
And so below each locality
are those four little bubbles

01:28:52.290 --> 01:28:55.810
that show what you've
implemented there,

01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:56.787
and they count down.

01:28:56.787 --> 01:28:58.120
You might not be able to see it.

01:28:58.120 --> 01:28:59.578
It's a little small
on this screen,

01:28:59.578 --> 01:29:03.040
but they count down and
become less colored in

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.800
or a little bit darker so you
know how much longer it'll

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.900
last.

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.590
And then for the menu of when
you clicked a village, that's

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:10.881
what it originally looked like.

01:29:10.881 --> 01:29:12.120
It was really hard to read.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:15.250
There were a lot of
choices that you could do.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:18.582
We had eight, I think, is
there, which at first, we

01:29:18.582 --> 01:29:20.290
were like, yeah, this
is a strategy game.

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:21.180
It's going to be really hard.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.388
There's going to be a lot
of choices, a lot of things

01:29:23.388 --> 01:29:26.580
you can do, and this ended
up being a very poor choice.

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.640
And so this is what it
looks like now, where

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.890
it's much clearer, first
of all, how to close it,

01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:34.450
how to get back to the main
screen, also what you can do.

01:29:34.450 --> 01:29:37.340
When you hover over something,
in the Description box,

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:40.952
its description pops up.

01:29:40.952 --> 01:29:42.660
If something's
implemented, which nothing

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.960
is in this locality, but if
something was implemented,

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.820
that circle would also be
colored in and counting down

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:53.500
to how long until you
can implement it again.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:55.720
So then what went wrong.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.960
First thing was coding.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.770
Working together is really hard.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:02.420
We learned this
over the project.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.450
So we thought, OK, we'll
divide everything up.

01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:07.290
We'll make it so everyone can
work independently and make

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:09.150
sure there aren't any
real dependencies that

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:10.360
are going to be roadblocks.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.480
But even doing that,
it's still hard

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.540
when you have to bring
everything back together

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.980
and there were just
inconsistencies.

01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:19.440
People had different coding
styles and merging just

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.080
took a lot longer than
it should have taken.

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:25.970
Motivation was also
a really big problem.

01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:27.840
At the beginning
of this project,

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:31.510
people weren't really passionate
about cholera or making

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:34.300
a game about cholera,
and even as we came up

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.730
with designs and interesting
choice and things

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:39.919
we thought would be fun, that
passion just didn't grow.

01:30:39.919 --> 01:30:41.460
It was always just
like, I don't want

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:43.720
to do this, which
is really hard.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.390
I don't know how we
could change that.

01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:49.770
Also, the topic was
really restrictive.

01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:52.732
It's something that
probably that I'm guessing

01:30:52.732 --> 01:30:54.190
must happen a lot
in the real world

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:56.398
that sometimes you work on
things that you don't want

01:30:56.398 --> 01:31:00.660
to work on, but you have to find
a way to struggle through that.

01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.170
We also had crunch problems.

01:31:03.170 --> 01:31:05.750
Our team was just
a lot of crunches.

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:06.914
There wasn't constant work.

01:31:06.914 --> 01:31:08.080
There was a lot of crunches.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.890
And so we had a lot
of crunching right

01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:11.790
before a play testing class.

01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:16.210
We had a lot of crunching
after Thanksgiving before now,

01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:18.780
and the work on the game
was really low priority

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.720
because everyone has
other classes that they

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.740
need to do things for.

01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:25.290
And so it is hard to
tell people, no, you

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:28.050
need to do this
because they're like,

01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:29.750
I have a thesis project due.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:33.640
That's way more important
than a project for this class.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.850
And another thing that
happened over time

01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:39.150
is that people weren't adhering
to the communication we

01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:39.680
agreed on.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.720
We said, OK, we'll
do emails and we'll

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:45.030
use Gitter, which is sort
of tied in with GitHub,

01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:47.860
and then people
weren't on Gitter

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:49.326
or they didn't reply to emails.

01:31:49.326 --> 01:31:50.950
And so whenever you
sent out a message,

01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:52.699
it was like throwing
it out into the ether

01:31:52.699 --> 01:31:54.370
and then hoping
people would respond,

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:56.350
which is really challenging.

01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:58.645
Sometimes you forget
to log onto Gitter

01:31:58.645 --> 01:32:00.200
or you forget to
look at an email

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.550
until later, so it's difficult.
It's something that happens,

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:06.590
but it's a hard
thing to deal with.

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:08.270
So then what we learned.

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:10.020
Within game design,
there's actually a lot

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.910
we learned from this project.

01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:14.800
The biggest thing is that more
complicated and more choices

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.450
does not equal more fun.

01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:19.420
It can, and if you're
making a really big strategy

01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:22.250
game like Civilization,
I could see

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:24.920
where you'd want to have the
ability to do a lot of things,

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.600
but in something
simpler, you don't

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.170
need to be able to
do as many things.

01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:31.960
But if those things have
meaning, which our choices now

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.820
do, it's a lot more fun.

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.570
Play testing revealed
that a lot of people

01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:37.060
didn't like having
so many choices.

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:39.160
They didn't know what to do.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.410
It was real time,
so people were dying

01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:44.590
and they were like, I lost
the game before I even

01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:47.010
felt like I started.

01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:48.910
Design is very restrictive.

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:51.265
You need to pay
attention not only

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.290
to what the client
wants, but also

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.700
who you're making this for.

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:57.030
How accessible
does it need to be?

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:58.850
Who's the target audience?

01:32:58.850 --> 01:33:01.620
And also, it's really
hard as a designer

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:04.260
to realize you need to put both
the player and the client's

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.620
needs before your own.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.830
You as a designer know,
I have this grand vision

01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:12.380
of what our game should be,
but then play testers say,

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.820
we don't like your vision.

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:14.810
You need to change it.

01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:15.840
It needs to do this.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.500
And your clients say, we
don't like your vision either.

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:19.327
It needs to change.

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:20.160
You need to do this.

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:23.270
And so doing that is
very hard as a designer,

01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:25.740
but we learned to
do it and the game

01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:28.930
was better as a result of it.

01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:30.917
Some other things is
none of us knew anything

01:33:30.917 --> 01:33:33.000
about cholera when we
started, so we learned a lot

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:34.120
about cholera.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:39.020
And it's surprising how easy it
is if you just wash your hands.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:40.060
That's it.

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:43.030
So if you're in Ghana,
just wash your hands, guys.

01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:45.270
And probably don't drink
infected water sources,

01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:47.010
but the big one is
wash your hands.

01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:50.310
And that also applies to
a lot of other things.

01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:51.950
Pablo actually asked
us to emphasize

01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:54.430
the washing your hands
because Ebola also,

01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.620
it benefits if people
wash your hands.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.970
It helps you so you don't
catch other diseases.

01:33:58.970 --> 01:34:01.400
And then about
coding is tweening

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.730
and other animation APIs make
a game look more polished

01:34:04.730 --> 01:34:07.524
for little effort, which is
something we didn't really

01:34:07.524 --> 01:34:09.440
implement until the end,
and then when we did,

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.150
we were like, wow, that
looks a lot better.

01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:14.740
And then future changes.

01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.640
So for just within the
game, things that we never

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.010
got to implement but
we really would like to

01:34:20.010 --> 01:34:22.750
are subtle effects
that would force people

01:34:22.750 --> 01:34:25.130
to change their strategy
because sometimes it

01:34:25.130 --> 01:34:27.840
can get really easy, and
so we'd want to make it

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.520
so people who quickly
figured out a strategy

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:34.430
and then think,
oh, we can win is

01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:36.850
we wanted to make some things
that their strategy doesn't

01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:37.550
work anymore.

01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:40.910
So we originally we had the
idea of a change in season,

01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:44.460
which is something we would like
to do, but time constraints,

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:49.640
or random events where there's
maybe not a change in season,

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.280
but there happened to
be really heavy rain

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.020
one day so everything flooded,
so now all the water sources

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:58.020
are more infected.

01:34:58.020 --> 01:35:00.120
Also, multiple
levels of difficulty.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.120
We did like simplifying
it, but there are still

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:04.740
some things we'd like to
add, at least one more action

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.260
and maybe a few more villages.

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:09.110
So that's something
that we would like

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:11.000
to add if we had more time.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.600
And also, more advanced
infection models.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.729
You can talk about the
infection models if you want.

01:35:17.729 --> 01:35:19.020
STUDENT 3: I'll chime in there.

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:21.430
It turns out to be
really, really hard

01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:24.740
to balance the spread of
infection of a disease.

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.237
It's almost impossible to
make the game relatively

01:35:28.237 --> 01:35:30.820
simple at the beginning but then
the right level of difficulty

01:35:30.820 --> 01:35:32.985
at the end because the
nature of infection

01:35:32.985 --> 01:35:35.080
is that it's exponential.

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.485
You change a
parameter by nothing

01:35:36.485 --> 01:35:38.820
and it just swings
the whole thing over

01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.050
and makes the game go from very
easy to completely impossible.

01:35:43.050 --> 01:35:46.150
So that made it really,
really hard to balance.

01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:48.920
If I had more time, if I had a
few more weeks to work on it,

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.590
probably the things
I'd want to work on

01:35:50.590 --> 01:35:52.790
would be work on
something more advanced,

01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:56.060
like some more advanced
mathematical models, as opposed

01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:59.190
to just a simple exponential
model that we currently have,

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:01.420
because that could make
game balancing much easier.

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.924
I had a really hard time
balancing infection.

01:36:04.924 --> 01:36:06.340
STUDENT 2: And
lastly, some things

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:10.680
we'd change for the
class is we wished

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.250
that we had something that
enforced the sprint tasklist.

01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:16.470
We submitted it every
week but we were never

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:20.200
held to actually doing what
we said we were going to do.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:26.320
So it felt just like, oh,
it's something we have to do.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.450
We have to say we'll do
things this week in order

01:36:28.450 --> 01:36:29.650
to be working on the game.

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:32.900
So we wish there was something
like the instructors asking,

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.280
OK, can we see your
completed sprint tasklist?

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.080
The restriction to
the Red Cross topics

01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.510
was a huge constraint
for the creative freedom,

01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:42.450
especially for the last project.

01:36:42.450 --> 01:36:44.980
So because all of
us didn't really

01:36:44.980 --> 01:36:48.430
like the topic to begin with, it
was a really long eight weeks.

01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:51.100
So we wish that we
didn't have to do that,

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:54.860
but I understand for this
semester of this class, that

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.980
was what happened.

01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:58.170
And then another thing
is that we wouldn't

01:36:58.170 --> 01:36:59.865
work on an educational
game regarding

01:36:59.865 --> 01:37:01.770
an unknown culture
for the final project

01:37:01.770 --> 01:37:04.790
because it was just really
hard to understand, OK, what

01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:07.980
do people in Ghana find normal?

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.720
What would they want in a game?

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:11.630
Do they understand
how this works?

01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.170
It's something that's
even hard because there

01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:15.995
are a lot of
assumptions people who

01:37:15.995 --> 01:37:18.450
have played games
make about games

01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:20.220
that's really hard to get over.

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:23.110
And so doing that for
the final project that

01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:25.970
also has to be an educational
game that also has

01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:27.835
to be about cholera,
it's just like there's

01:37:27.835 --> 01:37:32.020
a lot of things piling up that
made it really hard to do.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.700
So any questions?

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.420
And we'll also show
a demo of the game,

01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.910
but if you guys want to
ask any questions first.

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:40.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:44.166 --> 01:37:45.957
Should we do demo first
and then questions?

01:37:45.957 --> 01:37:47.623
RICK EBERHARDT: Yeah,
go ahead and demo.

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:53.740
ANDREW GRANT: Both
on this screen

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.640
and with some of
the earlier teams,

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:03.350
many of you are running off
Mac and you are using a screen

01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:05.640
resolution that's
better for your screen

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.290
than for the projector.

01:38:07.290 --> 01:38:11.570
So it's actually rescaling it
to fit the projector, which

01:38:11.570 --> 01:38:14.485
means actually, every pixel
that you're drawing on screen

01:38:14.485 --> 01:38:16.110
is actually too small
for the projector

01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:18.770
and things get blurred out.

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:21.270
In the Screen Resolution
Settings in System Preferences,

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:26.750
you can actually select
whether you are scaling it

01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:28.187
optimized for either display.

01:38:28.187 --> 01:38:30.520
I guess in this case, you are
optimizing it for display.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:31.820
RICK EBERHARDT: Which
resolution are you using?

01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.736
ANDREW GRANT: It looks
like you're using 1600.

01:38:33.736 --> 01:38:35.035
STUDENT 3: What's the best one?

01:38:35.035 --> 01:38:37.160
RICK EBERHARDT: It's on
the board right behind you.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.590
There's a wide screen
and a four three version.

01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:41.340
ANDREW GRANT: So check
that because you're

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.434
using a lot of
visual detail when

01:38:43.434 --> 01:38:44.600
you're scaling it like that.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.890
It makes your games look worse.

01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:48.580
That looks way better.

01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.080
RICK EBERHARDT: And
the color scheme

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.275
is going to be better, too.

01:38:51.275 --> 01:38:52.066
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

01:38:52.066 --> 01:38:56.040
Your colors do look
better as a result.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:56.990
STUDENT 3: Cool.

01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.670
Awesome.

01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:02.780
So we still have a little
bit of things to iron out,

01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:07.200
but the idea of the game is
that you manage these villages.

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.740
Cholera is spreading
and you have

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.350
to use various prevention
measures to stop it

01:39:11.350 --> 01:39:13.310
from spreading further.

01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:15.681
So when the game starts out,
there's just one village.

01:39:15.681 --> 01:39:17.430
People were having
difficulty figuring out

01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:19.450
that you could actually click
it, so we made it do like that

01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:20.860
so you know you can click it.

01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:23.200
So you click it and then
there's various options

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.637
that you can use to stop
the spread of cholera.

01:39:26.637 --> 01:39:28.470
So it's just the first
village, so I'll just

01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:31.750
go with soap, which is
the cheapest option,

01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:32.942
and that usually stops.

01:39:32.942 --> 01:39:33.900
I'll make it go faster.

01:39:37.630 --> 01:39:39.500
The first village is
sort of a tutorial.

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.791
Once you've figured out how
everything works and you're

01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:43.910
able to stop the infection
there and you cure it,

01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:46.250
then a second village pops up.

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:47.920
As the game goes
on, more villages

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.720
pop up, up to a total
of four villages.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.490
Basically, at the
beginning, it's quite easy.

01:39:53.490 --> 01:39:55.240
You can't really lose
on the first village

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.114
unless you sit and stare
at it and do nothing

01:39:57.114 --> 01:39:58.270
for three minutes.

01:40:00.699 --> 01:40:02.490
But the second village
comes up and now you

01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.137
have to think about
things, then you

01:40:04.137 --> 01:40:06.095
get an idea of how the
game is actually played.

01:40:06.095 --> 01:40:07.770
By the time the third
village comes up,

01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:09.895
you really need a strategy
or you're going to lose.

01:40:09.895 --> 01:40:13.380
And the fourth village, it
just gets really, really hard.

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:16.900
Generally, most people actually
fail in the third village,

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.140
don't make it to the fourth one.

01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:21.130
I guess if you guys want
to see more game play.

01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:22.700
RICK EBERHARDT: Is there sound?

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.533
STUDENT 3: So we don't
have sound right now.

01:40:24.533 --> 01:40:25.970
We're going to
add that in today.

01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:29.110
So the three different
options, basically, soap

01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:30.860
is the cheap, all
around option because we

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:33.110
want the takeaway of the
game is soap is overpowering.

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.010
These two options
distinguish themselves in

01:40:39.010 --> 01:40:41.400
that water containers are
good for stopping an infection

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.280
from spreading but they
don't cure anymore,

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.870
and electrolytes
don't stop anything

01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:47.328
from spreading but
they immediately

01:40:47.328 --> 01:40:50.060
cure just a percentage of
the infected population.

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.069
What we found is that I thought
electrolytes weren't actually

01:40:53.069 --> 01:40:54.860
going to be fun, but
then they are, because

01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:56.860
at the end of the game
when the infection is all

01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:58.490
over the place and
everyone's dying,

01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:01.364
you just keep
spanning electrolytes.

01:41:01.364 --> 01:41:03.280
It has a cool down so
you can't keep spanning,

01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:07.470
but you span it as much as you
can to desperately stay alive.

01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:10.240
I don't know how far
to actually take this.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.880
RICK EBERHARDT:
That's fine for us.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.150
A live player is going
to play it on their own,

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:15.730
so they'll be
figuring stuff out.

01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:17.146
Again, give them
a couple minutes,

01:41:17.146 --> 01:41:20.800
and then you can start talking
if you'd like to talk over.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:23.879
For the presentation itself,
when you started out,

01:41:23.879 --> 01:41:25.920
we could use a little bit
more context about what

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:26.795
you're talking about.

01:41:26.795 --> 01:41:28.400
You kind of just
throw us into what

01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.000
went right and one of the
things that went right,

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.150
so maybe telling us what
you're going to talk about

01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:35.992
might be a way to give context
for the full presentation.

01:41:35.992 --> 01:41:40.710
STUDENT 2: Would starting with
the game give a better idea?

01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:42.410
RICK EBERHARDT:
That would be good,

01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:44.160
especially if you're
talking over the game

01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.890
and talking about
some of the design.

01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:48.460
Then we can kind of call back.

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.310
SARA VERNILLI: Another
context related issue

01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:52.990
is you refer to your client
and you refer to the game

01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:55.200
and you refer to making
the game about cholera

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.010
but you don't actually
explicitly state

01:41:57.010 --> 01:42:00.800
who your client is, what your
game is for, what the goal you

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.830
were trying to create your game
for, what specifically it was.

01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:06.330
You could gather
it from context,

01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:07.913
but it's a nice thing
to have upfront.

01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:17.100
ANDREW GRANT: So the early
slides, they're pretty wordy.

01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.150
Both of you are actually
really good speakers,

01:42:19.150 --> 01:42:22.630
so I feel like you can
get a lot of those points

01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:25.652
in your actual verbal-- you did,
in fact, get all those points

01:42:25.652 --> 01:42:26.860
across in your verbal things.

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:30.150
The slides don't need to also
restate every single thing.

01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:34.960
So stick to high level headers,
but the way how you're actually

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.210
presenting these points are
coming across very clearly

01:42:37.210 --> 01:42:38.859
verbally and the
words are starting

01:42:38.859 --> 01:42:39.900
to distract a little bit.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.500
RICK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:41.620
Each one of those
could have been

01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:43.055
just one slide plus an image.

01:42:45.885 --> 01:42:48.010
ANDREW GRANT: That becomes
a backdrop to the things

01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:50.030
that you're actually
saying, which are actually

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:52.238
coming across quite clearly
and you don't really need

01:42:52.238 --> 01:42:57.299
all of that additional
visual noise,

01:42:57.299 --> 01:42:58.840
especially when you
have sub-bullets,

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.340
like you have a
heading and then you

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.560
have tiny little
sub-bullets underneath.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.995
Those sub-bullets,
just say them.

01:43:03.995 --> 01:43:04.870
Don't represent them.

01:43:08.130 --> 01:43:11.940
The image of selecting
which updates

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:14.430
you have for each
locality, right now

01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:18.180
you have the blank rectangle
with mouseover text in it.

01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.499
Nothing is lit up.

01:43:19.499 --> 01:43:22.040
If you just replace that with
a screenshot of something's lit

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.149
up, something's not lit
up with the mouseover

01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:26.190
text, that will be way
more informative, that one

01:43:26.190 --> 01:43:28.860
slide alone.

01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:31.810
When you talk about
balancing the infection rate,

01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:37.090
that's a really good
detail case example.

01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:38.429
I just want to call that out.

01:43:38.429 --> 01:43:40.220
That level of detail
is neat because you're

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:43.140
talking about really
something very specific.

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:46.490
Other things that you
can talk about-- I'm

01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:52.310
trying to remember the way how
you had set up a communication

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:54.770
system of using
email and Gitter,

01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:58.077
and this is what Gitter is,
but people weren't responding.

01:43:58.077 --> 01:43:58.660
That was good.

01:43:58.660 --> 01:43:59.618
That was very specific.

01:43:59.618 --> 01:44:03.230
That was like, this is
the way how something

01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:06.074
specifically broke down.

01:44:06.074 --> 01:44:07.740
You can talk about
how things eventually

01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:11.320
got resolved would be nice, but
maybe it didn't get resolved,

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:13.572
and you can say that, too.

01:44:13.572 --> 01:44:15.030
That level of
specificity was nice.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:19.627
SARA VERNILLI: One more.

01:44:19.627 --> 01:44:21.210
Specifically on the
slides, you talked

01:44:21.210 --> 01:44:24.590
about how you did iteration.

01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:26.270
You talked about
you made changes

01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:28.720
and you stayed
very generic there.

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.032
I think some actual
specific examples

01:44:31.032 --> 01:44:32.240
we really would like to hear.

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.823
What are some things
that you dropped?

01:44:33.823 --> 01:44:35.965
What are some things that
you had in the beginning

01:44:35.965 --> 01:44:37.720
but you changed a whole lot?

01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.480
They're in your end game
but we don't recognize it

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.170
from the beginning
game because it

01:44:42.170 --> 01:44:44.660
got changed [? in right now. ?]
You don't need

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.000
a whole lot of examples, just
one specific ones would tie it

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.720
back.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:49.511
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

01:44:49.511 --> 01:44:52.305
So if, in that particular
section, you just added,

01:44:52.305 --> 01:44:54.577
here's a specific
feature that got changed

01:44:54.577 --> 01:44:58.609
in this particular way, that's
great because you clearly

01:44:58.609 --> 01:44:59.525
have that information.

01:45:05.067 --> 01:45:06.150
RICK EBERHARDT: All right.

01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:06.650
Thank you.

01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:09.238
[APPLAUSE]

01:45:12.622 --> 01:45:13.330
So thank you all.

01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:17.564
Everyone, sorry we ran a little
bit late, but timing wise,

01:45:17.564 --> 01:45:18.980
everything looks
like it went out.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.410
Tech wise, it looks
like we've got

01:45:20.410 --> 01:45:23.591
most of our stuff figured out.

01:45:23.591 --> 01:45:26.252
A couple points of order.

01:45:26.252 --> 01:45:26.960
This did go long.

01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.929
It's probably going to go about
full two hours on Wednesday.

01:45:29.929 --> 01:45:31.720
Do you want to take a
break midway through?

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:33.780
Would you like an
intermission midway through?

01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.390
I'm seeing some
nods, so we're going

01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:38.250
to put an intermission
midway through.

01:45:38.250 --> 01:45:42.854
Lastly, based on the number
of speakers that we've got

01:45:42.854 --> 01:45:44.770
and the topic matter
that we're talking about,

01:45:44.770 --> 01:45:46.400
I think what we're
going to do is start

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:50.539
with Snap because everybody
will have their computers out

01:45:50.539 --> 01:45:52.580
from the get go and then
we won't need that again

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.370
afterwards.

01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:54.828
Just take care of
that right there.

01:45:54.828 --> 01:45:57.460
You're going to have people
playing live in the audience.

01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:59.634
Then we're going to
go to Hello Wave.

01:45:59.634 --> 01:46:01.300
Basically, we're going
to swap Heat Wave

01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:11.430
and Snap and Saving Gora Gora
and Cholera, swap those two.

01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:12.820
And for that,
because we're going

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:14.639
to have lots of
speakers at the so

01:46:14.639 --> 01:46:16.180
that will just make
it so that you're

01:46:16.180 --> 01:46:18.184
doing all the moving around.

01:46:18.184 --> 01:46:20.600
Cholera Control, you're going
to have two people for that,

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.725
so we're going to make sure
we have two microphones

01:46:22.725 --> 01:46:24.130
for all of that.

01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:27.020
We'll have the intermission
right after Heat Wave.

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.140
So that's about an
hour and a half,

01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:31.105
and then we'll
have another hour,

01:46:31.105 --> 01:46:33.435
and then that's the end
of the class on Wednesday.

01:46:36.798 --> 01:46:38.839
ANDREW GRANT: So that's
the order of presentation

01:46:38.839 --> 01:46:39.316
right there.

01:46:39.316 --> 01:46:40.191
RICK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:42.011
One, two, three, four, five.

01:46:42.011 --> 01:46:42.510
There we go.

01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:43.074
Cool.

01:46:43.074 --> 01:46:45.490
I'm trying to think if there's
anything else that I should

01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:47.210
get to before we release you.

01:46:47.210 --> 01:46:47.990
No.

01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:53.690
Student evaluations,
web.mit.edu/studentevaluations.

01:46:53.690 --> 01:46:55.520
I'll write up the
real URL right there.

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.141
Please do that in class
today if you could.

01:46:58.141 --> 01:46:58.890
Thank you so much.

01:46:58.890 --> 01:46:59.970
You actually are doing
a really good job.

01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:01.180
I really like these
presentations.

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:02.763
I'm really excited
to see what they're

01:47:02.763 --> 01:47:04.660
going to be like
on Wednesday, and I

01:47:04.660 --> 01:47:07.610
was really happy to see working
games today, so aces on you

01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:09.160
for that.
