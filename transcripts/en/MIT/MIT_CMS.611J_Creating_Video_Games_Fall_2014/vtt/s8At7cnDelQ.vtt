00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:24.360
PROFESSOR: So today in class,
we've got a guest lecturer.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.840
Scott Osterweil from the MIT
Education Arcade at MIT Game

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.380
Lab's going to be talking
to us about learning

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.867
and play in games to put us
in the mindset for the games

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.700
that you're making that
feel like they might

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.520
be educational or more
about awareness, to take

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.180
some ideas from him on that.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.180
Then after that, we're
going to do a play test.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.620
So this is your
first opportunity

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.400
to give staff and clients,
if our clients show up,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.860
the experience of
playing your games

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.700
and giving you some feedback
on the low-fidelity prototypes

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.720
that you have right now.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.007
And again, they could be
digital or non digital.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.590
That's going to be
pretty quick today.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.860
We don't need everybody to
play everybody else's games,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.610
if you don't like.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
So what we're going have
you do is set up your games.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.240
I expect if they're
paper, you probably only

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.699
have one copy of your game
running at any one time.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.240
So just make sure
that everyone who's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.952
on the team who is not playing
is observing and taking notes.

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:20.910
If you do have digital
and would like to set up

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.730
multiple stations, please do.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.940
It's always helpful.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.580
Our next play test
is November 5.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.606
We're having the
class from 21W032,

00:01:31.606 --> 00:01:33.230
the Introduction to
Digital Media class

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.997
taught by Ed Barrett.

00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:37.330
They'll be coming in at the
end of the day at about 3:00

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.380
PM to test your digital games.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.150
So on November 5, it's
a good opportunity

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.430
for a first playable
version of your digital game

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.530
to get tested by people
who are not in the class.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.080
And then after play test today,
we'll take a quick break.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.580
And then we'll do presentations
where each team will come up

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.030
here, and you've basically
got the floor for two minutes.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.830
We want to hear what is the
state your game right now,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.580
basically referring back
to your product backlog.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.180
What are the features
that are planned?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.269
What did you test today?

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.810
What does your build
look like today,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.610
your low-fidelity
prototype look like today?

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.720
And just let us
know how it's going.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.410
We're going to ask for a number
of these short two-minute

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.280
presentations throughout
the rest of the semester.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.730
And those dates are in the
handout for project four.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.400
And I'll be making mention
of them as we go along.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.360
And then the remainder of
class, you've got about hour

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.570
to an hour and a half at the
end of class to work in class.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.490
I'm going to let you
know how much time you're

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.676
going to have time for working
in class for future days.

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.050
This Wednesday, you'll probably
have about two full hours

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.821
in class to work, looking at
what our lecture schedule looks

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.320
like.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.280
So that's that.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.140
Any questions about
what we're doing today?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.660
Any questions
about project four?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.160
OK.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.490
I'm going to hand
it off to Scott.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.110
SCOTT OSTERWEIL:
[INAUDIBLE], this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.390
is the [INAUDIBLE] switch
you were talking about?

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.390
PROFESSOR: Yep, I'm
switching it over right now.

00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:14.600
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Well,
it's nice to see you all.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.860
I see at least two faces
from-- three from classes

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.020
that I taught, so forgive
me for those of you who may

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.440
have heard some of this before.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.780
So this was sort of
teed up as if I'm

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.440
going to talk to
you about education,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.115
but I'm actually not going to
talk to you about education.

00:03:31.115 --> 00:03:33.710
I'm going to talk to you
about something else entirely.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.668
Maybe we'll get around
to education by the time

00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:37.100
we're done.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.520
But what I want you to do right
now-- hang on one second--

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.317
is turn to the
person next to you

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:45.900
and play a quick
round of tic-tac-toe.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.340
So I do like doing
this, even though it's

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.580
hard to get people to stop.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.610
It's actually kind
of interesting to me.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.150
When I've done this with an
audience of about 300 people,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.820
it takes a long time to
corral everybody back,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.539
which is really remarkable.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.080
If you weren't
playing a game, I hope

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.310
you were at least looking
around and noticing

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.060
that the room got
kind of loud and there

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.840
was a fair amount of laughter,
and noise, and animation,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.390
which is really
remarkable when you

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.630
consider the fact that
tic-tac-toe is a stupid game.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.264
That by age eight,
you had figured out

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:24.180
that there was no point
in playing tic-tac-toe

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.013
because you almost
always play it to a draw.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.990
I'm always amazed when I ask a
bunch of adults, which you are,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.350
to play tic-tac-toe,
how into it they get.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.510
And I think in the end,
it's the thing I really want

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.530
to talk about, which is play.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.100
I know you guys have been
in a class studying games.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.310
Have you talked much
about the word play?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.810
Good.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.050
We are all in the
business of making games,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.180
and yet we don't stop
much to think about play.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.752
But play is not something that
was invented with the Atari.

00:05:00.752 --> 00:05:02.710
People have been playing
games for a long time.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.850
The oldest known game
implements are older

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.810
than the oldest known writing.

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:13.020
I don't know how many
of you know art history,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.810
but this is the
late 16th century

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.480
in what's now Belgium,
the low countries--

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.140
Flanders in those days.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.150
The great genre
painter Pieter Bruegel,

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.880
who did a painting called
Children's Games, in which he

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.830
documented over 100
games that scholars have

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.695
been able to identify
as real games that

00:05:31.695 --> 00:05:32.820
were played at that time.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.100
And if you think about
it, at that point

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.820
there wasn't really much of
a thing called childhood.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.010
That by the age of 11
or 12, you were probably

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.200
working in the family
business, whatever it was.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.210
You were expected to take
on adult responsibilities.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.926
And yet clearly, play was still
a huge part of their lives.

00:05:53.926 --> 00:05:55.300
Now, this is a
fanciful painting.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.210
He was not trying to
be realistic here.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.580
But the point was play was a
huge part of their lives then.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.950
So we know that they
were playing back

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.890
in the 16th century.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.460
We know they were
playing 6,000 years ago.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.650
We actually know that
our ancestors played too,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.400
that other vertebrates play.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.870
In fact, Edwin Wilson has sort
of argued that ants play too,

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.752
but let's just stick to
vertebrates for a minute.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:27.580
When mountain goats play--
there's a alpine mountain

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.130
goat-- they play
by-- and by the way,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.470
let me just say quickly
from my definition,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.040
play is the stuff
you do when you don't

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.500
have to do something else.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.040
You don't have to get food.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.840
You don't have to evade
capture, or protect your young,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.667
or procreate, or find shelter.

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.000
When you don't have to do all
that stuff-- some of which

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.070
you do playfully, by
the way-- but when

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.140
you don't have to do that
stuff and you're on your own,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.070
you play.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.740
And so mountain goats
play by actually chasing

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.270
each other around the mountains
and jumping from cliff

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.752
to cliff, ledge to ledge.

00:07:00.752 --> 00:07:02.210
And they do it in
spite of the fact

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.751
that mountain goats
will occasionally

00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:05.380
fall to their deaths.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.120
And if we know anything
about evolution,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.430
we know the behaviors that lead
to the deaths of individuals

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.030
are behaviors that are
more likely to die out,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.190
unless there is some
advantage to the behavior that

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.170
outweighs the risk.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.010
And it would easy
to assume from this

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.510
that mountain goats
are learning how

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.370
to do the things they need
to do, like jump and land

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.542
on precarious ledges.

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:29.750
That that's what they're
learning through their play.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.330
We might extend
that thinking when

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.470
we look at an image like this.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.940
By the way, you can find images
like this on the internet.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.710
Anyway, so we've all seen
images of cats or puppies

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.355
fighting, playing at games that
look like fighting or hunting.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.460
And if we take that example
and the example of the mountain

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.290
goats, it's easy to conclude
that play is about rote memory.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:05.360
It's about learning to do
things through repetition.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.390
But they've done a study
where they prevented kittens

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.550
from the opportunity to
play while they grow up,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.950
play with other cats.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.665
And it turns out they learn
how to hunt just fine.

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:18.040
What they don't
know how to do is

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.172
how to interact with
other cats or make

00:08:20.172 --> 00:08:21.380
other more complex decisions.

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:27.070
What I'm going to argue
is play is about something

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.450
far more involved that just sort
of rote memory and repetition.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.059
Last animal example.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:37.799
They did a study where they
gave an otter a fish every time

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.270
it swam through a hoop.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.230
Now, if you think about
what an otter's needs are,

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.090
that otter was rich
beyond its wildest dreams.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.880
Everything it needed
was right there just

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.270
by swimming through the hoop.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.587
So did the otter retire as we
might do if all our needs were

00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:52.170
taken care of?

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.470
No, it started swimming
through the hoop upside down,

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.960
backwards.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.310
Playing with a hoop with
its way of exploring

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.736
how the world worked.

00:09:00.736 --> 00:09:02.610
The otters-- I assume
there's more than one--

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.694
the otters knew that swimming
through a hoop got fish.

00:09:05.694 --> 00:09:07.610
They wanted to find out
what else it could do.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.360
And again, this is when
survival is no longer an issue.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.170
So play is really the way in
which we explore the world.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.300
Just looking at these
images of children,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.430
there are four different
continents here,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.580
four very different
kinds of games.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.716
But I'd argue the affect
is the same in all of them,

00:09:28.716 --> 00:09:30.340
and that what's going
on in all of them

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.710
is the same thing, that
the kids in these pictures

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.410
are really constructing their
understanding of the world

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.920
through play.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.820
What I want to argue is
that through play, we

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.850
begin to build the kinds
of conceptual structures

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.910
that we are going to then
engage with more formally

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.710
in other spheres of life.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.040
And I could argue that
it's only for children,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.611
but I'm going to
argue further that it

00:09:58.611 --> 00:09:59.760
doesn't stop in childhood.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.635
But sticking with
childhood for just a moment

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:04.510
and using my own
personal example.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.355
I loved playing with
blocks when I was a kid.

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:09.730
And this is all
pre-kindergarten.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.870
I can remember the
pleasure of discovering

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.940
that two square blocks
were the same size as one

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.580
rectangular block, and
two rectangular blocks

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.470
were the same size
as one big block.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.590
And the kicker was that
that was equal to four

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.580
of the little square blocks, and
that those relationships could

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.236
then be replicated elsewhere.

00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:29.360
That that was a pattern
that I could find elsewhere

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.120
in the world.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.980
And so pre-kindergarten
now, what I am really doing

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:40.640
is developing a primitive,
but I would say robust sense

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.380
that math is the way we
actually model the world.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.100
That we can actually model
the world mathematically.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.330
Now obviously, as four-year-old,
me couldn't have said that.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.900
Four-year-old me couldn't even
necessarily answer 2 plus 2

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.400
equals.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.700
But four-year-old me knew
something far more robust.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.640
I was starting to
really understand

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.110
that the world could be
described mathematically,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.529
and that that was why
I was primed to be

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:05.820
a relatively good math student.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.557
The challenge, though, is that I
just played with blocks the way

00:11:12.557 --> 00:11:13.640
I chose to play with them.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.320
No one made me.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.130
In fact, if you'd sat me
down and say play with blocks

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.150
and discover what you can about
numbers, I might have refused

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.840
and age four.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.830
Players' motivations are
entirely intrinsic and personal

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.600
in all play.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.749
You cannot make somebody play.

00:11:28.749 --> 00:11:31.040
I think it's helpful to think
about it as if there were

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.300
four freedoms present in play.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.230
Freedom to experiment.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.990
I thought I had
revised the slides.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.240
I really sort of revised that.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.617
I think it's better say freedom
to explore is the better word.

00:11:45.617 --> 00:11:47.200
But what I was doing
with those blocks

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.520
was seeing things about
the blocks that were not--

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.139
the package showed
pictures of things

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:52.930
you could build with
the blocks, but that's

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.120
not what I was doing.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.160
I was sort of exploring
properties of the blocks

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.520
that no one was
telling me to look for.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.470
Freedom to fail.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.830
If you played with
blocks, you probably

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.850
built a tower that
eventually fell down,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.711
and you probably learned a lot
from the tower falling down.

00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:10.460
You probably, in fact,
persisted at trying

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.585
to get the tower to stand up.

00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:13.920
And along the way, you were
learning all sorts of stuff

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.610
about mechanics and physics.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.160
Freedom of identity.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.980
If you think about
doll play for a minute,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:26.290
a kid in the floor of
their room acting out

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.760
conflict between two dolls,
or stuffed animals, or action

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.480
figures is really exploring all
the roles in their own family,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.070
in their world.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.450
A kid who plays at Luke
Skywalker versus Darth

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.280
Vader is really figuring
out what part of him

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.690
or herself is Luke
Skywalker and what part

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:46.670
is Darth Vader, because we think
we have both of them in us.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.700
And that's what we
explore through play.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.620
In less than a week, on
Friday, a fair number of you

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.970
are going to engage in identity
play at a fairly large scale,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.630
so it's not just
a childhood thing.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.400
I mean, I'm talking about
Halloween, obviously.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.940
And anyone who's ever
played World of Warcraft

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.780
or any number of games knows
that in fact, through games,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.530
we play with our
identity over time.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.230
Finally, freedom of
effort is the freedom

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.460
to really play hard
or play relaxed.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.490
You cannot make
somebody play hard.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.030
And if you watched
the pattern of play,

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.230
people will play intensely.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.802
They will suddenly ease up.

00:13:26.802 --> 00:13:28.760
Again, stick to World of
Warcraft for a minute,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.926
sometimes you want to grind.

00:13:29.926 --> 00:13:33.110
You just want to do the
mindless stuff for a while.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.010
And sometimes you want to
enter into an intense battle.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.070
They both happen.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.179
So here's the challenge for us.

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:40.720
The player's
motivations are entirely

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.670
intrinsic and personal,
as I've already said.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.500
And I'm also arguing
that obviously, learning

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.930
is happening through play.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.690
But how do we channel
play into learning

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.440
while still allowing
for its fundamentally

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.644
open-ended nature?

00:13:54.644 --> 00:13:56.060
So if you, as Rick
said, are going

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.010
to be making games in
which you want to-- well,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.520
I hope you're thinking about
real learning rather than just

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.900
conveying information.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.300
And I'll get to
that in a minute.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.200
But whatever it is you're
doing, theoretically you

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.240
want to make a good
game, they still

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.842
have to have the
freedom to play.

00:14:14.842 --> 00:14:16.300
You don't have a
game without play.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.040
You can have something that
has the structure of a game

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.220
without play, but
it won't really

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.770
be a game if
they're not playing.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.520
But anyway, so that's
where games come in.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.520
That's how we can channel
learning sometimes

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.730
while still being open ended.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.215
And just to use the most absurd
example, think about golf.

00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:36.900
It was Bernard Suits who
originally used this example.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.220
But in golf, you're
hitting a very small ball

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.770
with a very long stick.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.920
Anyone golf here?

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.850
Yeah, that's what the normal
percentage is in a class.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.895
But it's hard, right ?

00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:50.520
The first time you
swung the golf club,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.330
you might have missed
the ball entirely, right?

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.639
Yeah.

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:56.930
Sometimes even when you start
connecting with the ball,

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.540
it goes the wrong direction.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.421
It goes 10 feet, 20 feet.

00:15:00.421 --> 00:15:02.170
When you can finally
hit it some distance,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.550
it goes into the water,
it goes into the woods.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.880
It costs $2.50 every
time you lose a ball.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.390
If your goal, after all, is
to get the ball in the hole,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.723
why don't you just pick it
up, and walk to the other end

00:15:12.723 --> 00:15:13.860
of course, and drop it in?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.360
The golf game would
go much quicker.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.640
You'd never lose a ball.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.580
You have a lot more success.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.380
But no one chooses to
play golf that way.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.980
If you think about
it, people choose

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.720
to play golf by moving
the ball to the hole

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.640
in the single
stupidest way possible.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.540
And as Bernard Suits
said in this context,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.130
games are really
about overcoming

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.200
unnecessary obstacles.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.410
And unnecessary is critical
here because every game

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.710
is, by definition, unnecessary.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.810
If you're really
playing, it's voluntary.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.470
It's not required.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.490
Your survival does
not depend on it.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.274
So by definition, every
game is unnecessary,

00:15:53.274 --> 00:15:55.690
and therefore the obstacles
in every game are unnecessary.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.520
And the game is the
voluntary overcoming

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.850
of unnecessary obstacles.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.450
So why do we do it?

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.234
Why would we do all that?

00:16:03.234 --> 00:16:04.650
Well, in games we
willingly submit

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.700
to arbitrary rules
and structures

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.740
in pursuit of mastery because
that's what's going on in golf.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.370
Even in golf.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.140
You think it's hard, and yet
even though you missed the golf

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.515
ball the first time, you
think, I think I can hit it.

00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:20.890
And then eventually
you do hit it

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.598
and you say, I think
I can hit it further

00:16:22.598 --> 00:16:24.440
and I think I can
hit it straighter.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.739
And in fact, the game
gives you feedback.

00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:28.530
The game is continually
giving you feedback

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.780
as to how you're doing.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:36.170
No matter how
ridiculously hard golf is,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.555
you set for yourself
proximal goals.

00:16:38.555 --> 00:16:41.370
I'm going to hit a little
straighter, a little further.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.200
And the game lets you do that.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.720
No one runs out
into the golf course

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.270
and says, stop, you didn't
hit the ball far enough,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.735
or yells at you and says, hit
it further, further, right?

00:16:52.735 --> 00:16:54.920
They let you
playfully explore what

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.530
you can do with that golf ball.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.290
And you keep saying
I'm getting better,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.230
and so you keep playing golf.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.370
And that's true with every game.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.290
And I'll talk about a couple
other examples going forward

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.140
about that.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.990
So games give you proximal goals
which seem worth achieving,

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.250
but only if you can
continue to be playful.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.060
And that's I think
the thing we sometimes

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.200
lose sight of when we're making
games is the playfulness.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.789
We remember the goal.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:21.830
We remember that there's
an outcome that we want.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.160
And we remember that we want the
player to get to that outcome.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.980
But we forget about
playfulness, which means we

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.510
either make a game
that's too easy.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.295
We lead them right
to the outcome.

00:17:31.295 --> 00:17:33.920
That's like picking up the ball
, and walking to the other end,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.086
and dropping it in the hole.

00:17:35.086 --> 00:17:37.290
And a lot of games do that.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.399
Or we just figure I'm going
to make it really hard.

00:17:41.399 --> 00:17:43.190
I don't care whether
they enjoy themselves.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.669
They're going to get there.

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:45.710
And of course they don't.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:46.270
They quit.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.710
It's one thing to
define a challenge.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.130
That's important.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.030
The real art in it is
defining a proximal challenge,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.244
one that people can reach.

00:18:01.244 --> 00:18:03.410
And I would argue that if
you're talking about games

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.450
in which you want to
convey information

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.480
or you want people to learn
something, all of that

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.212
has to hold true.

00:18:09.212 --> 00:18:10.920
And in fact, the other
thing I'm arguing,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.260
obviously, is that at in every
game, people are learning.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.801
That the reason you
like playing golf

00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:16.530
is because you're learning.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.110
And Raph Koster sets
this out really well

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.650
in the Theory of Fun,
the book A Theory of Fun.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.590
But that basically, the
fundamental pleasure

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.690
of gameplay is
learning, is learning

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.706
to master the game,
which means in a sense,

00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:30.080
if you're doing
a game and you've

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.180
got some goal for some learning
to happen, all you've got to do

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.320
is make that learning
interesting and worth

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:43.410
achieving by giving people
the right set of goals

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.190
to work toward it.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:48.880
So I keep talking kind of
interchangeably between play

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.470
and learning.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.120
And yet the four freedoms
of play, which I'm arguing

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.290
are the four
freedoms of learning,

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:58.567
are not the four
freedoms of school.

00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:01.150
If you think about school, and
I'm not talking about MIT right

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.560
now, if you think about your
own high school experience--

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.401
high school is particularly
bad-- what kind of freedom

00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:08.900
is there?

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.800
Freedom to fail?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.150
Not so much.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.030
Freedom to explore?

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:17.344
Well, I mean, even a
high school science lab,

00:19:17.344 --> 00:19:19.760
everyone is expecting to get
the same results by following

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.690
the exact same procedure, right?

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.201
And that's the most experimental
you ever get in school.

00:19:26.201 --> 00:19:28.450
Certainly no freedom of
effort or freedom of identity.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.930
You sit in your
same seat every day

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.482
and you're expected to
behave the exact same way.

00:19:34.482 --> 00:19:36.190
And you're expected
to work equally hard.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.460
You can't come in and say I
don't feel like working today.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.390
So there's very
little play in school,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.980
at least as it's
currently embodied.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.940
And this is why I
mention school here,

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.985
is because I think
one of the challenges

00:19:49.985 --> 00:19:52.360
if you're an MIT student is
that you were probably pretty

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.940
good at the game of school.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.346
You probably did what
was required of you.

00:19:57.346 --> 00:20:00.600
You probably didn't
necessarily recognize

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.100
that doing the things that
school required of you

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.835
is not when you were
actually learning,

00:20:04.835 --> 00:20:06.670
that that was just
playing the game.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.725
That the learning was
more self-motivated

00:20:09.725 --> 00:20:11.500
and more self-directed.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.920
And so frequently people,
when they turn around

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.500
and try to make anything
to do with learning,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.130
whether it's a game, or write
a book, or create a curriculum,

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.880
they replicate everything
that's bad about school.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.010
And the reason I don't like to
say I make educational games

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.175
is because when you think
of educational games,

00:20:30.175 --> 00:20:32.300
you think of all the bad
games that have replicated

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.220
what's bad about school.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.070
Games that have largely taken
the dead carcass of a game

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:41.090
and stuffed it full
of academic content.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.450
So you're going
to shoot at aliens

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.360
and you're going to
memorize your times table.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.635
Now, what aliens have to do
with times tables, I don't know.

00:20:50.635 --> 00:20:52.760
Any I'd even argue that
memorizing your times table

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.730
is of questionable value.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.560
There may be a place
for it, but it's

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.620
certainly not what being good
at math is about, fundamentally.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.480
And too often,
games for learning

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.875
end up being about simply
I'm going to feed you content

00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:09.250
that would be
boring in a lecture

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.445
or boring in a textbook.

00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:11.070
And guess what?

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.820
It's going to be just
as boring in a game.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.236
The only difference
is we're going

00:21:14.236 --> 00:21:16.970
to surround it with things that
we think you think are fun,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.410
like shooting at aliens.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.180
So it sort of
translates into people

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.770
thinking that what
the world needs

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.535
is something like
Grand Theft Calculus.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.464
But in fact, without
playfulness, a game

00:21:32.464 --> 00:21:33.880
is just going
through the motions.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.180
It's just gym class.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.870
Volleyball in gym is not
the same as volleyball

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.260
at the beach, and there's
a reason for that.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.601
And even smart MIT
kids making games

00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:48.600
when they think there's
learning involved end up

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.054
reverting to gym
class, to just I'm

00:21:52.054 --> 00:21:54.220
going to make you play this
game to learn this stuff

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.560
you don't want to learn.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.012
Just to talk about
the difference

00:21:58.012 --> 00:22:00.220
between a good learning game
and a bad learning game,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.220
let's talk about difference
between spelling bee

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.030
and Scrabble.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:10.470
In a spelling bee, most of
us, when we do a spelling bee,

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:11.610
are nervous.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:12.890
Our palms are sweating.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.765
We think we're going to fail.

00:22:15.765 --> 00:22:17.140
Eventually the
moment comes where

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.223
they say no, you're wrong.

00:22:18.223 --> 00:22:18.790
Sit down.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.800
You're probably relieved.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.867
When they say, you're wrong,
sit down, nobody says to you,

00:22:24.867 --> 00:22:27.200
well, that was interesting
that you spelled it that way,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.080
or I can understand why you
might have chosen to spell it

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.920
that way, because
it rhymes with-- no.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.990
They just say you're
wrong, sit down.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.220
And that's the end of it.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.940
The end of a spelling bee, one
person feels good, the winner.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.477
Maybe the kid who comes
in second feels OK.

00:22:40.477 --> 00:22:42.310
Everyone else is relieved
because they don't

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.880
have to do spelling anymore.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.850
And I first coined this analogy
thinking about bad games.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.716
But I later came to
realize that it's bigger

00:22:51.716 --> 00:22:53.340
than that, because
if you think about--

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.089
so I don't know how
many of you know this,

00:22:55.089 --> 00:22:56.570
but 7% of the
population in the US

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.070
graduates high
school saying they're

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:02.720
good at math, which means
we take an hour a day

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.340
for 12 years teaching
93% of the population

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.650
that they're not good at math.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.180
We would be doing them all a
big favor by in kindergarten,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.860
saying you're not going to do
math and just leave it at that.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.540
Or better yet, we
could figure out ways

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.956
that teaching
method that actually

00:23:17.956 --> 00:23:20.750
were meaningful and relevant to
people, rather than making them

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.250
feel like they're
not good at math.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.661
So that's a bad game.

00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:29.160
And so what I'm really arguing
is that school is a bad game.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.050
School is a game in
which we reward people

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.656
for learning how
to play at school.

00:23:33.656 --> 00:23:35.280
Sometimes they're
smart at some things.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.946
I'm not saying that
there aren't people.

00:23:36.946 --> 00:23:39.580
But largely our goal
is to weed people out.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.250
And we filter some
people into some fields

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.460
because they seem good at it.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.459
For everyone else, we're
sort of convincing them

00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:47.520
that they-- whew, I don't
have to study anymore.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.394
I'm done with school.

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:50.060
I never have to
learn anything again.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.520
That's the way most people
end up leaving school.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.350
Scrabble, you sit down.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.189
You got your board.

00:23:56.189 --> 00:23:56.980
You got your tiles.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.396
You're moving
around all the time.

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:01.210
You're being creative even
in the downtime just thinking

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:02.600
about all the words you know.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.310
If you never win a
game of Scrabble,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.020
you have all sorts of
other proximal goals,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.675
like getting a 50-point word,
or getting a triple word score,

00:24:09.675 --> 00:24:11.540
or getting the highest
score you ever got.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.890
Just like golf, it gives
you lots of feedback.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.710
By the way, most
people who play golf,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.090
they're not in a tournament.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.820
They're not playing
to win a game.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.104
They made their own game.

00:24:23.104 --> 00:24:25.520
Maybe I'm going to get a lower
score than I got last time,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.170
or maybe I'm going to get at a
lower score than the person I'm

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:27.840
playing with.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.829
Well, at Scrabble,
it's the same thing.

00:24:29.829 --> 00:24:32.370
So you're continually setting
your own goals within the game.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.890
The game has goals.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.050
It has something called victory.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.920
And we all may aspire
to that victory,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.750
but we have lots of other
ways of measuring ourselves

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.360
that are not about victory.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.380
And every player makes up
their own game within Scrabble,

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.820
and golf, and any good game.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.340
We actually all play a different
game when we play a game,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.720
and that's not a
fault to the game.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:01.020
So one last thing I sort of want
to bring into the conversation

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.832
as we think about
this is an expression.

00:25:04.832 --> 00:25:07.415
It dates back to around the same
time as the Bruegel painting.

00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:11.480
But in English, we first see the
expression all work and no play

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.920
makes Jack a dull boy.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.140
And at first, your
first response

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.680
is that's a good thing, right?

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.204
Yes, play is important.

00:25:19.204 --> 00:25:20.870
So it seems to be a
statement in support

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:21.640
of what I've been saying.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.181
But the only trouble with it is
that it also sort of suggests

00:25:24.181 --> 00:25:26.080
that there is this dichotomy.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.620
There's work and there's play.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.470
And I may have sort
of suggested it

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.136
by saying it's the
thing you do when you

00:25:31.136 --> 00:25:33.390
don't have to do anything else.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.290
But then I did
modify that by saying

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.880
that you do some of these
other things playfully as well.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.080
And in fact, when
we go into school,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.420
we think that there's
learning and there's play

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.435
and they're different.

00:25:44.435 --> 00:25:46.810
But in fact, I'm going to go
quickly through those slides

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.268
and just go up to
here and just say

00:25:48.268 --> 00:25:52.474
I think we really need to
think of it more like this.

00:25:52.474 --> 00:25:54.515
And we need to think about
situating things here.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.880
And fun, by the way.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.640
Let me just be clear about fun.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.640
Fun is not giggles.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:08.260
Fun doesn't even necessarily
require a smile on the face.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.490
If you think about yourself
playing a video game

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.560
at age 11 or 12,
there were probably

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.580
moments where your
tongue was sticking out,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.960
and you're cross
eyed, and you're

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.760
yelling at the screen,
that's not fair,

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.330
and you threw your controller.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.890
And then you beat the game
and said, that was fun.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.460
And Seymour Papert a retired
professor from the Media Lab,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.300
is the one who coined
the term hard fun.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.270
And hard fun is not
a special category.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:37.110
I would argue that lots of fun
is hard fun, maybe most fun.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.720
Certainly most
games are hard fun,

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.780
and that most good
learning is hard fun.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.490
The things you learn that
aren't fun, yes, there

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.994
may be some value to
memorizing your times tables,

00:26:51.994 --> 00:26:53.660
but it doesn't make
you a mathematician.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.493
That's not where the
real learning happened.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.430
There's things you have to
memorize-- although I heard

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.090
somewhere that a
10th grade biology

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.340
student has to memorize
more words than a 10th grade

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.960
French student.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.959
And if you think about it, how
many of us, other than those

00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:14.000
of us who go to biology,
ever use all those words

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.021
that we memorized about?

00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:15.520
None of it.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.470
So, I mean, I think too much
of our vision of learning

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.980
is still based on memorizing
stuff that you then

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.757
get tested on, rather
than building up

00:27:25.757 --> 00:27:27.340
cognitive structures
that you can then

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.910
work with through the rest
of your life, which is what

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.310
we really want people to do.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.830
That's my point, because
I know you're doing

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.700
this work with the Red Cross.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.500
You have information
you want to convey.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.500
I want to argue that if
the information you want

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.730
to convey fits on a 3
by 5 card and people

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:48.464
can carry it around
with them, then

00:27:48.464 --> 00:27:50.130
there's no point in
making a game of it.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.490
So just to do a
parallel example,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:04.281
I've done games for the working
poor, games where the goal is

00:28:04.281 --> 00:28:06.780
to explain to them that they
shouldn't take out payday loans

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.817
or take on credit card debt.

00:28:08.817 --> 00:28:11.025
Well, in fact, you could
write that on a 3 by 5 card.

00:28:11.025 --> 00:28:12.700
If I handed it to
most people and said

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.533
don't take out a payday
loan, don't take out

00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:18.390
credit card debt, they would
nod, and smile, and agree.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.400
And then they would
go and do it when

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.580
they were in extremis, anyway.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.660
They don't do it
blithely, but they do it.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.680
But my point is that the
understanding that you really

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.951
need is more subtle
and more complicated.

00:28:29.951 --> 00:28:32.450
You really want to give people
some functional understanding

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.210
of something.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.376
So when we did that game,
what we really tried to do

00:28:35.376 --> 00:28:38.340
is put people in the situations
in which they might otherwise

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.065
get loans and help them see
what the alternatives were.

00:28:41.065 --> 00:28:44.360
That that was the important
learning, and helping them

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.670
recognize those moments.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.720
The learning was sort of
helping them, and helping

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.777
them feel empowered to be
able to make decisions.

00:28:52.777 --> 00:28:54.735
So we were doing lots of
stuff beyond conveying

00:28:54.735 --> 00:28:58.470
the information don't take
out of credit card debt.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.210
And so similarly, I think you're
doing games where you probably

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:03.540
think you want to
convey information,

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.870
but that's all information
that could fit on a pamphlet,

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.097
or on a 3 by 5 card,
and you probably really

00:29:09.097 --> 00:29:10.680
don't want to make
a game out of that.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.950
You probably really want
to make a game that's

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:17.690
going to be about helping people
through some experience master

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.670
something.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.490
And through their sense
of mastery, change them.

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.600
So I think that's it
in a nutshell, what

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.850
I want to say, and just use the
rest of the time for questions.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.117
And then you're to see
your paper projects

00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:32.950
with everybody else.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.260
Any questions?

00:29:41.451 --> 00:29:41.950
Yes.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.363
AUDIENCE: So a lot of
your initial description,

00:29:43.363 --> 00:29:45.250
it actually sounded
like grad school.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.554
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah?

00:29:46.554 --> 00:29:48.054
AUDIENCE: So I feel
like grad school

00:29:48.054 --> 00:29:50.924
is quite the opposite of
what you're saying school is.

00:29:50.924 --> 00:29:51.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:54.100
Say a little more, because
not everyone knows.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.822
So [INAUDIBLE] and fail,
because [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:56.822 --> 00:29:58.274
why did you go to grad school?

00:29:58.274 --> 00:30:00.788
Because you can explore things.

00:30:00.788 --> 00:30:02.084
You can fail.

00:30:02.084 --> 00:30:04.028
You can do a project
that doesn't work,

00:30:04.028 --> 00:30:06.134
that nobody's really
going to get mad at you.

00:30:06.134 --> 00:30:07.926
You just do the next paper.

00:30:07.926 --> 00:30:09.759
Afterwards, you can try
as hard as you want.

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:12.218
And there are days
when you don't

00:30:12.218 --> 00:30:15.185
feel like [INAUDIBLE] too much.

00:30:15.185 --> 00:30:16.662
I'm not sure about identity.

00:30:16.662 --> 00:30:17.370
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.380
Well, a lot of people
enter grad school

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:20.330
thinking they're
going to do one thing

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.700
and end up leaving
doing something else.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.993
They have that freedom to.

00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:24.530
I mean actually, that's
true of undergraduate too.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.760
I would say undergraduate,
and certainly at MIT, it

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.176
seems to me slightly
more playful.

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:29.070
Well, I don't know.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.910
I'm not familiar.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.370
I don't know what it's like
the freshman year, when

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:33.630
you're doing all those psets.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:35.510
I don't know what that's like.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.886
I was a theater major
at a different school,

00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:39.260
so I don't know
what that's like.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.843
But I do see, and particularly
in upperclassmen, a fair amount

00:30:41.843 --> 00:30:44.680
of play in your work.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.710
But I think it is true.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.160
What I'm really
arguing at core is

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.320
that what real education is
about is learning how to learn,

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.050
is learning all
the kinds of things

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:58.760
you need to do to
know how to learn.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.000
And some of it means just
having your natural curiosity

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.590
positively reinforced instead
of negatively reinforced.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.180
Kids are naturally curious.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.607
They don't have any
trouble asking questions.

00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:13.190
We slowly start doing
things that make

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.090
people stop asking questions.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.050
We killed the curiosity
in most people.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.970
And so I'm really
arguing that education

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.150
should be about
maximizing your curiosity

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.430
so that you continue to
ask interesting questions

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.360
for the rest of your life.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.650
So my example of
math, I don't see

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.760
why there's no reason why
everyone who graduates

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.260
high school couldn't,
when they then

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.150
hear a politician
quote a statistic,

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.260
say how does he know that?

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.770
Where did that
statistic come from?

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.570
And when you read a
survey, say that question

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:50.760
doesn't seem like a
good survey, or that's

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.330
correlation, not causation.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:55.110
Those are all things we can
learn in high school math,

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.670
for example.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:59.970
So it's much more about learning
how to think than it is about--

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.150
and for statistics, it's far
more important to know how

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:07.790
to ask those questions than it
is for everybody to know what

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.240
the r value is of something.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.680
I think that's a term in
the statistics, isn't it?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.360
Yeah.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.640
I haven't taken statistics.

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:19.300
And the reason I'm
going back to sort

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.330
of trying to talk to you about
what education should be about

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.410
is because if you do games
for learning, particularly

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.140
because they're
games, get you've

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.090
got to shake the false
model of learning is

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:34.362
and go for the truly
playful model--

00:32:34.362 --> 00:32:36.070
because otherwise,
it'll be the same kind

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.820
of boring educational game
that probably made you look

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.780
askance at having to listen to
me at all in the first place,

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.460
because that's
what you thought I

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.710
was going to be talking about.

00:32:46.436 --> 00:32:47.360
Yes.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.835
AUDIENCE: What's your opinion
on games that by structure makes

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:56.550
it easy or hard for the players
who play with a lot of effort,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:33:00.001
like hard work, or play
without a lot of effort?

00:33:04.084 --> 00:33:05.500
SCOTT OSTERWEIL:
You can do a game

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.050
that's all-- requires
nothing but 100% effort.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.887
And in a sense, the play is
who decides to play that game.

00:33:11.887 --> 00:33:13.720
The people who are
willing to put themselves

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.830
through 100% effort all the
time, they voluntarily do that.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.551
And so you've found
your audience.

00:33:19.551 --> 00:33:21.550
I'm not saying you couldn't
do a game like that.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.175
I'm saying that it's likely that
in the course of most people's

00:33:24.175 --> 00:33:28.840
gameplay, they're going to
have this need to-- a game

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.200
where you get on the rails
and the clock is going,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.700
and you guys [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.370
That's why there's
usually plateaus

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.370
of some kind or another.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.550
There's an acknowledgement
that people

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.220
need to stop and take a breath.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.080
Even if it's just a
plateau, a savepoint,

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.650
there's some
acknowledgement of that.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:47.150
I think games where
there's actually

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.660
some combination of really
intense play and more

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.240
relaxed play can sometimes
be more satisfying.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.310
So I'm not saying that a
game can't be all hard--

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.061
or the other side of
it, Farmville clearly

00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.310
was very popular with lots
of people who really wanted

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.610
to do kind of mindless stuff.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.490
I guess we all have
the need sometimes

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.700
for non-taxing-- so there's
nothing wrong with a game which

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.480
requires almost all
in or very little in.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.650
It's just that the
reality is, the player is

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.073
going to move fluidly from
one state to the other.

00:34:17.073 --> 00:34:19.489
And if your game can accommodate
that, so much the better.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],
there's something

00:34:24.476 --> 00:34:27.130
that I want to
comment on [? that. ?]

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:31.679
It is totally possible to
play Farmville extremely

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:32.663
in hard fun, isn't it?

00:34:32.663 --> 00:34:34.631
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah.

00:34:34.631 --> 00:34:37.583
AUDIENCE: I had a
interesting [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:40.781
just playing [? for them ?]
and that required very, very

00:34:40.781 --> 00:34:42.503
precise timing [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:42.503 --> 00:34:43.979
So it is possible [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:43.979 --> 00:34:45.219
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.630
And the point is
that Phillip chose

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:48.919
to make it that kind of game.

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:50.294
And everybody will
choose to make

00:34:50.294 --> 00:34:52.840
it that kind of--
too many games,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.130
I think we freely make
the mistake of imagining

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.315
a certain path for a
player on the win state,

00:34:57.315 --> 00:34:59.250
and we design the game
around that player,

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.240
following the path
to the win state.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.570
And we forget to think
about all of the time

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.520
that players are
likely to spend either

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.520
trying to break the game,
or play in different modes,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.204
or in fail state.

00:35:10.204 --> 00:35:12.370
I mean, one of the things
I encourage students to do

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.786
is make sure that the failure
is the most interesting part

00:35:14.786 --> 00:35:17.490
of your game, because if your
game is at all challenging,

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:21.270
people are going to be spending
a lot of time in failure mode.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.580
A, you want to reward
them and say that's OK.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.565
We're happy to see you here.

00:35:27.565 --> 00:35:29.940
And b, you want to make sure
that it remains entertaining

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.900
while they're in failure
mode so they don't quit.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.900
Like I said, I think
it's an easy mistake

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.170
to fixate on what's the
path to success look

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.710
like, and not think about
what the whole gameplay

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.940
experience is like.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.790
And that gets worse when
people have an agenda,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.200
like a game for the Red Cross.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.470
We really fall into that trap.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.270
And that's why so many
serious games seem

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.030
so serious, and
earnest, and humorless,

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.470
because all the
designer thought about

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.670
was the player earnestly
achieving the goals

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.174
that the designer set
out for the player,

00:36:07.174 --> 00:36:09.090
rather than thinking
about the player playing.

00:36:12.502 --> 00:36:13.418
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:18.358 --> 00:36:20.828
AUDIENCE: I guess this goes
back to your example about golf

00:36:20.828 --> 00:36:24.286
[INAUDIBLE] and not having
somebody yell at you for not

00:36:24.286 --> 00:36:25.587
hitting the ball straight.

00:36:25.587 --> 00:36:27.003
How do you think
that kind of goes

00:36:27.003 --> 00:36:30.708
with the existence
of golf teachers, who

00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:34.166
are paid to essentially tell
you you're doing it wrong?

00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:36.142
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:36.142 --> 00:36:39.140
AUDIENCE: I guess I'm thinking
of my own dad and [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.615
my sister, who have very
different opinions about a golf

00:36:42.615 --> 00:36:44.387
coach telling them
to do it right.

00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:45.970
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: So
the relevant thing

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:48.706
there is that they elected to
have a golf coach tell them

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:51.570
to do that at a certain point in
their-- if you started somebody

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.035
with a golf coach
yelling at them-- now,

00:36:54.035 --> 00:36:57.220
it could be very gentle, loving,
helpful person, in which case

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.230
it might go fine.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.516
But chances are if you started
somebody with someone standing

00:37:01.516 --> 00:37:03.890
over their shoulder telling
them what to do every moment,

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.410
they probably would never
develop a real interest in it.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.820
So the point which you elect
to have somebody there,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.030
you have your reasons now.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.071
You have your motivation.

00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:17.280
And so that's a different
experience at that point.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.190
I think lots of kids
who get turned off

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:23.950
to musical instruments
or sports because too

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:25.900
early in the experience,
they're forced

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.520
into sort of just reproduce the
results that some adult wants

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.860
you to reproduce, rather than
explore this and figure out

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.010
where your motivation is.

00:37:39.851 --> 00:37:41.300
Well, thanks.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.800
But I'm sticking around, so if
you have any other questions,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.247
I'm happy to take them.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.260
PROFESSOR: Another
reason I wanted

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.150
to ask you to come
and talk to class.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.670
So we mentioned a couple of
the other game classes we have

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.150
at MIT that we're teaching.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.910
And you teach 615, the
Games for Social Change?

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.920
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Games
for Social Change, yeah.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.860
PROFESSOR: Next fall, right?

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.840
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah,
that'll be next fall.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.690
PROFESSOR: Can you
say a little bit

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:06.960
about what that class entails?

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.876
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah.

00:38:07.876 --> 00:38:09.050
And Sabrina took it.

00:38:14.345 --> 00:38:18.830
It's sort of taking the same
principles that I was talking

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:23.380
about and using them to
think about if you're

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.900
interested in social change
and how you could use for that,

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.180
understanding that you
can't make people change.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.630
And so the question is,
how can you use play

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.090
to actually encourage change?

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.480
And so probably we're
looking critically

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.680
at how society works.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.504
And the task we're trying this
year for the first time-- well,

00:38:42.504 --> 00:38:44.170
you're doing two big
projects this year.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:55.060
We're just now finishing a
project on the theme of walls

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.680
to go in conjunction with the
25th anniversary of the Berlin

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.620
Wall coming down.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.190
And that's going to be
on display at the Goethe

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.608
Institute, which is
a place in Boston,

00:39:05.608 --> 00:39:07.233
and it may also be
on display in Munich

00:39:07.233 --> 00:39:10.195
at the same time, the games.

00:39:10.195 --> 00:39:11.820
And then we're going
do a project where

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.390
we try to actually
look at some system

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.330
in society, like school,
which is a bad game,

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.420
and try to redesign
it as a good game.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.970
Not make a game about school,
but rather redesign school

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:26.794
itself as if it were a game.

00:39:26.794 --> 00:39:28.210
Every year we try
different stuff.

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.170
The one thing I
like to try to do

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.753
is come up with
projects that actually

00:39:30.753 --> 00:39:33.960
have-- for which you're doing it
with somebody besides just me.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.364
I don't just want students
doing stuff for me.

00:39:36.364 --> 00:39:38.280
I want them doing it for
some bigger audience,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.850
and we try to do
that in every game,

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:40.850
every semester [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:41.290
And that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:41.810
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:42.010
Yeah.

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.820
So if you really
like what you're

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.190
doing right now with the Red
Cross/Red Crescent project,

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.220
and you want do more
of this kind of stuff,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.670
take a look at that in the fall.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.940
And if you're looking
for some help or insight

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.930
about the design of your
project this semester,

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.240
the Games for Social
Change materials

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.870
are on the
OpenCourseWare website.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.340
And we'll post those
readings and materials there

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:03.210
so you can take a look at that.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.918
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: It's
a bit of a seminar,

00:40:04.918 --> 00:40:06.290
so I think there's no lectures.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.540
And so I think there's a lot--

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.200
PROFESSOR: The readings.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.660
SCOTT OSTERWEIL: Yeah.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:09.860
And they're not
always explicitly

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.810
about what we end up
talking about in class.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.910
So I don't promise that
they'll always be helpful.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:16.240
But anyway, they're more
like thought starters

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.525
than [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:17.525 --> 00:40:18.400
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.787
So it's 1:48.

00:40:19.787 --> 00:40:20.870
Take a really quick break.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:25.030
And then set yourself up
into your five groups,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.510
and set up your play test.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.710
We'd like to start
doing play test at 2:00.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.600
So 12 minutes from now,
if that's possible.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.850
Do you think it's enough time?

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.150
So we're about to get started.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.580
How many stations do
you have for testers?

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:43.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
many [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.990
PROFESSOR: How many
are you going to have?

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.890
Three?

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:47.650
All right, three.

00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:53.160
Cool.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.810
If you're not using your
computer to run a game,

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.340
then close it or set it
aside so people know.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.037
How many stations are you
going to have over here?

00:41:03.037 --> 00:41:04.230
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:06.260
PROFESSOR: Two?

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.160
And group behind you,
how many workstations?

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.660
Four?

00:41:15.207 --> 00:41:17.040
How many workstations
are you going to have?

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:17.857
Two?

00:41:17.857 --> 00:41:18.940
And in the back, how many?

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.440
One?

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.310
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:34.280
So basically if you have--
there's one, two, three, four,

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.050
five testers, plus let's
say each team send out

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.510
two people to test other games.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.350
Remember to rotate.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:46.120
We're going to do this
for about 20 minutes,

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.980
as long as it takes.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.807
And then see where we
are and do it again

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.640
to get some just quick
testing and make sure

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.060
that the five of us get to play
a good number of your games

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.320
and give you some
feedback on that.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.230
So remember, if you're using
digital-- if you're not,

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.080
if a computer's not
being used for testing,

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.080
close it or make it look
like it's not being used

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.520
for testing by typing on it.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.650
Let's get started.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.730
Can I get everyone's
attention really quick?

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.620
Can I just get a
really brief report?

00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.520
How many teams-- how many
tests did you guys get?

00:43:04.296 --> 00:43:06.460
AUDIENCE: Two rounds
and three [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.737
PROFESSOR: So you feel like you
did a good amount of testing?

00:43:09.737 --> 00:43:12.070
For the team close up here,
how many rounds did you get?

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.401
How much testing did you get?

00:43:15.401 --> 00:43:19.610
AUDIENCE: We got about
four [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:20.986
PROFESSOR: Four?

00:43:20.986 --> 00:43:22.247
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:22.247 --> 00:43:23.830
PROFESSOR: How many
tests did you get?

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.163
How many people played the game?

00:43:25.163 --> 00:43:25.980
A good number?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.820
AUDIENCE: We had two
who played [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.500
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.891
I'm just trying to get a sense.

00:43:31.891 --> 00:43:34.515
You guys feel like you've got a
good sense of number of people?

00:43:34.515 --> 00:43:37.239
Did you guys get four or five?

00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:39.155
And in the back, how
many players did you get?

00:43:39.155 --> 00:43:41.081
AUDIENCE: We only
had one [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:41.081 --> 00:43:42.330
PROFESSOR: Has it been useful?

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:42.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:43.353
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:50.620
So let's close off
testing for now.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.200
If you'd like to test later
today or later during the class

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.480
period, you can.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.840
Go ahead and finish off whatever
testing you're doing right now.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.320
And at 2:50, we're
going to come down

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.140
and each team's going to give
a brief, two-minute description

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.960
about the state of their game
and your product backlog.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.820
And those are actually
going to get recorded

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.669
so that we can send them to
Pablo and the rest of his team,

00:44:14.669 --> 00:44:16.460
so they can see what
you've been working on

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.240
and give us some
feedback about it.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.150
OK?

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.680
So 2:50.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.650
Everyone set?

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:24.566
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.570
PROFESSOR: So Snap, come on up.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.439
And again, two minutes.

00:44:37.439 --> 00:44:38.480
Talk about your features.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.720
Talk about what's in your game
now, what will be in your game.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.460
Also, give a really brief
description of the topic

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.490
your game's about.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.210
So this is for our clients
to know what we decided

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.050
to do for all of our topics.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.620
AUDIENCE: So we're Snap.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.100
So we've decided to [? return ?]
Snap into a multiplayer game.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.630
So it'll be all everybody
playing at the same time.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:06.310
Right now we have a game that
looks pretty similar to what

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.930
we played in class,
where you can enter words

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:14.490
and you can snap with anybody
else who has played the game.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.342
Right now we don't
have any fiction

00:45:16.342 --> 00:45:18.050
and we don't have any
indication of score

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.175
other than just the number
of times you've snapped.

00:45:20.175 --> 00:45:21.880
We're hoping to change that.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.890
We got a lot of really
good feedback today,

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.720
and we've thought new ideas
for how to convey feedback

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.695
to the player and some
improvements to the UI,

00:45:29.695 --> 00:45:31.070
because right now
we don't really

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.430
express much to the player.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:34.990
That's about it.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.012
PROFESSOR: Any challenges
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:37.012 --> 00:45:38.896
leading up to where you are now?

00:45:38.896 --> 00:45:42.193
Is there anything [INAUDIBLE]
questions [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:42.193 --> 00:45:43.591
risks that you have right now?

00:45:43.591 --> 00:45:46.090
AUDIENCE: So the networking is
still a risk, as we just saw.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.461
It's a lot more confusing
when something doesn't work,

00:45:48.461 --> 00:45:49.335
why it's not working.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.090
We also do want to confirm
that the game that we build

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.860
is similar enough to Snap
in terms of satisfying

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.390
the client's goals.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.050
So we don't want to change the
game, even if it's more fun.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.800
We want to make sure
that the game still

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.780
satisfies the
client's requirements

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.905
and that they'll still be
able to use it and gather

00:46:08.905 --> 00:46:10.490
the information they want to.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.410
And that will require
some careful testing

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.430
to see what people end
up doing with Snap.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.080
PROFESSOR: And what
did you decide on?

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.940
Have you decided on
tech yet, or are you

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.176
still trying out multiple--

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:19.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.010
So I think we have a tech.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.840
So we have a server
running on Node.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.950
And we're going to use
Phaser for the front-end

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.028
so that we can make a
more expressive game.

00:46:30.028 --> 00:46:31.694
For now, we're not
using Phaser, though.

00:46:31.694 --> 00:46:36.350
The current prototype
doesn't use Phaser at all.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.790
AUDIENCE: One thing you asked
earlier was [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:42.539 --> 00:46:43.914
Does that basically
mean that you

00:46:43.914 --> 00:46:46.036
have to run on two
different flight, or--

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:46.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.720
So the idea would
be to experiment

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.820
with what sorts of entire
group visualizations

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.100
would be interesting to
put up for the entire room.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.840
And the back-end team might work
on what sort of visualizations

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.680
we want to show separate
from what we want to export

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.826
at the end of the game.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.394
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
anybody else?

00:47:08.394 --> 00:47:09.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:15.800
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
Cholera is Awesome.

00:47:26.075 --> 00:47:26.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.950
So the current
state of our game,

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:30.869
we spent a lot of time
thinking about design

00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:34.140
and how exactly we
want to do things.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.760
So we're currently
making sort of a game

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.010
where you control--
or don't control.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.090
You take care of a
bunch of villages.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.320
So you see different villages,
how infected they are,

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.153
and how many people are
dying sort of thing,

00:47:45.153 --> 00:47:47.820
and then implement measures
to prevent cholera spreading.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.460
So you give people soap
to wash their hands

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.365
or set restroom facilities,
or use vaccination,

00:47:54.365 --> 00:47:56.050
and that sort of thing.

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.800
And so a lot of the
feedback that we

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.590
got on a lot of questions
that we're facing basically

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.935
revolves around the issue of
making this game realistic

00:48:04.935 --> 00:48:08.660
versus making this game
more fun sort of thing.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.970
So you can make a really
unrealistic game that

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.990
can be tons of fun,
but we also want

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.073
to stick to reality because
at the end of the day,

00:48:16.073 --> 00:48:18.860
we do want to teach the people
that are playing how to prevent

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.320
cholera from spreading.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.740
So there's sort of this
trade-off that we have to make.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.320
And the second trade
off is sort of like you

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:29.370
can make a blantanty educational
game that just throws back

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.578
at you that can sort of be
fun for the first time you

00:48:31.578 --> 00:48:33.578
play it, but doesn't have
a lot of replay value.

00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:36.639
And it's sort of hard to make
a great educational game that

00:48:36.639 --> 00:48:37.930
also has a lot of replay value.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.424
So we're thinking, maybe
consider maybe we don't

00:48:40.424 --> 00:48:41.590
want that much replay value.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:45.120
Maybe this is a game that these
people will play once or twice,

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.620
learn what they need to learn,
and then never play it again.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.559
So it's sort of trade-offs
that we need to think about.

00:48:50.559 --> 00:48:52.934
PROFESSOR: So you're still
working on the paper prototype

00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:53.898
that you need [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:53.898 --> 00:48:54.380
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:54.862
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:54.862 --> 00:48:55.362
Cool.

00:48:55.362 --> 00:48:56.308
Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:56.308 --> 00:48:56.548
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:56.548 --> 00:48:58.381
But we're starting to
build up the back-end.

00:48:58.381 --> 00:49:00.880
And we're going to be using
Phaser to [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:01.986
PROFESSOR: So you've
already [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:01.986 --> 00:49:02.486
OK, cool.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:09.947
Forecast-Based Funding, right?

00:49:09.947 --> 00:49:10.530
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.840
Hi, we're
Forecast-Based Funding.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.930
The general idea
behind our concept

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.960
is that planning
ahead for disasters

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.840
is much better than
trying to react to them.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.615
So if you can have operating
procedures or ways of planning

00:49:26.615 --> 00:49:29.320
for them [INAUDIBLE]
afford that,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.110
you can reduce loss of lives
in the event of disasters.

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:36.240
We are actually
between two prototypes

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.590
right now that we're testing
to try and get at the ideas.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:44.090
The first one is a sort
of higher-level city-based

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:47.910
simulation of a city that's
at risk of disaster, which you

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.035
then have to fortify,
[INAUDIBLE] train volunteers,

00:49:50.035 --> 00:49:53.200
or preparing for
upcoming disasters

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.466
in order to prevent too much
damage from happening to them.

00:49:56.466 --> 00:49:58.590
One of the problems that
we're seeing with the game

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.810
is that's kind of abstract
and not as interactive

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.270
for players to connect with.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.978
But they are getting
a good understanding

00:50:04.978 --> 00:50:07.218
of the idea of planning ahead.

00:50:07.218 --> 00:50:08.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.780
And so to try and
address those issues,

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:11.430
we have a second
prototype right now,

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:16.840
which is about trying
to actually rescue

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.570
people in a flooding city.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.320
And so that hits the other
end of the scale, where

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.200
the player is told ahead
of time this disaster

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.320
was planned for versus this
disaster was not planned for,

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.742
and the appropriate
effects for each.

00:50:31.742 --> 00:50:33.200
And then they have
to rescue people

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:35.320
under those two
different conditions,

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.220
and then they get
to directly compare

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.240
what the experience of
is for acting in one

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.190
circumstance versus the other.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:45.815
AUDIENCE: Over the
next couple of days,

00:50:45.815 --> 00:50:49.235
we'll be looking at what we
learned from both of them

00:50:49.235 --> 00:50:51.560
and trying to either
combine them or pull out

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.182
the parts that we thought were
really useful to [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:56.182 --> 00:50:58.174
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE] on this?

00:50:58.174 --> 00:50:59.170
This was the hard one.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:50:59.668
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:59.668 --> 00:51:00.626
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:02.819 --> 00:51:04.860
AUDIENCE: I think it was
stated a couple of times

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:07.720
that we should be looking at
people that are policymakers

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.987
or donors in the sense of
sort of people who would be

00:51:10.987 --> 00:51:13.970
allocating funds from
governments or non-profits,

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.261
things like that.

00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:17.510
Basically we make it appear
that this type of planning

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.510
ahead is a good idea.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.426
PROFESSOR: And have you
decided on technology yet,

00:51:25.426 --> 00:51:28.077
or are you still pondering it?

00:51:28.077 --> 00:51:29.660
AUDIENCE: We're
probably using Phaser.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.020
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:36.520
Thank you.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.930
Heat Wave.

00:51:48.585 --> 00:51:49.126
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:49.126 --> 00:51:51.430
So as you guys have
all heard, Heat Wave

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.800
is going to be a game
that will hopefully

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.210
be used to help Red Cross
volunteers help people in areas

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.068
that are either
suffering from or about

00:52:00.068 --> 00:52:02.320
to suffer from a heat wave.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.710
So what we did was
we decided we wanted

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.700
to test out a very simple
digital prototype, not

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.890
with the same type action
as our final prototype,

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:16.260
but not in Unity
because having a working

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.051
game in Unity at this
point we didn't think

00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:19.380
is a viable option.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.450
So we made a Python
test base game.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:23.860
And people were
able to choose what

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.430
they were going to do based
on the scenario and the people

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.360
they were interacting with.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.450
And what we really want to
test it was how does this work.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.300
Is playing a good way to learn?

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.490
And if so, how can we make more
learning come out of the fact

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.620
that they're playing a game
and then making these choices.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.740
So what we did was we showed
people, and a lot of times,

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.156
people noticed
right away, well, I

00:52:48.156 --> 00:52:50.590
don't want to sit there
and do nothing, which is

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:52.180
what we wanted them to notice.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:56.110
And oh, this person passed
out even though they were

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:57.613
only outside for three hours.

00:52:57.613 --> 00:52:58.365
Why was that?

00:52:58.365 --> 00:53:00.140
So we did see a lot of that.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.850
But something we didn't
see was people sometimes

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.185
got stuck in a pattern.

00:53:04.185 --> 00:53:06.700
It's just like, well, I'm always
going to do the same thing.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.845
And then they don't
get different results

00:53:07.845 --> 00:53:09.680
and they don't really
learn anything.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.950
So we want to give people more
interesting options and more

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.470
options in our actual game
so that they try more things

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:16.340
and they learn more.

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:18.967
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:20.550
PROFESSOR: So you
already [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:21.945
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:21.945 --> 00:53:23.060
Any other questions?

00:53:25.837 --> 00:53:26.795
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:26.795 --> 00:53:27.288
AUDIENCE: [? Great. ?]

00:53:27.288 --> 00:53:28.274
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:53:31.725 --> 00:53:33.204
[INAUDIBLE] Animal Village.

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:42.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, everybody.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.930
We're saving the Animal Village.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:50.240
Our goal is to empower
around 8 to 13-year-olds

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:56.760
to reach into their
community and learn more

00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.990
about what cholera is,
what its symptoms are,

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.780
and how they would
convince people

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.240
that cholera is actually happen.

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:11.090
Our play tests were focused on
bringing as many minigames as

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.340
possible, and to testing.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.840
So in this case, we
had four minigames.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:20.160
The main feedback we
got on those games

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.774
was that they were far
too easy and simplistic.

00:54:24.774 --> 00:54:28.090
And we agree, it turns out.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:31.280
Our goals moving forward
are to essentially

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.727
improve our game
beyond just reading

00:54:33.727 --> 00:54:37.430
an informational
pamphlet, and to do things

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:43.390
where it requires
actual abstract thought

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:47.530
and in general, more
effort from the player

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.240
to think of the behaviors
and actions they

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.240
need to potentially change or
encourage in their community.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.030
We found a lot of success
with this in our game already

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:01.000
present in the mayor dialogue.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.640
And we hope to branch
that up as moving towards,

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:08.030
we begin to implement
our game in Phaser.

00:55:10.757 --> 00:55:11.340
Any questions?

00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:21.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what's
the upside of having minigames

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:23.722
versus one [? full ?] game?

00:55:23.722 --> 00:55:25.680
AUDIENCE: So our goal
with the united minigames

00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:31.066
is to be able to
drill down and be

00:55:31.066 --> 00:55:33.430
very specific about
which behavior

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.700
we want people to show.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.450
There are approximately
three to four core behaviors

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:43.910
that are very necessary
to prevent cholera.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:48.090
And having one minigame devoted
to each of them in theory

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:56.679
will allows us to focus more
and teach more, as a result.

00:55:56.679 --> 00:56:00.610
AUDIENCE: That's
a good statement.

00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:02.764
Just riffing off something
else that you said.

00:56:02.764 --> 00:56:05.180
I haven't looked that closely
at the cholera documenation.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.590
I'm not so sure if convincing
people that cholera

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.862
is a problem is necessarily
the thing you need to do,

00:56:10.862 --> 00:56:13.320
but convincing people to change
their behavior and whatnot.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.771
AUDIENCE: So not
convincing people cholera

00:56:15.771 --> 00:56:18.477
is a problem because obviously.

00:56:18.477 --> 00:56:21.270
It's convincing people
to report cholera

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:26.605
as it happens instead of waiting
to see if that one isolated

00:56:26.605 --> 00:56:31.880
case of diarrhea is actually a
symptom of an outbreak or just

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.444
someone eating something bad.

00:56:33.444 --> 00:56:34.110
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.290
So one of the things is
like this early alert thing

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.490
OK.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:37.990
Cool.

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.690
All right.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.890
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:40.723
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:56:40.723 --> 00:56:41.740
Thanks.
