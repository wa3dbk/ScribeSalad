00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:22.440
PROFESSOR 1: It's 1:06.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.190
We're going to start
presentations at 1:10.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.004
So Ghost Maze just get started.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:28.920
You don't have to come
down here yet, but just

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.660
make sure you're ready.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.847
So just a brief going over
what we're doing today.

00:00:37.847 --> 00:00:40.430
Presentations, I hear a lot of
really good energy in the room.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.070
So I hope to hear that when
you come down and tell us

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.000
about your games
and all the foibles,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.717
all the things went wrong, all
the things that went right.

00:00:47.717 --> 00:00:49.550
Hopefully this is a
really good prep for you

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.520
for our next
assignment, which is

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.599
going to be much, much longer.

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:55.390
So after we get through
with presentations,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.760
we'll take a brief break.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.600
And then we're going to just
jump right in to project 4.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.404
I'll introduce
project 4 again, going

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:03.570
through all the boring
slides with all the deadlines

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.330
and stuff.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.620
When I get to that, if you
want to fall on Stellar,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.240
I just updated the
project for assignment

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.460
today to make sure that
the deadlines were correct.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.280
And we'll double check
that again as well.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.666
Unfortunately,
Pablo who came to us

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.040
in the beginning
of the semester,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.290
is not here with us in person.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.192
But he will be here
with us on Skype.

00:01:25.192 --> 00:01:26.650
He's in Geneva
right now, but he'll

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.929
be talking to us about what
they're looking for project 4.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.720
In particular, we're
going to be introduced

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
to six different game
topics, game design topics.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.450
And you're going to
choose one of them.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.552
We're not necessarily
making your choice today.

00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:41.010
We're going to
brainstorming today.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.945
We're going to
have people form up

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.820
in a brainstorming groups
around these topics

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.000
to talk about them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.010
And then you will
have over the weekend

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.170
to talk about it on
the mailing list,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.040
to read some of the resources
and some of the materials

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920
we posted to Stellar
to see which topic

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.270
you're most interested in.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.160
We're going to start the day
off Monday with forming teams.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.240
So a little bit longer
time to form teams,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420
bit longer time to really
think about the topic

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.619
and think about what the
project's going to be-- again,

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.160
you have more time to actually
do concepting on this project.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.470
It's an eight week project.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.459
Nine weeks, if you count spring
break, which you shouldn't.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.125
We designed it as an
eight week project.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.590
What's that?

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.000
AUDIENCE: Not spring break?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.958
PROFESSOR 1: I said no.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:30.410
Yeah don't work on spring break.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.450
Like you were going to.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.120
Any quick questions
before we start?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.245
We've got two minutes left.

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:40.720
Any quick questions you
might have about project 3?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.835
About turn ins?

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.245
AUDIENCE: What did you mean
[INAUDIBLE] spring break?

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:49.370
PROFESSOR 1: I said don't
work during spring break.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.850
We designed this as
a eight week project.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.440
Project 4 is an
eight week project.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.010
We've designed it so
that you are not working

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.301
on a project over spring break.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.360
What's that?

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:03.700
You could give me some
details about what

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.850
I'm screwing up over here.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.650
So do we have a fall break?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.230
Don't we have a week long break?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.700
Thanksgiving break?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.822
It's 70 degrees outside.

00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:14.280
I'm in a different
place right now.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.340
All right, I said Ghost
Maze, come on down

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.130
and make sure your
projector, if you're

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.754
going to use a
projector at all, works.

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:28.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.515
PROFESSOR 1: What's that?

00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:31.135
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:31.135 --> 00:03:32.760
PROFESSOR 1: I still
didn't understand.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:37.060
PROFESSOR 1: No, just like 4,
you only need as many people

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.840
as you need to
present to come down.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.529
STUDENT 1: So if you remember,
our game was Ghost Maze.

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.320
And we'll run you
through a quick refresher

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.476
of what the game
actually was first

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.250
so you remember what it is.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.002
STUDENT 2: So here we have
our character in a maze.

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.960
You've just woken up and
you're in a dark maze.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.540
All you have is your lantern.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.400
And so your objective
is to explore the maze,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.680
avoid ghosts, and drop beacons
to help you explore the maze.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.220
And find a key, which will
then unlock and exit for you

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.620
get out the maze.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.280
And so there are
different effects

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.630
that happened during the games,
such as your sanity starts

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.867
decreasing as the games goes on.

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:16.200
And then randomly, as you're
sanity starts getting lower

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.793
and lower, your movement
will get impaired randomly,

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:21.209
and the light will turn red
as you can see in this picture

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.771
here.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:23.270
And then another
interaction that we

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.890
had was when you get
close enough to a ghost,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.654
your sanity start
decreasing faster.

00:04:27.654 --> 00:04:29.070
So the light turns
blue to let you

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.611
know that you're
too close to a ghost

00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.620
and you need to get
away from that ghost.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.120
STUDENT 1: So a few
things that went

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.529
right was that it was hard to
balance everyone's schedules,

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.570
but everyone was pretty
flexible in terms of what

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.820
features they were working on.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.860
So people would adapt
to the features that

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.190
needed to be done at that time.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.360
So flexibility was,
I think, something

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.230
that went more or less
well, in terms of working

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.372
on what needed to be worked on.

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:57.950
The second thing that went
right was user experience.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.820
So we spent a lot of time
focusing on user experience,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.502
and playing with the camera,
playing with shadows,

00:05:03.502 --> 00:05:05.380
playing with the
player movement.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.680
We spend a lot of time
putting in graphics and audio

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.846
so that it seemed a little
more realistic to put you

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:15.100
in the context that you were
in a dark maze and lost.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.601
A few things that went wrong
is we started out using Flixel.

00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:19.850
But it took us a few days
and we still couldn't get up

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.997
a dev environment reading.

00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:22.580
So we decided to
switch over to Unity.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.910
That was a pretty wise choice,
but we made it pretty late.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.060
We found that collaborative
coding on Unity

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.970
was really hard.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.180
Certain changes
to the main scene

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.890
would wouldn't merge well.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.730
So also when we were working
on different branches,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.110
and then tried to merge
it back into master scene,

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.480
people's changes were
lost or overwritten.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.089
So we found that Unity
wasn't great in terms

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.380
of like having a big team
project where a lot of people

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.180
are coding at once.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.170
And sometimes we just
re-applied changes

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.496
on to the master branch.

00:05:56.496 --> 00:05:58.730
Something else was we all
had really busy schedules.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.150
People were out of town.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.205
In town, they could only work on
the project at certain points.

00:06:03.205 --> 00:06:07.450
So I think something that helped
with that was at the beginning,

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.880
we did a pretty good job of
delegating tasks to people who

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.520
work on the project earlier.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.910
But then later on
it, it was pretty

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.160
haphazard in terms of who
is available at one of time.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.510
So maybe re-evaluating
priorities

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.366
as the project went on would've,
I think, really helpful.

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:26.740
STUDENT 2: So
lessons learned, we

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.600
spent a lot of time
working on user experience.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.271
Because we had a 3-D
perspective game,

00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:32.770
there was a lot of
thought that went

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.160
into how the light was
hitting the player, how

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.210
to get the shadows
to cast properly,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.310
how the player knows that
the players in the maze.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.820
And being able to move
around and understand

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.310
how your sanity is decreasing.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.230
We spent a lot of
time testing that.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.640
Working early and
quickly-- this was partly

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.250
hindered because we lost
at least four days of work

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.320
because we were trying
to get Flixel set up.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.631
And then it just didn't work.

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.006
And we had to
switch to Unity, so

00:06:57.006 --> 00:06:59.010
basically starting
over from scratch.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.800
Working early and quickly
is super important

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.000
because we ended
up having to drop

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.280
quite a few features because we
didn't get enough done on time.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.639
And we also learned that working
in 3-D is very, very hard.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.305
We were originally going to do a
2-D game, and then thought, oh,

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:15.630
how hard would it be?

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.970
We have a 2-D game, but let's
just give it a 3-D perspective.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.510
That was not a good idea.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.050
Doing the textures
took a long time.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.440
It ended up looking
really, really nice,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.731
as you can see in the pictures.

00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:27.600
But the time investment
was a huge investment

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.560
that we could have used to put
in some more complex mechanic

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.670
into our game.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.810
And future improvements, team
communication and availability

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.340
is a huge one.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.002
We, as Rachel said, we
had a task assignment

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:40.710
at the beginning.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.210
But then due to
people's schedule,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.835
we didn't really take
that into account

00:07:43.835 --> 00:07:45.360
when we made the
initial task list.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.777
So people ended up having to
pick up other people's tasks.

00:07:47.777 --> 00:07:49.318
And it became very
hard to figure out

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:50.350
who was working on what.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.440
And scheduling meetings
was near impossible.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.660
Getting familiar with the game
engine-- using Unity at first

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.150
was very hard because we
weren't sure how scenes work.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.080
And eventually we
figured out that if we

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.180
make most of the stuff
dynamically generated then

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.120
we can just worry
about the code,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.746
and not have to worry about
all the user interface stuff

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:10.810
that Unity does.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.420
And that would have made our
game develop a lot quicker.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.370
And setting deadlines
was very important.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.740
We had a lot of tasks laid out.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.670
But we didn't set
strict deadlines

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.820
for when we wanted each
task to be assigned,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.700
or when we wanted each
task to be finished.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.240
And that would have
helped push along our game

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.924
and get some of them more
mechanics that we wanted in it.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.732
STUDENT 1: Yeah,
I think something

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:31.855
that a little bit arose
was when we were going

00:08:31.855 --> 00:08:35.289
to plan on doing our testing
session because we should have

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.980
set the internal deadlines to
match the testing sessions so

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.289
that we get as much
feedback as possible.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.570
But that said, we
still got something out

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.130
of the testing sessions.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.532
So that was good.

00:08:46.532 --> 00:08:47.780
I think that's all we have.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.160
STUDENT 2: Yeah, that's it.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.410
STUDENT 1: So I don't know
if you guys have questions.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.290
STUDENT 3: I'm from
team Hardcore Dragon.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.650
And as a refresher,
I mean our game is

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.550
about being a hardcore dragon.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.870
So to us, that meant razing
villages, being chased down

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.410
by knights and accumulating
a horde of gold

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.730
that you have to
protect from looters.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.810
And we all were pretty
excited about this idea.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.530
And that was probably the
best thing about the project,

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.490
as a whole, is it
was a fun idea.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.680
Even when we got bogged down
with work from other classes,

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.700
or something emerged, or
didn't go through correctly,

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.060
or there's was a bug, and
we couldn't understand

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.620
what was happening, it was
still really fun to be like,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.780
OK, I really need to
make this dragon set

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.850
this village on fire.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.870
And I want to do this
because that's awesome.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.330
And another thing that
worked is that we use Gitter,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.995
which integrates with GitHub.

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:59.040
Whenever something is pushed,
it'll show up on to the right

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.010
and you can link to it.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:05.780
And everybody who's on your
project is on the Gitter chat.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.220
So it was easy to
keep track of who

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.880
was working at what time,
who was online at that time,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.660
and who you could ask
for help to let you

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.650
debug whatever was going wrong.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.205
Another thing that
helped was Trello

00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:20.560
is actually really good tool.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.520
The last project, I
personally used Google Docs.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.760
But Trello is much easier
to look at something,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.630
drag it while I'm
doing this right now,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.065
adding yourself to
things, and breaking it

00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:33.040
down to simpler task.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.340
It's all very easy on Trello.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.910
I mean, it's built for this.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.640
So it made long-term goal
planning a lot easier.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.010
And you could see
at this moment who

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.180
was supposed to be doing what.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.220
Unfortunately, the idea was
also a downside to the project

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.370
because it was Hardcore Dragon.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.810
I want to do so many
things with this idea.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.740
When I blow fire
on this thing, I

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.490
want it to turn into
a crumbled building

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.060
and become a pile of flames,
and it'll be awesome.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.310
That's not necessarily at
the top of the feature list,

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.100
obviously, because we
have other mechanics that

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.460
are more important than that.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.380
But we kept coming up with
these little additions that

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.940
would make the game a
lot more cool or awesome,

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.120
but are hard to prioritize
and just way too much

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.060
to stack on top of the game.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.800
So that was the downside.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.210
And it was just hard to
control-- it was hard to scope

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.720
the game down to the five
minutes game we needed

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.710
to create for the project.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.560
Gitter was good with
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.540
If everybody was on and
everybody used it all the time,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.810
it would be ideal.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.620
But since a lot of us are on the
go and working on other things,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.620
in classes while people are
working, using something else

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.560
might have been better, like
g-chat or Facebook, something

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.140
you can access
from a smartphone,

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.890
or something more instantaneous.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.887
We would just get-- if you
weren't on Gitter at the time,

00:12:05.887 --> 00:12:07.720
it would send you a
notification being like,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.350
you missed these messages.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.240
Which is almost as delayed
a message as email.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.804
So it was kind of pointless
other than the fact

00:12:15.804 --> 00:12:17.220
that it was
integrated with GitHub

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.986
and you could see who was
online at the same time as you.

00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:22.360
Another thing that
didn't work is

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.560
that meetings are really,
really hard to coordinate

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.290
with seven people.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:32.880
And what ended up happening
was that we would all be like,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.330
OK, so half of us are
free this day, six of us

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.350
are free this other time.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.560
Let's meet then.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.390
And then we wouldn't
decide a specific time

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.440
within the time
were free to meet.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.730
And then by the time we noticed
this, ti would like that day.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.500
And it was just hard to
coordinate everything

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.630
after it got to that point.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.230
So for the future,
I believe we would

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.850
have to have a fully
dedicated scrum master.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.600
And I really mean
fully dedicated,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.750
not scrum master AKA
programmer on the side,

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.917
or scrum master who also gets
music done and play tests,

00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:10.000
well it does play testing.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.660
Everybody play tests, but a
fully dedicated scrum master

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.000
to make sure that
everybody's on tasks,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.990
that the meetings
will get scheduled,

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.990
and that the tasks
are prioritized.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.590
And if something falls through,
they're the person to talk to,

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.100
they're the person who's going
to make you stop freaking out

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.380
that this task took
like three times as long

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.060
as you've estimated it for.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.710
We didn't have this one
person dedicated to that.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:38.600
Everybody was like a jack
of all trades in our group.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.930
So not having that
one person to talk to,

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:47.360
go to, made task
prioritization really fuzzy,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.880
and made everything kind of
come together really late.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.294
And it was hard to
hold people accountable

00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:54.960
because there wasn't
that one person who

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.346
was on top of everybody.

00:13:57.346 --> 00:13:59.750
Another thing we
had to do earlier

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.940
would be feature cutting.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.680
Because if you don't cut
features definitively earlier,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.770
you'll still have it lingering
on some people's minds.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.770
Oh, I have to do this
so that in the future

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.860
we're going to maybe
use this feature.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.760
But if you cut these
features early,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:20.370
you limit the propensity to
have bugs, or stuff like that.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.750
While it's unfortunate that
you have to cut features,

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.270
it's necessary.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.320
So doing it earlier is
the best time to do it.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.200
Another thing is,
like I said before,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.710
a native messaging system.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.680
Gitter was cute but didn't
actually work in the way

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.990
that we wanted it to work.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.840
It wasn't instantaneous
between all members.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.570
It's hard to find a messaging
system that everybody likes.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.140
But I think something like
G-chat or Facebook messaging,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.310
something instantaneous
like that that most people

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.157
use already should
be used as a group

00:14:57.157 --> 00:14:58.865
so that everybody can
be on the same page

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:03.860
and have access to
the instant messaging.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.490
Yeah, our game is there
if you want to play it.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.180
Anybody have questions?

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.679
PROFESSOR 1: So if you were to
do the feature cutting early,

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:20.762
did you feel like you had
the information in order

00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:21.304
to do that?

00:15:21.304 --> 00:15:22.720
STUDENT 3: So there
was some stuff

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.600
that like after even
half the halfway point,

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.920
that we could've cut features.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.294
But instead of
the halfway point,

00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:35.540
we did like two days ago,
which is too late already.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.520
So even earlier than that.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.370
It doesn't have to be like
day one feature cutting.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.170
Just at maybe points
throughout, be

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:48.120
like, now that I'm here, what
features look like they're not

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.650
going to get through.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.350
And with a dedicated
scrum master,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.050
who's like looking
through, looking at people

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.650
and how they're struggling
with certain tasks,

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.720
maybe people don't know exactly
what their pace is internally.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.160
But from an outside
perspective, a scrum master

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160
might be able to more accurately
help with estimates and stuff

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:08.890
like that.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:11.110
So a dedicated
scrum master would

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.647
help with early feature
cutting as well, probably.

00:16:13.647 --> 00:16:15.480
PROFESSOR 1: This is a
Unity project, right?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.855
STUDENT 3: Yeah,
a Unity project.

00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:18.530
Yeah, sorry.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.340
We actually didn't
have that many problems

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.860
with merging because we had,
I think, at least one of us

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.700
was really experienced with
Unity, so that's was lucky,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.200
I guess.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.136
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:16:32.136 --> 00:16:32.628
Thank you.

00:16:32.628 --> 00:16:33.711
STUDENT 3: You're welcome.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.000
STUDENT 4: So our team
is MIT Simulator 2014.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.130
So our basic concept was
you play as a certain dean

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.230
of MIT you may all know.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.150
And you're making
decisions that trade off

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.040
between the endowment, wealthy
donors, and student approval.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.470
And the basic goal
of the game is

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.380
to try and survive as long as
possible, while shitty things

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.370
happen to the institute.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.057
So what went right
in our project?

00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:06.640
I think what went
right in our project

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.729
is we connected
with our audience.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.980
A lot of MIT students know
what it's like to be at MIT,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.150
and they know the
setting, they knew

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.240
the administrator We're
not really pointing at,

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.390
but we kind of are.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.770
And so a lot of people connected
very well with our game.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:32.480
And so they enjoyed it and were
able to understand it easily

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.530
in their own terms.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:40.470
So the second thing that went
well is that humor works.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.480
A lot of our things in our game
were like kind of unpolished,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.510
and kind of like
slapped together.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.440
But because we had taken
the time to make them funny

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.640
and make them
entertaining, people we're

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.550
OK with losing all their
money in one turn [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.620
Because, hey, the
description of it was funny.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.140
And so the third thing that
well is that simple is OK.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.630
We ended up having like
very few core mechanics.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.690
But then because of
the setting that we had

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.170
and because people connected
well with our game,

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.214
I think people are
still able to get--

00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:21.380
we think people were still
able to get enjoyment out

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.330
of the game because of those.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.890
So now what went wrong?

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.870
So first, Hex Flixel,
AKA what do you mean it's

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.600
not on Stack Overflow?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.130
So Hex Flixel, while it did
play well with version control

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.360
and I heard some horror stories
about Unity version control,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.790
Hex Flixel played pretty
well with version control.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.910
But if you ever
had an issue, you

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:49.590
were pretty much out of luck.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:56.260
You could search on Google, and
you'd get like zero results.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.750
Sometimes the official
documentation wouldn't even

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.590
turn up on a Google
search result.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:05.720
So documentation was
a little bit lacking.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.470
I think the second thing
that we could have improve on

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.500
is that paperwork
is not management.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.220
I think in the
class in particular,

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.830
this isn't emphasized
enough, is that you

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.050
can do all these agile
development methods,

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.610
like you can have a sprint
task list and everything.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.160
But unless if you actually
have people who are actively

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.430
taking charge and
managing a project,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:33.860
I think stuff still
won't get done.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.470
I think that's something
that could be improved

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.260
in the future in this class is
like spend less time worrying

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.410
about paperwork, spend
more time actually

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:46.490
like teaching about how to
handle personal situations.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.950
Like what happens if
someone doesn't have time.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.080
Or what happens if
somebody like does this?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.790
And so learning those managerial
skills isn't a trivial task.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.840
And I think in the
beginning, we underestimated

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.960
how much those issues would
be a roadblock to progress.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.480
And then the third thing
that went wrong I guess

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.480
is that responsibility
is shared.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.990
So even if somebody has
a role assigned to them,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.430
we should all still
like take the time

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.490
to make sure that like everybody
is completing their role.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.460
So just making sure that people
are checking other people,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.980
to make sure tasks don't
fall between the cracks.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.240
And so overall people
do like the idea

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.490
of playing as a
certain dean of MIT.

00:20:44.633 --> 00:20:47.048
Any questions?

00:20:47.048 --> 00:20:49.738
PROFESSOR 1: So what
would you do different?

00:20:49.738 --> 00:20:53.224
Not necessarily things about
the Hex Flixel, [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.430
But when it comes
to your management,

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.605
managing stuff we talked
about, what would you

00:21:01.605 --> 00:21:05.669
want to do different, or what
[INAUDIBLE] particular problems

00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:06.210
that you had.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.376
And you know you're going
to have a feature that you

00:21:08.376 --> 00:21:09.560
need to have scrappings for?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.935
STUDENT 4: I think one thing
that we would do differently

00:21:11.935 --> 00:21:17.770
is like take project management
more as like a people problem

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.280
then like a paperwork problem.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.490
Because I think
like we kind of just

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.880
assume that by filling
in the sprint tasks list

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.900
and by writing git
commit logs, we magically

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.550
work together as a team.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.830
But I think in the future,
just taking a more active role

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.960
in insuring that people are
interacting with each other

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.745
and communicating.

00:21:43.863 --> 00:21:46.363
PROFESSOR 1: How about if I'm
[INAUDIBLE] the responsibility

00:21:46.363 --> 00:21:48.536
of sharing things,
like how would you

00:21:48.536 --> 00:21:51.680
address that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.080
STUDENT 4: I think for the
responsibility being shared

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.760
thing, I guess this
was just in reference

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.740
to a few particular
instances where

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.970
like we had someone
who would claim

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.760
that they would do something.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.200
And then because we
assumed oh, because they

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.475
claim that they would do
it, that it would get done.

00:22:10.475 --> 00:22:14.790
But I think sometimes
we got too complacent

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:21.830
and then thought that it would
actually get done anyways.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.970
But I feel in the future
maybe just sending out

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.010
a couple more emails,
just having people confirm

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.960
that they've finished things,
require that people send out

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.710
emails confirming when
they finish things,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.641
so we know that this thing
didn't get submitted yet.

00:22:37.641 --> 00:22:39.890
Oh, shoot class is in an
hour, or something like that.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.820
So just like encouraging
people to either like

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.380
poke each other
more, and also to be

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.390
more responsible about like
when you submit something.

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.380
Or when you do
something important,

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.570
you email out to
everyone just to show

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.045
that you've done the work.

00:22:59.045 --> 00:23:01.025
PROFESSOR 3: Would
email be primary means

00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:03.005
of communicating
between the team

00:23:03.005 --> 00:23:05.975
or was there face to face
meetings outside of class,

00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:08.580
or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.220
STUDENT 4: So email was our
primary means of communicating.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.090
We had one face to face
meeting outside of class.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.780
And then there was
another one that

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.550
was supposed to be scheduled
over the long weekend,

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:29.987
but things happened.

00:23:29.987 --> 00:23:31.820
One or two people were
gone for the weekend,

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.944
and then things fell apart.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:37.740
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:43.993
Thanks.

00:23:43.993 --> 00:23:47.740
STUDENT 5: This Is our
game Build a Spaceship.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.750
It looks like this.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.820
You have your ship with
a set of components

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.950
of a bunch of components
that you can add to the ship.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.300
You click and drag
them onto the ship.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.265
And then you send
it out on a mission.

00:23:59.265 --> 00:24:00.640
After you go out
on that mission,

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.223
you'll get a log
that looks like this.

00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:04.780
All this text is really
small, so you can't see it.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.640
But it says things like, you met
some bandits, you had a battle,

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.380
you won and earned
this much money.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.430
Or you got hit by asteroids
and lost this much health.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.826
And the point is that after
you design your space ship

00:24:15.826 --> 00:24:17.450
and sent it out on
this mission, you'll

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.824
get all this
feedback telling you

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:21.410
how you ship did so that you
can then update your ship

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.220
and send it out again, and
hopefully make even more money.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.700
The goal of the game is to
complete a series of missions

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.500
that we have in
the game currently,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.030
and make as much money as
you can while doing it.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.560
Of course given more
time, we would do things

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.710
like add more components,
upgrading your ship,

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.500
and other tweaks like that.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.200
But this is the core
of the game right here.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.010
So what went right on our game?

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.970
We made a prototype really
early, which was great.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.070
That helped us all
get on the same page

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.300
and understand what
we're talking about when

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.572
we're talking about the game.

00:24:55.572 --> 00:24:57.030
There's was point
before that where

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.988
we had all these cool
ideas from brainstorming,

00:24:58.988 --> 00:25:02.020
and a vague idea, a
personal idea, really,

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.470
of what the game would be.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.210
And that made it really
difficult to communicate.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.480
So once we had that
down, everything just

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.470
became way easier.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.750
We did a lot of UI testing.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.136
Even before we were sure about
the game would specifically be,

00:25:16.136 --> 00:25:18.260
we knew that was going to
involve adding components

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.220
to a ship.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.680
And so we knew we could UI test
that and see how people manage

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.420
with different ways of adding
those kind of components,

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.680
or customizing their ship.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.300
Hex Flixel, we found it really
simple to work with actually.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.320
And whenever we needed
to add more screens

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.800
or make changes the
game, we all had

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.540
a pretty intuitive understanding
of how that would go.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.580
That might also be an
artifact of coming over

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.110
from Phaser, which is
very similarly structured.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.860
And on our team, we got
lucky because everybody

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.380
had coding experience.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.700
And it made it a lot
easier because we were all

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.560
speaking the same language.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.530
And so on a time constraint
project like this,

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.287
it meant that when we talked,
we were more efficient about it.

00:26:02.287 --> 00:26:04.370
That's not to say that
there is a place for people

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.390
who don't have coding
experience on these teams.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:08.973
It's just that when we only have
two weeks to get things done,

00:26:08.973 --> 00:26:12.570
the speed was a huge help.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:15.350
What went wrong was
communicating our progress

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.360
on the game.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.890
We had a lot of problems
where we wouldn't

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.200
talk about what was that done.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.866
We didn't know what
was even in the game

00:26:22.866 --> 00:26:24.506
because somethings
weren't clear yet.

00:26:24.506 --> 00:26:26.130
Like there was one
part where we didn't

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.879
know that we could
actually add components

00:26:27.879 --> 00:26:30.880
to ship because somebody had
added that in but not actually

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.970
told us.

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.990
And the UI wasn't there yet
to actually make it clear.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.560
We also run into problems
with heroic efforts

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.440
where the night before
something was due,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.360
somebody would like to come
in and put in all this effort.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.322
And we didn't know
what they were doing,

00:26:46.322 --> 00:26:47.780
and we didn't know
what was getting

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.402
done because we just weren't
communicating about that.

00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:52.860
A problem that's
related to this is

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.850
that we didn't assigned
tasks well or take ownership

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.510
of what we were doing, or assign
responsibility between people.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.010
And so we ran into
problems where things just

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.380
wouldn't happen for a
long spurts of time.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.070
And then we'd run
into the heroic effort

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.280
problem at the end where
we're all jumping in

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.880
to make things happen.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.880
We also ran into problems
where sometimes people

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.556
didn't push commit
for an entire day

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:17.430
and we had no idea what
the state of the game

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.400
actually wa So what
we learned from this,

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.100
and what we would do
differently next time

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.590
is first we'd keep
track of our progress

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.140
and make sure that
it's contiguous,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.160
whether it's using Trello,
or emails, or any other sort

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.410
of solution for it,
it would be really

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.300
important to make sure we all
know what the state game is,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.130
and what's being worked on.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.990
We should come up with standards
for how we're going to email

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.790
and meet.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.960
We talked about this, and
said it would be a good idea,

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.770
but then we didn't
actually do it.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.250
So it would be good to have a
schedule of when your team is

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.787
going to meet, how
they're going to email

00:27:52.787 --> 00:27:55.370
and why they're going to email,
if it's a daily update of what

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.130
you're doing, or if it's
every time you push a commit.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.320
And also coming up
with standards for how

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.380
you're going to Git.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.840
Are you going to use feature
branches, and all these kind

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.070
of things, or are you going
to do it all on master?

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.640
And are you going to push every
time you make a new commit?

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.780
Or are we going to push
at a set time every day

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.781
so that we can track
it all at once?

00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:17.530
If would be good to
know who's doing what.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.530
That comes in with the idea
of communication and tracking

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.180
progress.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.650
What we did at first was
we had specific domains

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:25.880
that people were working on.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.950
Jeremy was working
on the UI, Rodrigo

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.460
was working on the ship model.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:34.826
And this made it really
easy to assign tasks

00:28:34.826 --> 00:28:36.200
and to make sure
that things were

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.870
getting done in the beginning.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.232
But then in the end, when
we had some tasks that

00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:42.440
were kind of in the middle
and we didn't specifically

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.470
say what was going to
happen, we ended up

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.030
with this last minute scramble
of, OK, I'll take this thing.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.280
Actually I'll take this thing.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.560
Somebody else is coming in.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.390
And it made a lot more
difficult to track

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.660
what was actually getting done.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.600
You can also give
tasks to people.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.765
We were kind of reluctant
to do that at first.

00:29:00.765 --> 00:29:02.640
But we got better and
it, and it was actually

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.300
super helpful to just be
like, hey, you take this.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.140
And then it's completely
clear what happening.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.470
And the very last
thing to do with this

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.054
is to just ask what's happening.

00:29:13.054 --> 00:29:15.257
It's good to get some
reassurance that something

00:29:15.257 --> 00:29:17.840
actually is happening if you're
not hearing anything about it.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.250
So you can just ask someone.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.680
Hey, what are you working on?

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.014
Or hey, is anybody working on
making this component up here?

00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:27.180
Then you just get an answer.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:30.560
And you get a lot of
peace of mind from that.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.140
It's good to set up specific
times to work together.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:38.110
We didn't do this enough, but it
would've been great if we had.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.950
And like I said, we made a
prototype pretty early on.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.950
But I think we could have
made one even earlier.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.840
We found that it didn't limit
our creativity or our ability

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:47.810
to talk about the game.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.790
Instead it just gave us a
platform to work off of.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.350
So we could build
a basic prototype

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.510
with some idea of
a core mechanic,

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.330
and then continue to brainstorm
and expand from there.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.882
And that's basically what
we learned from this game.

00:30:04.882 --> 00:30:06.590
And moving forward,
we're looking forward

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:10.032
to implementing
this on project 4.

00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:10.615
Any questions?

00:30:13.806 --> 00:30:16.236
AUDIENCE: The site's solving
problems with HaxeFlixel

00:30:16.236 --> 00:30:19.152
all on your own, did you
find any online resources

00:30:19.152 --> 00:30:20.610
that turned out to be helpful?

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:24.030
Or did you just [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.120
STUDENT 5: The main problem
that we ran into with HaxeFlixel

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.410
was we were trying
to build an HTML5,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.340
and the text just
wasn't working.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.230
And we found nothing about it.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.370
We found one page by
HaxeFlixel that said,

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.400
sometimes we have
problems with text.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.760
Try doing this.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.880
That didn't work.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.190
And nobody else has
an answer for it.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.260
I don't know if
anybody else did.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.980
AUDIENCE: Basically you have to
read the Flixel documentation

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.390
and ignore the
HaxeFlixel documentation.

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.040
[INAUDIBLE] identical
and the static typing

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.630
does save you a little bit.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.400
And you have to jump into
the source occasionally.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.129
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:31:07.129 --> 00:31:08.170
STUDENT 5: Anything else?

00:31:10.622 --> 00:31:11.330
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.991
STUDENT 6: So we did
Looking for Deena.

00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:19.490
And we have some screenshots
of the games in case any of you

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.100
didn't get to play it or see it.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.150
So it's just a search screen.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.990
The first thing-- so the
game is kind of in two--

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.490
you have to do two
different things.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.060
The first thing you do is you
choose which planet you're

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.685
going to go to.

00:31:32.685 --> 00:31:35.240
And you can't really read it,
but they all different distance

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.900
stats as well as stat games
that each planet will give you.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.350
Then you have to navigate
through an asteroid fields,

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.600
which depending on how far
along you are in the game,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.940
makes it harder as you go along.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.780
But hopefully you
have those stat games

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:52.800
that should make it easier
to actually go through it.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.820
You're looking for Deena.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.340
And you can lose and win.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.380
So what was right
and what was wrong

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.820
is we did communicate a lot.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.960
And by a lot, I mean from
midnight to like this class,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.632
there's 108 emails.

00:32:07.632 --> 00:32:09.500
And that was just today.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.190
So we communicated a lot.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.686
But we didn't communicate
really effectively.

00:32:13.686 --> 00:32:15.310
There were a lot of
people saying like,

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.670
this what I'm doing,
this is what I'm doing,

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.355
this is what I'm
doing, this is done.

00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:19.540
I submitted this.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.910
But then going through those
hundreds of emails trying

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:23.451
to figure out, oh
wait, who said they

00:32:23.451 --> 00:32:28.030
were doing this, who said this
was submitted, was really hard.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.600
And so we didn't have
those daily scrum meetings

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.540
that we talked about.

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.450
And I'm realizing those would be
really useful to have somebody

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.550
say like,

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.440
OK, this is what
everybody's done.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.150
This is what
everybody's going to do.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.620
This is what we've submitted.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.150
Having that one thing somewhere
where everyone can view it

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.200
easily would make
it a lot easier

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.560
than trying to go through email
and figuring out who did what

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.374
and what went wrong.

00:32:54.374 --> 00:32:56.790
One other thing we did right
was we went in smaller group.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.800
So people were working on the
design, just those people met.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.190
And then people working on
the code, just those people

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.860
met, which was really
useful for trying to meet.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.690
Instead of having
seven people meet,

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.170
you only had like three or four.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.060
And so much easier to
arrange those meetings.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.560
We really divided the
tasks effectively.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.160
Everybody was doing something.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.915
And that's what
the last point is.

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:22.950
Everybody tried to make
sure they were always

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.950
doing something and
contributing to the project.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.170
No one was just sitting there
wondering, what do I do.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.775
Everyone tried to constantly
be doing something.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.510
Another thing that went wrong
is that we worked in bursts.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.620
People were really busy.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.970
And then the night before we
assigned an internal deadline,

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.620
everyone's was like, oh OK,
let's work on this right now.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.220
And so then it was just
people staying up all night

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.630
to try to finish something.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.750
Which things got done,
but sometimes it's like,

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.670
did we do this the
best way we could.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.765
Was everything optimized?

00:33:58.765 --> 00:34:01.560
And we weren't really
sure because everything

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.390
was done in short
bursts, instead of

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:06.125
like a little bit of every day.

00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:08.550
And do you guys want
to talk about Unity?

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.350
STUDENT 7: Yeah.

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.916
As people have said, Unity is
annoying because it has all

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:14.980
these binary files
that you cannot merge.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.030
So if two people were-- we had
to basically always keep track

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.279
of, I'm working on this scene.

00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:20.500
No one else touch it.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.997
Because if two
people work on it,

00:34:21.997 --> 00:34:23.455
someone is going
to lose everything

00:34:23.455 --> 00:34:25.969
in it, which is really annoying.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.040
Emails worked for that.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.764
And so that way you could say, I
finished working on this scene.

00:34:30.764 --> 00:34:32.014
Someone else can touch it now.

00:34:32.014 --> 00:34:33.249
So that was sort of helpful.

00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:40.704
STUDENT 8: [INAUDIBLE]
spits up like five of them.

00:34:40.704 --> 00:34:42.195
And you're like,
I think it's fine.

00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:43.189
But sometimes a
conflict happens.

00:34:43.189 --> 00:34:45.314
And you're like, I don't
know what to do with this.

00:34:45.314 --> 00:34:47.165
I think I can check all of them.

00:34:47.165 --> 00:34:50.147
But then things break
and you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:50.147 --> 00:34:52.023
I feel like that scheme
is weird in the scene

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:54.563
because at least we tell each
other, stop touching the thing,

00:34:54.563 --> 00:34:55.614
or touching the thing.

00:34:55.614 --> 00:34:57.780
But something you touch the
thing and something else

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.596
happens entirely.

00:34:58.596 --> 00:34:59.590
And you're like, OK.

00:35:00.584 --> 00:35:02.150
STUDENT 7: I also
want to point out

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.680
how impossible it is to schedule
anything for seven people.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.670
We wanted to meet
on the weekend.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.850
And there was literally
not a single period

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.290
of time, not one hour that
wasn't at 3:00 of 4:00

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.100
in the morning where
everyone was asleep.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.040
It was impossible.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.311
It was insane.

00:35:17.311 --> 00:35:19.335
STUDENT 6: Yeah,
schedules are hard.

00:35:19.335 --> 00:35:20.293
STUDENT 8: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:26.257
STUDENT 6: Any questions?

00:35:26.257 --> 00:35:29.239
AUDIENCE: You have two points
about [INAUDIBLE] items up

00:35:29.239 --> 00:35:31.724
that appear to [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:31.724 --> 00:35:34.039
STUDENT 6: So we did
keep to deadlines.

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:35.830
So what I was trying
to say with that point

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:37.788
is that we did kind of
keep the deadlines where

00:35:37.788 --> 00:35:41.230
we worked in those bursts
to get to the deadline.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.000
But then because it was such a
long burst, by the end everyone

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.640
was drained.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.430
And if it was
like, I'll do this,

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.010
and this other
little small thing,

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.900
a lot of little small
things didn't get done.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.230
And so things were kind
of push back a little bit.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.470
And so this led to more bursts.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.550
And it was a really
bad cycle that I

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.784
think ended up happening.

00:36:06.172 --> 00:36:08.380
AUDIENCE: Do you think if
you planned for the bursts,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.810
it would be better?

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.030
If you actually scheduled
meetings at 3:00 before?

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.810
STUDENT 7: So I think
we need more granularity

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:22.760
in the deadlines.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.980
So we'd say, let's
get this bucket

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.900
of things done by this day.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.530
And that would--
people procrastinate.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:31.801
We have other work to do.

00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:35.073
Well, I have this other
deadline for this other class

00:36:35.073 --> 00:36:38.576
is due first, and leave
everything for this till later,

00:36:38.576 --> 00:36:40.450
until you're finished
with every other class.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:44.730
So if you leave smaller
tasks, more spread out

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.059
throughout the week, I think
that would enforce a more,

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:50.350
I'll work a little bit today
and a little bit tomorrow,

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.516
as opposed to I'll work a whole
time two days from today, which

00:36:53.516 --> 00:36:55.130
is what ended up happening.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.630
STUDENT 9: We also didn't have
that [INAUDIBLE] scrum master

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.534
or project manager who would
reinforce those deadlines

00:37:00.534 --> 00:37:03.147
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:03.147 --> 00:37:04.980
STUDENT 6: Yeah, you
would just get an email

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.646
saying I have something
due at midnight.

00:37:06.646 --> 00:37:08.650
I'll start working on
this after midnight.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.160
So a lot of times that would
happen, and things like got

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.400
pushed back because that
person didn't get that done.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.937
And so you kind of have to wait.

00:37:15.937 --> 00:37:17.520
STUDENT 7: But I
think we got it done.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.500
STUDENT 6: But
everything got done.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.970
STUDENT 8: It's very cute.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.400
I feel like that's
what [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.664
PROFESSOR 2: [INAUDIBLE]
you can [INAUDIBLE] a lot

00:37:25.664 --> 00:37:26.830
if it wasn't well organized.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.829
Do you have any thoughts
on how you might better

00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:33.200
organize your communications
on the project?

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.140
How do still have that good
level of communication,

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.400
but have it be
something [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.275
STUDENT 7: So I think
a big problem we had is

00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:45.010
we had just one
enormous email thread,

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.440
which became huge and monolithic
and impossible to look through

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.520
after a certain point.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.710
I think it would have
more helpful to break up

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.280
into smaller email threads.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.446
So like people that were working
on a specific feature in code,

00:37:56.446 --> 00:37:58.404
not everyone needs to
receive all those emails.

00:37:58.404 --> 00:38:01.580
So it would have been, I think,
really helpful for the future

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.756
to maybe organize it in the
send that if me and Jenny are

00:38:04.756 --> 00:38:06.880
working on something, we
email each other a lot.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.240
And at the end of the
day, we send one email.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.281
Here are the details that
everyone needs to know.

00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:13.016
You don't need to
receive the 10,000

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:15.250
emails we sent before that.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.850
So I have to say, keep
everyone in the loop.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.650
Don't leave people
out of the loop.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.958
But keep little pockets
of communication

00:38:21.958 --> 00:38:23.889
so everyone's not flooded
with all this stuff.

00:38:23.889 --> 00:38:26.180
STUDENT 6: And even having
the designated scrum master,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.290
I think, would help
with that a lot.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:30.650
Because then it's not
even they're sending it

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.460
out to the group email thread.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.920
They're sending it to the scrum
master and the scrum master

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.380
makes one thing.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.170
It would be really tiresome
to do that every day though.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.850
So maybe every other
day or something.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.430
I'm not really sure
how to break that up.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.190
Because it seems
like you'll just

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.610
end up having a lot of
things, like a lot of reports.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.456
Report this was done this day,
this was done on this day.

00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:55.718
PROFESSOR 2: Did you
[INAUDIBLE] place to track where

00:38:55.718 --> 00:38:57.590
what tasks were
done [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.184
STUDENT 6: We had the Google
Doc with the change log.

00:39:01.184 --> 00:39:02.684
PROFESSOR 2: You
did the change log.

00:39:02.684 --> 00:39:05.540
But were people updating,
changing, task lists

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.444
or anything like that?

00:39:07.444 --> 00:39:09.348
STUDENT 7: I think
that was mostly done in

00:39:09.348 --> 00:39:12.430
like-- so we'd say, these are
the sets of tasks that we want

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.780
to finish today, or something.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.340
And then I, for example,
I'm going to work on this.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:17.840
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.580
I'm going to work on this scene.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.270
No one touch it.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.704
OK, I'm done working
on the scene.

00:39:20.704 --> 00:39:23.250
And then once everyone finished
working on all the scenes,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:26.550
then we'd go back [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.530
STUDENT 8: It does
feel like we probably

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.071
could have done some weird joint
thing where the sprint tasks

00:39:31.071 --> 00:39:33.975
list keep track
of bigger things.

00:39:33.975 --> 00:39:37.192
And then we have some kind
of chat email system going

00:39:37.192 --> 00:39:39.915
on where we should
stay in contact,

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:41.895
especially with [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:41.895 --> 00:39:46.350
At the same time, it's
a little bit like , hm,

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:53.775
what level of tasks, size,
goes into the sprint task list?

00:39:53.775 --> 00:39:56.415
Because [INAUDIBLE] something
really small, it's like yeah,

00:39:56.415 --> 00:39:58.725
this is what we spent
the last two hours doing.

00:39:58.725 --> 00:40:01.706
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:01.706 --> 00:40:04.626
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:04.626 --> 00:40:06.626
STUDENT 8: [INAUDIBLE]
task [INAUDIBLE] is hard.

00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:08.594
AUDIENCE: But what
really [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:11.054
That's what, if
you can figure out

00:40:11.054 --> 00:40:14.006
a way to have something
[INAUDIBLE], whether it's just

00:40:14.006 --> 00:40:16.958
a list [INAUDIBLE] where you can
say, hey, I finished this task,

00:40:16.958 --> 00:40:19.418
can sum it up [INAUDIBLE]
task was based on that.

00:40:19.418 --> 00:40:22.370
Or if you can go to [INAUDIBLE]
troubleshooting or something.

00:40:27.441 --> 00:40:28.274
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:31.366 --> 00:40:31.991
STUDENT 10: Hi.

00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:33.900
So I'm going to be
talking about Score High.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.670
This is actually
our start screen.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.945
So just in case you don't
remember what Score High is,

00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:42.175
it was a game where you
played as an MIT student.

00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:43.970
You went around to
different buildings,

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:47.740
did your homework assignments,
ate, slept, and basically

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.025
just tried to survive school.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.610
So I'm going to start off by
talking about what went poorly.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:59.900
And the first thing we had
an issue with was direction.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.620
So this time, we didn't
have a paper prototype.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.030
We had an idea that
we wanted to do.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.180
But it ended up changing a
lot right from the start.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.480
And it became really
difficult to stay on topic

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.470
because we didn't really
know what we were doing.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.170
And very much related to that,
we then had issues with scope.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.320
We started off with a
lot of unrelated features

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.730
and a lot of components.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.340
And even now in our final game,
there are a lot of components

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.960
and the way they interact
is complicated sometimes.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.860
And then finally, I think every
single team has mentioned this,

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.980
just planning ahead, and
getting work done earlier,

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.930
and planning time to work
together-- the issues we had

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.200
especially that came up
later were a lot of issues

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.490
with midterms,
things going wrong,

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.310
everything that could go
wrong kind of went wrong.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.710
And if we had
started earlier, we

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.240
wouldn't have
had-- we would have

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.760
been able to deal with
those situations better.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.210
So based on that, what was well?

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.740
Well, the great
thing is that we did

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.160
start right away just setting
up everything we needed to work.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.410
We set up our email thread,
our Google Drive folder.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.370
We decided on Unity
first meeting,

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.120
and we set up the GitHub
project right away so

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.560
that we could all collaborate.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.310
And the nice thing was
in our Google Drive

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.970
folder we put our task list.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.105
We really utilized that.

00:42:19.105 --> 00:42:20.950
And our email thread,
like other teams said,

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.610
it did get a little
long and complex.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.370
But it was just so nice to have.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.110
And later on, we actually
also got a group text

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.330
messaging service.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:32.160
So that works really well
dealing with that last minute

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.230
hustle kind of stuff.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:36.010
The next thing I
went really well

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.590
is I told you that our
scope was way out there.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.980
We realized that very
quickly, and we just

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.860
started cutting,
cutting, cutting.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.980
So we cut items.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.560
We cut interactive
AI characters.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.490
We cut playable quizzes.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.680
We just cut everything
that wasn't key.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.970
Because our game, even
without all the things,

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:56.610
already had a lot of components.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:03.060
And then once we have a playable
game, the next thing we did

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.780
was we looked into feedback.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.640
So one of the main feedbacks
we got was our game

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.400
was not visually cohesive.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.850
It did not make sense.

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.930
The nice thing
about Score High was

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.020
that because you're
playing as an MIT student,

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.060
you're just getting work done,
people understood how to play

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.700
and what they were
supposed to do.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.304
But they didn't understand that.

00:43:22.304 --> 00:43:23.970
So if you look at the
thing on the left,

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.940
you're probably all just staring
at it being like, what's that.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.180
The rectangles are
buildings, and the bottom's

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.190
the stats bar, on the
right is the schedule.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:32.230
It's confusing.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:33.801
People didn't notice
the stat bars,

00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:35.300
or they thought
they were buildings,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.550
and things like that.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.130
So we responded to
that right away.

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:39.750
And we said, we need
to clarify this.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:43.510
We need to separate the
status, separate the schedule,

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:49.410
and make the map very clear, and
pretty, and easy to get around.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.390
So that was one thing
we responded to,

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:52.960
and I think it went well.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.010
The next thing that we
responded to feedback

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.960
was we really listened to
players, not only big picture,

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.280
but on smaller things.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.990
Players wanted WASD,
so we put WASD.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.370
They wanted a clear
way to leave buildings.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.120
They wanted to know
what was going on when

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.200
they were in a building.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.510
So we actually inserted
a progress bar that says,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.080
what's going on this building,
how it's affecting you.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.950
And then to leave,
instead of pressing

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.730
space bar, which people
found unintuitive,

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.560
they press a button that says
leave-- much more intuitive.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.971
Now given all that, we did
make a really good game.

00:44:26.971 --> 00:44:28.470
But there are
definitely some things

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.290
we would change if we
were to do it again.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:36.280
As I mentioned before, start
with something simpler.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.250
We did not design the
game around the scope

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.000
of the project.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.790
And if we were to do this
again, we definitely would.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.990
We tried to bite off
more than we could chew.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:48.650
And related to that, minimize
the number of components

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:51.310
and understand how
they will interact.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.740
Because especially if you're
trying to break down tasks,

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.483
people need to
know what has to be

00:44:56.483 --> 00:44:58.066
conveyed between
different components.

00:45:00.596 --> 00:45:01.750
Plan for the worst.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:02.850
Midterms suck.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.890
People get sick,
or go out of town.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.250
And laptops break.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.910
Literally all of these
things happened to us.

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.690
We're still waiting to
hear, is the laptop working.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.500
We don't know.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.930
Somebody's laptop
broke last night

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.310
and they were working on
something and finishing it up.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.340
And suddenly all
that work's gone.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.770
So as I said, start
earlier, plan for the worst,

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.440
and just get things done.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.800
Finally, it worked
out really well.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.302
And thanks for listening.

00:45:33.302 --> 00:45:34.284
Any questions?

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:40.117
Any questions?

00:45:40.117 --> 00:45:41.158
AUDIENCE: This was Unity?

00:45:41.158 --> 00:45:42.158
STUDENT 10: Yeah, Unity.

00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:47.535
I'm going to take
that as no questions.

00:45:47.535 --> 00:45:48.326
PROFESSOR 1: Great.

00:45:48.326 --> 00:45:48.523
Thank you.

00:45:48.523 --> 00:45:49.439
STUDENT 10: Beautiful.

00:45:52.269 --> 00:45:53.560
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you so much.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.480
And actually round of
applause for everyone here.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.980
You actually did a
really great job.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.140
I think we're going to give
you more detailed feedback

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.050
in a few days.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.920
But I think one thing
we heard definitely

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.375
is by working in
these large teams,

00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:11.750
you're coming
across these issues

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:16.129
that you don't initially-- you
still need tools to get over

00:46:16.129 --> 00:46:18.170
some of the management
issues you're finding out,

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.070
the communication
issues you having,

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.300
the scheduling
issues you're having.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:23.862
Part of this is just experience.

00:46:23.862 --> 00:46:26.070
That's kind of why we just
throw you in the deep end,

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.071
is just to figure out
what are all the problems.

00:46:28.071 --> 00:46:29.778
So that we could then
talk about and have

00:46:29.778 --> 00:46:31.350
some common things
to talk, how we're

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.994
going to solve those things.

00:46:32.994 --> 00:46:34.910
Looking at the schedule,
we'll probably end up

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:37.110
moving a couple things earlier.

00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.615
Did you have a comment?

00:46:38.615 --> 00:46:42.180
PROFESSOR 2: I just wanted
to make one comment.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.120
It's possible your
groups might be slightly

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.740
larger for the next project.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.480
I know.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.480
But you've got a lot
more time because you've

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.242
got seven to eight weeks.

00:46:54.242 --> 00:46:55.700
And what I really
want to encourage

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.650
you guys to do is if you realize
you're having communication

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.730
and organization
problems with your group,

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.510
if you're not sure how
to organize things,

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.340
or if it's not working, stop
by the office and talk to us.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.270
I don't think we said
this clearly enough

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.080
in the previous projects.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.190
But yes, our goal is, in
fact, to throw you out

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:15.040
into the deep end.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.248
But we're not trying to
throw you out in the deep end

00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:20.190
without at least a
floaty to hold onto,

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.280
or a safety rope or something.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:24.020
We are happy to
sit down and talk

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.030
with you, a small
member of your group,

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.100
or your whole group
about how to come up

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.600
with some
individualized solutions

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.760
to your team's communication
and organizational problems.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.280
OK?

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.797
PROFESSOR 3: That's
just a reminder,

00:47:38.797 --> 00:47:40.380
if you don't know
where our office is,

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.320
it's in the syllabus.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.250
It's in building 26
on the ground floor.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:47.530
You can see our rooms all have
the MIT Game, that logo on it.

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.380
And what Rick was
saying about tools,

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.980
not all our tools are
like mechanical tools.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.280
Not all our tools
are like are things

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.470
that you put in a spreadsheet.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.610
The things like the meetings
that we've been talking about,

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.860
where you are actually
supposed to talk to each other.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.734
It's important to actually
talk to each other

00:48:06.734 --> 00:48:09.080
during those meetings,
for instance.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.117
Of course, if you
don't have a way

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:13.200
to be able to schedule
those meetings because it's

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.104
hard to get people
together, you need

00:48:15.104 --> 00:48:17.520
to find a replacement to be
able to have those opportunity

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.740
to talk with each other.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.470
You can't just say,
well, we don't have time

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:24.500
to do this thing, therefore
we're not going to do it.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.740
However, this being
the final project,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.500
you're going to have
a lot of flexibility

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.460
to try out different ways to
communicate with your team.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.960
So what worked in
your previous projects

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.580
should give you a good basis on
what you can do in the future,

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.010
but may not necessarily
work with your future team

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.180
because it might be
different groups of people.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.400
And learn from the
previous three projects

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.150
about what worked.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.050
Try it out.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.140
And that doesn't work,
try something different.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.520
You have time this time around.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:56.420
Although still, eight weeks goes
by really, really, really fast.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.395
So don't over scope.

00:48:58.395 --> 00:49:00.020
PROFESSOR 1: So we
actually are running

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.145
really short on time today.

00:49:01.145 --> 00:49:05.004
We've got a really
long-- a lot of content

00:49:05.004 --> 00:49:06.670
that Pablo was going
to go over with us.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:10.160
So let's take a
five minute break.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.580
I'm actually going to skip
the project 4 introduction.

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.300
And I'll put the
slides up on Stellar.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.990
And I'll give that
on Monday morning.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.515
It's really just me
saying out loud what all

00:49:20.515 --> 00:49:23.230
the-- Monday class.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.990
Don't take everything
I say literally.

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.100
It's the spirit.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.250
Monday at 1 o'clock.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.669
So the slides will be up.

00:49:31.669 --> 00:49:33.460
I'm really just going
over what it actually

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.540
says in the schedule
by saying it out loud.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.454
So you can hear it and see it.

00:49:37.454 --> 00:49:38.620
But we'll do that on Monday.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:39.710
So take a break right now.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.290
And I'm going to
get Pablo set up.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.516
You can see some folks, Pablo?

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.896
PROFESSOR 4: I can
in the distance, yes.

00:49:48.896 --> 00:49:51.604
Hello, everyone.

00:49:51.604 --> 00:49:53.395
PROFESSOR 1: So let me
crank up the volume.

00:49:57.362 --> 00:49:58.702
All right. the room is yours.

00:49:58.702 --> 00:49:59.660
PROFESSOR 4: All right.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.440
PROFESSOR 1: Whoa, loud.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.900
PROFESSOR 4: Thank you
again to all of you

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.922
for still being there.

00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:08.560
Thank to the team in
charge of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.874
for persevering with the
invitation on the guidance

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.932
of how to use this time.

00:50:12.932 --> 00:50:15.100
I'm sure you, or at
least some of you,

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.440
should remember the slide
that I hope is on the screen.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.731
There is a comfort zone
where people feel safe.

00:50:22.731 --> 00:50:26.660
And most often, where people
are safe, not enough happens.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.070
And one of the things--
one of the reason why

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.440
I hope we can work
together is to see

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.256
if we can create true games.

00:50:35.256 --> 00:50:38.550
The magic circles that are
slightly outside of the comfort

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:42.150
zone of people will be a Red
Cross volunteer, a Red Cross

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.280
staff, a person
who is a scholar,

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.820
a donor, a government
official to try

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.210
to make something new happen.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:54.010
And that something new
can be just understanding.

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:56.140
It can be about dialogue.

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.710
It can be about perceptions,
or it can be about some

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.680
of the ingredients that
eventually lead to action.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:08.250
So now let's see if
this thing changes.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.800
Did you see a change in slide?

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:12.800
PROFESSOR 4: Good.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:16.434
So let me move this thing.

00:51:16.434 --> 00:51:20.220
We're going to start
by playing [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.022
I'm going to invite
everyone to stand up.

00:51:23.022 --> 00:51:26.950
And Reid, can I ask you and
someone to partner up with you

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.060
to be in a place
where I can see you.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.476
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:51:30.476 --> 00:51:32.780
PROFESSOR 4: Maybe Sarah,
or whoever you choose.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:33.780
PROFESSOR 3: I'll do it.

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.821
PROFESSOR 4: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:36.314 --> 00:51:37.980
PROFESSOR 1: Where
are we in the camera?

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.388
Hey, there we are.

00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:41.039
PROFESSOR 4: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:41.039 --> 00:51:41.830
PROFESSOR 1: Stand.

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.315
PROFESSOR 4: So everybody
find-- yeah, right.

00:51:44.315 --> 00:51:47.794
When I say stand up, I mean it.

00:51:47.794 --> 00:51:53.758
So everybody find a partner,
shake hands with your partner.

00:51:57.237 --> 00:51:58.170
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, no.

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:00.950
Cutting out.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:06.272
PROFESSOR 4: What you're going
to do now is each one with two

00:52:06.272 --> 00:52:09.630
in the duo is going
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:18.389
PROFESSOR 3: Oh,
you've dropped out.

00:52:18.389 --> 00:52:19.180
PROFESSOR 1: Oh no.

00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:25.610
PROFESSOR 3: How's the network?

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:26.240
PROFESSOR 4: Uh oh.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.823
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, we're getting
a little bit of network drops

00:52:28.823 --> 00:52:29.404
here.

00:52:29.404 --> 00:52:33.040
PROFESSOR 4: OK, may I
suggest the following then.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.910
If it is a matter of bandwidth,
you can stop your video

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:38.920
and that should work.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.289
PROFESSOR 1: We'll do that.

00:52:40.289 --> 00:52:42.330
PROFESSOR 4: You'll be in
charge of through audio

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.462
making sure I know--

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.404
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah,
it dropped again.

00:52:49.404 --> 00:52:51.820
PROFESSOR 4: But you're still
there and kind of following.

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:52.864
OK, can you hear me now?

00:52:52.864 --> 00:52:53.770
PROFESSOR 1: We can hear you.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.605
PROFESSOR 4: So
each one of you is

00:52:54.605 --> 00:52:56.738
going to hold an
imaginary deck of cards.

00:52:56.738 --> 00:53:00.440
Cards are number 1 to 10.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.670
And I want you to shuffle
these imaginary cards.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:09.700
I want you to take the
top half of the deck

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.314
and swap it with your partner.

00:53:13.314 --> 00:53:16.200
And then you shuffle again,
those imaginary cards.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.640
So you should have a lot
of imaginary cards numbered

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.701
1 to 10 in random order.

00:53:22.701 --> 00:53:27.489
If you're thinking, what does
this have to do with Red Cross,

00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:28.155
we'll get there.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.010
So now, this is crucial.

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:39.780
Each one of you is going to
take the top imaginary card,

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.846
make some body movement
to reveal the moment when

00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.400
you're flipping it.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:51.180
And [INAUDIBLE] state that the
number that is on the top card.

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:57.000
For example, [INAUDIBLE]
as well so say your number

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.516
at the same time.

00:53:59.516 --> 00:54:00.140
PROFESSOR 3: 4.

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:03.010
PROFESSOR 1: 6.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:06.495
Oh hey, you don't
have 10 fingers.

00:54:06.495 --> 00:54:08.935
PROFESSOR 4: Let's try it
again using body language

00:54:08.935 --> 00:54:10.810
to make sure it's simultaneous.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.379
PROFESSOR 3: 1, 2, 3--

00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:13.045
PROFESSOR 1: 10.

00:54:13.045 --> 00:54:14.970
PROFESSOR 3: 5.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:15.702
5.

00:54:15.702 --> 00:54:17.974
PROFESSOR 4: All right.

00:54:17.974 --> 00:54:21.150
So I couldn't hear the
number, but first of all, you

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.036
don't need to say 1, 2, 3.

00:54:23.036 --> 00:54:26.640
You can use body language to
make it happen simultaneously.

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.300
It's to your advantage to
make it as fast as possible.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.360
Two things can happen.

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:37.880
If the two players
say different numbers,

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.362
there's no consequence and you
try again a different number--

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:44.782
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, no.

00:54:44.782 --> 00:54:46.370
The video is slowing down.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.536
PROFESSOR 4: or the same
number, whichever you want,

00:54:48.536 --> 00:54:51.150
any-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.895
OK, it's the audio [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:52.895 --> 00:54:54.819
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, the
audio is cutting out.

00:54:54.819 --> 00:54:55.860
And the video is pausing.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.440
Do you want to just switch back
to me controlling the slides

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.391
and you on audio only?

00:55:00.391 --> 00:55:01.140
PROFESSOR 4: Sure.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.872
PROFESSOR 1: OK, let's do that.

00:55:03.872 --> 00:55:05.830
PROFESSOR 3: I think he
can just turn off his--

00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:06.010
PROFESSOR 1: So
yeah, if you just

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.140
go ahead and turn
off your video,

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.485
and I'll make sure
I have slides.

00:55:08.485 --> 00:55:09.651
PROFESSOR 4: All right, yes.

00:55:09.651 --> 00:55:10.880
Let me get back to this.

00:55:13.475 --> 00:55:14.393
How do I do it?

00:55:14.393 --> 00:55:15.480
There.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.230
PROFESSOR 1: Cool.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.830
Let me go back to this.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.660
PROFESSOR 4: So is
the audio now better?

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.905
PROFESSOR 1: So far, yeah.

00:55:19.905 --> 00:55:21.080
PROFESSOR 4: OK, good.

00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.245
So what I was going to say is
that the two players are going

00:55:25.245 --> 00:55:27.771
to say numbers simultaneously.

00:55:27.771 --> 00:55:31.900
If the two numbers stated
simultaneously are different,

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.034
you keep going.

00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:36.740
You keep saying numbers
at the same time.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:41.694
But if the two players say the
same number at the same time,

00:55:41.694 --> 00:55:48.180
the first player to say "snap"
takes all the imaginary cards

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.638
and wins one imaginary point.

00:55:53.395 --> 00:55:54.061
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:55:54.061 --> 00:55:57.040
PROFESSOR 4: You keep going, OK?

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.450
And you start again.

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:02.340
The purpose is in
one minute or less

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.346
to snap as much as you can.

00:56:05.346 --> 00:56:07.182
Those are the rules.

00:56:07.182 --> 00:56:09.020
Shuffle your cards.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.480
Ready, set and go.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.785
You have less than a minute.

00:56:11.785 --> 00:56:12.410
PROFESSOR 1: 5.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:13.446
PROFESSOR 3: 4.

00:56:13.446 --> 00:56:14.071
PROFESSOR 1: 6.

00:56:14.071 --> 00:56:14.568
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:14.568 --> 00:56:15.065
PROFESSOR 1: 10.

00:56:15.065 --> 00:56:15.562
PROFESSOR 3: 7.

00:56:15.562 --> 00:56:16.059
PROFESSOR 1: 8.

00:56:16.059 --> 00:56:16.556
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:16.556 --> 00:56:17.053
PROFESSOR 1: 3.

00:56:17.053 --> 00:56:17.550
PROFESSOR 3: 9.

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:18.047
PROFESSOR 1: 2.

00:56:18.047 --> 00:56:18.544
PROFESSOR 3: 12.

00:56:18.544 --> 00:56:19.127
PROFESSOR 1: 1

00:56:19.127 --> 00:56:19.907
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:19.907 --> 00:56:20.532
PROFESSOR 1: 7.

00:56:20.532 --> 00:56:21.398
PROFESSOR 3: 6.

00:56:21.398 --> 00:56:22.023
PROFESSOR 1: 5.

00:56:22.023 --> 00:56:22.520
PROFESSOR 3: 8.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:23.017
PROFESSOR 1: 4.

00:56:23.017 --> 00:56:23.514
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:23.514 --> 00:56:24.011
PROFESSOR 1: 10.

00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:24.508
PROFESSOR 3: 4.

00:56:24.508 --> 00:56:25.133
PROFESSOR 1: 4.

00:56:25.133 --> 00:56:25.871
PROFESSOR 3: 5.

00:56:25.871 --> 00:56:26.496
PROFESSOR 1: 6.

00:56:26.496 --> 00:56:26.993
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:26.993 --> 00:56:27.490
PROFESSOR 1: 3.

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:27.987
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:27.987 --> 00:56:28.484
PROFESSOR 1: Snap!

00:56:28.484 --> 00:56:29.109
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:30.969
OK, you got the point.

00:56:30.969 --> 00:56:31.835
1.

00:56:31.835 --> 00:56:32.460
PROFESSOR 1: 5.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:32.957
PROFESSOR 3: 6.

00:56:32.957 --> 00:56:33.454
PROFESSOR 1: 6

00:56:33.454 --> 00:56:33.951
PROFESSOR 3: 2

00:56:33.951 --> 00:56:34.448
PROFESSOR 1: 7.

00:56:34.448 --> 00:56:34.945
PROFESSOR 3: 1.

00:56:34.945 --> 00:56:35.442
PROFESSOR 1: 7

00:56:35.442 --> 00:56:35.939
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:35.939 --> 00:56:36.436
PROFESSOR 1: 8

00:56:36.436 --> 00:56:36.933
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:37.430
PROFESSOR 1: 8.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.927
PROFESSOR 3: 8, snap!

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:38.921
PROFESSOR 1: Ah,
OK, you get a point.

00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:39.915
PROFESSOR 3: All right.

00:56:39.915 --> 00:56:40.412
PROFESSOR 1: 9.

00:56:40.412 --> 00:56:40.909
PROFESSOR 3: 4.

00:56:40.909 --> 00:56:41.406
PROFESSOR 1: 10.

00:56:41.406 --> 00:56:41.903
PROFESSOR 3: 3

00:56:41.903 --> 00:56:42.400
PROFESSOR 1: 4.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:42.897
PROFESSOR 3: 8.

00:56:42.897 --> 00:56:43.394
PROFESSOR 1: 7.

00:56:43.394 --> 00:56:43.891
PROFESSOR 3: 6.

00:56:43.891 --> 00:56:44.388
PROFESSOR 1: 6.

00:56:44.388 --> 00:56:44.885
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:44.885 --> 00:56:45.382
PROFESSOR 1: 3.

00:56:45.382 --> 00:56:45.879
PROFESSOR 3: 1.

00:56:45.879 --> 00:56:46.376
PROFESSOR 1: 4.

00:56:46.376 --> 00:56:46.873
PROFESSOR 3: 1.

00:56:46.873 --> 00:56:47.370
PROFESSOR 1: 5.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:47.867
PROFESSOR 3: 5.

00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:48.364
PROFESSOR 1: Snap!

00:56:48.364 --> 00:56:48.861
PROFESSOR 3: Snap!

00:56:48.861 --> 00:56:49.855
All right, I think you got it.

00:56:49.855 --> 00:56:50.410
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:51.122
PROFESSOR 3: All right.

00:56:51.122 --> 00:56:51.480
PROFESSOR 1: 3.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:51.974
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:51.974 --> 00:56:52.468
PROFESSOR 1: 4.

00:56:52.468 --> 00:56:52.962
PROFESSOR 3: 3.

00:56:52.962 --> 00:56:53.456
PROFESSOR 1: 7.

00:56:53.456 --> 00:56:53.950
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:54.444
PROFESSOR 1: 8.

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:54.938
PROFESSOR 3: 8.

00:56:54.938 --> 00:56:55.432
PROFESSOR 1: Snap!

00:56:55.432 --> 00:56:55.926
PROFESSOR 3: Ah, OK.

00:56:55.926 --> 00:56:56.742
You got two points.

00:56:56.742 --> 00:56:57.408
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:56:57.408 --> 00:56:58.949
PROFESSOR 3: All
right, is that good?

00:56:58.949 --> 00:57:00.866
Or go again?

00:57:00.866 --> 00:57:01.854
OK.

00:57:01.854 --> 00:57:02.348
PROFESSOR 1: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:02.348 --> 00:57:02.842
5.

00:57:02.842 --> 00:57:03.336
PROFESSOR 3: 5

00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:03.830
PROFESSOR 1: 7.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:04.324
PROFESSOR 3: 2.

00:57:04.324 --> 00:57:04.818
PROFESSOR 1: 8.

00:57:04.818 --> 00:57:05.312

PROFESSOR 4: The
second difference

00:58:43.048 --> 00:58:45.190
is that instead of having
numbers 1 through 10,

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:47.555
you are going to have
the names of animals.

know more than 10 animals.

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.988

00:59:48.988 --> 00:59:49.802

00:59:49.802 --> 00:59:53.260

I'm not in the room.

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.248
Can you hear me guys?

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.990
PROFESSOR 4: Good.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:57.756
Even though I'm
not in the room, I

00:59:57.756 --> 01:00:00.120
imagine that what
usually happens

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.490
may have happened again here.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:07.280
First of all, it seems
much harder to snap.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:12.392
Second, more people find
themselves going, ah, and not

01:00:12.392 --> 01:00:13.316
saying an animal.

01:00:13.316 --> 01:00:16.920
There was like clogging
of the brain cells.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.210
And then very
interestingly, very often

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.036
people don't listen
to each other.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:26.390
So for example, the first
time I played, I was saying,

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.760
dog, cat, mouse, and
my partner was saying,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.790
zebra, giraffe, lion.

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:35.980
And it took us a
long time to notice

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.730
that we were in
different universes,

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.780
that we were never
going to snap.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.300
And then interestingly, when
you finally say the same words,

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.500
a lot of people don't snap.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.090
Their brain cells do not
get in the right place.

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.290
So when you play
the next round, I

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.868
want you to go back to
your original partner.

01:00:59.868 --> 01:01:02.268
And in your deck of
cards, you are not

01:01:02.268 --> 01:01:04.660
going to have
numbers 1 through 10.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.440
You are not going
to have animals.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:10.290
You are going to have
words or concepts that you

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.840
associate with the Red Cross.

If what usually happens
in this game happened

even more difficult for people

than before, people
are realizing

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.700
in the process of trying to
play this game, that they don't

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.414
really know what they think
about the subject matter

we proposed in the
third round of the game.

01:02:52.461 --> 01:02:55.560

invite you to do now

01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.350
is very quickly form

take video out of there.

01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.060
Everyone has four, right?

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.620
Oh, groups of three.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.435
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:05:05.082 --> 01:05:06.540
PROFESSOR 3: I gave
you a few extra

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.822
just in case you make a mistake.

01:05:10.822 --> 01:05:12.280
PROFESSOR 4: Rick,
can you hear me?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.696
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah,
I can hear you.

01:05:13.696 --> 01:05:16.352
PROFESSOR 4: OK, so I
want you to give them

01:05:16.352 --> 01:05:18.071
no more than 30 seconds left.

01:05:18.071 --> 01:05:18.737
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:05:18.737 --> 01:05:21.130
PROFESSOR 4: And let them
know that time is running out.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.796
PROFESSOR 1: All
right, 30 seconds left.

01:05:25.616 --> 01:05:28.790
PROFESSOR 4: And then, Rick,
what [INAUDIBLE] going?

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:30.789
PROFESSOR 1: The slide
is showing, yeah.

01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:31.580
PROFESSOR 4: Sorry?

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.224
PROFESSOR 1: The slide?

01:05:33.224 --> 01:05:34.625
PROFESSOR 4: No.

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:38.519
Well, yeah, actually,
[INAUDIBLE], no slide yet.

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:39.185
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.276
PROFESSOR 4: It's easier
if you just do it.

01:05:40.276 --> 01:05:40.650
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:43.265
PROFESSOR 4: What I want you
to do is to pick some trio,

01:05:43.265 --> 01:05:46.618
ask the trio to choose one
of the words [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:49.740
they have on their cards and
invite all the other groups

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:53.750
to say "snap" if they
wrote that exact term.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.560
PROFESSOR 1: OK,
did we get that?

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.900
So one trio come up and
give one of your terms.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.474
Just stand up and
start over here.

01:06:01.474 --> 01:06:02.640
So what's one of your terms?

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.040
AUDIENCE: Disaster relief.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.248
PROFESSOR 1: Disaster relief?

01:06:05.248 --> 01:06:07.320
Snap, snap.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.505
How many?

01:06:08.505 --> 01:06:09.130
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.170
PROFESSOR 1: Snap.

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:10.670
Three.

01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:11.160
So we had four or five.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.656
PROFESSOR 4: OK, now
choose another trio.

01:06:12.656 --> 01:06:13.864
PROFESSOR 1: OK, another one.

01:06:13.864 --> 01:06:16.240
PROFESSOR 4: Another trio
to say one of your words.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.750
PROFESSOR 1: All right, term?

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:18.607
AUDIENCE: Red.

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:19.232
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:19.232 --> 01:06:19.726
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:20.669
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:20.669 --> 01:06:21.210
AUDIENCE: Red

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:21.900
PROFESSOR 1: What was the word?

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.483
AUDIENCE: Red.

01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:23.246
AUDIENCE: Red.

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:25.640
PROFESSOR 1: Red?

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.200
All right.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.665
PROFESSOR 4: OK, so do the
same with a few more trios,

01:06:29.665 --> 01:06:31.580
maybe three or four more trios.

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:32.964
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:06:32.964 --> 01:06:34.320
AUDIENCE: Blood donations.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.000
PROFESSOR 1: What's that?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.650
AUDIENCE: Blood donations.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:36.485
PROFESSOR 1: Blood donations.

01:06:36.485 --> 01:06:36.910
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.377
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:37.377 --> 01:06:38.311
PROFESSOR 1: Snap, snap.

01:06:38.311 --> 01:06:38.935
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:38.935 --> 01:06:40.650
PROFESSOR 1: Snap, snap, snap.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:42.824
OK, another trio.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:43.708
Yeah.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:44.712
AUDIENCE: Aid.

01:06:44.712 --> 01:06:45.420
PROFESSOR 1: Aid?

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:45.905
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:45.905 --> 01:06:46.530
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:49.651
PROFESSOR 1: Snap, snap, snap.

01:06:49.651 --> 01:06:51.140
All right, another one.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:52.120
AUDIENCE: CPR.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.080
PROFESSOR 1: CPR?

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.240
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.110
PROFESSOR 1: No CPR?

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:57.151
PROFESSOR 4: Interesting.

01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:58.608
No snapping with that one, huh?

01:06:58.608 --> 01:06:59.274
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:06:59.274 --> 01:07:00.630
PROFESSOR 4: OK.

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:03.900
So there are two reason
why I wanted to do this.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.620
Thank you all very much.

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:07.545
If we had the time, we
would play this game

01:07:07.545 --> 01:07:09.570
in a version that has
winners and losers, where

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:14.770
we would eliminate the
most and the least snaps.

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:17.035
And the second most
and second least snaps

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:19.350
are the winners, for example.

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:22.690
So you have to choose which of
your cards to say, and so on.

01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.310
There are two reasons why I
wanted to share this with you.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:28.740
One is to re-energize the
room and bring it back

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.411
into the game zone.

01:07:30.411 --> 01:07:33.270
And the second one-- it's the
flavor of one of the games

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:36.390
that I hope maybe some
you will consider doing.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.844
When we play this game in
the context of [INAUDIBLE],

01:07:39.844 --> 01:07:44.528
for example, we
play [INAUDIBLE],

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:46.860
first with numbers,
then with animals,

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:50.454
and then we with the subject
matter of the course, which

01:07:50.454 --> 01:07:51.370
can be climate change.

01:07:51.370 --> 01:07:53.710
It can be humanitarian, law.

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:55.760
It can be [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.702
It can be shelter.

01:07:57.702 --> 01:08:00.370
It can be urban risk.

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:02.480
And people come up with words.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.360
And they write them down.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.745
And we keep those papers.

01:08:06.745 --> 01:08:11.100
And then after [INAUDIBLE],
which can be an hour, or a day,

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.690
or a week, we [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:17.709
And we ask them to
form different trios

01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:20.850
and to write the words
that they [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:24.059
And that collection
allows us to compare

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:28.543
the before and the after on
how the thinking changed.

01:08:28.543 --> 01:08:30.209
[INAUDIBLE], did you
show the slide that

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:32.020
has the two printouts?

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.200
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, I got that.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.695
PROFESSOR 4: So [INAUDIBLE]
and change this here.

01:08:38.695 --> 01:08:41.869
This is where we
played about insurance.

01:08:41.869 --> 01:08:44.120
The one on the left
was the before.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.472
And you see [INAUDIBLE] and
[INAUDIBLE], premium, accident,

01:08:48.472 --> 01:08:50.270
disaster.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.680
When we played the
game afterwards,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.359
there were more nuanced terms.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.960
There was [INAUDIBLE] collected.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.089
There was buffered.

01:08:59.089 --> 01:09:00.609
There was future.

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:01.540
There was return.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.950
There was long term.

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:05.620
And this was very
difficult for us

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:11.750
to see how the thinking changed
as a result of the session.

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:17.939
So moving on to the next slide
that says choices for your game

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:21.170
project, these are
the six choices

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.859
that I want to make
available to you.

01:09:24.859 --> 01:09:29.245
The zero one is to
create a digital version

01:09:29.245 --> 01:09:35.979
of the game that could be played
along the lines of what you

01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:38.970
just did, but for us an
accelerated collection of data,

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:42.240
so that everyone can see at the
same time what just happened.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.689
I'll explain it more later.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:47.960
Then in the list,
you see UNICEF Ghana.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:51.430
And this is about cholera,
a waterborne disease

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.955
that is very tough.

01:09:53.955 --> 01:09:59.420
And invite two groups if
possible to take this one,

01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:01.410
because it's an
important one to us.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:03.936
And it's about helping
schoolchildren in West Africa

01:10:03.936 --> 01:10:06.726
to manage health risks.

01:10:06.726 --> 01:10:12.870
The next one is about linking
early warning forecasts

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:17.700
with early action, decisions
that can help save lives.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:21.680
Since it is 75 in Boston
or Cambridge today,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.236
we thought it would be
relevant to say that we

01:10:25.236 --> 01:10:27.070
wanted to focus on heat waves.

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:28.696
We could make it
about hurricanes.

01:10:28.696 --> 01:10:31.315
We could make it about
volcanic eruptions.

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.130
We could make it
about many things.

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:36.317
But we invite heat waves,
because there are a few reasons

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:40.120
that make it useful to us.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.050
The next one is perhaps the most
challenging one intellectually.

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.040
It's about new
funding mechanisms

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.724
for disaster preparedness.

01:10:48.724 --> 01:10:50.250
I will explain this.

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.305
We call it forecast-based
financing, or FBF.

01:10:54.305 --> 01:10:59.480
And it's the one that has the
most potential to transform

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.445
the humanitarian world.

01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:05.600
The fourth one is Ebola.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.170
As you can imagine, this
is a very challenging time

01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:09.570
for my colleagues.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.400
And maybe some of
you can give a hand.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.030
And the last one involves
adaptation to climate change.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:21.070
I think you may have met
[INAUDIBLE], my partner.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.035
He designed [INAUDIBLE]
project for an organization

01:11:25.035 --> 01:11:28.186
called Plan International,
focused on work with children

01:11:28.186 --> 01:11:29.830
[INAUDIBLE].

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:34.710
So moving on to the
next slide, before we

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:37.780
go into the details of each
one of those potential topics,

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.320
I wanted to show
you some thoughts

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.290
about why digital
games for these things.

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:48.610
As you remember, hopefully,
from the previous visit to MIT,

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:51.690
the vast majority of our
games have been non-digital.

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:54.480
We've played them face to face.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.970
They have been very good for
what thew were intended to do.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:01.030
But they were reaching a very
small group of people, only

01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:03.460
those who were here.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.300
Recently, we designed--
or recently collaborated

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.250
in the design of our
first digital game that

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:14.080
was to be used in a
MOOC with [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.370
And it reached 35,000
people, which I'm pretty sure

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:20.865
has doubled the
number of people that,

01:12:20.865 --> 01:12:22.615
since the beginning
of my work with games,

01:12:22.615 --> 01:12:24.925
have been playing games
that are non-digital.

01:12:24.925 --> 01:12:30.422
There's clearly [INAUDIBLE]
to many, many people.

01:12:30.422 --> 01:12:34.970
And we're thinking of Red Cross
staff, colleagues of mine who

01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:40.130
have a job, because this is
their managers, [INAUDIBLE],

01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:41.144
whatever it may be.

01:12:41.144 --> 01:12:42.560
There's also Red
Cross volunteers,

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.495
people who are not paid
[INAUDIBLE] some work.

01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:47.718
It could be digital
games that people

01:12:47.718 --> 01:12:49.593
at risk, people who
would make some decisions

01:12:49.593 --> 01:12:53.170
to save their lives or save
the lives of their neighbors.

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:56.190
It could be about youth
and the schoolchildren,

01:12:56.190 --> 01:13:00.410
who maybe don't know something
could learn through a game,

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:04.682
or had a [INAUDIBLE] that could
inspire through digital games.

01:13:04.682 --> 01:13:07.810
And there's also the bigger
interpretations, especially

01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:12.760
now in a time where
there's crowd funding,

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.180
there is people who
have the ability

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.060
to act in [INAUDIBLE]
number of little things

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.322
and make them bigger.

01:13:21.322 --> 01:13:25.950
[INAUDIBLE] is that
games, including

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:30.060
digital games and [INAUDIBLE]
of the many ingredients

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.230
needed to support
a bigger change.

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.070
We are not widely optimistic.

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:38.880
It's not that we believe
that someone lives

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.490
their life in a
certain way, and then

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:43.074
they play a game, and boom,
they're a different person,

01:13:43.074 --> 01:13:44.739
and they change their behavior.

01:13:44.739 --> 01:13:45.655
Maybe that can happen.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:49.000
But we are aware that it
takes more than a simple game

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.255
to play to change minds.

01:13:51.255 --> 01:13:55.640
But we believe that games
can help invite people

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.860
to change behavior [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:59.640
It can be about
creating awareness.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.075
It can be about
engaging their desire,

01:14:02.075 --> 01:14:03.810
their want to learn more.

01:14:03.810 --> 01:14:06.842
It can be about a way give
them interest, the appetite.

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:09.360
Or it can be about
inspiring people

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.327
to take something that
[INAUDIBLE] they already do

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:16.420
and put it into
motion, [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.905
Importantly, because of
[INAUDIBLE]-- sorry--

01:14:22.905 --> 01:14:25.240
last bullet.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.640
There's so much hope
in digital technology,

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.550
in people who can
program, in people

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:34.550
who have cell phones
and [INAUDIBLE] Africa.

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:37.290
And we see a lot
of room for growth

01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:40.990
within our team designing
and deploying digital games,

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.367
particularly with
UNICEF, but also

01:14:43.367 --> 01:14:47.930
with many examples of
organizations [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:54.620
So moving on, I should
probably come to the next one.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.329
Rick, would you like to either
inject anything or invite

01:14:58.329 --> 01:14:59.870
questions at this
stage before moving

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.450
to the details of each game?

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.200
PROFESSOR 1: Sure.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.250
So yeah, are there questions
about the target audience

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:06.554
or the reasons for digital
games before we move on?

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:11.658
Yeah, one question?

01:15:11.658 --> 01:15:13.610
AUDIENCE: Will we
be able to play test

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.329
with our target audience?

01:15:15.329 --> 01:15:17.620
PROFESSOR 1: So play testing
with the target audience--

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:19.780
are any of these folks
in the Boston area

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:23.290
that we could invite in
for a play test session?

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:26.168
PROFESSOR 4: Almost
certainly not.

01:15:26.168 --> 01:15:30.340
So what we can do is to
play the games with people

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.960
who are as close as we can get.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.737
So you know, schoolchildren
[INAUDIBLE], most of them

01:15:35.737 --> 01:15:38.620
are different from
children in West Africa.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.380
But I imagine that [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:45.540
There are a lot [INAUDIBLE]
prototype for Ghana

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.923
if you play it with children
in Cambridge or [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:49.923 --> 01:15:50.890
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:53.745
PROFESSOR 4: Having said that,
I may be able to get colleagues

01:15:53.745 --> 01:15:58.630
in developing countries
to download your code

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:02.680
and play in [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.725
So [INAUDIBLE] on the
possibility for play

01:16:05.725 --> 01:16:07.365
test with the target audience.

01:16:07.365 --> 01:16:10.215
But it is in the
nature of this work

01:16:10.215 --> 01:16:13.980
to work for the benefit
of developing countries.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.950
So we'll have to
accept that there

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:20.060
is going to be a limited
ability to play test.

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:24.090
And that's something that can
happen in the early phases

01:16:24.090 --> 01:16:25.980
of the project design.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:27.536
Basically, we could
do it if you had

01:16:27.536 --> 01:16:30.060
the budget for a planet ticket.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.694
And it might be hard.

01:16:32.694 --> 01:16:34.610
PROFESSOR 1: Was there
another question I saw?

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:35.353
Yeah.

01:16:35.353 --> 01:16:36.769
AUDIENCE: Are you
envisioning this

01:16:36.769 --> 01:16:39.201
being used as a one
on one thing, where

01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:40.492
one person is playing the game?

01:16:40.492 --> 01:16:41.938
Or are you
envisioning this being

01:16:41.938 --> 01:16:44.348
used as sort of an
alternative to a presentation,

01:16:44.348 --> 01:16:47.240
similar to the games
that we've seen here.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:50.370
PROFESSOR 4: Yeah, it
depends on the game.

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:56.425
Generally speaking, mostly
because of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:56.425 --> 01:17:01.800
in your ability to spend
student time on both the games,

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.740
we are sticking to ideas that
can be implemented for one

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:09.510
player with one computer or
one device, [INAUDIBLE]--

01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:10.260
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.180
PROFESSOR 4: --which
can happen in the house,

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.265
happen in the street when
they're waiting for the bus.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.410
Or it can happen in a group, in
the context of a [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:22.790
But we decided to [INAUDIBLE]
multiplayer variable

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:24.920
for more sophisticated
endeavors.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.670
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:17:25.670 --> 01:17:29.290
So yeah, when I talk further
about the constraints

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:32.975
on Monday, I'll be
mentioning that you

01:17:32.975 --> 01:17:34.850
could do a single player
or multiplayer game.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.035
But it will be a single
device, no networking.

01:17:37.035 --> 01:17:40.690
And we are asking you to think
about the spectator experience.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.190
So what does it look like to
be looking over the shoulder?

01:17:43.190 --> 01:17:45.481
What does it look like to be
looking down on the table,

01:17:45.481 --> 01:17:47.420
if it's an iPad game
or a tablet game?

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.130
What does it like if
somebody's playing

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:51.820
the game on a screen like this?

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.930
Consider one of those.

01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:55.520
And design it
towards one of those.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.020
Yeah?

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.331
AUDIENCE: So by schoolchildren,
is this elementary, middle,

01:17:59.331 --> 01:18:00.277
or high school?

01:18:00.277 --> 01:18:03.590
And also, can we assume
they speak English?

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:05.080
PROFESSOR 1: So
for schoolchildren,

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.310
is there a particular age range,
elementary, middle, or high?

01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:12.052
And is there an English
language assumption going on?

01:18:12.052 --> 01:18:12.760
PROFESSOR 4: Yes.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.470
So yes to English.

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:17.910
And it will be [INAUDIBLE]
official language

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:18.840
is [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:22.990
So children go to school
and learn at some age.

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:25.700
And different products
have different age ranges.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.210
But generally speaking,
it's roughly the ones

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:34.050
that are schoolchildren
are not [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:37.320
So we'll get to that in
the details for each game.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.810
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:40.546
PROFESSOR 4: So
moving on, if you

01:18:40.546 --> 01:18:43.010
want to press the slide
for the [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.760
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.720
PROFESSOR 4: Thumbs up.

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.604
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:18:46.604 --> 01:18:48.020
PROFESSOR 4: Those
of you who were

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.130
at the game's
initial [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:52.928
may remember the game where
you all standing, and there

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:55.502
was a die, [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:55.502 --> 01:18:58.746
And if there was a 6, you
had to do the umbrella.

01:18:58.746 --> 01:19:02.030
Otherwise, you had
to do thumbs up.

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:07.740
Or if you push again,
[INAUDIBLE] sitting [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:11.200
on the cement, and [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:17.100
PROFESSOR 4: Those are the
two basic [INAUDIBLE] that we

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.140
generally remember things.

01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.111
You either do the usual,
or do something new.

01:19:24.111 --> 01:19:27.380
And what we want
is to [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:32.596
a player the idea that you
can't make wrong decisions

01:19:32.596 --> 01:19:34.450
without negative consequences.

01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:38.348
But it's really hard to
know whether the decision is

01:19:38.348 --> 01:19:40.910
the right one or the wrong
one before the disaster

01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:42.807
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:42.807 --> 01:19:48.500
[INAUDIBLE] most of you in
the process of designing games

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:54.090
will digitally incarnate
some form of mechanic

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.380
that [INAUDIBLE] that.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:59.160
The player is going to say,
do I do the usual thumbs up

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:02.820
or do I start
[INAUDIBLE] the umbrella.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.340
It will depend, of course.

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:09.950
If it's a game about health,
an umbrella won't be it, right?

01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:11.254
It will be some other image.

01:20:11.254 --> 01:20:12.170
But you get the point.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:15.920
It's about the repetitive act.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.860
The next slide, which I also
showed the previous group,

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.070
this is more what we want.

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:27.830
We want players to
experience an aha moment,

01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:33.325
a moment of discovery that is
the result of the process where

01:20:33.325 --> 01:20:38.816
they go though some not knowing
what the next choice is.

01:20:38.816 --> 01:20:40.380
Otherwise, it would
be too obvious.

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.890
It would be [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:44.560
And [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.590
So good luck to all of you in
coming up with an [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:53.480
balance because huh and aha.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.708
So moving on to
the next one, this

01:20:55.708 --> 01:21:00.292
is about the first [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:00.292 --> 01:21:05.083
It is in the context of this
game that you just played.

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:07.440
As I mentioned, when we
played with 200 people,

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.570
we can very quickly match
all the cards [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:12.770
by groups of three.

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:16.110
And we can quickly enter them
into a computer connected

01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.945
to internet, [INAUDIBLE]
before and after,

01:21:18.945 --> 01:21:22.590
so people can see at
the end of the workshop

01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:26.110
how their own
thinking has changed.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:29.285
Now, when we went through
the activity of Rick

01:21:29.285 --> 01:21:31.710
pointing to a geometric,
choosing a word

01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:35.550
like [INAUDIBLE], and other
people saying [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:38.185
If you have 50
people in the room,

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:41.220
it becomes much more difficult.
Because if you're doing

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:43.750
[INAUDIBLE], it becomes boring.

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:49.770
So what I ask you to consider
is to create a digital tool that

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:55.875
can be embedded or utilized
or employed to [INAUDIBLE],

01:21:55.875 --> 01:21:59.210
so that we can collect
and process information

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:00.800
of what people are thinking.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.030
So you'll be face to face,
just like you were then.

01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:06.940
But I imagine that your
interface, this could be made

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:10.850
with 3,000 people [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:14.300
And then each [INAUDIBLE] works.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:16.760
And there's some
game mechanic that

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:20.740
creates an incentive and
pitches [INAUDIBLE] at least

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.550
[INAUDIBLE] of the
time that helps

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.400
people visualize their result.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.870
And that helps make
them analyze the data,

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:30.780
to assess the input to monitor
or to evaluate, and eventually

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.910
to [INAUDIBLE] this animation
of this [INAUDIBLE] concepting.

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:37.696
But folks, you have no
idea how much [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:37.696 --> 01:22:40.630
was shouting at the first round.

01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:41.130
[INAUDIBLE]

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.316
And you were so energized.

01:22:43.316 --> 01:22:44.540
That's great.

01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:45.870
We love that.

01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:48.035
But we need to channel
that so it becomes

01:22:48.035 --> 01:22:51.490
more useful to the subject.

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:56.417
So the chances [INAUDIBLE], if
you deliver something, and gain

01:22:56.417 --> 01:22:59.370
a product life that works,
it's near guaranteed

01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.330
that we will use it.

01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:03.925
If your tool helps us
collect information

01:23:03.925 --> 01:23:09.374
in a somewhat playful way, and
share it, and think about it,

01:23:09.374 --> 01:23:10.290
we're going to use it.

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:12.330
And we're going to use
it in five continents,

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:15.470
starting the day
after you [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:17.710
And there are
researchers for this.

01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:20.640
There are documents
that cover [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.749
called data
[INAUDIBLE] initiative.

01:23:22.749 --> 01:23:24.790
And you can also consult
with me and [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:26.975
I should be here some
of the time if you

01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:29.464
have any questions about it.

01:23:29.464 --> 01:23:33.768
[INAUDIBLE] like what we did
for a tool similar to this one.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.900
PROFESSOR 1: Was
that a question?

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.380
PROFESSOR 4: I
asked if you prefer

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:46.830
that we move on to the next
game idea, or if we pause

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:48.480
and invite for questions.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.730
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, let's do
questions after each idea,

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:52.330
just really briefly.

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:55.680
So any questions
about this game?

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.310
Yeah?

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:58.685
AUDIENCE: I thought we were
not supposed to make anything

01:23:58.685 --> 01:24:00.120
that has to do with a network.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:00.380
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:01.963
So in this game,
there is a little bit

01:24:01.963 --> 01:24:03.540
a networking going on.

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.697
If you were to do
this game, it would

01:24:05.697 --> 01:24:07.780
mean it's not a multiplayer
networking experience.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.371
But you are transmitting
data to some kind of server.

01:24:11.371 --> 01:24:12.870
So that's where
this one gets hairy.

01:24:15.241 --> 01:24:17.240
It looks like a simple
design, but it's actually

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:20.390
a bigger-- there's a bigger
back end to this one.

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.350
PROFESSOR 3: This is possibly,
just by looking at it fully,

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:27.220
it's possibly, technically,
the most difficult one.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:30.720
Because it looks like it's
still a networking game,

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.020
even though we are
encouraging you to do

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:37.540
single players, single device.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.270
PROFESSOR 1: And designing for
touch is very difficult too.

01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:43.420
It just kind of it gets big.

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:45.580
Any other questions?

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:48.280
PROFESSOR 3: There
probably is a middle ground

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.130
where you can think
of, all right, what

01:24:51.130 --> 01:24:53.770
can be done with a single
computer that would still

01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:55.920
make it easier for
someone like Pablo

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:59.590
to be able to run this in
a workshop, for instance.

01:24:59.590 --> 01:25:01.630
Even just making his
job slightly easier.

01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:06.360
Remember, we just played this
game with imaginary things.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.430
What can we do that
doesn't required

01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:12.940
the players to have a
device, but speeds up

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:15.370
the process from
a central computer

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:19.095
to be able to say
collective data?

01:25:19.095 --> 01:25:20.720
I don't know what
that would look like.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.928
That would be more of a
design challenge, rather than

01:25:22.928 --> 01:25:27.420
a technical challenge,
but possibly more feasible

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:30.700
for the size of this class.

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.230
PROFESSOR 4:
[INAUDIBLE] the results

01:25:35.230 --> 01:25:38.080
are shared in real time.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.560
But if people have
a cell phone, they

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.105
can just send an email to
the words to some address.

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:48.490
And then some
[INAUDIBLE] someone

01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:51.526
punched buttons these
skills then. [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:00.490
Write down [INAUDIBLE] we don't
understand the [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:03.393
So as it was said before,
anything [INAUDIBLE] that you

01:26:03.393 --> 01:26:06.240
may have to an
[INAUDIBLE] experience,

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.750
our to improve a [INAUDIBLE],
would be appreciated.

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:12.342
If no group chooses
this one, no problem.

01:26:14.769 --> 01:26:16.060
PROFESSOR 1: So let's move one.

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.750
Actually Pablo, can you
turn off the screen sharing.

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:20.540
Maybe that will speed up the--

01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.060
PROFESSOR 4: Oh, I wasn't
aware that I wasn't sharing.

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.600
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, I
just noticed it too.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.410
PROFESSOR 4: Here it
says I am not sharing.

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:29.154
Weird.

01:26:29.154 --> 01:26:30.570
Let me go to this.

01:26:33.402 --> 01:26:35.040
Stop sharing screen, good.

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.310
PROFESSOR 1: There we go.

01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:38.390
So let's go to the next one.

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:41.610
PROFESSOR 4: The next
one is the important one.

01:26:41.610 --> 01:26:45.533
It's the UNICEF Ghana.

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:50.000
UNICEF is the most
loved UN agency.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.755
Well, I don't have [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:55.755 --> 01:26:59.310
Generally speaking, it's fun for
a very well [INAUDIBLE] agency.

01:26:59.310 --> 01:27:02.547
It works with
children and education

01:27:02.547 --> 01:27:06.210
and it does very good
[INAUDIBLE] work.

01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:09.058
And the team in
Ghana has decided

01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:10.990
to reach out to [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:13.600
Originally it was in
the context of cholera.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:18.700
But they also have some
money for Ebola and cholera.

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.110
And they want us to design
games for school children

01:27:22.110 --> 01:27:25.230
that would help them
becoming familiar

01:27:25.230 --> 01:27:28.265
with an improvement instrument
of risks [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.990
I have no contract yet.

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.660
But it's very likely
that this relationship

01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:39.450
will grow, and will grow in
time, and will grow in size,

01:27:39.450 --> 01:27:44.160
and will be able to get
into the digital very soon.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.590
So the context is that cholera
is a waterborne disease

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:53.881
and is on the rise, in part
because of [INAUDIBLE], in part

01:27:53.881 --> 01:27:55.829
because of the
organization, in part

01:27:55.829 --> 01:27:59.320
because of the changing
character of flooding,

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.600
access to water, and so on.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:09.230
It's almost [INAUDIBLE] risk
of getting cholera in countries

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:11.620
that the disease is epidemic.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.270
There are [INAUDIBLE]
million cases every year.

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:18.960
And if you've never experienced
it, I can assure you,

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.120
it leads to a very
miserable experience.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.250
It's a [INAUDIBLE] disease.

01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:27.400
And of course it changes
from one year to the next.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.892
But there's 100,000 people
dying out of cholera every year.

01:28:32.892 --> 01:28:35.280
And that's not good.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.580
And importantly,
many of those deaths

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:41.810
are avoidable if certain
measures are taken.

01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:44.700
Some of those measures are
difficult. For example,

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.692
providing clean
water [INAUDIBLE]--

01:28:46.692 --> 01:28:49.994
that is not something you
can do in five minutes.

01:28:49.994 --> 01:28:54.270
But other things are
important and manageable.

01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:57.040
For example, how
[INAUDIBLE] and protection

01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:00.300
of water sources, or basic
hygiene and using soap--

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.140
many of those are simple.

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:04.300
So we have a money
project-- work

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.060
with some children in Ghana.

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:14.050
Rick will have all details of
the project and description.

01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:17.470
The purpose is to help reduce
the risk of waterborne disease,

01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:19.456
in particular, cholera.

01:29:19.456 --> 01:29:24.580
The chances of risk are
very likely [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.670
something to be
further developed.

01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:29.440
I would be very surprised
between and December

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.170
if [INAUDIBLE]
something [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:32.170 --> 01:29:34.240
thousands and
thousands of children.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:37.540
But if any of you
have the [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:40.820
clean, clear, useful
game [INAUDIBLE],

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:46.100
then maybe we can become
direct [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:52.050
or someone could be hired
with money [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:55.962
There's the cholera
toolkit, which if you pick--

01:29:55.962 --> 01:29:57.890
show the next slide.

01:29:57.890 --> 01:30:00.890
You see a [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:03.125
There's a chapter
1 program shown.

01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:04.410
There are many stages.

01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:07.670
There's the situation of
preventing how to coordinate,

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:12.224
how to prepare community
aspects, all sorts of things.

01:30:12.224 --> 01:30:17.983
The toolkit [INAUDIBLE] is
extremely rich and detailed.

01:30:17.983 --> 01:30:21.370
And we are now conversing with--
actually, we need two days.

01:30:21.370 --> 01:30:26.230
We should be getting from
them, which are the thing that

01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:30.410
the [INAUDIBLE] practice.

01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:33.930
So who ever ends up
taking this challenge,

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:36.790
and we hope it
will be two groups,

01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:40.156
it's going to be something
that very directly

01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:42.990
capable of [INAUDIBLE] class.

01:30:42.990 --> 01:30:45.890
And that must feel
good for whoever

01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:49.768
successfully takes on that.

01:30:49.768 --> 01:30:53.850
I do not remember the age group.

01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:58.990
But I'm pretty sure it was
less than 18 and more than 10.

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:01.622
But it may be more
narrow than that.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:02.560
I can't remember.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.590
Ghana is an English
speaking country.

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:06.980
It in [INAUDIBLE] East Africa.

01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:10.100
In terms of [INAUDIBLE],
the UNICEF team

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:14.343
works with [INAUDIBLE] games.

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:18.276
I'm going to pause here
and invite for questions.

01:31:18.276 --> 01:31:20.252
PROFESSOR 1: Any
questions about this one?

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:25.862
OK, no questions on this one.

01:31:25.862 --> 01:31:26.820
PROFESSOR 4: Very good.

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:31.002
Was I very boring or very clear?

01:31:31.002 --> 01:31:32.085
Moving on to the next one.

01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:38.640
If you're having
[INAUDIBLE] slide show,

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.200
you can see through the text?

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.116
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:31:41.116 --> 01:31:42.490
PROFESSOR 4: Good.

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:45.970
So this one is linking early
warning with early action.

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:48.830
Science [INAUDIBLE] progress
of something [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:52.270
likely to accompany
[INAUDIBLE] future.

01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:55.000
And there are
timescales that are

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.025
going to be at the seasonal
level, like El Nino,

01:31:57.025 --> 01:31:58.840
and weeks to months.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:02.543
We're more likely to
focus on it hours to days.

01:32:02.543 --> 01:32:05.370
And in the meantime, in
the case of [INAUDIBLE]

01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:08.270
that's very useful, but
there is a lot being done.

01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:14.490
In the case of heatwaves,
that's not very much lower.

01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:17.360
An issue with heatwaves
is on one hand because

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:20.920
of global warming and
the changing climate,

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:26.530
the recent heatwaves is
very steep [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:26.530 --> 01:32:31.280
You need to remember
from almost a decade ago,

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:36.640
Netherlands, France, Belgium,
they have tens of thousands

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:40.346
of people die
because of the heat.

01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:47.910
And most of those people die for
very, very avoidable reasons.

01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:51.160
So if you're elderly, or
have respiratory problems,

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.780
you have certain legal health
condition, very simple things

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.960
like being in a colder
room with your condition

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:02.790
or drinking more than you
want, that alone can be enough.

01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:07.180
Construction workers
[INAUDIBLE] sports collapse.

01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:10.470
All you have to do is to
suspend the competition,

01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:11.693
or to [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:22.305
So it's very [INAUDIBLE]
and consistently take people

01:33:22.305 --> 01:33:23.707
by surprise.

01:33:23.707 --> 01:33:25.123
So the purpose of
these games will

01:33:25.123 --> 01:33:30.670
be to support Red Cross,
especially as a [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:34.310
So they can learn what are
the simple actions taken

01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:38.097
to save lives, not only at
home but more importantly,

01:33:38.097 --> 01:33:41.540
the lives of [INAUDIBLE]
members of the community.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:45.380
The chance for the [INAUDIBLE]
also is pretty big.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:48.450
But it's a little bit
more of a timeline.

01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:51.465
So it will begin-- we
start looking in January.

01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:53.200
We will need some [INAUDIBLE].

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:58.970
But there are some
institutional needs to embed.

01:33:58.970 --> 01:34:01.880
Once they exist, it has to go
through Red Cross channels,

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:05.070
which can be more complicated
than going in through school

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:08.120
children, where if it is
picked, it goes viral quickly.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.160
But it's still a very good one.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.790
Again, it's one that can
lead to saving real lives.

01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:17.430
And there plenty of resources
within the Red Cross

01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:18.790
and beyond.

01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:22.740
Importantly, there is a
master's student at Harvard

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.385
who is doing her
entire thesis on this.

01:34:24.385 --> 01:34:25.940
And we're going to
have at least one,

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:31.130
maybe two, hack-a-thons
dealing with heatwave risk.

01:34:31.130 --> 01:34:32.990
The Harvard student,
her name is Elle.

01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.948
She's really great fun.

01:34:33.948 --> 01:34:37.090
And she would be a collaborator.

01:34:37.090 --> 01:34:42.740
And this will have a lot
of chances of growth.

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:46.550
If you did see a photo from
the Netherlands heatwave,

01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:51.750
and Red Cross volunteer helping
an elderly lady just hydrate,

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:57.550
and do that lady did not die,
whereas tens of thousands did.

01:34:57.550 --> 01:35:00.920
Can you come up with a
game that helps people

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.096
make such simple decisions?

01:35:03.096 --> 01:35:07.080
And I'm sure there's
a way to make it fun.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.110
So overview-- one
or two questions?

01:35:11.110 --> 01:35:14.310
PROFESSOR 1: Any
questions on this one?

01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:16.580
So the target audience
on this one's different.

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.710
It's Red Cross
volunteers and staffers.

01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:20.910
It's probably as part
of their training?

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:21.970
PROFESSOR 4: Correct.

01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:25.050
So the way we envision this--
actually I dind't mention--

01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:29.770
the way you envisions this one
is to have the game as ready,

01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:34.670
deployable but on the shelf.

01:35:34.670 --> 01:35:38.210
And then when there's a forecast
of a heatwave likely to happen

01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:44.040
over the coming six days,
then we blast the game

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.090
to the Red Cross volunteers.

01:35:46.090 --> 01:35:50.460
So they become very quickly
familiar with the very core

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:53.965
aspect of it, of course
complemented with others

01:35:53.965 --> 01:35:56.440
like maybe face to face
training, or mainly sending

01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.798
documents to read But this
would be potentially very

01:36:00.798 --> 01:36:04.060
easy to adapt or translate
to many languages.

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.065
And again, Chicago,
Boston-- there's

01:36:07.065 --> 01:36:08.660
plenty of places even in the US.

01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:12.450
This is the one that would be
easiest to play test locally

01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:16.640
because we can-- And the
profile of a Red Cross volunteer

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.140
is not necessarily too different
from the profile of university

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:23.900
students who are engaged
in do-good activities.

01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:29.890
PROFESSOR 1: OK,
on to the next one.

01:36:29.890 --> 01:36:32.830
PROFESSOR 4: All right,
moving to the next one.

01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:36.130
The next one is
the most complex.

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.920
Do you see the drawing of
the time bomb with the fuse?

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:45.960
PROFESSOR 1: Yes.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.670
PROFESSOR 4: OK.

01:36:47.670 --> 01:36:51.560
So allow me to give a
little bit of context.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.913
We did a little bit
of this conversation

01:36:53.913 --> 01:36:56.046
when I showed up
a few weeks ago,

01:36:56.046 --> 01:36:58.900
but I imagine you
all forgot by now.

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:04.390
The humanitarian sector has
two main funding mechanisms.

01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:07.640
Imagine a pot of money.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.950
Even if there's almost no
money there, if the pot exists,

01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:15.990
money can go in, to then
be taken out to spend.

01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:18.750
One of the pots of money that
exists, one of the funding

01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:22.790
mechanisms that exists
is for disaster response,

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:26.150
meaning a hurricane,
flood, volcanic eruption.

01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:30.230
Something has already
happened, is happening,

01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:32.490
and is killing people.

01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:35.100
People are dying, but
if you did something,

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.690
you could save lives.

01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:39.040
For example, get on a
boat and rescue people

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.670
who are stranded on a roof.

01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:42.550
Or people are sick.

01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:44.590
Go give them medicine.

01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:45.860
This is disaster response.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:49.350
And if you spend money, you
can do very good things.

01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:51.627
And the funding
mechanism exists.

01:37:51.627 --> 01:37:55.220
There is another pot of money
which is for a normal days.

01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:56.510
The Red Cross has vehicles.

01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:58.030
The vehicles needs maintenance.

01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:59.450
They need to change tires.

01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:01.360
You need to buy a new computer.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.860
You need to pay rent and
the electricity bills.

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.860
You need to train staff.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:11.036
So on a normal day, you have a
budget for either maintenance,

01:38:11.036 --> 01:38:14.185
or development of new
projects, or writing proposals,

01:38:14.185 --> 01:38:15.330
and so on.

01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:17.090
And when that pot
of money exists,

01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:19.770
we called it the annual appeal.

01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:22.340
Every year, we appeal for help.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:27.430
And people or donors, or
governments give us some money.

01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:31.240
What does not exists is what
the drawing of the cartoon

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:35.750
depicts, which is when there
is a signal from science

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:41.640
that a disasters, that something
bad is likely to happen soon.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:46.770
We don't have money to fund
action before the disaster,

01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:49.060
after the forecast.

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:52.650
So if you click to see
the text, the context

01:38:52.650 --> 01:38:55.200
is that there that
missing money part.

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.930
We have money for
after a disaster,

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.640
we have money for
everyone all day.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.745
But we don't have money
for before the disaster,

01:39:00.745 --> 01:39:02.420
after the forecast.

01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:06.390
The issue is that if you spend
money in that time window,

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:08.500
before the disaster
and after the scientist

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.490
says a disaster
is likely, you can

01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:14.530
do very good things for
very cheap, and relatively

01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:16.330
simply, and much more reliably.

01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:18.380
It's not only more
expensive, but more

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:23.080
difficult to save a life when
the storm waters are flashing

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:26.180
through a city and people
are above the ground.

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:27.910
The boat is unstable.

01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:30.690
Whereas if you do
it the day before,

01:39:30.690 --> 01:39:33.220
when the water has
come down from the sky

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.250
but it's still in the
river and not in the city,

01:39:36.250 --> 01:39:39.110
people can take action
by just walking away,

01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:42.080
on your own means,
with your valuables

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:45.370
and not just depending on
someone to show up with a boat.

01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:47.870
So we came up with a
financial mechanism,

01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:49.870
we call it
forecast-based financing

01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:54.020
for disaster preparedness
which is nuanced

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:55.230
in how it's implemented.

01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:56.410
There is a pot of money.

01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:57.780
It's like a bank account.

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.705
You need to have a
threshold of disaster risk

01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:03.390
that needs to be exceeded.

01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:05.390
So it can not be
two drops of rain.

01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:06.690
It has to be a lot of rain.

01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:08.010
It can not be some wind.

01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.710
It has to be a hurricane
category 1 or more.

01:40:10.710 --> 01:40:12.955
But once the threshold is
established and reached

01:40:12.955 --> 01:40:15.760
by the forecast, then there's
some standard operating

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.450
procedures, some actions
that people have to take,

01:40:19.450 --> 01:40:22.300
spending money to save lives.

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.810
And that is something
that if you could come up

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:31.260
with a game that captures that,
this is the one that if we help

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.470
communicate
forecast-based financing,

01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:37.090
I sent to a colleague because
it can work for a broad audience

01:40:37.090 --> 01:40:37.750
digitally.

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:41.650
Ideally we would reach those
who can contribute either money

01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.610
or decisions, muscle power.

01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:46.500
The chances of
embrace for this one

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.960
are not as high as
on the previous one.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.740
But if it were to happen,
it'll have the highest impact.

01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:55.770
Because right now there's
billions of dollars being

01:40:55.770 --> 01:40:58.130
spent in the two extremes.

01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:01.350
And in the small fraction
where spent investigating

01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:03.040
that precious window
of opportunity--

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.210
when you see that fuse getting
close, that time of effort

01:41:07.210 --> 01:41:09.850
can really have a
very, very high impact.

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:11.480
There's a link to
a journal article

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:15.150
that should be very
clear for MIT students.

01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:18.140
We also have some simpler
readings and journal

01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.730
[INAUDIBLE] I have been engaged
within and are ready to help.

01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:22.920
This is, I insist,
the one that is

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.370
intellectually most challenging.

01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:27.565
But I think if you
nail it, it will also

01:41:27.565 --> 01:41:29.480
be the most rewarding.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:29.980
Questions?

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:35.790
PROFESSOR 1: Any
questions on this one?

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:38.720
So one thing, when we first
started designing this class,

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.024
this is actually the problem
that we're most interested in,

01:41:43.024 --> 01:41:44.440
mainly because the
other problems,

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:47.230
we just hadn't
heard about since.

01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:51.510
Cholera was a recent proposal
that was asked for, and Ebola,

01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:54.690
of course, very,
very recent as well.

01:41:54.690 --> 01:41:57.230
So if you really enjoyed
some of the challenges

01:41:57.230 --> 01:41:59.300
from projects 2 and
3, and you really

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:02.030
took on the planning
aspects, the trade

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:04.810
offs aspects of those
two games, if you're

01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:08.170
looking at trying to
communicate to another person

01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:10.316
how these probabilities
works, this

01:42:10.316 --> 01:42:11.690
is probably a
really good project

01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:14.140
you might be interested in.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.100
PROFESSOR 4: And I
should say also I'm

01:42:16.100 --> 01:42:20.135
working with a few MIT teams,
including the Humanitarian

01:42:20.135 --> 01:42:24.180
Response Lab, including the
Environmental Engineering.

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:27.596
We have two generations
of three students

01:42:27.596 --> 01:42:29.390
plus one professor
going to Uganda to work

01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:32.126
on making this happen for real.

01:42:32.126 --> 01:42:35.369
We got German money to do
it in Togo and in Uganda.

01:42:35.369 --> 01:42:36.660
So it's been meaning to happen.

01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:39.590
But it's hard to explain
because it's dry.

01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:41.310
It's like explaining insurance.

01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:43.560
People get bored
before they get it.

01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.561
So maybe a game can
help launch it a bit.

01:42:48.561 --> 01:42:49.060
Good.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.100
Then we'll move on.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.310
Number 4, Ebola.

01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:55.790
And I have to be very candid.

01:42:55.790 --> 01:43:00.293
I come from climate research,
climate and disasters.

01:43:00.293 --> 01:43:02.417
And as far as we
know, Ebola does not

01:43:02.417 --> 01:43:04.970
have much of a climate signal.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:09.140
But, as I'm sure you know,
it's a very importantly thing.

01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:10.522
And the idea for
bringing this up

01:43:10.522 --> 01:43:12.230
is that one of my
[INAUDIBLE] colleagues,

01:43:12.230 --> 01:43:16.730
Steven Ryan one day
sent a message saying,

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.640
tonight I'm arriving in Liberia
to work for a month with a Red

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.945
Cross national team that is
doing it's best to respond

01:43:21.945 --> 01:43:23.395
to the Ebola outbreak.

01:43:23.395 --> 01:43:24.670
And guess what?

01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:28.370
What they're doing, as
its best, is not enough.

01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:32.730
Steven is a
communications specialist.

01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:36.842
As you can imagine, I
feel phenomenal admiration

01:43:36.842 --> 01:43:44.140
and respect for his dangerous
choice to go to the place

01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:48.280
where people are in very
serious trouble to try to help.

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.150
And that made me think,
well, maybe we can help.

01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:53.780
So I sent him an
email, and he kindly

01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:56.430
responded saying, yes, they're
keen on the possibility

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.220
of a game.

01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:02.116
Bear in mind that because
of the cycle of the disease,

01:44:02.116 --> 01:44:05.030
by December chances
are that either it

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.250
became a complete pandemic,
or they [INAUDIBLE]

01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:09.660
is completely gone.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:11.280
So we are not going
to make a game

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.210
to be played in the equivalent
situation as the situation now.

01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:20.290
It would be more of a game about
an awareness of how it works

01:44:20.290 --> 01:44:23.880
and how it can be prevent
in a hopefully less

01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:26.160
than complete crisis mode.

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:30.140
But nonetheless, Steven
and one of his colleagues

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:32.060
were very graceful
to offer themselves

01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:36.780
to be the subject matter
experts and to help,

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:42.080
should a team choose Ebola--
please no more than one team.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:45.500
There's someone on the other
side of Atlantic Ocean that

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.690
is going to try to engage.

01:44:48.690 --> 01:44:51.210
In this one, John and I
do not have expertise.

01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:55.610
I imagine it is possible to find
expertise in the Boston area

01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:59.040
with so many phenomenal
hospitals and so on.

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.700
But it's outside of my control
to offer reliable support when

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.520
it comes to subject matter.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:10.175
I'm sure that there's plenty
of documents from the CDC

01:45:10.175 --> 01:45:12.275
and from health
practitioners that

01:45:12.275 --> 01:45:13.920
can help you design a game.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.360
But whoever chooses
this, it'll be heroic.

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.520
It can be really useful.

01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:22.568
But you have to be most
prepared to work autonomously.

01:45:22.568 --> 01:45:23.520
Any questions?

01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:28.070
PROFESSOR 1: Any?

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:29.237
[INAUDIBLE]

01:45:29.237 --> 01:45:30.570
PROFESSOR 4: Are you guys there?

01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:32.528
PROFESSOR 1: Sorry, I
had the microphone muted.

01:45:32.528 --> 01:45:35.690
No questions on this one.

01:45:35.690 --> 01:45:38.922
PROFESSOR 4: So moving
on to the last one.

01:45:38.922 --> 01:45:41.496
If [INAUDIBLE]
hasn't joined yet,

01:45:41.496 --> 01:45:44.160
then I'll do my best to explain.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:46.190
PROFESSOR 1: Yup, I
haven't seen her yet.

01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:47.910
PROFESSOR 4: So
this is a project

01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:49.760
that is being led by
two of my colleagues,

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.110
including [INAUDIBLE].

01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:53.160
So forgive my ignorance.

01:45:53.160 --> 01:46:00.170
And it's very similar in its
nature to the UNICEF one.

01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:02.910
The difference is that
the UNICEF project

01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:06.575
is for small children about a
very specific health condition

01:46:06.575 --> 01:46:08.300
called cholera.

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:10.356
Whereas this one
is for a partner

01:46:10.356 --> 01:46:11.925
called Plan International.

01:46:11.925 --> 01:46:14.560
It's an NGO that
works with children.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:16.640
They're very good.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.480
They work a lot on the
rights of children.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.340
They are about empowerment.

01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:24.550
And they work intelligently.

01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:29.890
And the Asian team has reached
out to the planning center.

01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:31.650
And I don't if you
can read the words,

01:46:31.650 --> 01:46:35.380
but in summary we want a
game to help children in Asia

01:46:35.380 --> 01:46:37.571
understand climate
change and what

01:46:37.571 --> 01:46:40.720
can be done to adapt
to climate change.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.186
Plan International seeks to
partner with the Red Cross

01:46:43.186 --> 01:46:44.769
[INAUDIBLE] Planning
Center to develop

01:46:44.769 --> 01:46:47.675
a participatory learning
game for children in Asia,

01:46:47.675 --> 01:46:49.140
focus on Southeast Asia.

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:52.220
So all the way from
[INAUDIBLE] Cambodia,

01:46:52.220 --> 01:46:55.085
et cetera, that would
strengthen their understanding

01:46:55.085 --> 01:46:57.510
of local climate change
impacts, and help them

01:46:57.510 --> 01:47:00.410
develop a [INAUDIBLE] what
they and their community

01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:03.630
can do to adapt and
increase their resilience.

01:47:03.630 --> 01:47:05.520
The project will include
the [INAUDIBLE] game

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.420
package, testing, and a
training officer [INAUDIBLE].

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:13.760
The current project does not
include a digital component

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.050
because there
wasn't enough money.

01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:18.900
But like the UNICEF
one, this is an area

01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:21.650
that inevitably has to grow.

01:47:21.650 --> 01:47:24.800
So if any of you comes
up with a prototype that

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.560
is sufficiently playable to
capture something about climate

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.220
change, there's
generally two [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.530
ideas that children can
benefit from learning.

01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:41.520
One is that the trends
of change are dangerous.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.340
[INAUDIBLE] sea level
rise, like drying

01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:49.270
of some sources of drinking
water, as well as the changing

01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:52.420
pattern of extreme events,
which can be about rainfall,

01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.460
can be about temperature, can
be about the winds and cyclones.

01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:59.110
And so children who
have not lived long,

01:47:59.110 --> 01:48:01.164
and therefore don't
have much of a memory,

01:48:01.164 --> 01:48:04.850
are likely to have to
confront information

01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:08.110
about things, extreme
events, disasters

01:48:08.110 --> 01:48:09.935
that they've never
experienced, but they

01:48:09.935 --> 01:48:11.650
have to do something about.

01:48:11.650 --> 01:48:15.260
So the game is not about
one specific threat,

01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:17.390
but is more about the
concept of adaptation

01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:21.330
to planet change, which
of course can be embedded

01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:26.140
into a specific manifestation
of planet change,

01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:32.220
like sea level rise, or like
changing rainfall patterns.

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.555
There was a more clearly
defined age group

01:48:34.555 --> 01:48:36.873
for this one, which
unfortunately I don't

01:48:36.873 --> 01:48:38.770
have off the top of my head.

01:48:38.770 --> 01:48:43.120
But [INAUDIBLE] will be sending
the materials to the team.

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:45.904
So within 24 hours, I
pray that you will have

01:48:45.904 --> 01:48:49.070
all the ingredients you need.

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:51.222
I know I didn't share too much.

01:48:51.222 --> 01:48:53.956
But are there any questions
about what I could share?

01:48:53.956 --> 01:48:55.705
PROFESSOR 1: Any
questions about this one?

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:00.750
No questions on this one.

01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:01.430
PROFESSOR 4: OK.

01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:04.190
Then move onto the next slide.

01:49:04.190 --> 01:49:08.410
We have about 50 minutes
left [INAUDIBLE].

01:49:08.410 --> 01:49:11.420
And based on some
questions and comments,

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:14.730
I'd like to get a
[INAUDIBLE] front room.

01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:16.540
You have all choices here.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:18.190
The first one was snap.

01:49:18.190 --> 01:49:21.235
I need a digital tool to
enhance the snap experience

01:49:21.235 --> 01:49:23.910
of collecting and
processing information.

01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:25.697
Then we have the
UNICEF Ghana, Cholera,

01:49:25.697 --> 01:49:27.696
where we hope we can get
two groups because this

01:49:27.696 --> 01:49:29.026
is a big one.

01:49:29.026 --> 01:49:31.225
Then we have linking early
warning and early action

01:49:31.225 --> 01:49:33.670
maybe focusing on heatwaves.

01:49:33.670 --> 01:49:37.680
Then we have the more
sophisticated, conceptually,

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:40.580
[INAUDIBLE] forecast-based
financing, funding mechanisms

01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:43.880
for disaster preparedness
before the disaster,

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.990
after the forecast.

01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:47.710
And then we have Ebola,
where there's not

01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:50.087
much I can offer other
than if you make a game,

01:49:50.087 --> 01:49:51.670
we can try to hook
you up with people.

01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:55.780
And if you come up with a good
game, it can be really useful.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:58.750
And the final one is
adaptation to climate change

01:49:58.750 --> 01:50:01.180
to be played by children
in Southeast Asia

01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:02.930
so that they understand
climate change.

01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:04.770
Here's what I propose.

01:50:04.770 --> 01:50:07.670
We're going to give
you guys 30 seconds.

01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:15.620
Each one of you choose
one or two secretly

01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:18.660
based on what [INAUDIBLE]
which is completely

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.806
incomplete information.

01:50:20.806 --> 01:50:22.760
But that's the way it is.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.120
Given what you've
heard, choose one or two

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:31.100
of those in the
come 10, 15 seconds.

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.370
I'll give you that time.

01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:36.000
Thanks for your patience.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.050
PROFESSOR 1: Not a problem.

01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:41.655
PROFESSOR 4: And
so what we're going

01:50:41.655 --> 01:50:44.296
to do now is-- you're
all sitting I imagine.

01:50:44.296 --> 01:50:47.644
Actually Rick, can
you show the room?

01:50:47.644 --> 01:50:49.310
PROFESSOR 1: Let me
go back to the Skype

01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:50.515
and turn on our video.

01:51:00.262 --> 01:51:05.242
PROFESSOR 4: So what I
want to do is [INAUDIBLE],

01:51:05.242 --> 01:51:08.920
and if that number
of your chosen one,

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.300
I want you to do two things.

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:16.500
One is to stand up, the
other to shout snap.

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:18.358
But I cannot see everyone.

01:51:18.358 --> 01:51:19.316
I cannot hear everyone.

01:51:19.316 --> 01:51:22.550
But it will give me a
flavor of proportion.

01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:27.496
So item 0, if you're ready
to [INAUDIBLE] stand up,

01:51:27.496 --> 01:51:28.442
[INAUDIBLE].

01:51:28.442 --> 01:51:30.810
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:51:30.810 --> 01:51:32.610
PROFESSOR 4: All
right, so we've got

01:51:32.610 --> 01:51:34.277
maybe one in four [INAUDIBLE].

01:51:34.277 --> 01:51:34.777
Excellent.

01:51:34.777 --> 01:51:36.780
You may sit down.

01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:40.535
Number 1, if it's of
your liking, do it?

01:51:40.535 --> 01:51:43.150
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:46.000
PROFESSOR 4: All right.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:46.820
Good.

01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:50.270
This one, [INAUDIBLE] all
of you guys on a group

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:52.792
because I don't see
enough for two groups.

01:51:52.792 --> 01:51:54.350
[INAUDIBLE]

01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:56.400
Then next one now, for two.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.830
If you're going to do, do it.

01:51:58.830 --> 01:52:00.582
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:52:00.582 --> 01:52:01.540
PROFESSOR 4: All right.

01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:02.956
This one seems popular.

01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:08.791
Number 3, go.

01:52:08.791 --> 01:52:09.416
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:15.370
PROFESSOR 4: Thank you.

01:52:15.370 --> 01:52:17.525
Number 4, show it.

01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:24.144
PROFESSOR 1: 4 was
the funding one?

01:52:24.144 --> 01:52:25.220
PROFESSOR 4: Yes.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:27.000
AUDIENCE: Three was
the funding one.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.559
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:52:28.559 --> 01:52:29.850
PROFESSOR 1: Yup, you're right.

01:52:29.850 --> 01:52:30.910
I'm wrong.

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.560
Yeah, we're counting from 0.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.800
4 is Ebola.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.255
So nobody stood up for this one.

01:52:36.255 --> 01:52:37.530
PROFESSOR 4: OK.

01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:44.365
And if [INAUDIBLE] do
the last one, number 5.

01:52:44.365 --> 01:52:45.612
Go for it.

01:52:45.612 --> 01:52:46.236
AUDIENCE: Snap.

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:51.936
PROFESSOR 4: OK, so
we're focused then.

01:52:51.936 --> 01:52:54.320
I don't know, Rick
and team, what

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.421
you had in mind for this time.

01:52:56.421 --> 01:52:58.760
But given that we
went relatively fast,

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.575
what we could do
is you could point

01:53:00.575 --> 01:53:04.810
to different places of the
room and talk [INAUDIBLE]

01:53:04.810 --> 01:53:08.700
0 middle, left is 1, and so on.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:11.160
And invite people to just
answer with your feet.

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:15.008
Which is the location
they most want to go to?

01:53:15.008 --> 01:53:16.560
So we get a sense
of how many people

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.674
want to engage in which game.

01:53:20.674 --> 01:53:21.340
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:23.800
So we've got it on the board.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:29.730
Cholera here, Ebola
here, early warning here.

01:53:29.730 --> 01:53:32.840
These are actually
behind you, so I'm going

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.790
to have to rotate the computer.

01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:38.680
Snap over there,
adaptation here,

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.380
and disaster prep funding,
the forecast-based funding

01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.110
over here.

01:53:43.110 --> 01:53:45.570
PROFESSOR 3: Let's draw
out the numbers as well.

01:53:45.570 --> 01:53:47.486
PROFESSOR 1: Oh yeah,
I'll put the numbers up.

01:53:47.486 --> 01:53:51.670
PROFESSOR 3: So snap
was 0, cholera was 1,

01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:58.240
early warning was 2,
funding was 3, Ebola was 4,

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.390
and adaptation to
climate change, 5.

01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:05.590
PROFESSOR 4: So
answer with your feet.

01:54:05.590 --> 01:54:07.352
You can not stay
sitting for [INAUDIBLE].

01:54:17.474 --> 01:54:20.110
And now Rick and team,
I'm going to invite you,

01:54:20.110 --> 01:54:24.240
because you know best what
is required for each group,

01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:27.070
be it finance grouping, in
terms of quantity of people,

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:29.340
in terms of profile
[INAUDIBLE], there

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:33.470
won't be code geeks
in one, and then

01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:35.870
narrative geeks on the other.

01:54:35.870 --> 01:54:38.550
If you understand this,
at least what happens now

01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:41.480
is in now way definitive.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:43.970
But it's to get a
sense [INAUDIBLE].

01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:44.720
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.814
So actually this
leads really well

01:54:46.814 --> 01:54:47.980
into what we're about to do.

01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:50.750
We're going to do some
brainstorming on these topics.

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:53.489
So we're going to first
have each of the groups

01:54:53.489 --> 01:54:56.030
just do a little bit of a quick
brainstorming about the topic

01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:57.910
that they're standing
with right now.

01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:59.410
And then midway
through, we're going

01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.125
to invite you to go
over to a new group

01:55:01.125 --> 01:55:02.500
to talk about a
different project

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.050
if you're interested in talking
about that other project.

01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:08.160
On Monday, we're going
to actually form the team

01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:10.750
and make sure all the teams
meet our requirements.

01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:13.780
But it's basically seven
to eight people per team.

01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:16.252
We're hoping for
eight people per team,

01:55:16.252 --> 01:55:17.460
hopefully not more than that.

01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:19.650
But we'll figure
that out as we go.

01:55:19.650 --> 01:55:24.500
And over the weekend, we'll
be using the mailing list

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.999
to talk about the projects.

01:55:26.999 --> 01:55:29.290
So I'm actually going to
let-- we're going to start off

01:55:29.290 --> 01:55:30.854
with this brainstorming.

01:55:30.854 --> 01:55:32.270
We're going to
take a break, we're

01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:33.770
going to do some
more brainstorming.

01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:36.460
And then I will
more clearly outline

01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:41.389
how the mechanism is going to
work between now and Monday.

01:55:41.389 --> 01:55:43.180
PROFESSOR 4: Do you
need me to stay online.

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.080
PROFESSOR 1: No.

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.380
What we would like
is-- are you going

01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:50.170
to be on email between
now and Monday?

01:55:50.170 --> 01:55:53.080
PROFESSOR 4: Yes, but only
with very limited ability

01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:54.540
to read and respond.

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:57.490
So make sure to make the
subject line very clear

01:55:57.490 --> 01:55:59.992
and the questions as snappy
and answerable as possible.

01:55:59.992 --> 01:56:02.200
PROFESSOR 1: And you don't
mind if give all the teams

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:04.320
your email address?

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:06.955
PROFESSOR 4: No mind-- but
teams, please, please, please,

01:56:06.955 --> 01:56:11.335
I beg you, consolidate
your questions.

01:56:11.335 --> 01:56:14.550
Be very efficient
with your writing.

01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:17.660
Because if I get too many
emails or too wordy, excessive

01:56:17.660 --> 01:56:20.526
verbosity, I will not
be able to get it.

01:56:20.526 --> 01:56:22.400
PROFESSOR 1: So I'll
figure out a mechanism--

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:27.400
PROFESSOR 4: [INAUDIBLE] fine,
a channel within each group

01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:29.729
to communicate and consolidate.

01:56:29.729 --> 01:56:31.520
PROFESSOR 1: So I'll
figure out a mechanism

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.436
to make sure you're not
overloaded with email,

01:56:33.436 --> 01:56:36.300
and to make sure everyone gets
the benefits of those emails

01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:36.994
to you.

01:56:36.994 --> 01:56:37.744
PROFESSOR 4: Good.

01:56:37.744 --> 01:56:41.030
And I suggest that you
always copy [INAUDIBLE].

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.370
All right, so good
luck to you all.

01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:48.915
Thanks again for your
time and inspiration.

01:56:48.915 --> 01:56:52.340
And I wish you good
luck [INAUDIBLE].

01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:53.030
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.696
Thank you Pablo.

01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.470
OK so you're in your groups.

01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:06.680
I have paper for people
who are not on chalkboards.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.280
Do we have nobody for Ebola?

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.470
PROFESSOR 3: No one.

01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:12.600
PROFESSOR 1: Then let's give
snap the Ebola-- actually

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:13.680
you're pretty big.

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:15.150
Let's not.

01:57:15.150 --> 01:57:16.730
These two groups are pretty big.

01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:18.230
Let's give them
space to spread out.

01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:21.430
So what we're going to do is
just a really quick brainstorm.

01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:25.260
Five minutes-- just choose
one person to be a secretary.

01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:28.409
Have them come up.

01:57:28.409 --> 01:57:30.200
You've heard a little
bit about the topics.

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.800
You haven't done any
of the reading yet.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.050
We're going to have all that
reading available for you

01:57:34.050 --> 01:57:36.302
on Stellar right now for you
to read over the weekend.

01:57:36.302 --> 01:57:37.010
It's a lot of it.

01:57:37.010 --> 01:57:38.593
We don't expect you
to read all of it.

01:57:38.593 --> 01:57:41.050
But we do expect
you to look at it.

01:57:41.050 --> 01:57:44.080
Based on what you understand,
what kind of mechanics

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.540
could come out of
these kind of topics?

01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:49.320
Just based on the
word cholera, based

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:51.360
on the word early
warning, early action,

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.450
what kind of game
mechanics pop out of that?

01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:55.620
And just through
them on the board.

01:57:55.620 --> 01:58:03.010
So disaster prep-- let me
hand these off to those two.

01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:08.010
PROFESSOR 3: To disaster prep,
or to more than one group?

01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:10.042
PROFESSOR 1: One to one,
and one to the other.

01:58:10.042 --> 01:58:12.250
PROFESSOR 3: We had a question
like that, by the way.

01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:14.220
Rick, we have
questions in the back.

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:16.010
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah, one second.

01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:16.990
What's the question?

01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.970
From who?

01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:19.761
PROFESSOR 3: Let's
stick it up on the wall?

01:58:19.761 --> 01:58:20.770
PROFESSOR 1: What's up?

01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:23.050
PROFESSOR 3: You guys
probably need the stand.

01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:28.440
STUDENT 13: What game engines
would-- is it the same

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.430
as other previous ones?

01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:30.290
PROFESSOR 1: Same
as previous ones.

01:58:30.290 --> 01:58:31.630
We'll talk about the
constraints on Monday.

01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:33.200
Don't worry about the
constraints right now.

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:34.824
Right now just focus
on game mechanics.

01:58:34.824 --> 01:58:38.100
STUDENT 13: [INAUDIBLE]
mobile [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:40.890
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah,
so keep it blue sky.

01:58:40.890 --> 01:58:41.820
You can be mobile.

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:46.030
You can be on tablets,
you could be a computer.

01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:48.280
It could be single player,
it could be multiplayer.

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:52.345
Just don't do
multiplayer networking.

01:58:52.345 --> 01:58:52.845
That's it.

01:58:52.845 --> 01:58:53.800
STUDENT 13: Our game has--

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.755
PROFESSOR 1: What's that?

01:58:54.755 --> 01:58:56.290
Our game's definition
is [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:57.450
PROFESSOR 1: Then what are the
ways you're going to get around

01:58:57.450 --> 01:58:58.310
that like we talked about?

01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:59.893
STUDENT 13: Without
doing multiplayer?

01:58:59.893 --> 01:59:03.140
PROFESSOR 1: Without doing
multiple devices connecting

01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:04.890
to a single server.

01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:05.830
There's other ways.

01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:07.871
Don't even think about it
for this brainstorming.

01:59:07.871 --> 01:59:09.440
Just don't worry
about it for now.

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:11.072
Here we go.

01:59:11.072 --> 01:59:12.090
Pass these out.

01:59:12.090 --> 01:59:15.795
All right, so five minutes, go.

01:59:15.795 --> 01:59:19.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:42.876
PROFESSOR 1: This is in
case my wife sends pictures.

01:59:42.876 --> 01:59:45.440
So I have another
group that we work

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:47.860
with is doing an EdX course.

01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:59:55.777 --> 01:59:57.860
PROFESSOR 1: We've done
about 15 minutes of really

01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.360
quick and dirty brainstorming.

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:02.977
Somebody from your group
shout out one or two

02:00:02.977 --> 02:00:05.060
really, really interesting
idea that you're really

02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:05.670
excited about.

02:00:05.670 --> 02:00:09.730
Just one person, one group,
interesting ideas, this group

02:00:09.730 --> 02:00:10.230
go.

02:00:10.230 --> 02:00:13.194
STUDENT 14: Spatial
placement of wells affecting

02:00:13.194 --> 02:00:14.695
where cholera spreads.

02:00:14.695 --> 02:00:16.070
PROFESSOR 1: So
spatial placement

02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:17.640
of wells affecting
where cholera spreads?

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:18.410
STUDENT 14: Yeah.

02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.830
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:20.020
So a spatial puzzle
kind of game.

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:20.760
STUDENT 14: Exactly.

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:21.918
PROFESSOR 1: One more idea?

02:00:21.918 --> 02:00:24.684
STUDENT 15: Animal crossing
with cholera and puzzles.

02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:26.100
PROFESSOR 1: Yes,
animal crossing.

02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:29.312
I'd think about the
scope on that one.

02:00:29.312 --> 02:00:31.089
STUDENT 16: Playing
as a heatwave.

02:00:31.089 --> 02:00:32.630
PROFESSOR 1: Playing
as the heatwave,

02:00:32.630 --> 02:00:34.170
you are the heatwave, cool.

02:00:34.170 --> 02:00:36.039
One other idea?

02:00:36.039 --> 02:00:37.455
STUDENT 17: Playing
as a Red Cross

02:00:37.455 --> 02:00:39.210
volunteer, managing resources.

02:00:39.210 --> 02:00:40.450
PROFESSOR 1: OK, not as cool.

02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:43.190
Heatwave [INAUDIBLE] volunteer.

02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:43.760
Over here.

02:00:46.230 --> 02:00:47.688
STUDENT 18: You're
on a tiny island

02:00:47.688 --> 02:00:50.143
and you live on the island and
you do stuff on the island.

02:00:50.143 --> 02:00:51.125
But your island is shrinking.

02:00:51.125 --> 02:00:52.317
So you have to collect
resources on your island

02:00:52.317 --> 02:00:53.089
to move to the bigger island.

02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:54.315
The bigger island
is shrinking too

02:00:54.315 --> 02:00:55.544
because the water
keeps going up.

02:00:55.544 --> 02:00:57.508
So you hop, and hop, and hop,
and you arrive at the mainland.

02:00:57.508 --> 02:00:58.424
Yay, everyone's saved!

02:00:58.424 --> 02:01:01.927
Except the mainland
is a giant island too.

02:01:01.927 --> 02:01:03.694
Whaa, whaa, whaa.

02:01:03.694 --> 02:01:05.360
PROFESSOR 1: Whaa,
whaa, climate change.

02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:05.840
Cool.

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:06.340
Thank you.

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.889
Another idea, or is
that the big one?

02:01:08.889 --> 02:01:10.930
STUDENT 19: The decision
between chopping forests

02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:13.804
and to build more buildings
for faster development,

02:01:13.804 --> 02:01:16.199
or to keep the
forest air help make

02:01:16.199 --> 02:01:17.541
climate change less severe.

02:01:17.541 --> 02:01:18.290
PROFESSOR 1: Cool.

02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:21.530
So one's kind of, you
don't have much action.

02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:23.160
The world is going around you.

02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:25.020
This one is kind
of, you have action.

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.230
The decisions you make are
going to affect things.

02:01:27.230 --> 02:01:27.960
Cool.

02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.830
This group here?

02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:34.032
This was snap right, this group?

02:01:34.032 --> 02:01:34.740
One or two ideas?

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.880
STUDENT 20: Well,
so I was thinking

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.720
about not just choosing
words, but given a scenario,

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:50.000
making a particular decision
can vary in two decisions

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.582
other people made given that
exact same set of [INAUDIBLE].

02:01:53.582 --> 02:01:55.040
PROFESSOR 1: OK,
so really thinking

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.270
about how you're going to
make this simple decision,

02:01:58.270 --> 02:02:00.415
or this simple interaction
that the game has,

02:02:00.415 --> 02:02:01.790
make it a little
bit more complex

02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:03.346
and really kind of bring
the decision making out

02:02:03.346 --> 02:02:05.637
in the forefront-- is that
kind of what it sounds like?

02:02:05.637 --> 02:02:06.930
Right?

02:02:06.930 --> 02:02:08.181
Yeah, what's up?

02:02:08.181 --> 02:02:10.586
STUDENT 21: The was I
understood the game,

02:02:10.586 --> 02:02:13.660
or the description
for snap is that it's

02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:16.015
more of a data
collection method,

02:02:16.015 --> 02:02:17.890
like collecting what people--

02:02:17.890 --> 02:02:19.350
PROFESSOR 1: That's at least
the purpose they want, is they

02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:20.200
want that data.

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:21.765
Well they want to
collect that data.

02:02:21.765 --> 02:02:23.640
But they also want to
reflect that data back.

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.210
So it's a little bit
of a visualization.

02:02:25.210 --> 02:02:26.740
It's actually a of
a visualization,

02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:29.740
as much as it is collection.

02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:34.209
Are those the only groups,
or the only concepts?

02:02:34.209 --> 02:02:35.500
Oh yeah, disaster preparedness.

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.410
Everybody's disappeared.

02:02:37.410 --> 02:02:39.730
Anybody from that group want
to run over to the sheet

02:02:39.730 --> 02:02:42.350
and say an idea or two?

02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:43.599
Or you just kind of--

02:02:43.599 --> 02:02:46.015
STUDENT 22: I think we just
got stuck on the brainstorming

02:02:46.015 --> 02:02:47.957
because the program
is not as easy.

02:02:47.957 --> 02:02:49.040
PROFESSOR 1: So it's hard.

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.206
It's going to be a hard one.

02:02:50.206 --> 02:02:53.656
STUDENT 23: One idea we
came up with was building

02:02:53.656 --> 02:02:56.490
an infrastructure
and you would decide

02:02:56.490 --> 02:03:00.970
whether to keep expanding or
to reinforce the structure.

02:03:00.970 --> 02:03:03.660
And that way, you
would oh, are you

02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:07.055
preparing for before the
disaster or after the disaster.

02:03:07.055 --> 02:03:08.507
Did you have something to add?

02:03:08.507 --> 02:03:09.965
STUDENT 24: I was
just going to say

02:03:09.965 --> 02:03:12.640
we felt like we needed to do
more reading to understand

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.747
exactly what [INAUDIBLE].

02:03:13.747 --> 02:03:15.330
PROFESSOR 1: But
something about there

02:03:15.330 --> 02:03:18.467
is something that can be
built to spend that money on.

02:03:18.467 --> 02:03:20.300
So it's not just about
collecting the money,

02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:22.030
it's that money's
going to go somewhere.

02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:23.792
Which I remember him
saying at least--

02:03:23.792 --> 02:03:25.500
I don't know if it
was a meeting with me,

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:28.225
or if it was one of the first
times he came to class to talk.

02:03:28.225 --> 02:03:30.820
But I remember that came up.

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.770
Take a quick couple
minutes, one person

02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:36.150
from each group make a copy
of all the ideas you have

02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:39.050
on the board somehow,
like a photograph,

02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:43.680
or-- actually just take
a photograph of it,

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:45.430
and then come back
to your seats.

02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:48.120
We've got two more slides, then
we're going to release you.

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:29.300
PROFESSOR 1: So after you've
taken your captures, sit down.

02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:42.339
What next?

02:04:42.339 --> 02:04:43.880
I'm going to stand
in front because I

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:46.560
can't see what my slides say.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.630
So today we brainstormed
in groups on these topics.

02:04:52.630 --> 02:04:55.670
Between now and Monday,
what we'd like you to do

02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:59.210
is use the mailing list, the
videogames@mit.edu at mailing

02:04:59.210 --> 02:05:02.350
list to form teams.

02:05:02.350 --> 02:05:05.020
In class on Monday,
we will actually also

02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:06.690
set aside time in the
beginning of class

02:05:06.690 --> 02:05:08.720
to make sure that all
these teams get formed.

02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:10.410
And we're going to do some more
brainstorming and some more

02:05:10.410 --> 02:05:11.470
pitching on Monday.

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:13.860
And I'll go into more detail
about the requirements

02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:14.960
for the project 4.

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:17.170
But make sure you read
the project 4 assignment.

02:05:17.170 --> 02:05:19.170
That's basically all I'm going
to be doing is just saying

02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:20.540
out loud what it says in there.

02:05:23.190 --> 02:05:26.300
So before next class,
do these things.

02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:27.940
Read the material in Stellar.

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:30.360
All the topics have some
material in Stellar.

02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:34.730
The Ebola topic did not,
the snap topic did not,

02:05:34.730 --> 02:05:36.640
but cholera has the
tool kit that he'd

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.140
that he mentioned up there.

02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:46.280
Early warning, early action has
a like a task force guideline,

02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:49.600
like a idea of world
disasters from 2009, I think.

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.640
And then another
journal article.

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:55.880
Disaster prep funding has that
forecast-based funding journal

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.340
article attached to it.

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.360
Adaptation for
climate change, we

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:01.810
don't have materials
yet for that.

02:06:01.810 --> 02:06:03.797
But that should be
coming in today.

02:06:03.797 --> 02:06:05.255
And that'll be put
up into Stellar.

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:09.560
That's all of that, right?

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:13.990
So when you're in your groups,
think about these questions.

02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:16.020
And think about these
questions until Monday.

02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:19.572
Did you actually have eight
people interested in your topic

02:06:19.572 --> 02:06:21.780
when you were in your group
together, like think back

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:22.890
about the brainstorming.

02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:25.300
Did you see seven
other individuals

02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.354
interested in the topic?

02:06:26.354 --> 02:06:28.020
If you did, you can
probably make a game

02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:29.159
based on that topic.

02:06:29.159 --> 02:06:31.200
If you didn't, it's going
to be difficult to find

02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:32.910
people for your team.

02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:34.520
So really use the
mailing list and try

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:37.010
to figure out ways
to use the mailing

02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:38.832
to try to attract
people to your topic.

02:06:38.832 --> 02:06:40.790
If there's something
about like the game design

02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:42.942
that you came up,
a personal reason

02:06:42.942 --> 02:06:44.400
why you'd like to
see this game get

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:47.451
made, throw it to
the mailing list.

02:06:47.451 --> 02:06:49.450
If you really don't care
about the topic so much

02:06:49.450 --> 02:06:51.590
or any of these topics, but you
really want to do programming,

02:06:51.590 --> 02:06:52.750
you really want to
do art, you really

02:06:52.750 --> 02:06:54.210
want to do code,
whatever you want

02:06:54.210 --> 02:06:56.626
to do, if that's the thing
that you're most interested in,

02:06:56.626 --> 02:06:58.930
that game engine
you want to use,

02:06:58.930 --> 02:07:01.590
throw an email to the
class to say, hey, use me.

02:07:01.590 --> 02:07:03.090
Here's what I'm
interested in doing.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.544
Put me on your team, basically.

02:07:08.544 --> 02:07:11.210
If you're more interested in the
mechanic design over the topic,

02:07:11.210 --> 02:07:12.080
that's also OK.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.045
So you might not be
interested in the topic,

02:07:14.045 --> 02:07:16.044
but you're interested in
some of these mechanics

02:07:16.044 --> 02:07:19.190
that we've been talking about in
class, or some of the mechanics

02:07:19.190 --> 02:07:22.100
that you heard mentioned
in the group brainstorms,

02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:24.420
so mention that in mailing list.

02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.670
Again, team information
will be finalized on Monday.

02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:28.450
And if you are
undecided, I'm just

02:07:28.450 --> 02:07:30.022
going to stick you in a team.

02:07:30.022 --> 02:07:31.730
That's the worst thing
that could happen.

02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:32.770
Because if I just
put you in a team,

02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:35.314
I'm not thinking about who
you're going to work best with.

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.730
I'm not thinking about what
game engine you're working on.

02:07:37.730 --> 02:07:39.700
I'm not thinking about
is whether or not you're

02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:41.240
interested in the topic or not.

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:43.671
I'm just grabbing you, and
sticking you on a team.

02:07:43.671 --> 02:07:45.920
So do all the work for me,
so I don't have to do that.

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:49.260
And if you do just want
me to do that, that's OK.

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:51.359
I like rolling dice.

02:07:51.359 --> 02:07:53.900
Do we have any questions about
this, any concerns about this?

02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:54.400
Yes.

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.370
STUDENT 25: Are you
targeting five teams?

02:07:56.370 --> 02:07:58.820
PROFESSOR 1: No, I'm
targeting teams of eight.

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:04.260
So that's five teams, but
it could be four teams if we

02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:06.150
need more people on the teams.

02:08:06.150 --> 02:08:10.980
I would recommend 10
being your biggest cap.

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:14.530
In the past, we have seen
10 person teams work-ish.

02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:20.160
They failed everywhere you
think they failed, communication

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:22.399
largely, scheduling largely.

02:08:22.399 --> 02:08:23.940
The one thing they
didn't have that I

02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:25.410
think you're more
prepared to do,

02:08:25.410 --> 02:08:26.990
if you were in a
big team like that,

02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:29.980
is that they didn't understand
how to break out the strike

02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:32.850
groups, into strike teams,
how to separate tasks and form

02:08:32.850 --> 02:08:34.180
into smaller groups.

02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:37.370
I've actually seen you all
do this on these previous two

02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:38.250
projects.

02:08:38.250 --> 02:08:40.399
So if you do find
yourself in a large team,

02:08:40.399 --> 02:08:42.440
think about how you're
going to break the work up

02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:48.670
into the small tasks, into these
bigger, modular kind of things.

02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:51.346
Especially think about
why you're in this class.

02:08:51.346 --> 02:08:53.220
What did you expect to
get out of this class?

02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:55.850
What do you expect to get
out of this final project?

02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:58.490
If you wanted to do some
really big tech thing,

02:08:58.490 --> 02:09:01.350
there are some ideas out here
that require some heavy tech

02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.937
lifting.

02:09:01.937 --> 02:09:04.520
If you're in designer, there's
some really, really challenging

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:08.800
design issues, especially with
that forecast-based funding.

02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:13.180
I'm really leaving
that up to you.

02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.263
But I'm going to make sure
that all the teams have

02:09:15.263 --> 02:09:16.670
eight people.

02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:17.640
Any other questions?

02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:25.320
PROFESSOR 3: Just one
statement [INAUDIBLE].

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.560
Especially with
the snap team, I do

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:33.280
realize that as
presented to you today,

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.690
it really does seem
like a networking game.

02:09:35.690 --> 02:09:37.800
That really does seem
like a game that will

02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.460
involve a lot of networking.

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.505
And of course, we've
spent the entire semester

02:09:41.505 --> 02:09:45.110
so far telling you, oh
good lord, don't do that.

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:49.220
So it could be a
huge tech challenge,

02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:51.030
or it could be a huge
design challenge.

02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:53.830
The huge design challenge is
how do you accomplish everything

02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:56.240
that we think we need
networking to accomplish

02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.120
without networking.

02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.870
Or it could be a tech
challenge that's, screw it,

02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:03.080
we're going to do networking.

02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:09.120
Then it becomes what's the least
brittle way to accomplish that.

02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:11.490
The problem with networking
and that particular game

02:10:11.490 --> 02:10:15.240
is that to require
networking means

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:19.845
that you need to play this
game in a room with networking.

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:21.970
Which means if you take it
to a room without Wi-Fi,

02:10:21.970 --> 02:10:24.520
for instance, that means it's
got to be something that's

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.860
going to work over
a phone system,

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.650
or it's going to
require short messages,

02:10:29.650 --> 02:10:32.200
or something ridiculous.

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:33.630
And if you don't
have networking,

02:10:33.630 --> 02:10:34.710
it's going to be like, what
are you going to be doing.

02:10:34.710 --> 02:10:36.650
Are you going to point
a camera in a room

02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:38.319
and do image capture,
or something?

02:10:38.319 --> 02:10:39.860
It's like some crazy
things-- are you

02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:42.470
going to do manual data entry?

02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:44.330
That's actually a possibility.

02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:46.190
Anything that you
can come up with that

02:10:46.190 --> 02:10:49.420
makes that game that we played
in class slightly easier

02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:53.120
might be beneficial for Pablo.

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.980
And he's guaranteed
that he will use it

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.910
as soon as you provide it.

02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:59.680
So that's an
incentive right there.

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:02.530
But it is possibly,
despite how simple

02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:05.340
that game is, possibly
one of the toughest design

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:08.019
challenges that I can
see on the board today.

02:11:08.019 --> 02:11:09.560
PROFESSOR 1: Up
until now, we've been

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:13.240
really strict in allowing
you to use specific tools,

02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.770
use specific methods.

02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:16.340
We're going to start easing up.

02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:19.850
But if you break any of the
rules, you need to tell us why.

02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:21.250
That's all we ask.

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:23.684
If you are going to use
multiplayer, tell us why.

02:11:23.684 --> 02:11:25.850
If you're not going to use
one of these game engines

02:11:25.850 --> 02:11:28.980
that we've been practicing
on for this semester, really,

02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:31.090
you really need to convince us.

02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:33.670
So use the office hours
like [? Sarah ?] suggested.

02:11:33.670 --> 02:11:34.710
Use the mailing list.

02:11:34.710 --> 02:11:36.240
Talk to us during class.

02:11:36.240 --> 02:11:38.040
I've already had
quite a few students

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:40.290
talk to me individually, and
talk to them individually

02:11:40.290 --> 02:11:41.826
about these kinds of thing.

02:11:41.826 --> 02:11:43.200
The rules are
there to be broken.

02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:47.030
But don't break all
of them at once.

02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.670
Break one.

02:11:47.670 --> 02:11:50.180
PROFESSOR 3: If you're going
to get rid of like the task

02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:54.570
list or something like that,
what are you replacing it with?

02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:59.257
Tell us if you're going to
be not doing daily scrums

02:11:59.257 --> 02:12:00.840
because it doesn't
work for your team.

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:03.580
What are you replacing that
communication strategy with?

02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:05.930
Because it's clearly there
for a particular reason.

02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:08.060
Hopefully you've
seen the reason,

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.410
even if you haven't
necessarily managed to make

02:12:10.410 --> 02:12:11.780
it work on a previous team.

02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:16.280
So what are you going
to do in its place?

02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:17.280
Sarah, did you want to--

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.735
PROFESSOR 2: I think
you guys covered it all.

02:12:19.735 --> 02:12:22.920
About all I can do is
restate the [INAUDIBLE]

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.610
about breaking rules.

02:12:24.610 --> 02:12:27.890
And it's break rules with care.

02:12:27.890 --> 02:12:30.949
We didn't give them to
you just to be arbitrary.

02:12:30.949 --> 02:12:32.490
We gave them to you
in our experience

02:12:32.490 --> 02:12:34.830
of watching a lot of
students make a lot of games,

02:12:34.830 --> 02:12:37.880
and make a lot of mistakes.

02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.790
These are the big pits
that people dig themselves

02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:42.700
in and then climb
down and wonder

02:12:42.700 --> 02:12:44.730
what the heck they're doing in.

02:12:44.730 --> 02:12:48.234
So if you're going to break
a rule, have a plan for it .

02:12:48.234 --> 02:12:49.900
Come and talk to us
about whether or not

02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:51.820
you think your plan will work.

02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:55.130
We are here to try and
support, and give you advice,

02:12:55.130 --> 02:12:55.970
and help out.

02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:57.970
PROFESSOR 3: I think it's
fair to say that we've

02:12:57.970 --> 02:13:01.320
seen every single rule that we
provided actually successfully

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:04.910
broken in every single year.

02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:05.667
Not all the time--

02:13:05.667 --> 02:13:07.250
PROFESSOR 1: Except
for that bad year.

02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:07.990
PROFESSOR 3: The what?

02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.470
PROFESSOR 1: Except
for that bad year.

02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:10.178
PROFESSOR 3: Except
for that one bad year

02:13:10.178 --> 02:13:11.824
where every project was crap.

02:13:11.824 --> 02:13:14.337
PROFESSOR 2: Don't be that year.

02:13:14.337 --> 02:13:15.920
PROFESSOR 1: No,
you're not that year.

02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:17.240
PROFESSOR 2: You're
not that year.

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:19.406
PROFESSOR 1: And Paulina
was in the class last year.

02:13:19.406 --> 02:13:22.460
So if you're looking
for student level, what

02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:24.546
was it like during this
project, talk to Paulina.

02:13:24.546 --> 02:13:25.420
She can help you out.

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:26.900
She can give you some tips.

02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:27.862
And talk to each other.

02:13:27.862 --> 02:13:29.570
That's why we do all
these presentations.

02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:30.270
Yes.

02:13:30.270 --> 02:13:33.034
STUDENT 26: What level of
polishedness [INAUDIBLE]?

02:13:33.034 --> 02:13:35.700
PROFESSOR 1: We're going to talk
about that through for the rest

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.366
of the semester.

02:13:36.366 --> 02:13:38.900
What does polish mean?

02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:42.000
Polished, to our eyes-- I'll
talk about this on Monday.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.740
But basically what we're
asking for is the games you've

02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:47.310
made these past two
projects, that's

02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:51.237
about the scope you should
have think for project 4.

02:13:51.237 --> 02:13:53.070
So if you thinking about
that kind of scope,

02:13:53.070 --> 02:13:55.280
but then you have
four times the time,

02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:58.020
what are you applying
that time towards?

02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:00.750
Polish and making sure
the user experience is

02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:06.930
easy to use-- it doesn't
crash, it doesn't break.

02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:09.640
A player can start
playing and figure out

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.570
through the systems
of the game how

02:14:11.570 --> 02:14:13.510
it works, what the keys are.

02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:15.960
You've got good credit screens.

02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:22.700
We're not necessarily asking for
an art, sound, or music polish.

02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:24.920
We're not asking
for indie level art.

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:27.160
We're asking for just
a level below that.

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:30.810
A unified level of polish--
so everything in the game

02:14:30.810 --> 02:14:34.884
has the same amount of time,
care, effort being put into it.

02:14:34.884 --> 02:14:36.800
PROFESSOR 3: It doesn't
feel uneven and bumpy.

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:39.320
It doesn't feel like, here's
this awesome soundtrack

02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:42.070
with this really,
really terrible art.

02:14:42.070 --> 02:14:45.160
Or here's this really
bleepy, 8-bit thing

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:48.540
with gorgeous,
hand-painted scenery.

02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:51.290
That's not cohesive.

02:14:51.290 --> 02:14:53.835
We want everything
to look like it's

02:14:53.835 --> 02:14:56.875
on an even level of quality.

02:14:56.875 --> 02:14:59.250
PROFESSOR 1: This might be a
preview for future lectures,

02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:00.760
but play Ponycorns.

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:02.795
Look up the term Ponycorn.

02:15:02.795 --> 02:15:05.990
It's a game made by a
five-year-old and her father.

02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:08.480
That is actually a
high level of polish

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:11.430
that I've seen
happen in this class.

02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:14.890
If it happens with your project,
it would be really great.

02:15:14.890 --> 02:15:17.970
Yes, Sissy's Magical
Ponycorn Adventure.

02:15:17.970 --> 02:15:19.886
PROFESSOR 2: The key
thing to note here

02:15:19.886 --> 02:15:23.060
is that all the assets were
created by the five year old.

02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:25.680
And I believe the story was also
written by the five year old.

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:26.310
PROFESSOR 1: And the sounds.

02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:28.390
PROFESSOR 2: And the
sounds were done by her.

02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:34.773
And her father just did all the
coding and put it all together.

02:15:34.773 --> 02:15:35.814
PROFESSOR 1: What's that?

02:15:35.814 --> 02:15:39.300
STUDENT 27: $3,199
in donations to date.

02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:41.790
PROFESSOR 2: If you can draw
as well as a five year old,

02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:44.619
you can make good
assets for you game.

02:15:44.619 --> 02:15:46.410
PROFESSOR 1: So we've
got nine minutes left

02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:48.550
for the rest of class.

02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:50.865
Capture all the ideas
that you wrote down

02:15:50.865 --> 02:15:53.860
and mail them to
videogames@mit.edu.

02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:57.200
So whoever took a capture
of each of these things,

02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:59.250
just turn it into a
text file, and mail it.

02:15:59.250 --> 02:15:59.945
Yeah?

02:15:59.945 --> 02:16:02.120
STUDENT 28: Somebody created
a Google spreadsheet.

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:04.540
Can we all just put
our pictures in there?

02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:05.582
PROFESSOR 1: That's fine.

02:16:05.582 --> 02:16:07.373
STUDENT 28: So we don't
get million emails.

02:16:07.373 --> 02:16:08.410
PROFESSOR 1: Absolutely.

02:16:08.410 --> 02:16:10.040
PROFESSOR 3: Also there
are a couple of students

02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:11.123
who aren't in class today.

02:16:11.123 --> 02:16:17.450
So they may need some-- you
might need to sort of explain

02:16:17.450 --> 02:16:19.512
to them what happened
today and bring them up

02:16:19.512 --> 02:16:21.470
to speed, especially if
you are like dormmates,

02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:24.030
or hallmates or
something like that.

02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:26.510
Please help them along
and help them get ready

02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:30.990
so that by Monday-- get the
conversation going on online so

02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:32.879
that they can at least
have a clue of which

02:16:32.879 --> 02:16:36.310
team to join on Monday.

02:16:36.310 --> 02:16:38.460
PROFESSOR 1: The rest
of the time is yours.
