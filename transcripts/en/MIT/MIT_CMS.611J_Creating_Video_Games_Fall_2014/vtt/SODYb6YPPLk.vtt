00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.520
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.480
So the way to this day
is going to be set up

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.090
is we've got one hour to
go Philip, me, and Drew.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.910
We'll go to each
team, and we're just

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.940
going to talk with each team
about your updated vision

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.064
statement-- you should
have one by now--

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:41.730
your product backlog
you just turned in,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.001
and your sprint tasklist
you just turned in.

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:45.500
The main thing we
want to talk about

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.680
is just some more
detailed discussion

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.000
based on the presentations
you gave, as well.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.930
So what are you doing over
the next week and a half?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.820
What do we think the
biggest issues are?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.210
What are your plans for
Thanksgiving, and not working

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.710
during Thanksgiving, hopefully?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.490
And we'll go in that order--
so Heat Wave, Hello Wave, Snap,

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.050
Cholera, and Awesome Cholera.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.440
It should only take about
five to 10 minutes per team,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.970
unless you have more questions.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.480
And then after that, you
are free to depart or work

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.080
in class.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.110
We've got the room
until 4:00, as well.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.010
Before we do that, Phillip
had some generalized feedback

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.760
he wanted to give.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.220
PHILLIP TAN: So after
looking through all

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.745
of the state of the projects
in terms of the deliverables

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:36.070
that you handed us, when we
looked through the product

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.390
backlogs, we noticed
something fairly consistent

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.870
among all the teams.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.390
And that was you know how you
have these columns, right?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.370
You have your serial
number, your item number

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.790
of your task, the
description of the task,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.665
usually who it's assigned
to, and then a priority list.

00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:53.206
Well, first of all,
everybody sent us

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:57.470
this list sorted by serial
number rather than my priority

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.160
list.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.720
That's not so bad,
because we can always just

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.280
resort it ourselves.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.000
The problem was that the
priorities was something

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.160
like, task one was priority one.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.550
Task two was priority one.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.870
Task three was priority one.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.520
Task four was priority one.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.405
Task five was priority two.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.030
And then it goes, two, two, two,
two, two, three, three, three,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.730
three, three.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.810
And that-- if you get granular
enough, that might be fine.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.630
But I'm a little
bit worried that's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.190
not quite granular
enough when it

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.670
comes to your priority levels.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.150
Everybody seems to have
about three to four levels

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.170
of priority.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.240
And you get these
huge swaths of tasks

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.081
that all have the same priority.

00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:38.330
So you don't actually know
which one's more important.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.180
Now, you might be
thinking, well,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.110
they're all assigned
to different people.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.130
So for everybody who
has a set of tasks,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830
they have a priority
one task and they

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.913
know what they're supposed
to be doing right away.

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:53.170
And that's true
for the individual.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.740
The problem is that
if you've got--

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.750
I'm just going to bring this up.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:00.590
If you've got-- OK.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.916
So say this-- what the?

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.010
Oh, here we go.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.490
Say this is your
product backlog,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.890
and you've got a chunk
of priority one tasks,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.920
priority two tasks,
priority three tasks.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.410
And each one of these
tasks have been assigned

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.540
to some individual person.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.260
Maybe you've got something
like all your priority

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.720
one stuff done.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.554
All that is cleared.

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:29.178
All the most important
things got done.

00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:29.679
We are fine.

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.219
So now you're somewhere dealing
with all of your priority two

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.820
tasks.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.127
And some of them are done.

00:03:34.127 --> 00:03:35.210
Some of them are not done.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.293
Hopefully you're finishing
off a priority two task

00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:40.320
before you get to your
priority three tasks.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.060
And so this is person
A, this is person B,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.017
this is person C. And
person C's done their job.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.100
Person B's done their job.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.650
And person A's
still working on it.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.922
How complete is
your game, actually?

00:03:52.922 --> 00:04:01.260
Your game's only as
complete as person A

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.730
is capable of
finishing their task.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.170
So if you've got like a
giant list of priorities--

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.580
if I were to take this list
of priority one, priority

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.950
two, priority three and
forced sat you down and went

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.380
through the arduous
process of actually giving

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.608
each individual task a
separate priority number

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:20.649
so that you could actually
solve it and rank it--

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.779
I'm going to do that.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.695
Because I know it takes
a heck of a long time.

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:27.490
But if I were to do that,
what you'll find most likely

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.720
is that you've got a bunch
of tasks that are done.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.130
You have an undone task, a
bunch of tasks that are done,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.450
an undone task, and then some
stuff done, and a whole bunch

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.560
of undone tasks.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.200
And the game's only this done.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.780
You are not here.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.610
You are not here.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.520
You are here.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.220
And you need to be able
to see that as a team.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.250
You need to be able
to actually see,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.710
what is the highest, most
important thing that's

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.580
still not completed?

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.530
Right now, at the
level of granularity

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.980
that we're looking at all
of your product backlogs,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.490
all of your product
backlogs don't quite

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.090
have that level of granularity.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.195
But, it is possible
that in your head,

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:14.070
you actually have that
level of granularity--

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.500
that you actually know in
your team what that highest

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.382
level undone task is,
even though they all

00:05:20.382 --> 00:05:21.340
have the same priority.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.220
They're all priority two
tasks, or something like that.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.950
So something that will be useful
before you depart class today

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.660
is to actually figure out--
off all of the things that

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.820
are the highest
priority and undone

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.740
right now, what is really
the most important thing?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.140
And who's responsible for that?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.410
In fact, all of your
highest priority tasks

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.670
should all be
assigned to somebody.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.770
And you should have a good
sense of what order of priority

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.350
they are.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.112
Because not everybody
who's been assigned a task

00:05:56.112 --> 00:05:58.070
is actually going to be
able to complete a task

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.510
before the next time you meet.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.640
And the next time when you
meet, when you actually check in

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.160
and you discover
some tasks are done

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.750
and some tasks
haven't been done,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.780
you need to know how much
progress your team actually

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.330
made towards
completion of the game.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.260
Otherwise, you may say, oh, we
got five out of our six tasks--

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.010
only that one task
that didn't get done

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.910
turns out to be the most
important thing, which

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.550
means you actually haven't made
enough progress on your game

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.050
at all.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.940
And you need to know that
so that you can actually

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.530
start to cut features, scope
down, and do all of the things

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.080
that we talked about regarding
crisis control for your team.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.580
So we'll talk a little bit
more with each individual team

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.162
about that.

00:06:39.162 --> 00:06:40.870
But that's a conversation
that you should

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.702
be having within your own team.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.660
Of all your highest
priority tasks, which one's

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.348
actually the highest priority?

00:06:48.348 --> 00:06:49.061
OK?

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:50.102
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:53.180
So take a minute just to
meet up with your team,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.890
and we're going to go to
Heat Wave in one minute.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.080
Also, make sure you've got a
playable version of your game,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.210
because Drew would
like to see it.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.490
He was not available
for the presentations.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.920
Amelia wanted Drew
to play, since he's

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.203
played it during the play test.

00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:13.286
And there might have been
some stuff that changed.

00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:14.262
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, excellent.

00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:15.238
That person's on fire.

00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:16.702
I like it already.

00:07:21.094 --> 00:07:25.886
People are dying, and you're
asking me questions why?

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:27.842
Seriously?

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:30.287
You're dying, and
I'm talking to you.

00:07:30.287 --> 00:07:32.721
Why are you talking
back when you're dying?

00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:33.221
All right.

00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:35.670
Cool.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.820
PHILLIP TAN: So, I
just want to be clear.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.165
Catching on fire is fainting?

00:07:40.165 --> 00:07:41.290
AUDIENCE: Equivalent, yeah.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:41.460
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah?

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.740
OK.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.055
All right.

00:07:42.055 --> 00:07:42.806
AUDIENCE: It's a metaphor.

00:07:42.806 --> 00:07:45.014
AUDIENCE: It's meant to
invoke an emotional response.

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:45.782
PHILLIP TAN: Yes.

00:07:45.782 --> 00:07:46.907
ANDREW GRANT: It does that.

00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:47.766
Oh my god.

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:48.758
They're all dying.

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:50.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:51.734
Hello.

00:07:51.734 --> 00:07:53.222
Go inside.

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:54.210
No.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.710
OK.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.657
No.

00:07:55.657 --> 00:07:56.198
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:07:56.198 --> 00:07:58.100
Something you should
know is the dialog

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.475
is just-- the back
end's working,

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:01.540
but we actually haven't
put the content in yet.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:01.615
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:01.950
OK.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.495
AUDIENCE: The dialog will be
much more educational and--

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:05.909
AUDIENCE: And have choices,
which it currently doesn't.

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:06.617
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.164
Sure.

00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:10.068
AUDIENCE: You guys
are going to want to--

00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:11.496
AUDIENCE: So right now, we
don't have an and condition,

00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:12.460
because the dialog is just--

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.126
ANDREW GRANT: Well,
you eventually will.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.024
AUDIENCE: Yeah yeah.

00:08:15.024 --> 00:08:17.274
ANDREW GRANT: It's currently
the Space Invadors style.

00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:20.271
You will eventually
die and condition?

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.702
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:22.660
ANDREW GRANT: OK, cool.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.197
RIK EBERHARDT: So I've got
the old vision statement.

00:08:27.197 --> 00:08:28.655
Did you make a new
version of that,

00:08:28.655 --> 00:08:30.170
and is that on
Stellar right now?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.170
AUDIENCE: No, it is not.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.396
I didn't realize we needed it
for today, because it wasn't

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:33.950
on the homework assignments.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.280
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:35.890
That's OK.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.044
Then just--

00:08:37.044 --> 00:08:38.711
AUDIENCE: I'll redo it today.

00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:39.710
RIK EBERHARDT: OK, cool.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.330
Yeah, that's-- I should
have put that on the thing.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:41.839
AUDIENCE: In therms
of the task breakdown,

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.370
its' actually pretty
much the same.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.850
And the overall vision I
haven't looked at in a while,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.007
but I think most of
our goals are the same.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:49.840
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.340
It actually looks pretty--
so, like, vaguely,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.710
when you're reading through
the old 30 of game play,

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.140
it feels like this game.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.844
A lot of these
elements are in there.

00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:00.552
AUDIENCE: We haven't
had any major design

00:09:00.552 --> 00:09:01.070
changes in terms of that.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.980
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.470
So between Monday and
today, has anything new

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.610
gone on the chopping block?

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.002
Are any other
features getting cut?

00:09:12.002 --> 00:09:14.364
AUDIENCE: Monday is when
the product backlog was due?

00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:14.831
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:15.330
Yeah.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.232
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:22.000
We caught secondary scenes, and
everything else seemed doable,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.255
because a lot of it-- the only
other thing that could possibly

00:09:25.255 --> 00:09:27.270
be cut is items
breaking over time.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.590
RIK EBERHARDT: Yep.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.730
AUDIENCE: Everything else
is actually in progress,

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.420
and just being improved upon.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.454
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:09:33.454 --> 00:09:34.870
AUDIENCE: So they
might not break.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.395
It might be that once you've
installed an umbrella,

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:38.370
it will last forever, kind of
thing-- or a water fountain,

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.505
or whatever we choose.

00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:41.300
But everything else
is in progress,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.706
and I really think we're
on track to finishing OK.

00:09:43.706 --> 00:09:44.100
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.173
So you said a lot of the
content you have to get in

00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:46.515
is the dialogue.

00:09:46.515 --> 00:09:48.910
Then you're also going to
be doing some new artwork

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:49.845
for the characters.

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:50.428
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:53.116
RIK EBERHARDT: Is Julia the only
person doing artwork on that?

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:54.490
AUDIENCE: She is the only
person doing artwork.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.360
RIK EBERHARDT: Is she
also doing dialog?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.348
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:57.193
AUDIENCE: Uh, no.

00:09:57.193 --> 00:09:58.818
AUDIENCE: I'm doing
the dialog content.

00:09:58.818 --> 00:10:00.362
AUDIENCE: All the backup
stuff was for my UAP,

00:10:00.362 --> 00:10:00.920
so I was kind of--

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.670
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.970
But, I mean, are you
still coding the dialog

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.950
system for this game?

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.920
AUDIENCE: Not anymore.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.280
AUDIENCE: Unless it's debugging.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.250
RIK EBERHARDT: So you're
saying it's bug OK.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.541
AUDIENCE: We need more testing.

00:10:10.541 --> 00:10:11.368
We know that.

00:10:11.368 --> 00:10:12.690
AUDIENCE: If there are
issues, I will fix them.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:13.910
RIK EBERHARDT: That was
like the big red flag

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.530
when Phillip and I were
talking, is that one person

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.656
doing two important things.

00:10:17.656 --> 00:10:19.321
AUDIENCE: We know
that there's-- no, no.

00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.500
The dialog is split between
these two lovely people.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:21.650
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh, yeah.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.570
No, not the creation
of the dialog.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:22.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.760
RIK EBERHARDT: That's not the
thing we're concerned about.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.470
It's the creation of
the art with one person,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.430
and that person also
being the person in charge

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.942
of the back end for your dialog.

00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:30.733
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:31.840
The back end--

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.496
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean,
it was a lot of work,

00:10:32.496 --> 00:10:35.284
but again, it's like I was
counting the dialog for my UAP

00:10:35.284 --> 00:10:37.744
instead, so I was
definitely doing this fast.

00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:38.728
It's not a big thing.

00:10:38.728 --> 00:10:41.188
So the artwork is my,
like, contribution

00:10:41.188 --> 00:10:43.156
for this project for this class.

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:45.150
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.970
All right.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.230
So if you have enough
time during the day

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.180
that if that breaks--

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:49.490
AUDIENCE: I do.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.410
I can get the art done.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.909
I know that.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.510
RIK EBERHARDT: and
you're doing both.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:51.550
OK.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.050
All right.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.060
We'll see how that goes.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.850
AUDIENCE: Worst case,
we'll have stick figures.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:55.110
It'll be OK.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.740
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.239
Oh, yeah.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:58.280
And from our point
of view, it's fine.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.780
ANDREW GRANT: These
people are fine.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.105
RIK EBERHARDT: These
people are fine.

00:11:01.105 --> 00:11:01.840
ANDREW GRANT:
Unless they don't--

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.290
AUDIENCE: The issue
with that is one

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.920
of the main learning
things about this game

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.795
is choosing who you're
going to try and help,

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:09.120
and these people do not convey
at all their characteristics,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.380
which is why we're
redoing the art.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:11.580
ANDREW GRANT: That makes sense.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.955
RIK EBERHARDT:
And art is one way

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:14.680
of doing it, floating
dialog, floating

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.810
box is another way of doing
it, and floating boxes.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.680
AUDIENCE: We have labels.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.830
RIK EBERHARDT: Are they--
they're broken, or?

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.750
AUDIENCE: We deleted them,
because they-- they were just

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.372
hard to read, and
we didn't have them

00:11:23.372 --> 00:11:25.705
moving with the characters,
so they would stay in place.

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:27.606
We could have made
them move, but we just

00:11:27.606 --> 00:11:29.740
decided it was better
to redo the art than try

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.660
and make the little
captions better.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:31.939
RIK EBERHARDT: No.

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:32.128
Oh, yeah.

00:11:32.128 --> 00:11:32.596
That's--

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:33.532
AUDIENCE: If you guys don't
think I need to do the art,

00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:34.408
let's not do the art.

00:11:34.408 --> 00:11:36.323
PHILLIP TAN: Well, I
mean, the art is awesome,

00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:37.980
but it is also a
huge bottleneck.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.960
And if you fall
sick and then a lot

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.680
of the reliance
on your art to be

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.400
able to convey that important
information falls through,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.730
and the project fails.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.120
If you don't fall sick and
you get all your stuff done,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.930
your game just looks
better, and it's awesome.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:57.176
Right?

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:57.422
So.

00:11:57.422 --> 00:11:57.914
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:57.914 --> 00:11:59.390
So, I mean, we
have placeholders.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.866
So if for some reason
I don't complete it,

00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:01.650
we can just use
what we've got now.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.066
PHILLIP TAN: But
I'm just thinking

00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:06.050
about tinting the [INAUDIBLE],
or something that like--

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.950
like just through
software or something.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.006
What else can you do that's a
little bit like as a backup?

00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:13.630
AUDIENCE: So with
heat waves, one thing

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.050
that happens when you
get sick is you turn red.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.390
So we could tint
them red over time,

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.130
and like have people starting
at different levels of red.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.582
But I think-- and that's
actually something

00:12:23.582 --> 00:12:25.290
that we might be
looking into separately.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.690
Because something Pablo
talked to us about

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.574
was wanting to
convey that people

00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:31.991
are getting sicker over time,
and that maybe once you see,

00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:32.490
OK.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.640
Somebody's turning red or
has an exclamation point,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.889
or some way of conveying that.

00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:39.710
Let's show the person
that they're sick.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.840
The users need to know.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.339
But that's something
we're doing as,

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:43.922
like, a secondary
thing, because we

00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:46.935
want to focus primarily
on making the game better

00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:47.810
as a whole right now.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.296
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:48.796
That's cool.

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:49.440
All right.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.390
Yeah.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.430
And all the things we're
saying are not at all, do this.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.076
It's more--

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:54.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.120
No.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.290
I--

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:55.910
RIK EBERHARDT: Think about this.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.940
PHILLIP TAN: It's more we're
flagging our concerns rather

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.880
than telling you
how to solve it.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.630
RIK EBERHARDT: And
prove us wrong, please.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.463
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:13:01.463 --> 00:13:02.570
I'll prove you guys wrong.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:02.660
Don't worry.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.618
PHILLIP TAN: All right.

00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:04.924
Cool.

00:13:04.924 --> 00:13:06.950
RIK EBERHARDT: The
other thing we had

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.589
was about tutorial
and ramping up, right?

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:12.630
PHILLIP TAN: Well, actually
more like ramping up.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.480
So, right now, the
game's frantic.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.980
Right?

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.070
It feels like you have to
be everywhere at all places.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.750
And that's great
for somebody who

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.310
knows how to play
the game, and also

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.055
great for someone who's just
learning how to play the game.

00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:23.596
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:23.596 --> 00:13:26.370
PHILLIP TAN: So you already
have this concept of this.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.565
I don't know if difficulty
is ramping up over this--

00:13:28.565 --> 00:13:30.690
AUDIENCE: Actually, currently,
right now, it's not.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.670
AUDIENCE: It's not.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.732
We were planning on just
changing the number of people

00:13:34.732 --> 00:13:36.080
that come up every day.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.020
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah, so
maybe, I mean, just--

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.520
AUDIENCE: Starting
with less people.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.603
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah, just
starting with less people,

00:13:41.603 --> 00:13:43.326
or reducing the rate
in which people,

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:44.950
like, fall over or
something like that.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.332
Just like, how do you ease
people into this situation?

00:13:47.332 --> 00:13:49.457
AUDIENCE: That is kind of
set, because that depends

00:13:49.457 --> 00:13:50.509
on temperature right now.

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:51.300
PHILLIP TAN: Right.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.280
So that-- it's--

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.750
AUDIENCE: So we could just
have lower temperatures

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:54.240
in the first few days.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.660
AUDIENCE: The first couple days.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.180
We could definitely do that.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.930
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.400
Just think about how you're
going to run people in.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.080
That's definitely
better than going

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.295
to the expository tutorial
route, you know, of the I'm

00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:05.670
just going to tell
you everything

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.586
that you need to know
and hope you remember it

00:14:07.586 --> 00:14:09.550
when you play the game.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.165
Ease people into the experience.

00:14:11.165 --> 00:14:11.560
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.130
In fact, if it's
just the case that

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.270
you have your high risk person.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.470
And if you've got
your-- really cool--

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.640
I'd like you to tell how
that might map to reality.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.391
And you don't need to
tell me that they're

00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:23.681
at risk if they're the ones
that keep dying like flies.

00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:24.880
I'll be like, oh my gosh.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.930
That's kind of a visceral
way learn that lesson.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.250
Is the game-- when you
guys play the game,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.720
do you feel that
you are winning it?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.130
AUDIENCE: No. [LAUGH]

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.870
AUDIENCE: No.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:36.038
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:14:36.038 --> 00:14:38.205
So if you don't have it
really high in your backlog,

00:14:38.205 --> 00:14:39.579
you probably should
put it there.

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:42.010
You need to do the gameplay
balancing first, first thing.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.760
Because you need
to play test that.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.102
Even if you guys are-- you can
use yourselves as play testers

00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:50.060
to some extent for
difficulty, but keep in mind

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.690
that if you think the game is
hard, the game is impossible.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.690
If you think the game is
easy, the game is hard.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.570
AUDIENCE: Well, I think the
game's impossible right now.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:56.800
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.883
AUDIENCE: Which has to
do-- I think we have, like,

00:14:58.883 --> 00:15:01.925
a bug where too many people
show up, which I think

00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:03.540
is something you noticed also.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.540
It's just like, they're
all on fire all at once.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.998
And I think we
definitely-- we only

00:15:06.998 --> 00:15:09.130
intend to start with
like, four or five people,

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.520
and the fact that there's
like 20 there is an accident.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.270
We're fixing that.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:13.650
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.084
And you could easily have
it-- they could arrive over

00:15:16.084 --> 00:15:18.500
the course level, or whatever,
if that's what professors--

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:18.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.880
Definitely.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.160
ANDREW GRANT: But, yeah.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.480
I would say make sure that that
game play piece is really high.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.770
AUDIENCE: Definitely--
game balancing.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.580
RIK EBERHARDT: Have you all
played Diner Dash at all?

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.532
Is it free online?

00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:29.115
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:29.115 --> 00:15:29.540
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.276
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think I have.

00:15:30.276 --> 00:15:30.370
Yeah.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:30.448
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:15:30.448 --> 00:15:32.200
You should be able to find
at least a video of it.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.190
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:33.980
ANDREW GRANT: Or Tapper.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.366
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.290
PHILLIP TAN: Oh,
Root Beer Tapper.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.650
RIK EBERHARDT: Diner
Dash or Tapper--

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.316
they're basically
time management games,

00:15:38.316 --> 00:15:40.320
very similar to this one.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.420
Take a look at those just to see
how they ramp up difficulty--

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.930
how easy it is when you
first start compared to after

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.370
about five minutes of play,
and try to think of that.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.915
It might be as a baseline.

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:51.040
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.340
So, somewhere it says that
we should have explicit end

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.621
conditions for our game.

00:15:54.621 --> 00:15:56.620
RIK EBERHARDT: That's an
explicit end condition.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.370
You died.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.040
PHILLIP TAN: Loss
is an end condition.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.270
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:15:59.740
PHILLIP TAN: You can--

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.740
AUDIENCE: Well, you don't
technically ever lose.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.565
You just lose people.

00:16:03.565 --> 00:16:04.315
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh.

00:16:04.315 --> 00:16:07.190
So there should be some
point where I know that, OK.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.200
I can stop trying right now.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.429
I can try playing
the game again.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.220
We try to keep it vague,
because every game

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.950
is going to do it differently.

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.620
If it's A, the heat
wave lasted four days,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.330
and you ended those four days
of heat wave or whatever,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.809
and that heat wave's
over, then you're done.

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:24.350
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.146
We were just going to do
it by, like, 20 people

00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:27.380
dead or something like that.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:27.570
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.070
ANDREW GRANT: That
will work fine.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.450
RIK EBERHARDT: That's fine, too.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.970
Whatever is best
for the project.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.100
PHILLIP TAN: You can
actually do both, right?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.820
If you keep this town going
20 days without losing

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.655
x number of people, you
win, otherwise you lose.

00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:41.850
ANDREW GRANT: That's an
aesthetic choice, I think.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.900
The modern game shtick is that
all games have a win condition.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.497
But classic games didn't.

00:16:47.497 --> 00:16:48.890
They had a lose condition only.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.000
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.708
You could be like a
Tetris kind of thing,

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:52.977
where you just-- how
long can you last?

00:16:52.977 --> 00:16:54.310
But summer doesn't last forever.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.790
If somebody goes for,
like, you know, 200 days,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.415
it's probably not a
heat wave any more.

00:16:58.415 --> 00:16:58.700
ANDREW GRANT: That's funny.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.241
That's funny.

00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:01.080
After 90 days, you're
like, summer is over.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.288
No one is dying of heat wave.

00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:03.902
Wait for the sequel-- Winter.

00:17:03.902 --> 00:17:04.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:04.834 --> 00:17:06.232
ANDREW GRANT: Cold Snap.

00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:08.489
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's only
winter all year long.

00:17:08.489 --> 00:17:09.030
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.113
ANDREW GRANT: That's true.

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:12.697
Some parts of the world actually
is heat wave all year around.

00:17:12.697 --> 00:17:13.404
PHILLIP TAN: Mhm.

00:17:13.404 --> 00:17:13.910
Singapore.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.890
[LAUGH]

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:16.740
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.700
Any other stuff?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.825
PHILLIP TAN: No, that's it.

00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:21.900
RIK EBERHARDT: Last thing for
me, then, is product backlog

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.889
item 20-- menu user interface.

00:17:24.889 --> 00:17:25.430
Outside menu.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:25.579
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.420
RIK EBERHARDT: What is that?

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.390
So that's not actually
well explained.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.610
That has to do with the
insoluble items, which--

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.240
Roy isn't here.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:31.940
But Roy is working on it.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.880
AUDIENCE: It's kind of like
the pods are like add water

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.976
stations, add umbrella.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:35.420
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:35.670
Cool.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:35.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.520
RIK EBERHARDT: We
just weren't sure

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.920
what you were
talking about there.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.220
But that's enough.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:38.968
AUDIENCE: I meant to fix that.

00:17:38.968 --> 00:17:39.530
I forgot.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.080
RIK EBERHARDT: No.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.240
These documents are for you.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.323
As long as you understand
what's going on-- that's

00:17:43.323 --> 00:17:45.130
why Phillip was saying, yes.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.200
We didn't understand.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.210
There's probably some things in
your head that you understand.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.600
But also, in case
you didn't see that,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.970
then we wanted to go over that.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:54.264
PHILLIP TAN: Yep.

00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:55.210
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:55.780
ANDREW GRANT: And
another thing--

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.909
so add water-- is
it red on there

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:57.450
because it's high priority?

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:57.991
AUDIENCE: No.

00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:59.172
Red means it was cut.

00:17:59.172 --> 00:17:59.880
ANDREW GRANT: Ah.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.210
Awesome.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:00.540
OK, cool.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.790
RIK EBERHARDT: And we like
that-- cutting the features

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.750
and leaving them there is fine.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.840
Sometimes, as a morale,
removing them is also good.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.753
Have a party when you do that.

00:18:09.753 --> 00:18:11.265
ANDREW GRANT: Well, trying to--

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.930
RIK EBERHARDT: But
as memory, they're

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.770
good for institutional
memory, to know, hey.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.686
We thought about this.

00:18:15.686 --> 00:18:16.390
We cut it.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:18.985
Later on, oh-- assuming you
had another couple weeks.

00:18:18.985 --> 00:18:19.860
We can go back to it.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.693
ANDREW GRANT: Actually,
almost every project

00:18:21.693 --> 00:18:23.637
I work on, I now have
a do not do list.

00:18:23.637 --> 00:18:24.088
Like, not a to do list.

00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:25.555
Like this is the
thing I thought about,

00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:25.890
and I really want to do it.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.431
And I'm going to
write down here so I

00:18:27.431 --> 00:18:28.675
know I'm going to ever do it.

00:18:28.675 --> 00:18:30.450
So later, when I think
about, what about that?

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.015
Oh, right.

00:18:31.015 --> 00:18:32.216
PHILLIP TAN: You're
not going to do it.

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:33.142
AUDIENCE: Never do that.

00:18:33.142 --> 00:18:34.308
ANDREW GRANT: Never do that.

00:18:34.308 --> 00:18:35.457
Because I don't have time.

00:18:35.457 --> 00:18:38.222
And so I think even
if you don't keep

00:18:38.222 --> 00:18:39.680
those on your main
to-do list, it's

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.455
cool to have them
there for a little bit,

00:18:40.455 --> 00:18:42.520
just so you
remember-- oh, right.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.357
We cut that.

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:44.940
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.110
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.590
PHILLIP TAN: Well, thank you.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.506
RIK EBERHARDT: Thanks.

00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:48.350
And actually, so
the vision statement

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.099
isn't due until December 10.

00:18:50.099 --> 00:18:50.640
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.931
RIK EBERHARDT: Is just we
wanted to give you the chance

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:54.736
to make an update
now if you could,

00:18:54.736 --> 00:18:56.360
but this discussion
is fulfilling that.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.789
So, that's good.

00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:58.414
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:18:58.414 --> 00:18:59.290
Thank you, sir.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:18:59.560
RIK EBERHARDT: All right?

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.060
Thanks.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.744
Have a great holiday.

00:19:02.744 --> 00:19:03.410
All right, Drew.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.260
When you're ready, go ahead
and play another game.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.010
ANDREW GRANT: Yes.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.594
Oh, excellent.

00:19:06.594 --> 00:19:08.301
AUDIENCE: There's
still some instructions

00:19:08.301 --> 00:19:10.120
which are missing
from within the game.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:10.828
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:12.660
AUDIENCE: So I'll just
explain those now.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.160
So the goal of the game is to
build up your victory progress

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:15.960
to 100%.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:20.940
And the way you do that is by
setting your toys to build or--

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:21.940
ANDREW GRANT: Or gather.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.270
Mhm.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.106
And you do that by clicking.

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:26.810
So the story is like you
brought your toys to the beach,

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.250
and they have
these sand castles.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.480
But then the waves-- like, if
they cover the sand castles,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.760
the toys will then take damage.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.850
And they can only get
hit by the waves twice.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.170
They take damage if they start
underwater or end underwater.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.510
And so in order to
prevent your toys

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.510
from getting swept
under the waves,

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.452
you can move them by clicking
and dragging them to castles.

00:19:51.452 --> 00:19:52.160
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.190
AUDIENCE: And then they will
move one castle at a time.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.577
So this one will
move here, here.

00:19:55.577 --> 00:19:56.285
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:19:56.285 --> 00:19:58.660
It's pretty much the same as
[INAUDIBLE] play test, then,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.032
the last I saw.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:00.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:00.890
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.473
AUDIENCE: And then
the last thing-- so

00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:04.630
you can hover over
this to see what

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.145
the predictions are, and you
can hover over the castles.

00:20:07.145 --> 00:20:08.430
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, I see.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.260
And they're no longer perfect.

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:09.759
Excellent.

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:11.140
I like that.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.010
I like that change.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:12.222
All right.

00:20:12.222 --> 00:20:12.722
Cool.

00:20:12.722 --> 00:20:16.380
I'm going to say, again, this
toy is immune to water damage.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.450
AUDIENCE: But he does
not need to be put away.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.700
ANDREW GRANT: Ah, OK.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.710
OK.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.645
RIK EBERHARDT: So
while he's playing,

00:20:26.645 --> 00:20:28.930
did you update
your-- did you have

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.460
a discussion about
cutting features

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.590
after Monday, as a team?

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:34.215 --> 00:20:35.880
RIK EBERHARDT: Did
you cut anything?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.120
AUDIENCE: We cut, like, kind
of any sort of big changes

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.530
where we would give
people special abilities,

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:51.890
or give any sort of long
tutorial kind of like that.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.640
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.140
So you cut things you hadn't
started yet, basically.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:55.981
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:55.981 --> 00:20:56.730
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.180
Anything that if you
had to cut today, like

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.572
could you cut
anything right now,

00:21:00.572 --> 00:21:02.530
or does everything have
to go in the way you've

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.400
thought about the game?

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.880
AUDIENCE: So what we mainly
have left is UI changes--

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.380
like make this a cloud it fits
into the theme of our game,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.724
or add arrows to show where--

00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.390
ANDREW GRANT: Where
they're going to go,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.917
and how they're going.

00:21:17.917 --> 00:21:18.672
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:18.672 --> 00:21:19.380
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:26.850
AUDIENCE: And so a lot of
that is necessary to make sure

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.640
that our game is standalone.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.210
But I guess the
worst case scenario,

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.832
we make that a blob of
text, which would be, like,

00:21:34.832 --> 00:21:36.040
absolute worst-case scenario.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.480
RIK EBERHARDT: Do you
already have the feature

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.617
to do a blob of text?

00:21:37.617 --> 00:21:38.242
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:38.242 --> 00:21:39.500
That would be our--

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.170
RIK EBERHARDT: It's
already in there, or?

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:40.224
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:40.224 --> 00:21:42.330
That would be our menu screen,
which we didn't show you, but.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.080
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.165
Cool.

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:46.390
OK.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:49.330
For your vision
statement-- so I said

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.640
if you have a new one
today, we'd like to see it.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.570
If you don't have
a new one today,

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.880
make sure you update your
vision statement before you turn

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.925
in the game on December 10.

00:21:55.925 --> 00:21:56.466
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:56.466 --> 00:21:57.020
Yeah.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.655
We do have an updated
vision statement now.

00:21:58.655 --> 00:21:59.020
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh, you do?

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:21:59.770
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:21:59.853
Cool.

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:01.060
Then I'll review it.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.270
So we review--

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.330
AUDIENCE: Should I submit
it to Stellar though?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:03.680
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.720
Submit it to Stellar.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.790
Submit it under the
December 10 one.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.942
And then on December 10,
if anything else changes,

00:22:08.942 --> 00:22:10.400
resubmit it on the
December 10 one.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.590
That's the one we're going
to use and judge the game by.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.660
The main thing I saw
on the one you have now

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.780
is that just the 30
seconds of gameplay

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.070
is really, really vague.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.561
So if you changed that for this
new one, then you did good.

00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:23.186
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:23.186 --> 00:22:23.320
OK.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:23.720
Yeah.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.210
We made it a lot
more concrete, now

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.770
that we have a more concrete--

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.040
RIK EBERHARDT: Great.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.540
Cool.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.170
That's exactly right.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.880
So the biggest thing
that Phillip and I saw

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.760
was about your-- basically
about the representational art,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.700
the quality spent on
the representational art

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.530
compared to other feedback.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.280
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:46.620
So right now, the graphics
that you have in the game

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.770
look really cute, and
they're attractive.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.595
They're endearing.

00:22:50.595 --> 00:22:52.845
They make people want to
people want to play the game.

00:22:52.845 --> 00:22:57.595
And then your UI isn't
up to that, right?

00:22:57.595 --> 00:23:00.550
You have this issue-- and this
happens in a lot of games--

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.660
where the quality of one
asset or one kind of asset

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.890
is showing how far back the
rest of your assets are.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.280
And this obviously
means that you

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.960
might be inclined to make sure
that the rest of the stuff

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.557
looks as good as what
you've got-- things

00:23:17.557 --> 00:23:19.580
like the background,
for instance--

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.325
probably the most important
part of the entire game

00:23:22.325 --> 00:23:23.422
is the background.

00:23:23.422 --> 00:23:25.380
But it also looks like
the least visually thing

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.020
that you've got on screen.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.505
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:23:29.505 --> 00:23:30.880
PHILLIP TAN: And
also things like

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.906
when you want to instruct your
characters to move around,

00:23:33.906 --> 00:23:35.718
for instance.

00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:37.990
Like you said, right now
you have to explain it.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.860
But I expect to see some sort
of visual feedback, UI feedback,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.830
when I have, say, instructed
someone to move somewhere else.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:45.455 --> 00:23:46.437
That's what we're
planning to do.

00:23:46.437 --> 00:23:48.154
We'll probably have
the go to destination

00:23:48.154 --> 00:23:49.154
and the character goes--

00:23:49.154 --> 00:23:50.850
PHILLIP TAN: And
the danger right now

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:54.165
is that your characters and
your sandcastles and your clouds

00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:56.550
have set the standard
of visual quality

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.500
that the rest of
your stuff now needs

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.160
to meet, which is a
pretty tall-- I mean,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.930
you clearly have
the skills to do it.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.740
The question is whether
you have the time to do it.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.370
And that's what
I'm worried about.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.020
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.470
PHILLIP TAN: Because you
don't just want people--

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.582
you want people to look
at your characterize

00:24:13.582 --> 00:24:15.540
when they're trying to
think about whether they

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.802
want to play a game.

00:24:16.802 --> 00:24:18.260
When they're playing
your game, you

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.040
want them looking at that
background, and where they're

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.049
going, and the quality--

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:26.340
RIK EBERHARDT: So when it
comes to a feature like-- OK,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.970
here's an arrow going
from one place to another.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.397
Do you already
have code in place

00:24:30.397 --> 00:24:32.480
to do that, but just you
don't have the art asset?

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.313
Do you have the art
asset, but not the code?

00:24:34.313 --> 00:24:35.840
Or do you not have any of it?

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.756
AUDIENCE: I think that
was like our, actually,

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:39.382
highest priority to
implement highlight

00:24:39.382 --> 00:24:41.672
to implement by, like, the
end of Thanksgiving weekend.

00:24:41.672 --> 00:24:43.500
So that would be,
like, our number one--

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.140
RIK EBERHARDT: But you're
starting from 0 and going--

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:45.916
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:46.362
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:24:46.362 --> 00:24:46.861
Cool.

00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:49.040
AUDIENCE: Don't they have
arrows showing where--

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.930
RIK EBERHARDT: They have arrows
showing that they are moving,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.589
but not where they're moving to.

00:24:52.589 --> 00:24:53.130
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.630
ANDREW GRANT: And do you have
to click twice on a character?

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.580
Is that correct?

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.250
AUDIENCE: No.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.475
ANDREW GRANT: No?

00:24:57.475 --> 00:24:57.550
OK.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.600
It's just a click and hold?

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:58.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.335
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:24:59.335 --> 00:25:00.080
But-- yeah.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.746
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
a little difficult.

00:25:01.746 --> 00:25:03.640
ANDREW GRANT: The
cancel is-- I mean,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.681
the cancel is intuitive
to a computer programmer,

00:25:05.681 --> 00:25:06.410
but no one else.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.604
Is there sound?

00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:08.612
AUDIENCE: Uh, no sound.

00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:10.570
AUDIENCE: That's another
one to be implemented.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.040
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.248
And how far are you on sound?

00:25:12.248 --> 00:25:13.095
Is it a--

00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:14.970
AUDIENCE: We have
potential background music,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.294
but we're trying to figure
out which one we actually

00:25:16.294 --> 00:25:16.976
want to put in.

00:25:16.976 --> 00:25:19.475
RIK EBERHARDT: Well, what about
sound for I clicked a thing,

00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:20.050
and sound for--

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.759
AUDIENCE: I have
worked on the sound,

00:25:20.759 --> 00:25:21.967
but we haven't put it in yet.

00:25:21.967 --> 00:25:22.826
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:23.360
That's--

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.340
ANDREW GRANT: My
recommendation on that

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:26.430
stuff is don't worry about
picking the right background

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.860
music.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.693
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:29.640
ANDREW GRANT: Put in
stupid background music,

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.130
and then you will
hear it, and then

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.180
you'll be motivated
to change it.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.554
But most importantly,
you'll have

00:25:33.554 --> 00:25:35.951
proven that your code can
support background music

00:25:35.951 --> 00:25:38.200
and click simultaneously,
et cetera, et cetera-- which

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.890
it can, because it's not hard.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.570
But just be safe.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.665
Put in placeholder sounds,
put in placeholder art

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:45.826
for whatever.

00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:47.326
If it is, in fact,
the case that you

00:25:47.326 --> 00:25:51.680
end up with your cool, cute
toys being more visually

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.230
exciting than your UI, there's
another cheat you can do,

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:57.525
which is lower the
quality of your characters

00:25:57.525 --> 00:25:59.900
if you don't have time to
improve the quality of your UI.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.471
PHILLIP TAN: Just pixelize them.

00:26:01.471 --> 00:26:03.720
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH]
Obviously, improving the quality

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.660
of your UI is better.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.750
But again, you can
cope with that.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.320
But, yeah.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.840
You do want people to
focus on the right things.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.226
RIK EBERHARDT: From a
usability standpoint,

00:26:15.226 --> 00:26:19.480
we're going to be looking
stronger at if I click a thing,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.612
it gives me an audio
feedback that I

00:26:21.612 --> 00:26:23.630
clicked a thing,
more than there's

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.904
background music going on.

00:26:25.904 --> 00:26:26.700
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.000
RIK EBERHARDT: Background
music's an aesthetic element

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.440
that we're also
going to look at,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.830
but when we're ranking
our priorities,

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.392
usability is higher
than aesthetic.

00:26:36.392 --> 00:26:36.880
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.254
Another thing is
that, right now,

00:26:38.254 --> 00:26:39.940
for usability, there is no hint.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.440
So we're talking about hints
about where is this going?

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.310
The guy is moving,
not moving, whatever.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.054
But currently, there's no
clue that he's clickable,

00:26:47.054 --> 00:26:48.220
except for the instructions.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.845
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:48.845 --> 00:26:52.030
ANDREW GRANT: So you want
him to react in some way.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:54.840
The easy, easy way is
to make them bigger,

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.800
and just scale them.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.321
So have them scale up, or
something, when your mouse is

00:26:58.321 --> 00:26:59.320
over them, or something.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.957
Just give us some
really simple clue.

00:27:01.957 --> 00:27:03.790
It doesn't have to be
complicated code-wise,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.030
but you definitely
need that clue.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.985
Also, the part where
this guy, if he's-- this

00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:10.020
castle's perfectly safe.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.970
It's never in danger.

00:27:13.585 --> 00:27:15.460
I saw in your backlog
we've got to figure out

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.577
how to solve that problem.

00:27:16.577 --> 00:27:18.660
I would make that pretty
high priority-- actually,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.120
higher priority than any
polishing you're doing.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.750
Because your game, currently,
has a pretty easy strategy

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.021
of leave a guy there and
click for 100 turns, right?

00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:28.464
AUDIENCE: Well,
the only thing is

00:27:28.464 --> 00:27:29.910
you have to be at [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:30.701
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:34.920
You may never win, but it's
easy to never lose, certainly.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.890
That's not interesting.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:37.710
Actually, no-- this
guy, by himself,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.873
doing nothing but building,
can win the game in 100 turns.

00:27:40.873 --> 00:27:41.800
Right?

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.275
So--

00:27:43.275 --> 00:27:44.900
AUDIENCE: Our proposed
solution to that

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.275
is after you lose two guys or
one guy, you lose the game.

00:27:47.275 --> 00:27:48.024
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:27:48.024 --> 00:27:48.600
Cool.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.177
AUDIENCE: That's
not [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:51.177 --> 00:27:52.010
RIK EBERHARDT: Sure.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.510
All right.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.710
Cool.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.270
But I would try to
make that sooner,

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.765
because your game is not-- make
sure anything that your game

00:27:58.765 --> 00:28:00.840
has not done-- like, I
feel like that is not

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.780
done with that flaw.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.220
And, as you actually
mentioned in your backlog,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.340
this may add new tasks
and bugs, because it will.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.380
So make sure that's
relatively high priority.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.500
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.000
ANDREW GRANT: I would say--

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.416
PHILLIP TAN: Because
then you have

00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:17.760
to test all of that on people.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.220
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.105
PHILLIP TAN: Because
you are going to have

00:28:20.105 --> 00:28:21.450
a different kind of bar graph.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.750
That's what I'm getting
from what you're describing.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.660
You're going to maybe
rearrange the way

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.500
how your fonts and your progress
bars and stuff, and all of that

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.710
is going to be understood
differently by people who've

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.150
never seen your game.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:37.910
And you need to get that
information pretty soon.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.570
ANDREW GRANT: Oddly,
in some sense,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.800
the poor bar graph tells
me is that, right now, I

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.070
know this is a bar graph.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.230
It's probably giving
me information.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.320
So I should figure out
what that information is.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.945
As soon as you turn
this into something

00:28:47.945 --> 00:28:49.980
that looks like a
cloud or something,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.462
I might stop knowing
that it's information.

00:28:52.462 --> 00:28:53.246
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:28:53.246 --> 00:28:53.640
That's interesting.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:53.870
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.745
So right now, I see it
and I think to myself,

00:28:55.745 --> 00:28:56.427
what does it do?

00:28:56.427 --> 00:28:58.927
RIK EBERHARDT: That's something
you can really quickly paper

00:28:58.927 --> 00:29:00.205
prototype and get in front
of people who have never

00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:00.670
seen this before.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:01.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.310
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.870
In fact, you could take
a screenshot of this.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.244
And just stick it
into Photoshop.

00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:05.360
Put your thing on there.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.070
PHILLIP TAN: Mock it up.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.990
ANDREW GRANT: What
does this mean,

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.210
random person on the street
I've never met before?

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.114
[LAUGH]

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:11.030
PHILLIP TAN: Family
member that you might see.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.980
ANDREW GRANT: Over
Thanksgiving, for example.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.540
But, yeah.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.880
You don't need to put it
in the game to test it, so.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.570
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.320
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.350
There's a lot of different
ways you can get that bar graph

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.540
to look like it's part of
the scene while making it

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:23.490
look like a bar graph.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.410
It doesn't necessarily need
to be made out of clouds.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:26.370
It could be in a cloud.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:26.630
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.546
PHILLIP TAN: It could
be projected on a cloud.

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:30.519
It could be--

00:29:30.519 --> 00:29:31.310
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.805
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:29:31.805 --> 00:29:32.170
OK.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.169
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:34.860
RIK EBERHARDT: Moving on.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.160
First things first.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.527
On Monday, I mentioned try to
do an updated vision statement.

00:29:41.527 --> 00:29:42.110
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.760
RIK EBERHARDT: It's
due December 10.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.070
If you have one now and it's
in Stellar now, awesome.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.028
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:48.028 --> 00:29:48.903
We did not submit it.

00:29:48.903 --> 00:29:49.286
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:29:49.286 --> 00:29:50.480
AUDIENCE: We haven't submitted
it, but we did just rewrite it.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:50.680
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.180
Cool.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.925
Then submit that to Stellar
under the December 10

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:54.425
final one.

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:54.750
AUDIENCE: Final-- OK.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.670
RIK EBERHARDT: And then
resubmit it again with changes.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.870
AUDIENCE: Resubmit
it again for changes?

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.110
Sure.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.185
RIK EBERHARDT: OK?

00:29:58.185 --> 00:29:59.140
The big thing we see--

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.870
AUDIENCE: What do you
want risks to have?

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.244
Because it seems
like by the end,

00:30:02.244 --> 00:30:03.760
their risks are
kind of meaningless.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.730
ANDREW GRANT: By December
10, risks are too late.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:05.950
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.220
So just keep the risks
you originally had.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.205
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:09.205 --> 00:30:09.550
RIK EBERHARDT: If
you want to have

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.640
AUDIENCE: So we updated
the risks right now,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.551
because pretty much ever risk
we had before didn't make sense.

00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:14.800
RIK EBERHARDT: That's perfect.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.800
The thing I'm really looking
at is 30 seconds of game play.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.670
AUDIENCE: That
completely changed.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:18.902
RIK EBERHARDT: That's cool.

00:30:18.902 --> 00:30:20.620
Because that's the thing
we're judging your game one.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.980
If your game does not look
like the 30-second game play,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.146
it's a huge red flag for us.

00:30:24.146 --> 00:30:25.009
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:26.550
PHILLIP TAN: Actually,
there probably

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.210
are still risks on December 10.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.710
There won't be
implementation risks.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.160
It won't be like, can
we implement something?

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.493
It will be more of the what
happens when real people try

00:30:33.493 --> 00:30:34.290
to use this thing?

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:34.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.970
PHILLIP TAN: Right?

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.120
So you can write those up.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.260
AUDIENCE: Well, I think
that risk is December 8.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.670
PHILLIP TAN: Possibly.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.610
AUDIENCE: So--

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:42.790
PHILLIP TAN: Well, I mean--

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.350
AUDIENCE: Because we're
testing with 100 players.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:44.930
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.290
But what happens when the
next 100 players come along?

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.490
AUDIENCE: Sure, sure.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.440
PHILLIP TAN: What
happens long-term?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.820
There's real-- there's
real deployment.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.580
PHILLIP TAN: You
can change it then.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.405
AUDIENCE: Charlie.

00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:54.980
RIK EBERHARDT: For your
product backlog and task list,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.120
are these prioritized
when you look at them?

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.705
Like, you're using Asana, right?

00:30:59.705 --> 00:31:00.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.625
RIK EBERHARDT: Do
you use priority?

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:04.250
AUDIENCE: We did not
do a good job of--

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.020
AUDIENCE: We sort of
do soft priority--

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.149
small, medium,
large-- on some tasks.

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.774
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:08.774 --> 00:31:09.890
We have different--

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:10.220
RIK EBERHARDT: No.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:10.800
That size.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.730
PHILLIP TAN: No--

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:11.840
ANDREW GRANT: That size.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.173
But you don't necessarily have--

00:31:13.173 --> 00:31:14.835
AUDIENCE: So I
think theoretically,

00:31:14.835 --> 00:31:16.293
they should be
ordered by priority.

00:31:16.293 --> 00:31:16.716
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:31:16.716 --> 00:31:17.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:17.320
That would be--

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.600
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.099
Because it doesn't
look like they're

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:21.874
ordered by name
and something else.

00:31:21.874 --> 00:31:22.415
I don't know.

00:31:22.415 --> 00:31:24.289
We couldn't tell how
you were authorizing it,

00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:26.947
so hopefully you are
thinking about that

00:31:26.947 --> 00:31:29.000
as you are moving
towards the deadline.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.730
You're going to have to choose--
I'm going to work on this right

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.200
now.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.000
Make sure it's organized.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.625
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:34.302
I think now that will
be more important.

00:31:34.302 --> 00:31:36.260
RIK EBERHARDT: How are
you-- are you doing work

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:39.050
over the weekend,
over the break?

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:39.758
AUDIENCE: I will.

00:31:39.758 --> 00:31:42.671
AUDIENCE: I probably will do
a little bit, but mostly other

00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:43.170
work.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:43.930
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:44.330
No.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.930
We tell you don't.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:46.740
Like, don't plan on
having, like-- that's

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.762
bonus work, right?

00:31:47.762 --> 00:31:49.725
But if you are working
individually elsewhere

00:31:49.725 --> 00:31:51.735
and you're not able
to talk to each other,

00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:53.650
how do you know what
you're working on?

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:58.150
That's the big thing for that.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.420
PHILLIP TAN: One
of the big things

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:02.960
that we're noticing on your
list of things-- a lot of them

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.932
are both the server
and game-system based.

00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:09.390
Probably also because you've
been getting a lot of feedback

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.744
from Pablo and people how have
been running this game in front

00:32:12.744 --> 00:32:15.160
of the audience, we're not
getting a whole lot of feedback

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.437
from the people who are actually
playing it on the playing site.

00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:19.020
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.540
That's true.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.190
PHILLIP TAN: So the thing that
I'm really, really worried

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.615
about is that the
client-side user

00:32:23.615 --> 00:32:27.470
interface doesn't look like it's
actually changed all that much.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.280
I'm sure the technology has,
but the actual user experience

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:31.875
hasn't.

00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:32.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:39.680
PHILLIP TAN: So I am worried
that you're not actually

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.880
getting in useful
usability information

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.730
and that iterative
playing experience.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.949
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:46.949 --> 00:32:49.240
RIK EBERHARDT: And so you
mentioned in the presentation

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.470
you were dropping Phaser.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.810
are you in the process of
dropping Phaser, or started?

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:54.060
AUDIENCE: We are
done with with that.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:54.940
RIK EBERHARDT: You're
done with that.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.260
So you're no longer in Phaser.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.870
You've got something else?

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:57.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:57.135 --> 00:32:57.400
RIK EBERHARDT: It's buggy,
but you've got something else.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.410
AUDIENCE: It's a
little bit buggy,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.350
but it's almost as
good as we had before.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.611
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:01.111
Cool.

00:33:01.111 --> 00:33:03.989
Because we were going to ask do
you really need to drop Phaser?

00:33:03.989 --> 00:33:06.030
And so you're already
done, so why bother asking?

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.449
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:09.490
RIK EBERHARDT: What else?

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:09.989
Oh.

00:33:09.989 --> 00:33:13.430
And give some time looking
at your scoring mechanism.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:15.580
While you kind of
hand-waved through it

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.690
during the presentation--
as we've got,

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.880
here's a couple of different
ways we can do scoring.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.558
Are you thinking about
scoring as a team?

00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:26.830
Or are you relying on the
client to come up with that?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.170
AUDIENCE: So I'm
actually not sure why

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.949
our scoring works
the way it does,

00:33:30.949 --> 00:33:32.365
because it's harder
to implement--

00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:32.660
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.780
It's also not very intuitive.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.420
AUDIENCE: It doesn't make sense.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.192
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:33:35.192 --> 00:33:36.983
AUDIENCE: Like, there's
a specific function

00:33:36.983 --> 00:33:39.955
that makes sure that you only
get one point when you might as

00:33:39.955 --> 00:33:41.950
well get more than one point.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.906
I think that's just something
that has been low-priority,

00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:47.690
and hasn't been
fixed-- especially

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.210
because nobody
actually understands

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.026
how their getting points.

00:33:51.026 --> 00:33:53.359
And they only ask at the end
of the game, wait a minute.

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:54.290
How did I get points?

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.044
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:33:56.044 --> 00:33:57.460
PHILLIP TAN: Two
ways that you can

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.500
resolve that-- one
is you play test it,

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.994
and then you ask people
how they think that they

00:34:00.994 --> 00:34:02.035
should be getting points.

00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:02.762
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:04.970
PHILLIP TAN: And the other
way is you just ask Paolo.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:05.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.210
PHILLIP TAN: And let him
make a decision for you.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.620
RIK EBERHARDT: The third way--
if you're with family members,

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.488
you can play the
regular, the analog game.

00:34:12.488 --> 00:34:14.989
Come up with a scoring
mechanism-- like, just do it.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.739
You don't need to be
programming to do it.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.836
You can probably do
it really quickly.

00:34:18.836 --> 00:34:21.460
PHILLIP TAN: My guess is that a
accumulated scoring system will

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.960
give you more differentiation
between players,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.624
whereas the one point for
everybody kind of situation

00:34:28.624 --> 00:34:31.249
means a lot of people
get the same score.

00:34:31.249 --> 00:34:32.169
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:34.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.070
ANDREW GRANT: Are these-- it
looks like you have, actually,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.190
three backlogs.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.790
Is that true?

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.719
RIK EBERHARDT: This is backlog,
and these are tasks lists.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:41.389
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, I see.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.889
I see.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:42.150
I see.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:42.810
RIK EBERHARDT: That's on the--

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:43.643
ANDREW GRANT: I see.

00:34:43.643 --> 00:34:45.035
RIK EBERHARDT:
Same system, yeah.

00:34:45.035 --> 00:34:45.909
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, OK.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.242
So does that mean it's repeated?

00:34:47.242 --> 00:34:49.889
This is the backlog and
these are task lists,

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:51.790
are the same thing?

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.079
I think they're
repeated in both places.

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:55.149
Do you have one list--

00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.690
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.523
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:34:56.523 --> 00:34:58.500
ANDREW GRANT: So you
have somewhere one list

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.789
that lists everything you
need to do, prioritized.

00:35:01.789 --> 00:35:02.830
So that way, one of you--

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.082
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:03.082 --> 00:35:04.660
We don't have something
exactly like that.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.576
ANDREW GRANT: And the
reason why you want that

00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.330
is so that if I'm
working on the back end

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:12.020
and I have gotten all of
my priority two stuff done.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.720
I'm working the
priority three stuff.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.530
But on the front end,
there's a whole bunch

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.790
of priority one bugs.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.154
I need to switch
to the front end.

00:35:19.154 --> 00:35:19.990
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.240
ANDREW GRANT: Right?

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.823
AUDIENCE: So far I
don't think anybody

00:35:21.823 --> 00:35:23.594
has-- initial on the switch.

00:35:23.594 --> 00:35:24.760
It was permanently switched.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:24.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.030
ANDREW GRANT: Now, part of
that, there's a learning curve

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.760
problem for doing that.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.540
But if you get that
far out of whack,

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.690
you really need to be ready,
or to be aware of the fact

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.755
that that might happen.

00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:35.421
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:35:35.421 --> 00:35:35.910
Yeah.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:36.700
ANDREW GRANT: So
it also does you

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.235
no good job to implement a
feature on the back end that's

00:35:38.235 --> 00:35:39.610
not implemented
on the front end,

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.380
and vice versa, really-- for the
features that pair, at least,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:42.880
right?

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.480
So there's got to be
really close communication.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.630
And one way to handle that
is to have a unified list--

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.394
bugs and features
intermingled sometimes.

00:35:51.394 --> 00:35:52.060
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.120
ANDREW GRANT: What's the most
important thing to do next?

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.610
But I would be a
little bit worried

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.068
if this is your
entire organization

00:35:57.068 --> 00:35:59.180
system, about stuff
falling through the cracks

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.680
pretty easily, especially since
you're dividing your team up

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.345
into subgroups to sort of handle
front end, back end problems.

00:36:04.345 --> 00:36:04.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:05.360
ANDREW GRANT: That
means that there's

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.610
a-- it's not a
communication barrier,

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.980
but there's no highway
of communication.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.860
Since you are
separated out, you will

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.156
tend to forget to inform the
other side of what's going on.

00:36:17.156 --> 00:36:17.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.127
ANDREW GRANT: So, and the one
list also helps with that.

00:36:21.127 --> 00:36:21.960
And also, let's see.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.605
Did I see here that you're
already adding word lists

00:36:24.605 --> 00:36:26.580
or did I make that up?

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.674
No, I just saw cloud,
words, and export.

00:36:28.674 --> 00:36:31.090
RIK EBERHARDT: They have a
word cloud on the back end now.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:31.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:31.920
Not for players--

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.410
ANDREW GRANT: I see.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.600
AUDIENCE: --for the back end.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.330
That's been around.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:34.560
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.200
So the back end-- I see.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:35.440
I see.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:35.840
I see.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.360
OK.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:41.410
So are you, for
example, not bothering

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:46.069
to have a feature for
collusion or cheating?

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.610
AUDIENCE: No.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.105
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:47.490
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:47.989
Cool.

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:50.575
AUDIENCE: I think we have
no anti-cheating tasks.

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:50.899
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:51.399
Cool.

00:36:51.399 --> 00:36:54.050
You probably should mention
that explicitly somewhere.

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.960
I'm not sure where
that goes, though.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.100
PHILLIP TAN: Maybe
interpretation document.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.310
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:57.710
It's an anti-task, certainly.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.510
AUDIENCE: That's actually--

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.385
ANDREW GRANT: And to
the client, for example,

00:37:00.385 --> 00:37:02.840
you'd want to make sure
the client knows this

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.201
is the thing we're not doing.

00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:06.450
And you probably don't care,
because of your use case.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.158
But we should mention
in case you go, no.

00:37:08.158 --> 00:37:10.044
Wait a minute.

00:37:10.044 --> 00:37:11.710
RIK EBERHARDT: Your
final presentation's

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.770
a great place for that,
as a here's something

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.089
we thought about and
didn't do because of that.

00:37:16.089 --> 00:37:16.880
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.080
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.900
ANDREW GRANT: Although if
you do have any conversation

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.830
with the client, mention that.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:27.520
Because if they're
like, that's crazy,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.352
you want to know that before
the final presentation--

00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:32.810
you might not be able to do
anything about it with the time

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:35.429
you've got, but it'd be good
to be aware if maybe there is

00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:37.970
an easy solution the client come
up with or whatever that you

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.640
haven't-- because maybe full
cheating stopping is not

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.098
necessary, but some
minor things are.

00:37:45.098 --> 00:37:46.472
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think the way

00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:48.420
they run it-- if you cheated it
would be obvious, first of all.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:48.930
Like, they're going
to show you did it.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.355
ANDREW GRANT: Oh,
because the cloud.

00:37:50.355 --> 00:37:50.730
AUDIENCE: So, like--

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:51.510
ANDREW GRANT: OK, yeah.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.100
AUDIENCE: What you did--

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.000
ANDREW GRANT: Who put
cat and dog in here?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.450
That's ridiculous.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:53.976
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:37:53.976 --> 00:37:54.340
Sure.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:54.735
All right.

00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:55.130
Cool.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.630
That may well be
enough right there.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.265
AUDIENCE: And
also, they wants us

00:38:01.265 --> 00:38:03.059
to focus on pretty
serious players, right?

00:38:03.059 --> 00:38:05.100
ANDREW GRANT: So who aren't
going to be cheating?

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.060
AUDIENCE: They're
not going to cheat.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.364
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:38:06.364 --> 00:38:06.440
Cool.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:06.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.443
ANDREW GRANT: That's
a nice advantage.

00:38:08.443 --> 00:38:10.160
And that's a thing
to include in your--

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.564
if you mention your target
audience is, in fact, people

00:38:12.564 --> 00:38:13.980
who've already
drunk the Kool-Aid.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.090
They're already on your team.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:18.370
They're not trying to--
it's not whack people

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.117
on the internet who are going
to do whatever they want.

00:38:20.117 --> 00:38:20.410
That's an important--

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.035
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:21.035 --> 00:38:22.359
It's almost like not players.

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:23.150
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.920
AUDIENCE: It's not
a typical player.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.780
ANDREW GRANT: That's
an important thing

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.280
to mention in your
vision statement,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.500
actually, if it's not
in there already--

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.870
I'm behind on that, but.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.184
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:33.725
PHILLIP TAN: One
other thing is given

00:38:33.725 --> 00:38:35.175
that your game is
designed to work

00:38:35.175 --> 00:38:39.270
both on phone and
on laptop, on PC,

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.970
you do want to set up
multiple test sessions

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:45.945
so that you can test your user
interface on both clients.

00:38:45.945 --> 00:38:48.180
Maybe you're testing
them simultaneously,

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.700
but then you have to make
sure that when you're getting

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.991
your usability feedback, you
are getting some usability

00:38:51.991 --> 00:38:54.410
feedback on the phone
users, and some--

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.630
because it's very different
on the different device.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.700
AUDIENCE: So I think that's
sort of a weird feature where,

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.125
as far as the
class is concerned,

00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:03.170
I don't think we care
about the mobile interface.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.370
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:03.785
All right.

00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:04.930
AUDIENCE: Like,
that's not something

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.090
that we're promising
in terms of the course.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:07.450
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:07.720
Oh, good.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:07.980
Good.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.905
PHILLIP TAN: That wasn't clear
on the priority list, too.

00:39:09.905 --> 00:39:12.090
AUDIENCE: On the other
hand, it seems easy enough,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.070
and the client really wants it.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.340
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.290
PHILLIP TAN: You
might want to do

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.527
we'll guarantee that
the PC site will work,

00:39:20.527 --> 00:39:23.340
and if you wanted us to do
the mobile site, maybe pay us.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.000
RIK EBERHARDT: Here's 0.9B.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.340
You get 1.0 with the dot.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.840
PHILLIP TAN: I mean,
seriously, this

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.850
is real work that you're
doing that real people get

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.110
paid to do.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.435
And for the sake
of this class, we

00:39:40.435 --> 00:39:42.660
want you to turn in
a polished product,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.780
and we never ask you to
target two platforms.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.049
The client does, obviously.

00:39:46.049 --> 00:39:48.090
But then it's also reasonable
to tell the client,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.214
first priority is get one--

00:39:49.214 --> 00:39:51.437
RIK EBERHARDT: Beyond
the scope of the class.

00:39:51.437 --> 00:39:53.770
AUDIENCE: Well, I think he's--
he's been very good about

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.303
mentioning that every time,
that he wants us to do well

00:39:56.303 --> 00:39:58.100
in the class, not
make him happy.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:58.280
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.780
Sure.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.320
Well, and that's another place
where your prioritization can

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.340
help a lot, right?

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.540
You want to make
sure that the web

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.730
interface on a thing
with a keyboard

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.737
is the one that's
the highest priority.

00:40:09.737 --> 00:40:12.070
And if you have time, then
you make the mobile one work.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.126
And you're already going
to have problems for you

00:40:14.126 --> 00:40:15.751
poor mobile people
on their phones, who

00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:17.140
are typing really
slowly compared

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.470
to the people on
their computers.

00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.150
This is something
we talked about,

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.946
in fairness, that
sort of got dropped

00:40:21.946 --> 00:40:22.890
because it's very hard to do.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:23.140
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh, yeah.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.060
You can't compensate
for the fairness,

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.380
but it's a thing to be
aware of, obviously.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.055
All right.

00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:28.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.346
So I have one question
about deployment.

00:40:30.346 --> 00:40:34.340
How long after the course
will the game have to be up?

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:38.270
RIK EBERHARDT: At
least through January.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.570
PHILLIP TAN: Or through
the whole of January.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:40.890
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.405
Through the whole of
January, if possible.

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:42.988
And if you can't do
that, let us know.

00:40:42.988 --> 00:40:45.980
And we'll come up with
a different solution.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.402
Grading is really soon.

00:40:47.402 --> 00:40:48.485
We're going to do grading.

00:40:48.485 --> 00:40:49.010
Yeah.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.190
ANDREW GRANT: Grading will be
before then-- way before then,

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.690
obviously.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:54.717
RIK EBERHARDT: If you
have a way to deploy it

00:40:54.717 --> 00:40:56.550
to a different platform,
a different server,

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.850
if that is what is necessary,
then we'll think about that.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.106
But that's the other thing.

00:41:01.106 --> 00:41:02.980
We're going to have a
conversation with Pablo

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.820
at the end of the
class to figure out

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:05.390
how it's going to be used.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.520
PHILLIP TAN: And OCW would
like to figure out, also.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.353
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:41:07.353 --> 00:41:09.436
OCW wants to actually--
that's right.

00:41:09.436 --> 00:41:10.690
Forever.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.270
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH]

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:13.960
AUDIENCE: So ours is a
little bit more tricky.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.220
RIK EBERHARDT: Yours
is more tricky.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.011
PHILLIP TAN: I'll find
a solution for that.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.805
RIK EBERHARDT: Something we
could talk about after class,

00:41:20.805 --> 00:41:23.550
because I don't think we can
talk about it during class.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.170
That after January 1, it's not
going to be part of the grade.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.066
Because the grade's already
done by December 15.

00:41:30.066 --> 00:41:30.690
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.150
RIK EBERHARDT: But
for OCW capture,

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.407
we'd like to have
something there.

00:41:34.407 --> 00:41:35.990
ANDREW GRANT: What
does it run on now?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.585
AUDIENCE: It's a node server.

00:41:36.585 --> 00:41:37.250
ANDREW GRANT: It's
a node server.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:40.410
AUDIENCE: Actually, it's two
node servers, unfortunately.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.340
One for the back end and
then one that runs the front.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.100
AUDIENCE: The front end
is just static files.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.750
AUDIENCE: Actually, the
front end is HTML now.

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.438
RIK EBERHARDT: So
maybe we can talk

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:50.156
to [INAUDIBLE] about finding
money to pay for the servers,

00:41:50.156 --> 00:41:51.022
basically.

00:41:51.022 --> 00:41:51.879
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:51.879 --> 00:41:53.920
PHILLIP TAN: And maybe
even money for one of your

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.290
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.770
ANDREW GRANT: Exactly.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.186
RIK EBERHARDT: So
that's something

00:41:58.186 --> 00:42:00.750
to put in your vision
statement too-- or as a release

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.470
note or something, somewhere.

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.570
ANDREW GRANT: Is there any place
the caveats go for the risks--

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:06.310
AUDIENCE: The risks
section might be OK.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.210
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah, actually
risks is a good place.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.300
That's as close as
we've got for that.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.160
Risks, cheating, risks,
server goes down.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.699
[LAUGH]

00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:13.740
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.850
We've taken too
much of your time.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.270
Thank you.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.970
Have a good holiday.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:17.386
ANDREW GRANT: Thank
you very much.

00:42:17.386 --> 00:42:20.020
RIK EBERHARDT: So
looking at your project,

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.254
the biggest thing we
found was can you cut

00:42:24.254 --> 00:42:25.420
one of your main characters?

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:26.529
Is that even possible?

00:42:26.529 --> 00:42:27.320
AUDIENCE: So, yeah.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:28.745
We already cut one of our games.

00:42:28.745 --> 00:42:29.990
And we're at three.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.656
RIK EBERHARDT: So
how-- you're at three?

00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:32.980
So you cut one down to three.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.940
Do you need three?

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.520
Is three the magic number
that just says, everything's

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.420
wrapped up together?

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.087
Or if one of those fell
away and we polished two,

00:42:41.087 --> 00:42:41.920
is that good enough?

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.700
AUDIENCE: I think two would
significantly change how

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.240
the game fundamentals.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.050
It's kind of a puzzle.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.830
So it's like if you only had two
clues, which is three clues, so

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.760
more of a puzzle element.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.400
AUDIENCE: Also the fact
that each game covers--

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.565
we cut down one
game and combined

00:43:00.565 --> 00:43:03.845
it to minimize-- to still
try to cover everything

00:43:03.845 --> 00:43:05.085
we want to teach.

00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:05.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.435
We'd have to find
to teach the-- what

00:43:07.435 --> 00:43:11.000
was in the game we cut in
other game dialog or something.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.501
ANDREW GRANT: Absolutely.

00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:13.000
Cool.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.245
RIK EBERHARDT: So
cutting them in the game

00:43:14.245 --> 00:43:15.895
would, in fact,
mean a lot of work.

00:43:15.895 --> 00:43:16.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.780
ANDREW GRANT: Great.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:20.620
That's the perfect,
excellent answer.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.120
RIK EBERHARDT: Otherwise, we're
looking through your product

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.820
backlog.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.550
Your prioritization looked
really good to me and Phillip.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:27.217
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:43:27.217 --> 00:43:29.341
RIK EBERHARDT: So I think
you're-- do you feel like

00:43:29.341 --> 00:43:31.980
you're in control of the
information that you have right

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.385
now, of where you
are on your team,

00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:35.980
where you are on your project?

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.181
I think our team, since
the way we structured it,

00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:40.569
it's like everything
has to come together.

00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:42.110
But putting it
together will not take

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.920
as long as it would originally.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.995
Because we kind of
all divided up tasks.

00:43:46.995 --> 00:43:48.870
Everyone's working on
the same kind of tasks,

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.839
like for the same
thing, but we just

00:43:50.839 --> 00:43:52.880
have to put it all together,
if that makes sense.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.654
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:53.654 --> 00:43:56.890
So it's very modular, since
we have three mini games.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.750
Then we have somebody to
work on the main scene.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.747
And then we have end scenes.

00:44:01.747 --> 00:44:03.622
So you just have to put
some pieces together.

00:44:03.622 --> 00:44:04.106
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:44:04.106 --> 00:44:04.590
Cool.

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:06.650
Can you pull up the vision
statement really quick?

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:07.441
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:44:07.441 --> 00:44:09.410
RIK EBERHARDT: So on
Monday I mentioned talk

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.730
about vision statement.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.190
Change it if you need to.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:17.790
On yours, it looked pretty good.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.339
I really like the
narrative aspect

00:44:19.339 --> 00:44:20.630
of the 30 seconds of game play.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.080
Does your game still feel like
there's a narrative to it,

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:23.660
though?

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.264
Like, is it as
strong in that game?

00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:29.305
AUDIENCE: So I think it's
probably not as strong

00:44:29.305 --> 00:44:30.929
as we want it to
be now but, that's

00:44:30.929 --> 00:44:32.470
only because the
dialog hasn't been--

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.915
AUDIENCE: --really written.

00:44:32.915 --> 00:44:33.851
I mean, been drafted.

00:44:33.851 --> 00:44:34.476
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:34.476 --> 00:44:34.590
Exactly.

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:35.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:35.215 --> 00:44:37.140
We're going to that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.020
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:38.650
Cool.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:40.840
It's not due until
December 10, for reals.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.300
So that was an exercise just
to make sure that you do it now

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.050
rather than waiting
until the last minute.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.950
RIK EBERHARDT: So once you
have a finished version in,

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:57.040
turn it in on Stellar under
the December 10 deadline.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:57.760
And, yeah.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.240
Really make sure that the
30 seconds of game play

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.437
are more representative of
what the game really is.

00:45:03.437 --> 00:45:04.160
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.410
RIK EBERHARDT: Are you having
problems with the title?

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:07.290
AUDIENCE: Hmm?

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.510
RIK EBERHARDT: Are you having
problems with the title?

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:09.390
AUDIENCE: I would say so.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.015
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:10.015 --> 00:45:10.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:10.765 --> 00:45:13.140
RIK EBERHARDT: Is the problem
too many ideas, or too few?

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:13.592
AUDIENCE: Too few.

00:45:13.592 --> 00:45:14.496
AUDIENCE: Too few.

00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:15.246
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:17.480
That's actually the easier
one to deal with, I think.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.385
Because when you resolve
it, no one's mad.

00:45:19.385 --> 00:45:20.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.324
RIK EBERHARDT: What are
your strategies for that?

00:45:24.324 --> 00:45:26.240
AUDIENCE: We haven't--
we've been ignoring it.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:26.750
ANDREW GRANT: You've
been ignoring it.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.291
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.125
That's-- that's actually
a fine place to be.

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:30.832
Because it's relatively
to brainstorm it.

00:45:30.832 --> 00:45:32.708
But if you tried that
and it didn't work, eh.

00:45:32.708 --> 00:45:33.873
ANDREW GRANT: Because, yeah.

00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:36.320
A title does-- even if it
happens last minute-- it's

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.980
another art asset to create.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.510
Another thing to integrate.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.830
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:39.961
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:41.710
We've been thinking
like, as we do it,

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.630
we'll just get a
name for the village,

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.300
and we'll be like,
Saving Village Name.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:45.540
RIK EBERHARDT: Village name?

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.000
ANDREW GRANT: Beautiful.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:46.620
RIK EBERHARDT: Sure.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.280
That sounds easy.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:47.780
That's fine.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.680
Have you been brainstorming
water themes, like water names?

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.030
AUDIENCE: Water names?

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.000
RIK EBERHARDT: Maybe like
the Ghanaian word for water?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.050
AUDIENCE: We looked
through like Ghana stuff,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.330
like Ghana city names.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.450
And then we haven't
actually, like,

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.712
looked through specifically--
we have to work on that.

00:46:07.712 --> 00:46:08.420
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.220
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.456
Is that on your backlog?

00:46:10.456 --> 00:46:11.190
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.640
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.180
Score.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:12.890
AUDIENCE: It's at the--

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.389
ANDREW GRANT: The
very, very bottom.

00:46:14.389 --> 00:46:14.905
Yeah, yeah.

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:15.540
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.380
Cool.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.760
AUDIENCE: Find a name
that isn't offensive.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.710
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH] Yeah.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.450
That's important.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:21.866
RIK EBERHARDT: How has that
been going along since we last

00:46:21.866 --> 00:46:24.899
talked to you, about the--

00:46:24.899 --> 00:46:25.690
AUDIENCE: Research?

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.410
RIK EBERHARDT:
Research and stuff?

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:27.826
Are you done with
that, or are you

00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:29.207
still on-progress with that?

00:46:29.207 --> 00:46:31.540
AUDIENCE: Well, we got together
and did a mega research,

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.470
like-- find all of the things
and get inspiration from it,

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.314
mainly for the
artists, so that we can

00:46:37.314 --> 00:46:40.095
get a cohesive theme together.

00:46:40.095 --> 00:46:42.230
And I think that
also helps inform

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:47.603
the decision, the design behind
water filtration, for example.

00:46:47.603 --> 00:46:48.585
So, yeah.

00:46:48.585 --> 00:46:52.100
I mean, I think still
if the artists ever

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.220
need to make something
new, we still

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.279
look up and see if we
can find references.

00:46:57.279 --> 00:46:58.112
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:46:58.112 --> 00:46:58.612
OK.

00:46:58.612 --> 00:46:59.558
That's good.

00:46:59.558 --> 00:47:00.449
AUDIENCE: But--

00:47:00.449 --> 00:47:01.490
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:03.031
ANDREW GRANT: So I
don't think that I

00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:05.000
have played this game,
because mini game sounds

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.320
like a new thing to me.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.850
Saving All the Village.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.790
Give me a quick
five-second play-through.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.530
I hit that, I'm sure.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:13.820
Mini Game 1.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.880
Yes.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.740
Purified water
conversation goes here.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.950
I will purify.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.360
Yay!

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.457
This is the mini game?

00:47:23.457 --> 00:47:24.930
Hmm.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:25.430
Hmm.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.440
AUDIENCE: The down button
should be a Next button.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.210
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, excellent.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:28.900
Oh, excellent.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.750
And now I play the game where
I'm doing essential sorting,

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:31.930
and this is an actual game.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:32.776
All right, cool.

00:47:32.776 --> 00:47:34.900
I am going to assume that
I do something like this.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.710
All right, cool.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:42.890
The main thing I-- so when I am
putting on my feasibility hat

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.680
and I hear the word mini
game, I always think [GASP].

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:48.680
But it seems like you
actually have a mini game.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.214
Good job-- a mini game.

00:47:50.214 --> 00:47:50.922
AUDIENCE: [LAUGH]

00:47:50.922 --> 00:47:52.310
RIK EBERHARDT: Mini
games tend to just be--

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.485
AUDIENCE: Game games?

00:47:53.485 --> 00:47:54.952
RIK EBERHARDT: --many games.

00:47:54.952 --> 00:47:56.160
AUDIENCE: Many games. [LAUGH]

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:56.480
RIK EBERHARDT: M-A-N-Y.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:56.820
ANDREW GRANT: Yes.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.153
Many games is not what you want.

00:47:58.153 --> 00:47:59.755
What you actually
want is mini game.

00:47:59.755 --> 00:48:00.929
RIK EBERHARDT: [LAUGH]

00:48:00.929 --> 00:48:01.970
ANDREW GRANT: Oh my gosh.

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.280
RIK EBERHARDT: This is
[INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGH]

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.280
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.236
You've got a lot of-- you've
got a lot of features, here.

00:48:07.236 --> 00:48:08.979
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:48:08.979 --> 00:48:10.270
ANDREW GRANT: And that is cool.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.020
RIK EBERHARDT: Is this a
mini game, or is this--

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.353
AUDIENCE: This is the mini game.

00:48:13.353 --> 00:48:14.860
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:15.860
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.550
All right.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:19.049
I see here.

00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:19.720
OK.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.220
Cool.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.590
And so how much
more do you think

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:25.601
is going into these mini games?

00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:28.898
AUDIENCE: So we just--
for two of them,

00:48:28.898 --> 00:48:31.295
I haven't actually had an
update on the symptoms one.

00:48:31.295 --> 00:48:32.670
RIK EBERHARDT: On
the second one.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:33.460
AUDIENCE: But the symptoms
one should probably just

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.820
be dialog and the pictures.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.560
That's it.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.450
ANDREW GRANT: Got it.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.515
AUDIENCE: The water
filtration should

00:48:39.515 --> 00:48:42.509
be instruction page, or
interactive tutorial beginning,

00:48:42.509 --> 00:48:44.592
so you just don't like
dive into it and it's like,

00:48:44.592 --> 00:48:46.500
what's happening?

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.815
And I think just
clearer instructions

00:48:48.815 --> 00:48:52.358
with the water placement.

00:48:52.358 --> 00:48:53.354
ANDREW GRANT: I see.

00:48:53.354 --> 00:48:54.350
OK.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.840
AUDIENCE: The main thing
that we have to do right now

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.824
is just the end
game-- making sure

00:49:00.824 --> 00:49:04.808
that once you finish
all the mini games,

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:07.298
you have the clues you
need to take it from there.

00:49:07.298 --> 00:49:09.040
Then you can have
that conversation.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:09.790
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.290
OK.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.245
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:49:11.245 --> 00:49:13.912
AUDIENCE: And also art assets.

00:49:13.912 --> 00:49:15.768
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:49:15.768 --> 00:49:16.700
ANDREW GRANT: Cool.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.830
I win.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.586
Yay.

00:49:18.586 --> 00:49:19.340
All right.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.500
Cool.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:21.030
All right.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.240
So you have three mini games,
and they're, like, doing stuff.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.755
That's good.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.190
All right.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.090
RIK EBERHARDT: Those
are the symptoms.

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:32.200
ANDREW GRANT: Do you
have any-- because it

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.920
seems like, for the most part,
these mini games are relatively

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.420
simple.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.189
The code is actually not--

00:49:36.189 --> 00:49:37.480
RIK EBERHARDT: You're raising--

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.210
ANDREW GRANT: Click
the right thing.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:39.540
You're using assets
because of that.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.165
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:40.165 --> 00:49:42.820
ANDREW GRANT: Do you have
any unknown sort of tech-wise

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.490
at this point?

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.240
You sort of know
everything, or is there--

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.040
we're not sure how that works.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.540
that left?

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:50.977
AUDIENCE: So I
don't know how-- I

00:49:50.977 --> 00:49:54.952
think something that has been
buggy consistently-- maybe

00:49:54.952 --> 00:49:55.955
it's changed now.

00:49:55.955 --> 00:49:57.770
I'm not updated on it.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:58.762
Is the conversation UI?

00:49:58.762 --> 00:49:59.595
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:49:59.595 --> 00:50:01.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.200
We need to iron out a few
bugs with the conversation UI

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:10.800
and make the visual aspect of it
more appropriate with the theme

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.840
that we're going
with the assets.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.720
But other than that,
code-wise, there's

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.595
just a couple bugs that
won't be hard to fix.

00:50:16.595 --> 00:50:17.303
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:50:17.303 --> 00:50:17.900
All right.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:18.823
Cool.

00:50:18.823 --> 00:50:19.610
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:23.710
RIK EBERHARDT: So do a glance--
I'm sure you already have.

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:27.890
But make sure that anything that
has any question marks at all

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:29.747
with it gets higher priority.

00:50:29.747 --> 00:50:30.330
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.970
ANDREW GRANT: Many not
even finishing it-- right?

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.170
Like if it's the case
that you go over the tasks

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.003
and you're like, OK.

00:50:36.003 --> 00:50:38.219
Now the question marks
are gone, and I'm

00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:40.760
comfortable moving it down in
priority, feel free to do that.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.390
But make sure that
those question marks

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:43.970
are done sooner than later.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.810
Because anything that
has a question mark,

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.130
it might become
five question marks.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.255
And then you're in trouble.

00:50:48.255 --> 00:50:51.590
So just make sure you
look at it seriously

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:52.835
as a high-priority item.

00:50:52.835 --> 00:50:54.418
RIK EBERHARDT: When
is sound going in?

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:59.676
AUDIENCE: So we have sound
files in a folder, but, yeah.

00:50:59.676 --> 00:51:01.020
They should probably go in.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.515
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:51:01.515 --> 00:51:02.576
AUDIENCE: We ended
up-- they were

00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:03.880
taking a long time to push.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.240
According to Rachel, they
were taking a long time

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:06.160
to push to our test server.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.470
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:07.990
AUDIENCE: So we just
removed the assets

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.460
and just pushed it
without the sound.

00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:09.760
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.280
AUDIENCE: We do have some sound.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.321
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:13.120
Cool.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.650
ANDREW GRANT: And generally
speaking, sound, much like art,

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:22.810
if the file is the
problem, use a stupid file.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:24.500
At this stage of
development, it's

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:25.970
more important that
it makes sounds

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:28.960
than it make the right sound.

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:31.364
And so-- again, you
might discover that, oh.

00:51:31.364 --> 00:51:33.780
It turns out playing that sound
is harder than we thought,

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.520
because we can't
use an Ogg file.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:37.270
That's the kind of
thing you want to know.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.368
ANDREW GRANT: But, all right.

00:51:39.368 --> 00:51:40.100
Cool.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:40.690
RIK EBERHARDT: Great.

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:41.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:41.610
RIK EBERHARDT: Thank you.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:42.230
Have a good holiday.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:43.271
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:51:43.271 --> 00:51:44.295
You too.

00:51:44.295 --> 00:51:46.670
ANDREW GRANT: I think I've
only played the paper version.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.440
AUDIENCE: No, you played
the computer version.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.790
ANDREW GRANT: No, I
did-- way back when.

00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:51.140
Way back when, yes I did.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.490
AUDIENCE: You were
our first tester.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:52.330
ANDREW GRANT: You are so right.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.150
AUDIENCE: Because we have a new
version that we're building up,

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:55.920
and it's still very
broken-- the new one.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.670
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.550
ANDREW GRANT: So nothing
more playable than that.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:00.300
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:00.880
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.880
AUDIENCE: Unfortunately.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.700
AUDIENCE: And the minute we
kind of rehauled the system,

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.620
the game play's focus
is a lot different.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.540
We cut out a lot of stuff,
and we're focusing more on,

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.706
washing your hands is great.

00:52:10.706 --> 00:52:12.246
And cholera travels
through water.

00:52:12.246 --> 00:52:13.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:13.410
ANDREW GRANT: Good.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:14.360
RIK EBERHARDT: Is that based
on feedback from Monday,

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.270
or this previous lecture?

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.746
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:15.746 --> 00:52:16.222
That's correct.

00:52:16.222 --> 00:52:17.174
We got some very good feedback.

00:52:17.174 --> 00:52:18.007
RIK EBERHARDT: Good.

00:52:18.007 --> 00:52:18.602
Good, good.

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:19.910
AUDIENCE: It was interesting.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.250
So one of the crucial things
we were wondering about

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.440
is we were sort of
designing our game to have

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.462
a huge variety of options.

00:52:27.462 --> 00:52:30.045
But we recently switched to this
new thing that we really like

00:52:30.045 --> 00:52:34.804
a lot, which is that basically
we roll out the mechanics one

00:52:34.804 --> 00:52:36.580
by one, so we start
with one build,

00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.788
using like two or three
[INAUDIBLE]-- maybe only two.

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:41.497
And it actually just is
the case that one of them

00:52:41.497 --> 00:52:42.830
is better than the other, right?

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.770
Because if the point of the
game is to teach you something,

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:47.982
it's OK if just washing
your hands is [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:47.982 --> 00:52:49.440
and something else
is not so great.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:49.850
Right?

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:50.265
RIK EBERHARDT: Uh huh.

00:52:50.265 --> 00:52:50.680
Mhm.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.563
AUDIENCE: And then it
actually slowly becomes

00:52:52.563 --> 00:52:55.520
more and more of a game, where
we roll out another village.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.790
And then you have to trade
off balancing your resources.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.960
But then another village appears
upstream of both of them.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.540
And suddenly, the trade-offs
become not so clear.

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.957
Where before it
was just one thing

00:53:06.957 --> 00:53:08.539
was more price-effective
than another.

00:53:08.539 --> 00:53:10.428
Suddenly you
actually have to care

00:53:10.428 --> 00:53:11.933
about how infected they are.

00:53:11.933 --> 00:53:13.516
Because boiling your
water will reduce

00:53:13.516 --> 00:53:16.950
the extent to which you're
infected by upstream water.

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.830
And he really liked that as a--

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:22.120
RIK EBERHARDT: So
that's sounds awesome.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.965
How does that get affected by
that change based on the UI

00:53:25.965 --> 00:53:27.480
that we saw?

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.825
Is it using the same--

00:53:28.825 --> 00:53:30.200
AUDIENCE: It's
going to end up up

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.072
being the same sort of system.

00:53:32.072 --> 00:53:34.030
It's only that the pop-up
screen now eliminates

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.280
a bunch of options, because
they aren't necessary anymore.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:36.390
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:38.280
So these are you removed
a ton of options,

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:39.020
you weren't creating
new options.

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.380
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.366
RIK EBERHARDT: That's
what I'm hearing, right?

00:53:40.366 --> 00:53:41.352
AUDIENCE: We're basically--

00:53:41.352 --> 00:53:43.070
AUDIENCE: We basically
gutted a whole bunch

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.630
of the options that
seemed redundant

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.370
and apparently weren't helpful
to people on a local scale.

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.830
And then we changed
those options

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:50.080
so that they're more distinct.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.290
So while before it was just,
like, the higher magnitude

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:55.757
to price ratio of
affect, now it's

00:53:55.757 --> 00:53:57.840
like some things only
really touch infection rate.

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.055
Some things just cure people
[INAUDIBLE] infection rate.

00:54:00.055 --> 00:54:00.390
RIK EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:01.830
AUDIENCE: And now
you have things

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.395
that have that upstream,
downstream play affecting it.

00:54:04.395 --> 00:54:05.311
ANDREW GRANT: Exactly.

00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:05.742
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:06.604
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:06.604 --> 00:54:08.573
AUDIENCE: So the
other crucial thing

00:54:08.573 --> 00:54:09.947
we were struggling
with before is

00:54:09.947 --> 00:54:13.720
how to make legitimate, actually
meaningful gameplay choices.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.500
When, if you just have
a bunch of options,

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.672
there's going to be some static
build-- just the correct one,

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:20.330
right?

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:23.490
So we need to make it so that
it was more situation-dependent.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.206
And [INAUDIBLE] had
a great idea, which

00:54:26.206 --> 00:54:29.925
was to be highly effective.

00:54:29.925 --> 00:54:33.562
Basically we have a thing
that's the best for reducing

00:54:33.562 --> 00:54:35.260
the infection rate
both ways, and then

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.374
a thing that's the
best for reducing

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:39.540
the symptom which could
spread infection downstream.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.040
And I think that's the best at
protecting you from infection.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.373
RIK EBERHARDT: Oh, that's great.

00:54:43.373 --> 00:54:47.540
AUDIENCE: And then suddenly--
that can be made incredibly

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.040
clear to the player, right?

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.330
We're not hiding what
the best build is.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:50.530
ANDREW GRANT: No.

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:51.030
You're playing Rock,
Paper, Scissors,

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.890
is what it sounds like.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:52.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:52.902
Exactly.

00:54:52.902 --> 00:54:53.652
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:54:53.652 --> 00:54:54.310
Awesome.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:54.935
AUDIENCE: And--

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.709
ANDREW GRANT: But-- so
it sounds like UI-wise,

00:55:00.709 --> 00:55:02.500
obviously this is a
huge, huge improvement,

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.779
just removing the options,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:55:05.779 --> 00:55:07.570
But when you start
having a little bit of--

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.420
do you already have
cross-talk in your game

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:11.313
code between villages going on?

00:55:11.313 --> 00:55:11.896
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:11.896 --> 00:55:12.990
We had that previously.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.990
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:16.784
So again, it really is you're
actually mostly cutting rather

00:55:16.784 --> 00:55:17.950
than adding, it sounds like.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:18.320
AUDIENCE: Pretty much.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:18.584
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:55:18.584 --> 00:55:18.650
Cool.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:20.635
RIK EBERHARDT: But you are
still adding the new UI--

00:55:20.635 --> 00:55:21.440
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:21.940
Which

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:24.560
RIK EBERHARDT: --which
I imagine we would see.

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.370
If we're looking at your backlog
now or soon, a lot of that

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:29.760
would be in the backlog.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:29.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.526
RIK EBERHARDT: Because
I think right now

00:55:31.526 --> 00:55:34.170
you've got some very--
actually, go to the task list.

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.400
I think this might have
been the vague one.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:35.710
AUDIENCE: OH, yeah.

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:36.650
The sprint tasklist?

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.980
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:37.090
Yeah.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:38.120
That's, like, wicked vague.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:39.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
tomorrow, but this

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:40.420
needs to be submitted today.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.137
So you get this really
vague description.

00:55:42.137 --> 00:55:42.970
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:43.305
We figured that.

00:55:43.305 --> 00:55:43.640
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.765
RIK EBERHARDT: No, that's--

00:55:44.765 --> 00:55:47.219
AUDIENCE: It'll probably
be in sprint tasklist five.

00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:49.010
I'll outline the stuff
that we're assigned.

00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.880
RIK EBERHARDT: I don't
care what's in this.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.030
I use what's in this to
know what you're doing.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:57.031
So I knew exactly
what was going on.

00:55:57.031 --> 00:55:58.072
AUDIENCE: So that's fine.

00:55:58.072 --> 00:55:58.545
RIK EBERHARDT: That's OK.

00:55:58.545 --> 00:55:59.710
AUDIENCE: All right, good.

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.710
RIK EBERHARDT: And if you
didn't me in anything,

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:02.500
that's like, OK.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.823
You're really on fire.

00:56:03.823 --> 00:56:04.750
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH]

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:05.130
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:05.890
Cool.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.280
So Phillip and I were
talking about the UI

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.650
that you were doing.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:13.040
You had mentioned, in the
presentation, civilization.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:15.780
But Phillip and I-- Phillip
actually remembered this.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.890
If you go to Molleindustria--
Paolo Pedercini

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:23.020
is a serious game designer.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.540
He might hate the
term "serious."

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:27.222
But he made a game
called-- I think it

00:56:27.222 --> 00:56:28.053
was called the McDonald's Game?

00:56:28.053 --> 00:56:29.412
ANDREW GRANT: I don't know.

00:56:29.412 --> 00:56:31.785
RIK EBERHARDT: I think it's
called the McDonald's Game--

00:56:31.785 --> 00:56:35.690
again, this is Phillip's idea.

00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:38.650
Basically, there's a lot of
different screens going on

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:39.272
in that game.

00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:40.730
But if you were to
make your game--

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:41.660
AUDIENCE: Oh, is
it the cutesy one?

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:41.950
RIK EBERHARDT: It
might be, yeah.

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:42.340
PHILLIP TAN: OK.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.120
I know exactly
which one that is.

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.920
RIK EBERHARDT: If
your game had as much

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.706
UI as one of those working
screens, then you'd be golden.

00:56:47.706 --> 00:56:50.848
So that's kind of like a
bar to set yourself towards,

00:56:50.848 --> 00:56:53.278
that I think you
could probably match,

00:56:53.278 --> 00:56:54.250
especially now that you've
cut a bunch of this stuff.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:54.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:54.940
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:56.565
RIK EBERHARDT: But
you can look at that

00:56:56.565 --> 00:56:59.030
as yet another way of seeing
how he's putting together

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:00.918
all of these UI
elements, or doing

00:57:00.918 --> 00:57:04.110
all of these systemic changes
in this very simple interface.

00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:07.360
So take a look at that.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:09.300
Otherwise, can you go
to the vision statement?

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.780
ANDREW GRANT: Yep.

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:11.738
RIK EBERHARDT: So vision
statement-- on Monday,

00:57:11.738 --> 00:57:13.150
I asked for you to revise it.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.990
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.740
I have it revised.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.596
I haven't submitted it yet.

00:57:15.596 --> 00:57:15.848
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:57:15.848 --> 00:57:15.932
Cool.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.410
AUDIENCE: It's right
here on my computer.

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:17.870
RIK EBERHARDT: Great.

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:18.810
Submit it under the
December 10 deadline.

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:19.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.021
RIK EBERHARDT: And then if you
have a new version afterwards,

00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:24.050
submit it there.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:26.450
And again, the big thing
that I was really looking for

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.713
is that 30 seconds of game
play actually reflecting

00:57:28.713 --> 00:57:29.712
what the game really is.

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:30.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:30.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:31.560
RIK EBERHARDT: Did you do the--

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.393
AUDIENCE: If you want
to read it real quick,

00:57:33.393 --> 00:57:36.375
this is what I have now for
the 30 seconds of game play,

00:57:36.375 --> 00:57:37.830
if that's better.

00:57:40.626 --> 00:57:41.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.170
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.169
RIK EBERHARDT: That sounds
like-- well, kind of.

00:57:44.169 --> 00:57:48.594
That looks to me like an
overview of a lot of game play.

00:57:48.594 --> 00:57:50.052
ANDREW GRANT: More
than 30 seconds.

00:57:50.052 --> 00:57:52.422
AUDIENCE: The thing is it was
hard to cut it into 30 seconds,

00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:54.588
because if you don't know
the beginning of the game,

00:57:54.588 --> 00:57:56.972
then doing 30 seconds in the
middle doesn't make sense,

00:57:56.972 --> 00:57:58.630
and doing 30 seconds
in the beginning

00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:59.720
doesn't make sense either.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.970
So that's why I kind of like--

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.670
ANDREW GRANT: Well, I
might question that.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:06.170
What is it that you are doing
in 30 seconds in the game-- is

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.253
you're probably looking
at one village and saying,

00:58:08.253 --> 00:58:10.790
what's the right intervention
for me to do right now?

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:13.964
Can you describe that
experience in a way at all?

00:58:13.964 --> 00:58:14.505
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:14.505 --> 00:58:18.300
ANDREW GRANT: Like I
decide that because there's

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.740
nobody downstream, I don't
need to worry about this thing.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:23.260
So I'm going to just direct
everyone to boil their water.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:24.039
Like--

00:58:24.039 --> 00:58:24.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:25.400
I--

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:26.100
ANDREW GRANT: Describe
the thought process.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:26.380
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.630
So that might be more like
the major game play concept,

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:29.310
or the vision itself.

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:29.880
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.030
RIK EBERHARDT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.160
ANDREW GRANT: That's what
you're doing for the whole game,

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:31.590
absolutely.

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:32.450
You're doing all of that stuff.

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:33.360
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.234
ANDREW GRANT: But the
30 seconds of game play

00:58:35.234 --> 00:58:38.780
is really about what does the
game feel like in the moment?

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.197
And it's a planning
game, so it's

00:58:40.197 --> 00:58:42.530
hard to do in 30 seconds of
game play that's meaningful.

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.835
But--

00:58:42.835 --> 00:58:45.130
RIK EBERHARDT: So if Rock,
Paper, Scissors is a way

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:49.010
to synthesize that, or I'm
making choice A versus Choice B

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.690
now.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.030
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.530
ANDREW GRANT:
Because your game is

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:52.575
about weighing choices
and making a good one.

00:58:52.575 --> 00:58:53.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.480
ANDREW GRANT: So 30
seconds of game play

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.714
should be about making a choice.

00:58:58.714 --> 00:59:01.150
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:04.820
ANDREW GRANT: So if what
you have that runs now

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:08.125
is very similar to what I saw
a while ago at this point,

00:59:08.125 --> 00:59:11.662
is this backlog up to
date, out of curiosity?

00:59:11.662 --> 00:59:14.614
AUDIENCE: So not really.

00:59:14.614 --> 00:59:16.090
It still needs to be fixed.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:17.090
ANDREW GRANT: All right.

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.760
AUDIENCE: A lot of this
stuff is like-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:20.540
It's difficult.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:20.830
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:21.280
So--

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.738
AUDIENCE: Tasks
have been split up,

00:59:22.738 --> 00:59:25.980
and, like, I'm somewhat
removed from the coding.

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.040
So I don't actually
know what's being done.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.175
So, for me, it's
hard to edit it.

00:59:30.175 --> 00:59:32.200
And so I exactly sure what--

00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:32.410
RIK EBERHARDT: Do you have a--

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.670
ANDREW GRANT: So I would claim
that not over the holiday.

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.310
But, you know, the
priority on Monday

00:59:36.310 --> 00:59:38.136
would be to make
sure it is up to date

00:59:38.136 --> 00:59:39.510
so you guys know
what's going on.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.260
Because for me
looking at it, hearing

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:43.176
that I can't play a newer
version of the one I

00:59:43.176 --> 00:59:46.315
played a while back and seeing
this backlog, I think, uh oh.

00:59:46.315 --> 00:59:49.520
So it may be that you're
much better off than that.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.550
But I think your
highest priority task

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.591
on, say, Monday is find out
if you're in trouble or not.

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:56.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:56.215 --> 00:59:57.220
ANDREW GRANT: And
if the answer's we

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.440
know we're in trouble, then, OK.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.856
You still need to do it so you
know what trouble you're in

01:00:00.856 --> 01:00:02.877
and how to adapt.

01:00:02.877 --> 01:00:04.460
Because I don't have
much information,

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.520
but I'm a little bit
nervous right now.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.035
But I suspect you're better
off than it looks on that page.

01:00:09.035 --> 01:00:10.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.345
RIK EBERHARDT: So you have
a one, two, three, four,

01:00:12.345 --> 01:00:13.410
five-person coding team?

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:13.993
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

01:00:13.993 --> 01:00:17.449
RIK EBERHARDT: Would you say one
person on that team fits lead?

01:00:17.449 --> 01:00:18.740
Like, do you have a lead coder?

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.860
AUDIENCE: Uh, Harry, probably.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.664
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:21.664 --> 01:00:22.740
RIK EBERHARDT: Does
he know he is lead--

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.420
AUDIENCE: Harry is
mostly the back end.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.202
I think he does.

01:00:24.202 --> 01:00:26.890
Because he mostly
doles-- him and Derek

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.050
dole out the tasks,
so I assume they

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.242
know that they're the leads.

01:00:30.242 --> 01:00:30.350
But--

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:30.670
ANDREW GRANT: OK.

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.900
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:33.774
Because that could just be you
meeting with them to make it

01:00:33.774 --> 01:00:35.440
easier rather than a
full eight-person--

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.970
ANDREW GRANT: You might not need
the entire eight-person team

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.210
for that.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:39.730
But again, also
there's a difference

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:42.150
been the person who knows
what the coders are doing

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:44.520
and the person who's
doing the most code.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.280
Those are two different things.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:49.490
And so you want to
figure out who's

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:53.284
really wearing what hat there.

01:00:53.284 --> 01:00:54.736
Yeah.

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:55.497
Cool.

01:00:55.497 --> 01:00:57.122
RIK EBERHARDT: Have
we kept you longer?

01:00:57.122 --> 01:00:57.621
Thank you.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:58.480
ANDREW GRANT: Yes.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.990
Thank you for your patience.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.160
RIK EBERHARDT: And, yeah.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.540
ANDREW GRANT: Do you have any
specific sort of questions,

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.405
worries that we can try to
talk about, or just get me out

01:01:08.405 --> 01:01:08.905
of here.

01:01:08.905 --> 01:01:09.700
It's Thanksgiving.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.950
[LAUGH]

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:12.000
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.780
I think the big unknown for
us right now is the new UI.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.067
We have the mechanics
that we want.

01:01:18.067 --> 01:01:19.817
We've really been
playing with the numbers

01:01:19.817 --> 01:01:23.935
for a while for what infection
rates and what efficacies

01:01:23.935 --> 01:01:25.560
and treatments and
what prices into a--

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.000
RIK EBERHARDT: Got it.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.925
AUDIENCE: --beatable game
that's also not trivial.

01:01:27.925 --> 01:01:28.169
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

01:01:28.169 --> 01:01:28.669
Cool.

01:01:28.669 --> 01:01:30.050
AUDIENCE: So we have that.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:32.860
The big question is the UI.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.090
The old version of
the UI has all sorts

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:40.665
of problems, where it'll
constantly orphan UI elements,

01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:42.540
and they'll sort of
accumulate on the screen.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.706
ANDREW GRANT: Got it Got it.

01:01:43.706 --> 01:01:45.570
So it's buggy, among--

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:46.540
AUDIENCE: It's buggy.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:50.790
So I'm much more worried
about having a functioning UI.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:52.980
So one thing I'm thinking
about is if we suddenly

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.080
find we don't have
anything working

01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:00.540
at some point, what sort of
bare-bones UI would work?

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:03.480
Like, for example,
you could concieve--

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.950
and this is sort of unclear.

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.630
You can see that the UI
can work entirely-- it

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.302
would be very, very simple.

01:02:09.302 --> 01:02:12.765
It would take half
an hour to write.

01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:15.110
For absolutely every
single action in the game,

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.450
it's like a keyboard thing.

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.235
The four villages are mapped
to the columns Q through Z, W

01:02:20.235 --> 01:02:20.735
through X.

01:02:20.735 --> 01:02:21.568
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

01:02:21.568 --> 01:02:23.469
AUDIENCE: And that
grid of 12 buttons

01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:24.510
does every single action.

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:24.977
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

01:02:24.977 --> 01:02:26.845
AUDIENCE: So it could
be reduced to that.

01:02:26.845 --> 01:02:28.389
It would take a
half hour to write.

01:02:28.389 --> 01:02:29.180
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.114
AUDIENCE: The question is--

01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:30.800
AUDIENCE: That would mean
having to explain that, though.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.070
ANDREW GRANT: Oh, yeah.

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:31.903
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:02:31.903 --> 01:02:34.020
ANDREW GRANT: So you
can't ship with that.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.280
But it might be worth
doing it, [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.450
half an hour, so you can
test your game as it exists,

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:40.950
internally.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:42.741
AUDIENCE: There's also
concern whether we--

01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:45.560
we're still clear if we have
to-- maybe other people aren't.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.590
But I remember at one
point hearing from you

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.532
tablets were what we--

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.365
AUDIENCE: We don't need
to worry about that.

01:02:50.365 --> 01:02:50.960
RIK EBERHARDT: No, no.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.210
No.

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.418
You've got a single platform.

01:02:52.418 --> 01:02:53.929
It's what you've
been developing on.

01:02:53.929 --> 01:02:54.720
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.370
It's this.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.635
RIK EBERHARDT: It's that.

01:02:55.635 --> 01:02:57.620
If that's what you've
been developing on.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.536
ANDREW GRANT: At this
point I would say, yeah.

01:02:59.536 --> 01:03:03.067
Whatever's-- we actually want
to grade it on a computer rather

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:03.650
than a tablet.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:04.062
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:03:04.062 --> 01:03:04.474
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

01:03:04.474 --> 01:03:04.886
RIK EBERHARDT:
That's exactly right.

01:03:04.886 --> 01:03:05.298
Yeah.

01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:05.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:07.605
RIK EBERHARDT: The tablet
was if it was a challenge

01:03:07.605 --> 01:03:08.779
that you wanted to take on.

01:03:08.779 --> 01:03:09.570
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.126
RIK EBERHARDT: The client
was like so, what's the--

01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.750
AUDIENCE: I totally
misunderstood that.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.735
RIK EBERHARDT: So
the after class life

01:03:15.735 --> 01:03:17.810
of this game and the
other Cholera game

01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:22.890
is they are being presented
to UNICEF as a possible funder

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:24.759
for games of that nature.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:25.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.841
RIK EBERHARDT: So
it's like, you want

01:03:26.841 --> 01:03:29.820
to make-- like UNICEF wants
to make games about Cholera

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.660
for Ghana, and
you're saying, here

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.780
are what those games
might look like.

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:34.779
Here are prototypes.

01:03:34.779 --> 01:03:35.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.180
RIK EBERHARDT: These
are not the games

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.550
we're going to ship to you.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:41.030
And if they were going to be the
games-- so when we're setting

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.905
one of these games,
we're going to be saying,

01:03:42.905 --> 01:03:44.945
imagine this is a
tablet-style game.

01:03:44.945 --> 01:03:46.134
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:03:46.134 --> 01:03:47.550
RIK EBERHARDT: And
the other thing

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:51.752
is if you are graduating and
wanted to work on this project,

01:03:51.752 --> 01:03:54.530
and [INAUDIBLE] had
funding for that project,

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.370
they might hire the students
who worked on these games

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.380
to make that project.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:58.790
ANDREW GRANT: Sure.

01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:01.039
RIK EBERHARDT: That's very
much a talk-in-January kind

01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:02.345
of thing.

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:03.275
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:04:03.275 --> 01:04:04.108
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:04:04.108 --> 01:04:07.970
ANDREW GRANT: And so
generally speaking, if that

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:11.100
takes a big worry of the UI
off your shoulders, awesome.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.520
But regardless, if you have
an unknown like that-- like,

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.474
as the new UI.

01:04:14.474 --> 01:04:15.640
Is that a big question mark?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.220
I'd make sure you schedule
it, prioritize it higher.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.560
It sounds like you have your
game play under control,

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.620
which is awesome.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.880
But you want to make sure
that whatever unknowns

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.700
you have are scheduled sooner so
that if they go horribly awry,

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.677
you have time to
adapt to that problem.

01:04:28.677 --> 01:04:30.052
RIK EBERHARDT:
And my last one is

01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:31.635
going to be, you've
already cut a lot.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.350
Can you cut more?

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:38.096
When you meet on Monday and
you say, are you in trouble?

01:04:38.096 --> 01:04:39.610
Like, all right.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.530
You've proved you can
cut a bunch of stuff.

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:43.196
You could possibly
cut a little bit more

01:04:43.196 --> 01:04:45.890
out of it too-- assuming
it's the kind of cutting

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:47.610
that doesn't create new work.

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:48.890
ANDREW GRANT: Right.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.160
But I would start with
that-- where the heck are we,

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.211
if you don't know.

01:04:52.211 --> 01:04:53.044
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

01:04:53.044 --> 01:04:53.521
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:54.690
ANDREW GRANT: And
probably all eight of you

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.573
don't know where you are, so
it's worth getting all eight

01:04:56.573 --> 01:04:58.260
of you to know where you are.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:03.370
AUDIENCE: I can't
even-- I see such-- I

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:06.570
see resulted-- I
didn't even realize

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.818
[INAUDIBLE] until I forgot it.

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:11.602
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH]

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.790
And that's why the last
project is so tough, actually.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:20.300
RIK EBERHARDT: It doesn't fit
the school year very well.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.600
ANDREW GRANT: Yeah.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.975
Unfortunately it's a shorter
term than we'd like to have,

01:05:22.975 --> 01:05:23.620
but, yeah.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.802
Eight people's a lot to keep
organized, even with full time.

01:05:26.802 --> 01:05:28.010
AUDIENCE: We only have seven.

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.210
Don't worry.

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.010
There's no eighth person.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:29.885
ANDREW GRANT: [LAUGH]

01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:31.160
RIK EBERHARDT: OK, cool.
