00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.290
PROFESSOR: Just very
quick-- very quick

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.550
what we're doing today and what
we're doing next on Wednesday.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.280
Phil's going to start with
an estimation lecture.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.770
We're going to follow that
up with a lecture from me

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.049
on Sprint Backlogs
and Task Lists.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.965
And then we're probably
going to take a break.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.250
You'll come back and you'll have
essentially a Sprint planning

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.860
meeting here in class where you
will create a Sprint backlog

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.726
and a task list,
hopefully with estimations

00:00:50.726 --> 00:00:52.892
down to how many hours you
think all those tasks are

00:00:52.892 --> 00:00:55.570
going to take you.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.500
Then we'll ask you
to come up and give

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.391
a very brief two minute
presentation on hey,

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:04.349
how did the process work,
and what was it like?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.650
How did it work for your team?

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.710
We're not actually interested
in hearing about your game

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.980
or what the top task
you have to do is.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.200
We trust that you have
a good game in progress

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.310
and that you've got a
reasonable set of tasks.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.110
But we actually want to hear
about how that meaning worked.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.000
So we'll also give
you about 10 minutes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.240
to have a little sort
of post-mort review

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.185
to talk about the process, after
you've made your task lists.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.580
Andrew will then come in.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.210
He'll be leading a discussion,
sort of a review discussion

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.800
on good software to see
what you've been doing

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.480
and see if you've remembered
anything he said from earlier.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.860
And you should have turned
in your product backlogs.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.620
And you should have code
running on your machines.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.470
We're not going to walk around
and inspect all your laptops

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.850
to find out if you
have running code.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.830
But to be on target, you really
should have something running,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.070
and if not playable,
at least pokable.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.070
For Wednesday, we'll be
talking about testing.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.090
And you'll be running
a focus test in house.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.960
And Genevieve Conley,
yes, from Riot

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.260
will be also giving a guest
lecture after the focus test.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.310
And I believe she'll be here
to wander around and help out

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.190
in the focus test a little bit.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.280
So I think that's everything.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.889
Now!

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:26.930
Those were my two slides.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.090
Now you can have the controls.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.641
PROFESSOR: Do try to come
in on time for class.

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.140
If you are unsure about whether
you can get your game set up

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.490
in time, come in early.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.280
And make sure that
your game is ready.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.370
When we have guests
coming to our class,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.180
we really will
prefer that people

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.470
don't walk in terribly late.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.520
It's just kind of embarrassing.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.720
All right.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.570
So over the weekend,
I found myself

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.080
in an unenviable
position of having

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.700
to teach-- prepare for
a video game class,

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.800
and not having a
working computer.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.070
So I had to prepare
for the possibility

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.090
that I wouldn't have a
computer as of today,

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.170
and redo my entire
presentation in analog format.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.720
But it turns out that IS&amp;T
actually does miracles

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.190
and got my computer back
and working on Monday.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.891
If you happen to
be working at IS&amp;T,

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.140
give yourself pat on the back.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.650
You are doing God's work.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.810
But I'm going to try to
do the analog thing anyway

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.840
because might is worth a shot.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.629
I'm going to do
to be very clear,

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.420
this is the first time
that I'm doing this.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.440
I'm going to need three
volunteers to come down.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.710
Come on down.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.840
Come on.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.340
Come down.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.230
All right.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.390
OK.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.760
So on Wednesday, we asked you
to split things up into small,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.320
medium, and large
features, right?

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.150
Small, medium, large.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.900
And I'm going to give you
an idea of what your product

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.240
backlog currently looks like.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.070
Your product backlog currently
looks like a bunch of features.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.640
All right.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.769
Now I'm going to assume that
all of you have sort of already

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.420
assigned small, medium, large
things to your features.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.910
Sort of small, medium, large
categories to your features.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.260
But I want to try doing
it slightly differently.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.090
I'm going to give each
of you three cards.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.070
These are the large currents.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.784
Medium.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.700
Can people see this from
the back, by the way?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.640
The letters on the card?

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.300
Small.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.580
So this is what's
going to happen.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.780
I'm going to pull
something out from here,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.770
and you all are going
to all look at it.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.844
And you are going to
figure out whether that

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:06.010
is going to be small, medium,
large without actually

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.350
discussing anything.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.850
All right.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:14.050
So you keep the cards hidden,
and only you can see it.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.760
And then when I ask you to
reveal it, show it all at once.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.740
Show me what you've picked.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.265
All right.

00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:22.515
I'm not going to tell you
what's small, what's medium,

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:23.560
or what's large.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.410
I want you to tell me what's
small, medium, and large.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.910
All right.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.400
So everyone clear
on how this works?

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.900
OK.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.970
Don't show it to anyone yet.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.780
Make sure everyone's picked.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.280
Yes?

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:45.990
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.130
Hang on to that.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.080
Is this a small,
medium, or large feature

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.200
with no frame of reference?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.220
So everyone's got one?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.860
Show it to me.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.030
Medium, medium, medium.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.530
All right.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.200
I'm going to put this here.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.260
Next one.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.581
Can everyone see this?

00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.080
All right.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.650
Everyone's picked one?

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.170
Show it.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.180
Medium, small, small.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.680
OK.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.615
Why is this a medium?

00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.346
AUDIENCE: Looks similar.

00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:16.486
PROFESSOR: It looks similar.

00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:16.985
All right.

00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:17.901
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:20.682 --> 00:06:21.830
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.372
The other one does
have a hole in it.

00:06:23.372 --> 00:06:24.330
If you haven't seen it.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.950
OK.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.480
I'm going to put this
one aside for now.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.090
This one.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.645
It is red.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.140
All right.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.080
Still being picked.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.030
Small, small, small.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.529
OK.

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:43.110
So this is unequivocally small.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.460
And this piece.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.460
This one also has a color in it.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.960
All right.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.490
Show it to me.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.010
Large.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.120
OK.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.020
Going back to this
one, what do you think?

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.130
Everyone show me
what you're thinking.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.800
Everyone thinks
that now is small.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.610
OK.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.420
All right.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.400
So, don't go back yet.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.450
But I want to say thank you very
much to all of our volunteers.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.570
Why did I just make you
all go through all of that?

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.060
That seems like a very,
very inefficient way

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.784
of sorting out features.

00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:26.450
Like if I just gave
you this entire box,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.914
this is what I
want you to do now.

00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:29.830
Sort this whole box into
small, medium, large.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.840
All three of you together.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.881
You don't need the cards.

00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:34.245
Go for it.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:35.161
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:20.372 --> 00:08:22.170
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.070
Thank you very much.

00:08:26.997 --> 00:08:29.330
If you can just hang out here,
just a little bit longer,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.120
that will be great.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.700
Now that is probably a fairly
good analog of how most of you

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.380
figured out small, medium,
and large on Wednesday.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.270
Which was you just compared
features next to each other.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.240
Figured out which one's
seen on the larger end.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.190
Which ones was on the small end.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.140
And just kind of
put things in place.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.220
But there was some
discussion going on.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.867
Is this small?

00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:52.450
Is this large?

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.790
It's just like do
two of these put

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.070
together make one
medium, for instance?

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.940
Now think about the first
method of first choosing

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.080
whether this was small,
medium, large and revealing

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.400
it, was that I forced you
to actually voice out why

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.380
you thought that was different.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.630
I believe you picked a medium.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.090
And the others picked a small.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.580
For a lot of these other pieces,
you didn't voice anything out.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.070
And one of the reasons why
we can do this so quickly,

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.710
is because human
beings are actually

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.570
pretty good at reasoning
about spatial volume.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.320
You're pretty good
at-- and being at MIT,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:39.310
you also understand geometry,
3D geometry, in a sense

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.180
pretty well.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.220
So you can make these spatial
reasonings pretty well.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.090
But when it comes to things
like time and complexity,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.807
human beings tend to
have a tougher problem.

00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:51.390
So I'm going to say,
for instance, I'm

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.740
going to give you three blocks.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.480
This represents for you,
seven hours of work.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.690
OK?

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.480
This represents for
you, six hours of work.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.790
This represents eight
hours of work for you.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.380
All right?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.185
So you know you've got
16 hours of work to do.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.670
Pick out features that
you're going to implement

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.461
in your next print.

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:24.190
AUDIENCE: So this is how
much time I have in my life.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.230
PROFESSOR: That is
how much time that you

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.240
spent on the last feature.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.877
If all three of you worked
on identical features--

00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:32.460
AUDIENCE: OK, so
this is already done.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:32.905
This is already done.

00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:33.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.250
This is done.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.595
This is a known value.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.050
You spent seven hours on that.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.920
You have 16 hours.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.864
AUDIENCE: So I spent
seven hours on this.

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.836
And then there are the
two small triangles.

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:58.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.065
PROFESSOR: The first
one is just a reference.

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:11.890
And the little feature.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:12.390
OK.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.510
All right.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.220
All right.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.280
What did the cube
represent to you again?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.290
Seven hours of work.

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.160
And you picked?

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.100
And you think that that's
a reasonable amount of work

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.215
to get done in 16 hours?

00:11:29.762 --> 00:11:30.720
Not including that one.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.340
So this is about 16 hours of--
assuming volume equals time.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.100
Sorry, volume equals
effort, actually.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.190
All right.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.774
And over here?

00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:43.106
AUDIENCE: How long did it
take me to do the other block?

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:44.000
AUDIENCE: Six hours.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.190
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.734
I guess I could have
done a little bit more.

00:11:45.734 --> 00:11:46.485
Well, that's fine.

00:11:46.485 --> 00:11:47.942
I'll just do
[INAUDIBLE] like them.

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:50.027
And then if I have leftover
time, I'll do more.

00:11:50.027 --> 00:11:52.652
PROFESSOR: If you went for more,
what would you try to pick on?

00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:54.312
AUDIENCE: I guess
maybe this one.

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:55.888
It's a little bit
more than perhaps I

00:11:55.888 --> 00:11:58.096
could do in exactly 16, but
it wouldn't hurt to touch it.

00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:00.400
PROFESSOR: It's the smallest
thing that you can find.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:00.910
OK.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.710
All right.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.270
And for you?

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.740
AUDIENCE: This exactly
fills my estimate.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.007
But realistically, I'd
probably go with this.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.600
PROFESSOR: So you're using
kind of programmer patterning.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.430
You got a question?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:22.210
AUDIENCE: Sometimes you do not
[INAUDIBLE] the small things,

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.150
for example, adding balls
to your game set is small.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.600
But bringing out
the framework itself

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.312
is a large test
that must be done

00:12:29.312 --> 00:12:31.520
before you have the choice
of choosing smaller tasks.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.480
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.230
That's true.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.970
I am not indicating
priority in here.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.360
I'm assuming that you're
picking up high priority tasks.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.110
The next thing that
needs to be done.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.950
Thank you very much.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.535
And you may have a seat.

00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:47.660
Big hand to our volunteers.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.760
I'll be going back to
this example shortly,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.140
as soon as I get my
presentation going on.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.750
I want you to hang
onto these examples

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.190
because I'm going to come
back to them during the talk.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.980
On Wednesday-- and what I first
asked our volunteers down here

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.230
to do was to do a small, medium,
large, extra large feature

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.050
sizing, basically.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.970
The reason why we use
these broad categories

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.740
is because actually
it can be pretty fast.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.320
And on Wednesday a lot of
you did it pretty quickly.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.850
However, what I
noticed on Wednesday

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.740
was a lot of people weren't
actually discussing how big

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.490
or how small these
features were.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.500
Like you all using your
own little metrics.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.430
So that was a good question.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.280
Small, medium, or large to
what frame of reference?

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.280
And everybody had their
own frames of reference.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.170
When I forced people
to make the assessment

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.950
and then declare it in
front of the entire team,

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.160
and then discuss if they
disagreed with the entire team,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.540
then assumptions
started coming out.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.740
You had to vocalize why you
thought a certain feature was

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.830
a bigger or smaller.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.710
You could adjust your
assessment after the discussion.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.620
But it very, very important
to get that discussion out

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.530
to everybody.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.520
So as long as you're discussing
with your entire team,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.470
I don't really care what method
you use to split things up

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.060
into small, medium, and large.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.060
But you need to be
discussing as an entire team.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.980
In fact, every single
member of the team

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.130
should be in on the
discussion, because somebody

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.440
in charge of sound design,
or somebody in charge of art,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.800
or in charge of art of
the code architecture

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.850
would have very different
perspective on any given future

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.100
from other people on the team.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.760
And you want all of those
perspectives in the same time.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.590
There's oh!

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:47.699
Playing a sound effect.

00:14:47.699 --> 00:14:49.990
That's going to take no time
at all, because we already

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.960
have sound effects
in our game, and we

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.170
know how that code works.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.230
That's what a programmer thinks.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.640
The sound designer
says wait a minute.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.240
I need to create
that sound effect.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.780
I don't even know what this
is going to sound like yet.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.710
I have no idea.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.570
And that's going to be larger
feature from my point of view.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.640
And you want that
discussion to come out.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.960
So each row should try
to lend its perspective.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.670
And is very important to listen.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.992
The reason why I forced everyone
to do this-- the volunteers

00:15:13.992 --> 00:15:15.450
to do this-- right
at the beginning

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.620
was because it was a
very turn-based method

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.390
of getting that discussion out.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.380
I had to force everybody
to listen to everybody.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.590
And something that I didn't
ask our volunteers to do

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.702
was to offer
alternate solutions.

00:15:32.702 --> 00:15:35.160
However, they kind of did that
automatically by themselves.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.190
When I just left them
to their own devices,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.480
I said, sort these
out into features.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.450
They started
discussing well, this

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.340
is how I look at a problem, this
is how you look at a problem.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.046
And they quickly came to
some sort of consensus.

00:15:50.046 --> 00:15:51.920
Of course, something I
mentioned on Wednesday

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.169
was if you've got a really,
really huge feature that's

00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:55.640
kind of hard to figure out.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.470
It doesn't really fit neatly
into any of these boxes.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.780
Break it up into
smaller features.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.810
You want to converge.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.619
You want to converge
down in to a consensus.

00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:08.660
But there are right ways
and there are wrong ways

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.336
to go about that.

00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:12.835
Every time you have
that discussion,

00:16:12.835 --> 00:16:16.580
you're getting new information
into the team about how

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.960
complex a certain problem is.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.150
Maybe sometimes
through a discussion,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.700
you discover a certain
problem is easier--

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.190
a certain feature is easier
to implement than you

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.800
had originally expected.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.160
And then you redraw a C.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.096
Other people's estimates is
actually new information.

00:16:31.096 --> 00:16:32.720
And that's actually
what happened here.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:40.320
There was small, small medium,
and the people on the volunteer

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:46.785
team figured out how other
people were seeing the problem.

00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:48.410
Here's something
that's very important.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:49.680
Don't negotiate.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.452
Don't say I think it's
small, you think it's small,

00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:54.910
most of the team
thinks it's small,

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.600
somebody thinks it's medium.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.700
Just change your
estimate down to a small.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.210
I suppose it's kind of adamant.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.870
No, I think this is a bigger
problem than you think it is.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.630
Don't try to negotiate
with that person

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.040
because that person has
a valid point of view,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.380
and this starts to
focus a discussion

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:16.069
on changing the person's mind,
not focusing on the feature.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:18.540
You actually want
to figure out how

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.929
complex a certain feature is.

00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:22.720
For the same reason,
don't take an average.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.910
Someone thinks it's
a small feature,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.050
someone think that's
a large feature.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.859
That doesn't make
it a medium feature.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.600
That means that your team has
no idea what this feature is

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.010
because you aren't in agreement
with how complex something is.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.330
So what I did--
does anyone remember

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.140
what I did when-- let me see.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.590
Which feature was the
weird one that people

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.161
were kind of hung up on?

00:17:44.161 --> 00:17:45.160
I think it was this one.

00:17:47.545 --> 00:17:49.920
When we got to this one, and
there was some disagreement,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.211
can anyone remember what I did?

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:54.450
Yeah.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.990
I just put it aside, right?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:58.850
I actually gave it away.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.700
It is a very, very easy to
get into a long drawn out

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.225
discussion about how large
or how small a feature is.

00:18:04.225 --> 00:18:06.500
It's usually much more
clearer if you sort of

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.614
tackle the easy ones first,
and then come back to the ones

00:18:09.614 --> 00:18:10.530
that you disagreed on.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.270
But you remember
that you disagreed,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.170
and you got new information in
the process of talking it out.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.270
So that's a role for
the Scrum Master.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.640
The Scrum Master says we don't
want this feature estimation

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.579
process to take too
long, so we're just

00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:25.370
going to put that
feature aside first, look

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.870
at the other features, do
the estimation on that,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.460
and then review it later.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.440
But a Scrum Master
does not decide

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.830
what size that feature is.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.700
The whole team has to
come to a consensus.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.770
You want to converge
on a single estimate.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.850
So if you put together
your product backlog,

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.230
and you never really discussed
with the rest of your team

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.214
what those size estimates
were, then that's

00:18:51.214 --> 00:18:53.130
something that you're
going to do later today.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.766
Before the end of
today I want you

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.890
to have a discussion about
whether these things are

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.890
actually small,
medium, or large.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.060
And the reason is
because estimation--

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.310
it is not just a process of
just putting down numbers

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.720
or letters on a spreadsheet.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.637
There is a goal for the
process of estimation.

00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:13.220
And it's this.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:16.877
It's to get a clear enough view
of the reality of your project

00:19:16.877 --> 00:19:18.960
so that you can make
informed decisions to control

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.160
your project in order
to hit the targets.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.100
Now what's a target?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.500
A target is a goal that
you wish would happen.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.300
It's your fondest desires
is to get this project done.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.320
Entire product backlog of
all features into your game

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.080
before the deadline.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.790
That's a target, right?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.390
Maybe your target's a
little bit closer term.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.860
What can you get
done by this week?

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.510
What can you get
done by this spread?

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.270
It's still a target, and
something that you want to hit.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:52.460
But you can't base
all of your decisions

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.110
on your fondest desires.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.560
You have to base it on
what your team's actually

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.070
capable of doing.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.460
An estimation is a
process of actually trying

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.040
to understand what your
team is capable of doing.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:12.840
Not whether what you want to
happen, but what can happen.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.290
So what are you estimating?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.880
This is where you
are at right now.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.330
You have a product
backlog, and you have size.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.490
You have feature size that
is going to get broken down

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.350
into a bunch of tasks.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.230
Each feature is going
to be broken down

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.240
into individual things that
individual people can do.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.580
Maybe a certain
feature like jump

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.110
involves art, involves
code, involves sound,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.736
involves debugging,
involves integration.

00:20:40.736 --> 00:20:42.110
All of these are
individual tasks

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.050
that might be carried
out by different people.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.706
So what you're really
doing in the second step

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:50.080
is to figure out how much time
something's going to take.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:54.470
Remember what Drew said on
the very first day of class.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.850
It's not so much how
hard something is,

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.709
how hard a feature is, but
how long it's going to take.

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:01.250
And what you want
to do is figure out

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.920
how long it's going to take.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.785
Now that's a process of arriving
at a number of how many hours

00:21:06.785 --> 00:21:08.410
this is really going
to take, and is it

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.020
going to fit within
the amount of time

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:15.350
that we've actually
given the team?

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.730
And you need to translate
it first from size

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.460
into effort, which is like,
total amount of effort that's

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.510
going to be used to
tackle the problem.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.780
Split it up among the
people who are actually

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.390
going to work on it,
and then each person

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.170
has an individual
amount of efficiency.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.410
So for instance, I gave
exactly the same cube

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.550
to all three volunteers.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.560
But I told them this
meant different things

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.070
to each one of you.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:49.360
And when they picked off
tasks off the product backlog,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.200
they picked it based on
their own personal metric.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.870
That's what you've
got to do too.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.660
When you decide that you're
going to take on a task,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.850
you have to assess it
based on your own ability

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.300
to actually execute on a task.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.430
Say it's an AI
problem, and you're not

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.050
very well versed in AI.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.430
It's going to take you longer
than somebody that has done

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.037
artificial intelligence before.

00:22:11.037 --> 00:22:12.870
But that's OK because
maybe the person who's

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.130
doing artificial
intelligence is busy

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.810
trying to solve or harrier
problem establishing the base

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.917
framework of code.

00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:21.250
And that needs to be done first.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.730
And that needs to
be done sooner.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:24.150
So that person is busy.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:27.390
You can start working
on certain features,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.157
even though you may not be
the best person to do it.

00:22:30.157 --> 00:22:32.240
That's fine as long as I
make an honest assessment

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:36.570
of how long it's going
to take you to do it.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.030
Size estimates are pretty easy.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.830
You're just sorting
things into buckets.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.630
Very large buckets.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.250
Time estimates are very much
like hitting a moving target.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.080
As you start to
make estimates, you

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.000
are going to discover
that many of those

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.401
estimates just flat out wrong.

00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:54.900
You're going to say
oh, that's going

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.700
to take me four hours to do.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.980
And it takes you
four days to do.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.970
And you're going to have to
communicate that to your team.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.920
Giving an estimate is not the
same thing as making a plan.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.494
It is part of the
same process, but I

00:23:11.494 --> 00:23:12.910
want to be very
clear about what's

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.390
the difference between
estimation and planning.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.590
Say somebody on your team
asks you for an estimate.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.670
[INAUDIBLE] alarm
bells going off

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.320
when he says, how long is
this going to take you to do?

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.660
Everyone starts to get worried
because you're not quite sure

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.380
whether they're actually trying
to ask you for how difficult is

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.380
something, and how
much time do you think

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.890
it's really going to take.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:41.090
Or are they asking you, can
you get it done by Monday?

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.220
That's kind of like
the hidden question

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.910
that they're not asking, but
they think that they're asking.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.150
So you need to be very
clear when you respond,

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.320
whether you're giving
an estimate or a plan.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.610
You plan to reach your targets.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.170
Obviously, none of
you-- I hope none of you

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.820
are planning to not
hit your targets.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.320
I plan to get this done one
week after the deadline.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.092
(WHISPERS) No.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.140
But once you've made your
plan-- here's our entire product

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.986
backlog, and we think
it looks reasonable,

00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:14.360
and we think that
it can actually

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.769
be done by the
deadline-- you need

00:24:17.769 --> 00:24:20.435
to start making estimates to see
whether that plan is realistic.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.910
You can say, yeah, I think
that's a reasonable estimate

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.810
when you think that
assessment is accurate.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.050
I've done something
similar before,

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.950
so I figured that
this is something

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.090
that we can get done
before the end of the week.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.680
You can commit to that estimate.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.610
But you haven't
committed to the plan.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.260
You haven't said, I'm going
to take responsibility

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.430
for getting it done by
the end of the week.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:50.740
That's a very different thing.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.470
When you accept
the task and say,

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.990
all right, put my name
on that spreadsheet,

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.461
and I have decided
that I think I'm

00:24:59.461 --> 00:25:01.460
going to be able to get
this done in four hours,

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.080
so I'm now committing
to this plan.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.790
Of course then everything goes
wrong, and you re-estimate.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.070
You're allowed to
make re-estimations

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.120
while you work on tasks.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.000
You have to because no
plan survives first contact

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.610
with actual development.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.160
So here's a quick quiz.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.840
Here are four
statements that you

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.380
might hear in the middle
of a team meeting.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.590
OK.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.630
I want you to tell me what
each one of these things are.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.990
I've already used
the words describing

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.610
each one of these things
in my talk so far.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.130
It has to be done in two days.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.400
What is that?

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.809
It's a deadline.

00:25:43.809 --> 00:25:45.350
I used another word
to describe that.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:47.610
It is a deadline.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.840
Is it a plan?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.830
It's a target.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.290
Someone.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.500
All right.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.150
So the next one.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.690
It'll take about
two days to do it.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.200
You're talking in
a team, you say,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.750
this feature looks like it'll
take about two days to do it.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.210
That's an estimate.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.930
That's right.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.610
I'll need two days to do it.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.070
That is a plan.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.270
That is a plan that you're
committing to, more accurately.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.350
It's like, I will take
two days to do it.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.360
You might take
three days to do it.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.760
You might be able to do it
faster than [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.290
But I'll need two days to do it.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:33.170
And of course the last
one is, actual reality.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.260
It actually took
two days to do it.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.750
I mean, in reality it'd be like,
it took four days to do it.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:42.030
So I want you to
be very, very clear

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.330
that when you're
communicating with your team,

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.680
what you are trying to say.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.380
Are you giving estimations?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.410
Given all the information
that you know,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.510
this is how tough
something is going to take.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.920
And this is how long
it is going to take

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.444
to get this feature working.

00:26:57.444 --> 00:26:59.110
Or are you making a
personal commitment,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.879
saying this is my
responsibility now?

00:27:00.879 --> 00:27:02.420
I'm going to get it
to you by Monday.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.190
Just a quick side
note, you've probably

00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:13.910
seen these two words come up in
numerous engineering classes.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:15.940
The difference between
accuracy and precision.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.065
Which one is more accurate?

00:27:21.692 --> 00:27:23.650
Raise your hand in the
direction that you think

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.280
is more accurate.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:26.780
OK.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.490
That's actually-- OK.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.300
I think that's a
majority on this side.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.440
Which means that that
one is more precise.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.370
OK?

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.260
So that's right.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.200
This is more accurate.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.366
It's closer to the target
that you're trying to hit.

00:27:40.366 --> 00:27:43.340
Even though it's kind of
like broadly spaced out.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.922
None of them actually
hit the target,

00:27:44.922 --> 00:27:46.380
but if you took
the average of all,

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.080
then you get pretty
close to the center.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.800
That one's a really
nice tight grouping.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.050
Anyone here do pistol,
or archery, or rifle?

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:01.350
So we always talk about
how tight the grouping

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.570
is when you're shooting.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:04.750
That's very precise.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:11.690
That can be corrected by say,
fixing the sites on a pistol,

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.080
or on a rifle.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.280
But for time estimates, this
is consistent underestimating.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.820
Right?

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.600
It's like, yeah, it's going
to take me two days to do it.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.890
I'll get it done in two hours.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.500
Really, it took four
days and four hours.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.080
And you're always doing this.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.000
When it comes to estimation,
accuracy is more important then

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.520
precision because you're going
to work on multiple tasks.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.590
And if your estimates are a
little bit off all the time,

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.510
but sometimes you're
under, sometimes

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.350
you're over, that
kind of averages out.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:49.010
Which means that you can still
make some effective plans.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.410
But if you are consistently
underestimating or consistently

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:56.150
overestimating, you need
to figure that out quickly.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.500
You need to learn that about
yourself during this class

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.002
so that you can start
to correct that.

00:29:02.002 --> 00:29:03.710
And if you can't figure
it out, hopefully

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.510
somebody else on your team can
realize that your estimates are

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.010
always off in a
certain direction

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.960
and then adjust the
plan accordingly.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.960
It's also important to
know what the uncertainty

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.050
of your estimates are.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.050
It's very valuable to know
how imprecise an estimate is.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.560
It's like, this could
be done in a week

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.350
if I find someone else who's
implemented a feature just

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.509
like the one that we want.

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:27.800
If not, I'm going to have to
implement it from scratch,

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.530
and it's going to take
four weeks to implement.

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.420
I mean, that's a
fairly common scenario.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.290
So it's very valuable to know
how imprecise an estimate is.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:45.960
But while I welcome that
kind of discussion in a team,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.980
don't just give a range.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.560
Don't just say,
well that's going

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.820
to take anywhere between
one week and four weeks.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.120
That's too wide a range.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:56.100
You can't establish
a plan on that.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.200
How many of you have
been in this situation?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.210
Two minutes remaining.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.330
And it just kind of sits there.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.356
And it's really
four minutes later,

00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:04.980
and it's just what
the heck's going on?

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:10.440
It would be much better
if you had actually,

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.617
that progress bar.

00:30:11.617 --> 00:30:13.450
And that progress bar
is actually giving you

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.530
a single point estimate.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.460
This progress bar is
kind of telling you

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.540
this job is about 15% complete.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.765
And it's telling me there's
two minutes remaining.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.750
And that bar still has
a long way to fill up.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:31.437
So you realize this
estimate may not

00:30:31.437 --> 00:30:33.270
be terribly accurate,
because it not working

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.075
on a lot of information.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.297
It may be a
pessimistic estimate.

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:42.630
But you still need to commit
to a single point estimate,

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.171
if you want to make
a plan around it.

00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:46.030
Don't just use the
average of a range.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.114
The difference between
a one week estimate

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:52.030
and a four week estimate
for the same feature,

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.130
is not somewhere in between.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.844
It's not like it's going to
take two and a half weeks.

00:30:56.844 --> 00:30:59.010
With the one week estimate
and a four week estimate,

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.090
are two very different
circumstances.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.202
One week, if you found
somebody else's code

00:31:03.202 --> 00:31:04.660
that basically does
the same thing.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.120
Four weeks if you had to
write it from scratch.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.450
One week in, you know exactly
what situation you're in.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.849
Either the code is done,
or the code is not done,

00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:14.640
and you know it's going
to take four weeks.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.430
Your estimate is not like,
two and a half weeks.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:22.087
You're not halfway in between.

00:31:22.087 --> 00:31:23.920
The good news is that
the time estimates are

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.940
entirely internal to your team.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.780
No one outside your
team needs to know this.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.630
I don't need to know this,
Sarah doesn't need to know this.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.680
None of the graders need to know
what your time estimates were.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:39.610
We're not holding you to-- your
grade is not dependent on this.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:42.240
This means that you can revise
your estimates over time.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.310
And I'm going to
encourage you to do that.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.170
You are not Neo.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.990
You aren't going
to be faster, just

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.850
because you want to be faster.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.040
So it's important to
actually understand what's

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.550
your actual pace of work.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.580
Now this is something
that I'm going

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.210
to recommend that everybody
do starting from today.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.090
And that's to track
your own estimates.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.020
This is one way
that you can do it.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.777
It's not the only way,
but it's good enough.

00:32:06.777 --> 00:32:09.110
Where you write down the
feature that you're working on.

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.590
Say it's the jump feature.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.480
And you have the task
that you took on.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.330
I'm a coder, so I'm
going to say I'm

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.670
going to put some upward
velocity when the player hits

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.120
the space bar.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.930
I'm also going to
write some code

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.880
to play a sound effect
when that happens.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.210
These are two separate tasks.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.522
And with the
original estimations,

00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:30.980
that was going to
take eight hours.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.800
It's going to take five hours.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.930
And then you actually
write down how many hours

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.777
you spent on this task so far.

00:32:38.777 --> 00:32:40.110
For the first task, it was done.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.900
It took me 10 hours to do.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.890
Or longer than I expected.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.300
So my eventual estimate
was 10 because I actually

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.310
knew it took ten hours to do.

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.630
If I ever have to do
that same feature again,

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.710
let's say a feature
of the same size,

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.170
again, a task of the same size.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:59.300
Again to be accurate,
then I'm going

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.990
to estimate, next
time if I think

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.448
it's going to be eight, I'm
going to write down 10 instead,

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:07.440
because that's what previous
history has taught me.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.520
Let's say I'm in the middle
of writing my jump sound code.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.410
I thought it will
take five hours.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.530
I've spent two hours on it.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.502
And I look at it, and
I think actually this

00:33:18.502 --> 00:33:20.710
is a little easier than I
thought it was going to be.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.170
So I'm going to say probably
only another two more

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.392
hours of work on this.

00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:27.850
And my current
estimate is actually

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.390
being revised downwards.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.890
So this is going to get faster.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:34.770
And if I put this in a public
location, where my Scrum

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.610
Master to read this,
it can actually

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:39.504
see my progress on my work.

00:33:39.504 --> 00:33:41.920
You might be able to also do
this on certain task tracking

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.720
tools.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.680
Don't estimate in
ideal work hours.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.810
Don't say, if I had
four uninterrupted hours

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.240
to just work on
this game, I'm going

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.560
to get this jump thing working.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.790
How many of you ever have
four uninterrupted hours?

00:33:58.790 --> 00:33:59.720
Really?

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.890
Is this like between
midnight and 4 AM?

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.760
OK.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.260
OK.

00:34:08.237 --> 00:34:08.820
Uninterrupted?

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.469
You're not like, checking
Facebook, or having

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.170
to get a snack in between?

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:14.710
No?

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.210
Really?

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.949
If there are distractions,
if there are team meetings,

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:25.120
if there are other problems
that [INAUDIBLE] that you

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.870
expect to have to do,
you should count it.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.770
You should count it
in your task time.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.920
You should be able
to account for this.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.366
Because say so you've
blocked off 12 hours of-- No.

00:34:38.366 --> 00:34:39.199
Let's say six hours.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:43.840
You are going to spend six hours
on this project over the week.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.719
And you know you've got
that, because you're

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.552
going to have to spend
the rest of your time

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:49.845
going to other classes,
and doing other work.

00:34:49.845 --> 00:34:51.469
And you know that
you've got a one hour

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:54.800
meeting somewhere in there.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.080
Part of your task is actually
going to that meeting,

00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:59.792
and figuring out how a
certain feature should

00:34:59.792 --> 00:35:01.250
be implemented,
before you actually

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.220
start writing the code.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.190
Or actually start
doing the art for it.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.790
You want to factor that
into your task estimation.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.440
You don't want to say
that's a separate thing.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.440
At least if you do count
it as a separate thing,

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.856
make sure that
you've actually got

00:35:13.856 --> 00:35:17.050
that as a separate task with
an actual time estimate on it.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.610
Count all of your distractions.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.818
Do try to schedule and time
box all of your meetings,

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:22.460
because it makes
estimation easier.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.010
If you know that a meeting's
time boxed to one hour,

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.710
you can't spend more than
one hour in a meeting.

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.560
And you can actually account
for that in your estimations.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.420
Don't just always have ad
hoc meetings, for instance,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.150
like on Skype.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:37.260
Because then you're
just stealing

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.230
a couple of minutes from
everybody's schedule

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:44.240
all the time without any one
being able to plan for it.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.960
So you've got
something like this,

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.892
where you're tracking
all of your progress,

00:35:47.892 --> 00:35:49.850
then you just add up all
of your time estimates

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.720
when a feature is done.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.270
And then you can go
back to your original

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.410
small, medium, and large
and say this thing took me

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.890
seven hours to complete.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.770
And if I get another feature
that looks like these two

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.720
features, for
instance, and say it's

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.750
about two half features
compared to that seven hours.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.220
I said, OK, three and a
half, three in a half.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.512
And you can use that.

00:36:15.512 --> 00:36:16.720
It's not going to be perfect.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.220
It's not going to be accurate.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.930
But you're basing it on real
evidence of how fast you

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.600
personally work.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.700
So all of this information helps
you become a better estimator

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.700
of your own performance.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.050
And in the future, you
can use those numbers

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.860
for future sprint planning.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.957
So when you finish one
sprint-- say it's project 4,

00:36:36.957 --> 00:36:38.290
and you've got multiple sprints.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:41.440
You finish one sprint, and
you know that this takes you

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.840
eight hours to complete.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.930
So the next time you get
this size feature, well

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.550
it took me eight
hours last time.

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.541
So I'm going to say that that
feature looks like a eight hour

00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.040
task.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.640
You should
re-estimate every day.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:03.120
So you animate your jump and
say that's too big of a feature,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.240
so I'm going to split into
two tasks, the animate,

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.807
the jump take off, and the
animate, the jump landing.

00:37:09.807 --> 00:37:11.390
Since they are two
very similar tasks,

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.030
I'm going to put the same
time estimate on both of them.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.196
And then I'm going to start
working on jump take off

00:37:16.196 --> 00:37:19.060
since you have to go in the
air before you can come down.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.371
And I'm going to
start working on this.

00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:25.370
The task is a little bit
harder than I expected,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.120
so actually it was a
five hour estimate.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.040
So I'm going to increase it
up to a six hour estimate.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.100
And then eventually,
I got it done.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.359
Down to zero.

00:37:34.359 --> 00:37:35.900
I have no more hours
on this feature.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.399
It works.

00:37:36.399 --> 00:37:36.900
It's tested.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.790
It's integrated.

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.480
Everything's fine.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.570
Now I have to do
the second feature.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.540
Animate the jump landing.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.042
What should I write
down for that?

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.250
Let's say by the time I
actually came to the situation

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.260
where I wrote down I
had six hours remaining,

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.230
I had already spent eight
hours working on the feature.

00:38:07.756 --> 00:38:09.630
I spent eight hours
working on jump take off,

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.860
and it wasn't done.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.200
Then I wrote down I
had six hours left.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.060
So what's my new
feature estimate?

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.000
14.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.080
A lot bigger.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.290
Because that's real evidence.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.599
It may be that during the
process of doing this earlier

00:38:28.599 --> 00:38:30.890
feature, you've learned
certain techniques that's going

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.220
to speed up your next thing.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.880
However, that's
wishful thinking.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.380
That's hope.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.850
That's what you desire
will happen in reality.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:40.619
The actual information
that you have

00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:43.160
is that actually if you add up
all the hours I actually spend

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.666
on this, it took me 14 hours.

00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.290
So I'm going to revise
the next feature

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.160
and let the rest of
my team know that I

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.100
think this next feature
is going to 14 hours.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.186
Divide and conquer.

00:38:53.186 --> 00:38:55.560
If you've got a very big
feature and very, very big task,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.920
break into little bits,
and do your estimations.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.260
Don't forget to
account for debugging.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:07.630
This is one of the very
first actual bugs found

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.560
by Admiral Grace
Hopper, stuck in a vial

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.590
somewhere in a computer in 1940,
that actually caused a program

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.960
to fail.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.130
That's one theory of where
the term debugging came from.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.380
Don't forget integration time.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.870
Taking your code and your
assets and your writing

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.090
and your dialogue
and sound effects,

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.450
and making them work
with other people's code

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.580
and contributions.

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.510
Don't forget that
some of you are

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:38.540
going to get very exhausted
and overloaded while you're

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.994
working on this project.

00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:42.660
And don't forget to take breaks,
and to account for those breaks

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.160
in your time estimation.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.780
If you know that you
don't tend to work well

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.110
on a four-hour
stretch, and you tend

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.060
to work much better
with one hours,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.160
with a five minute or 10 minute
break, and then another hour,

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.950
then use that in
your time estimates.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:02.800
Try to estimate so that
you can work efficiently.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.137
Not just how you wish
you could be working.

00:40:08.137 --> 00:40:08.720
Any questions?

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.830
I thought that was
kind of fire hosey.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.680
We'll probably get
back to this-- actually

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.220
we will actually have
you practice this

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:28.700
later on in class.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.859
Five minute break?

00:40:29.859 --> 00:40:32.400
All right, so right now we'll
do a five minute break while we

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.720
switch our computers around.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:37.790
Be back here by 1:53.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.780
OK.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.410
We are back on.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:49.550
So we're back on.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.912
Hopefully this will actually
not be terribly long,

00:40:51.912 --> 00:40:54.120
because at least some of
the stuff I'm talking about,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.410
Philip has already
really touched on,

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.930
and discussed in more
detail than I need to hit.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.050
Since he just talked about it.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.780
I'm just taking a
lot of the terms

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.530
he has introduced and
explained and talked

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.210
about all the estimations
and tasks and so forth,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.180
and stuffing them back
into our Scrum framework.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:13.940
So you can think about-- given
that data, about estimating,

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:15.349
what do you do with it?

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:16.140
How do you show it?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.130
How do you share with it?

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.005
How do you record it?

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.827
But first, let's have
a really quick review.

00:41:23.827 --> 00:41:25.660
Remember I said there
would be a quiz later?

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.572
Here's our quiz.

00:41:27.572 --> 00:41:29.780
I want to see how many of
you actually still remember

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.870
we talked about on men day.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.760
So can I get some volunteers
to give you some definitions

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.260
up here?

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.570
One per customer.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:42.562
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:41:42.562 --> 00:41:44.056
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:44.056 --> 00:41:47.210
In charge of the vision of the
products, and also in charge

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.534
of maintaining the backlogs
of the team's [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:49.534 --> 00:41:50.600
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.390
Specifically prioritizing
the backlog, but yeah.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:54.470
OK.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.070
Someone else?

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.216
This is going to be a
really long lecture.

00:42:01.216 --> 00:42:02.132
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:10.706 --> 00:42:12.560
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.370
Next?

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.881
Grab them while they're easy.

00:42:17.881 --> 00:42:20.117
AUDIENCE: The product
backlog is a list

00:42:20.117 --> 00:42:23.100
of features to be implemented
to have the whole product done.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.040
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.304
And I saw someone.

00:42:26.304 --> 00:42:27.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:31.184 --> 00:42:32.045
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.924
You're already a
repeat customer.

00:42:41.924 --> 00:42:44.870
AUDIENCE: The
sprint is the period

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.220
of working on one
installation of the product.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:53.850
It should be kept short,
so we can [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:57.442
And each sprint should
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:57.442 --> 00:42:59.882
that can be published,
or that's running,

00:42:59.882 --> 00:43:01.834
so that you can only
do incremental work.

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:03.750
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.770
Somebody else.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:05.540
Somebody else.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.450
We got two meanings left.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.210
Grab the meetings.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.234
Team members?

00:43:17.234 --> 00:43:19.150
Don't make me do the
whole lecture over again,

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.600
because I don't want
to give it, and I don't

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.683
think you want to hear it.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.500
AUDIENCE: The retrospective is
the meeting at the end where

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.830
you review your processes.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.000
AUDIENCE: Team member
is really easy.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.510
PROFESSOR: Nobody's
grabbed that.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.390
AUDIENCE: Team
member is everyone

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.350
on that's on your team.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.300
PROFESSOR: Well done!

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.411
Do I have anyone that
will take Scrum Master?

00:43:55.411 --> 00:43:56.660
You've already answered twice.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:58.515
Thank you for noble
participation.

00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:05.086
AUDIENCE: A Scrum
Master is in charge

00:44:05.086 --> 00:44:08.164
of just making sure
the Scrums go quickly,

00:44:08.164 --> 00:44:10.594
and everyone knows
what they need to do,

00:44:10.594 --> 00:44:13.010
but he doesn't actually
have to do anything.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.075
He's not actually in charge
of planning anything.

00:44:15.075 --> 00:44:17.533
He's just in charge of making
sure everything goes smoothly

00:44:17.533 --> 00:44:18.324
during [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:18.324 --> 00:44:19.090
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.460
Yep.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.560
Coach is a great
description for that.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.940
OK.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.220
Now I think we have not hit
the sprint review meeting,

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.830
but other than that, I
think were pretty good.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.110
So the sprint review
meeting is the meeting

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:34.580
that you're going to get
to do in class today.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.080
No it's not.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.080
Sprint planning meeting.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:36.870
Ah!

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:37.740
Sprint planning
meeting is the one

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.490
you're going to get
to do in class today,

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:42.147
where you go ahead, look
at your product backlog,

00:44:42.147 --> 00:44:44.480
decide what you can get done,
and make a sprint backlog.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:47.190
And then break that down
into sprint task list.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:50.940
And don't think anybody
gave sprint review.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.720
OK.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.380
And sprint review is just
at the end of your sprint,

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.410
when you were
evaluating your project

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:01.230
for how close it came to what
you had intended to make.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.990
And it is a chance to change
and update the product backlog

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.434
by the team, usually led
by the product owner,

00:45:07.434 --> 00:45:09.100
since they're the
person with the vision

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.174
and a lot of strong opinions, to
modify any changes to the plan

00:45:12.174 --> 00:45:13.840
that you guys have
realized now that you

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.905
see what you've actually made.

00:45:17.905 --> 00:45:20.640
I'll stop torturing you now.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.360
So backlogs, task
lists, and tasks.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:30.710
First step is creating
a sprint backlog.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.550
It's pretty basic.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.830
It's pretty simple.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.140
Usually a product
backlog ends up

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.870
having lots of
really big stories.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:37.910
Big fancy features.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.820
The things that you
want your game to

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.840
do when everything is in and
it's all working at the end.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.550
By nature, these are
usually big stories.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.450
We want to have physics so
that the game feels realistic.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.350
I want the player to
be able to develop

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.510
lots of different
powers through the game.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.030
I want to be a long
complicated story.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.880
I want there to be lots and lots
of characters to interact with.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.940
I want a fully immersive world.

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.430
Never ever put
that in a backlog.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.000
But I want a fully
immersive world.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.330
These are all somewhere
passed extra large, often.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.386
But in a product backlog,
it's OK to go that big.

00:46:10.386 --> 00:46:11.760
But when you're
actually thinking

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.320
about what you're going to
do this particular sprint,

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.070
and this particular
iteration, you

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.540
got to get a lot
smaller than that.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.130
For example, I want a fully
immersive world is not

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.660
getting done in one sprint.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:23.640
Even if it's the only
thing you're working on.

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:25.770
So clearly you're going
to have to break that down

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.070
into smaller stories.

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.670
And the place you do that is
usually your sprint planning

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:31.750
meetings.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.897
So as you break those really big
stories into smaller stories,

00:46:34.897 --> 00:46:36.980
you can leave some of them
on the product backlog,

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:37.820
because oh my gosh.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:39.950
We're not touching those yet.

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:43.570
And then you can decide which
of those pieces of the story

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.102
are complete enough
and small enough

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.810
that you can get them
done in the sprint.

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:48.830
Be it one week, or
two week, or a month.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.330
And again, the size of
stories you're grabbing

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.580
is really going to vary, based
on how long your sprint is.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.550
By definition, the sprint
you guys have coming up

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:59.290
is one week.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:01.630
Because your project
is due next Monday.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:05.510
So once you've got your
stories broken down

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.614
that you've pulled out, and
you've got your sprint backlog,

00:47:08.614 --> 00:47:10.530
then you can start taking
a look at the tasks.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.750
Except that's not
quite how it works.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.480
Because it's kind
of easy to grab

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.210
too many stories onto your
sprint backlog at your first

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.710
pass.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.293
And when you actually are going
through and estimating things,

00:47:20.293 --> 00:47:22.750
and you realize just how much
work each of those stories

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.987
take, you may find you have to
put some of those stories back.

00:47:25.987 --> 00:47:28.070
You may even realize that
some of the stories that

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.017
were at the bottom
of your priority list

00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:31.850
are actually more
important than you thought

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.390
because you've got other stories
higher up that depend on them.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.367
So while you're
doing your planning,

00:47:37.367 --> 00:47:39.200
and while you're making
your sprint backlog,

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:43.110
and making your task list,
all a little bit-- you're

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.550
going to go forward
two steps, back a step,

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:50.230
forward three steps as you
both reorder your backlogs,

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:53.360
put stories back, take
stories back off as you're

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.240
trying to figure out how you
get all those dependencies

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:58.465
and squished into
what is actually

00:47:58.465 --> 00:47:59.950
a really short amount of time.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.670
You guys don't even
have what a sprint

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.720
team thinks of as a full week.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.302
You do not have a 40 hour
work week ahead of you.

00:48:06.302 --> 00:48:10.690
You have, per person, probably
a 10 to 12 hour work week.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.580
Because that's about
the amount of time

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.690
the class expects
you to put into it.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.600
So small.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.310
Small stories.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:20.360
Small tasks.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:20.970
OK.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:23.420
I just went through
all of that, didn't I?

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.220
How do you break things down?

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.880
When you're breaking
down your stories,

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:31.350
think about what's the
most important part of what

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:32.455
your breaking down into?

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.070
Because your stories have
a because, or so I can,

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.750
you can start
thinking about what

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.600
is most important
part of that story.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.540
And which portions of those
stories you can just dump.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.050
You don't need a
full physics engine

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.756
to create realistic driving.

00:48:49.756 --> 00:48:51.630
Because, what the heck
does realistic driving

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.232
mean in this case any way?

00:48:53.232 --> 00:48:55.190
Does it mean that it
accelerates, and it really

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.200
feels like it's
accelerating properly?

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.580
Doesn't mean that when
you handle curves,

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.740
you can feel it
spinning out on you?

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.150
What does feel mean anyway?

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:06.140
Does it mean that
the computer is

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.050
playing really realistic
sound effects for me?

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.350
That I'm getting really cool
sparks off of the wheels.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:17.030
I'm getting this view
of the car spinning out.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.960
When you understand
what you actually want,

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.180
then you can create
smaller stories

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.330
that let you break it down
and sign up just for that.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.212
You can also take a look at what
the abilities of your team are.

00:49:28.212 --> 00:49:29.420
And what you can actually do.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:31.917
If you have somebody who's
really get at sound effects,

00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:33.500
maybe you really
want to try to create

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.044
a realistic aural environment.

00:49:36.044 --> 00:49:38.210
You're not going to worry
so much about the physics.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.626
You're not going to worry so
much about the sound effects.

00:49:40.626 --> 00:49:42.530
But boy, is it going
to sound sharp.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:43.220
That's OK.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.200
That's working within
your capabilities

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.750
and your limitations
to do your best

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:51.170
to fulfill your overall vision.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.060
Philip really already
covered this pretty well.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.830
I will zip right through it.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.220
Tasks.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.620
Think of them in terms of
going down to a half hour

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.795
is probably a waste
of your time if you're

00:50:03.795 --> 00:50:05.170
looking at a whole
bunch of tasks

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.461
that are a half hour long,
that's a really small amount

00:50:07.461 --> 00:50:08.770
of time.

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.647
On the other hand,
eight hours is probably

00:50:10.647 --> 00:50:12.230
the biggest you want
to look at, given

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.900
that that's most of a week.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.730
Ideally, you don't
have one task that

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.090
takes up your entire
week's worth of work.

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.750
If so, you're rolling some
really big dice there.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.460
Because you're assuming that
your estimate is pretty good.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.050
And especially the first
time you start estimating,

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.580
your estimate probably
isn't that good.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.090
It is more common for
people to overestimate by up

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.490
to twice as much.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.340
So, I can get this task
done in eight hours

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.390
often means I can get this
task done in 16 hours.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.600
Think about that as you
are tasking things out,

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.825
and as you are creating
your sprint task lists.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.340
So I think I've
mostly covered that.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.020
Finally, once you have this
big pile of tasks on an Excel

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.090
spreadsheet that no
one actually ever wants

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:04.610
to look at again,
because they're

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:09.220
kind of hard to pick out there,
what do you do with them?

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.690
I mentioned Scrum boards.

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:12.082
I mentioned them
being preferably

00:51:12.082 --> 00:51:13.290
there a physical Scrum board.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.100
That's really not
realistic for us.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.830
So you're going to
want-- and I really

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:20.930
strongly do recommend that
you use-- a visual Scrum board

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.370
solution.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.030
Two that I have used
on projects that

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.930
work well for
different situations

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:29.100
are Trello and Scrummy.com.

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.450
Don't feel like you have
to use either of these.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.450
If you find something better,
use it and tell me about it.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.790
Because I want to know.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.050
Especially if it's free.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.900
So let me show you
very quickly-- let's

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.400
see if I can pull them up.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:50.110
So here it is-- is that showing?

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.360
Here's scrummy.com
which I actually-- I

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.212
think it's kind of the easiest
and quickest one to use.

00:51:56.212 --> 00:51:58.670
This is always going to be more
work for your Scrum Master.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.590
So when you're
thinking about tasks,

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.930
set some time aside for your
Scrum Master, who's probably

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.070
going to create this board.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:07.570
It's going to be
your responsibility

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.520
to maintain it, and
move things over,

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.180
but somebody's going to
have to type tasks into it.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.297
And it would work
best if everyone

00:52:15.297 --> 00:52:17.130
could be relied upon
to type in their tasks,

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.770
but it rarely works
that way, especially

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:20.305
since you often have a
whole bundle of tasks

00:52:20.305 --> 00:52:22.310
that haven't been assigned,
at least at the beginning

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.435
of the sprint, because
people start picking them up

00:52:24.435 --> 00:52:28.550
as they discover that
they've gotten stuff done.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:33.790
So pretty much it works much
like a Scrum board ought to.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.790
So you can create
all your tasks.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.367
It divides things up
naturally by stories.

00:52:40.367 --> 00:52:42.450
Although if you'd like to
put it by user, you can.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.970
They're two standard ways
to organize a Scrum board.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:48.720
Either organizing all
your tasks by the story it

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.510
belongs to, or by the
user who's working on.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.640
Feel free to do it how
ever works well for you.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.769
Scrummy, because
it's free, and you

00:52:56.769 --> 00:52:58.560
don't want to pay for
the upgraded version,

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.518
won't let you change the
names of your columns.

00:53:00.518 --> 00:53:04.000
But it's pretty hard from
the end of the world.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.830
So if my stories demonstrate
so many of the [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:10.410
I have recorded the URL,
so I can get back here.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.260
That's done.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.274
I've made a new board.

00:53:12.274 --> 00:53:12.940
That's all done.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.660
And I confirmed the
board was there.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:17.240
I've assigned a
task to Philip, so

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.910
that there can be a task there.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.135
And it's a really pretty
quick and easy-- ah!

00:53:22.135 --> 00:53:24.681
No, don't delete it.

00:53:24.681 --> 00:53:26.930
It's really pretty quick and
easy to go ahead and edit

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.946
things.

00:53:28.946 --> 00:53:31.070
It changes color, so you
can have different colors.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.690
Easy to tell apart.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.639
And it's really just
sort of a click and grab.

00:53:35.639 --> 00:53:37.680
Click and drag, except
that I don't have a mouse.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.090
Sorry.

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.714
I don't have a track
counter, and so it

00:53:39.714 --> 00:53:43.369
takes these fancy two-fingered
maneuver to actually move it.

00:53:43.369 --> 00:53:44.910
So I'm going to fail
to move it over,

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.344
but they're pretty easy
just click and drag

00:53:47.344 --> 00:53:48.260
to the various things.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.682
To the various sides.

00:53:49.682 --> 00:53:54.100
So that's Scrummy, which has
less functionality than Trello,

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.810
but it's actually, in exchange
for that, it's quick and easy.

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:01.100
You type in a task, you
type in a name, you're done.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:05.920
Trello-- and I apologize
about the resolution here.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.170
Let's see if I can close this.

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:13.790
Trello let's you go ahead
and create as many columns

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:14.755
as you'd like.

00:54:14.755 --> 00:54:16.255
You can name them
whatever you want.

00:54:21.035 --> 00:54:23.109
You can put in all the
information you want.

00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:24.900
If you want to track
your estimations here,

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.400
if you want to have a checklist
of subtasks that are related

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.520
to it, if you want to put
on pretty little labels

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.430
so that every user
has a different color,

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.013
or every story has a different
color, as long as you only have

00:54:35.013 --> 00:54:41.660
five stories-- but
on the other hand,

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.610
you can also waste a lot of
time organizing your project

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.550
on Trello.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.380
And it will look really nice,
and it will have all the data

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:49.350
there, and you will have
sucked all those hours

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:51.974
that you could have been coding,
or drawing, or actually making

00:54:51.974 --> 00:54:52.780
a game.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.660
So Trello can be
really nice to use,

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.380
but don't let it steal
your project from you,

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.360
if you choose to use it.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.400
I was told that there's a cool
Scrum-free download extension.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.280
Runs in the Chrome browser
that makes it work better

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.042
for Scrum because
it adjusts lists,

00:55:11.042 --> 00:55:12.750
and it does some
previous set up for you.

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.390
I haven't tested that, so
I don't know how it works.

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:17.150
If you'd like to try it out, do.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.690
But don't do it this project,
because you don't have time

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.800
to waste mixing it
around and fixing that.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.570
Do that on outside
time, if you really

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.115
want to is my advice to you.

00:55:27.115 --> 00:55:28.990
I don't want you to
spend a whole lot of time

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:30.529
getting the perfect
system together.

00:55:30.529 --> 00:55:33.070
I want you to get a system that
works well enough and use it.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.400
Yay.

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.680
Back to the slideshow.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.850
So that is Scrum boards.

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:45.230
Ah.

00:55:47.964 --> 00:55:49.130
Don't use PowerPoint either.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:52.100
Apparently it has
to be difficult.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.700
So the classic line
up on a Scrum board

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:58.140
is you've got all the
tasks in your to-do pile.

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.899
You've got the in-progress.

00:55:59.899 --> 00:56:02.190
And anything in-progress
should be assigned to someone,

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:03.320
should have a name
attached to it.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.700
It can't be in-progress if
someone isn't working on it.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.780
And it should have a time
estimate attached to it.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.940
Ideally, the time remaining.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.410
Although, it's good to
keep track of how much time

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.720
has actually gone by on it.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.650
The task cards are
really good places

00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:21.656
to keep track of your
estimates as they change.

00:56:21.656 --> 00:56:23.280
Then it's all in
together in one place.

00:56:26.552 --> 00:56:28.760
Once you get finished, it
should not go over to done.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.716
It's going to testing.

00:56:29.716 --> 00:56:31.090
Someone who is
not the person who

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.454
did it should test it, and
then move it over to done.

00:56:34.454 --> 00:56:36.120
That way you've got
a second set of eyes

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:38.703
on every piece of code and every
feature, just confirming it's

00:56:38.703 --> 00:56:40.590
working.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.040
Many Scrum boards also
have another column

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:45.280
called Blocked or On Fire.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.280
Which is to say this
is a task that someone

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:49.780
can't get done until someone
else gets something out

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.150
of my way.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:52.850
It's nice to have.

00:56:52.850 --> 00:56:55.020
It's not required.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.920
And if you're working on a board
that you're having a hard time

00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:02.370
fitting everything
into one screen,

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:04.900
Trello has always a problem
for that with me, it's

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.290
OK to leave it off.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:09.440
But it can be really
helpful to have.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.950
That sort of is a Scrum board.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.580
And I do really recommend them.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.540
They are useful.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.880
I know it feels like a
lot of extra time often,

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.320
when you're setting them up.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.405
But if your team is
actually looking in there

00:57:20.405 --> 00:57:22.520
and checking it every
day and updating,

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.700
it's a really good
way for the team

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.730
to know where it's at
without having to spend

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:28.080
a lot of time talking about it.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.822
Because all the really basic
stuff is there to be seen,

00:57:31.822 --> 00:57:33.280
which means you
could freeze you up

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.740
to talk about any real
problems that are coming up.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.450
OK.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:41.820
So that said, it's your turn.

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.190
You've got a week
left on your project,

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:50.360
so let's try creating a
sprint backlog and a task list

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.070
from that backlog
for what you're

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:56.441
going to get done for Monday
when you have your turn in.

00:57:56.441 --> 00:57:58.190
I'm going to give you--
like all meetings,

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.600
they should be time boxed.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.160
So I was going to give
you half an hour to do it.

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.600
I will check in at half
an hour, and if people

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.770
are screaming oh no,
we're nowhere near done,

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:10.862
I will give you another
10 minutes or 15 minutes.

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.320
Not actually a
whole lot more time,

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.950
but I'll give you
a little more time.

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.754
This is probably
doable in half an hour

00:58:16.754 --> 00:58:18.670
if you guys have been
working on your project,

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:20.630
and you've got your product
backlogs in good shape.

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.296
But it's the first
time you're doing it,

00:58:22.296 --> 00:58:24.020
so it's always-- it's
hard to know what

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.320
the right amount of time is.

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.930
After that, I will give
you five or 10 minutes--

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:33.650
probably call it five minutes
to talk about the process,

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:36.290
and have someone come up and
give a very short presentation

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.110
of what the process was like.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.870
What worked, what didn't,
whether you liked it or not.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.670
It's OK to come up
here and say bleh.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:45.426
I don't feel like
this helped us at all.

00:58:45.426 --> 00:58:47.050
Just come up and tell
us what happened,

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:48.960
and how it works for your team.

00:58:53.118 --> 00:58:55.603
[CHATTER]

00:59:13.495 --> 00:59:14.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.600
So [INAUDIBLE] meaning
we used Scrummy

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.470
to try to organize our product
backlog into our sprint task

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.091
list.

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.590
We found Scrummy to be a little
annoying, because it doesn't

00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:28.810
automatically update instantly,
you have to refresh the page.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:30.830
And whatever happens
last, we find,

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.370
is what it shows
as what's edited.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:39.040
So it shouldn't break, but
it's not the most useful thing.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.360
I think more useful would
be to Google use the Google

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:45.470
Doc of the product backlog.

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:48.030
Section out the stuff that
you do in that sprint,

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:49.689
and then just update it there.

00:59:49.689 --> 00:59:51.980
We had it all color coded,
and so it looks really nice.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:58.500
And that's much easier to look
at and do than importing that

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.520
into some other program,
and then doing everything

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.710
there and then going back.

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.210
It just seems better
to use Google.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:04.957
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:00:04.957 --> 01:00:06.418
Thank you.

01:00:06.418 --> 01:00:09.814
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:10.314
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:17.132 --> 01:00:21.380
AUDIENCE: OK, so we used
Trello for our Scrum planning.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.080
And we liked Trello
because you can just

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.745
create cards that
have lists of tasks

01:00:26.745 --> 01:00:29.000
and easily move them around
between different columns.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.524
So when someone takes on a task
they can move it to in-progress

01:00:32.524 --> 01:00:33.690
and assign their name to it.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.450
And it' really easy
to look at and see

01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:37.950
what's going on at a glance.

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.280
Trello does have a lot of
features like checklists

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.300
that you might not want to use
a lot of, especially if you

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.749
have really complex tasks.

01:00:44.749 --> 01:00:47.040
You don't want to put all of
those inside the checklist

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.206
because that gets confusing.

01:00:48.206 --> 01:00:50.520
The thing that we had
the most problems with

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.180
was doing time
estimates for the tasks,

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.950
because no one in our group
has used Phaser before.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:58.050
And so we have a very kind
of shaky grasp on how long

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.860
things are going to take, so
our guesses were mostly random

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:02.050
at this point in time.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.316
But we will update that as
we get more experienced.

01:01:05.316 --> 01:01:07.190
One thing that we did
find was really helpful

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.767
was when we were
drawing up goals,

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.600
we broke down all the
features that the game

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.230
needed into as fine
detail as we could

01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.791
because we know what
results we need to have

01:01:16.791 --> 01:01:17.790
to get the game to work.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:19.248
But we don't know
Phaser yet, so we

01:01:19.248 --> 01:01:22.600
don't know exactly what the
processes are going entail yet.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.277
But having like
the list of things

01:01:25.277 --> 01:01:26.860
that need to go into
the game gives us

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.730
some guidance on what we
should be developing towards.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.617
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:01:31.617 --> 01:01:34.718
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:34.718 --> 01:01:35.593
Sparkling Redemption.

01:01:43.559 --> 01:01:44.850
AUDIENCE: Sparkling Redemption.

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:46.570
We basically just
opened up Google Docs

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:48.930
and made a whole bunch
of Excel spreadsheets.

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:51.510
I think we're kind of
trying to use Scrum Do

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:53.270
and see how that
works, but we figured

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:55.420
it'd be best to just
kind of finish the thing

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.000
first, and then
take a look at that.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.740
So no thoughts there yet.

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.500
I guess we basically
just took a look

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.590
at what we wanted to
get done by Wednesday,

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.260
and what we wanted to get
done by the end of the week,

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.330
and then broke that
down into the tasks,

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:12.670
and then worked with that.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:17.200
I guess estimation
was-- it wasn't too bad.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.444
Because some of us have
worked with Phaser before,

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:20.860
but there was also
a lot of things

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.345
where we realized oh, well,
assuming x is finished first,

01:02:23.345 --> 01:02:24.970
then y would be really
straightforward.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:27.560
But do we count x's
time inside of y?

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.520
Well maybe, but
maybe not really.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.293
So that was as complicated
as it got, I think.

01:02:33.293 --> 01:02:34.766
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:02:34.766 --> 01:02:37.703
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:37.703 --> 01:02:38.203
Blundermans.

01:02:45.568 --> 01:02:47.780
AUDIENCE: So for
us, we started out

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.720
with a fairly detailed plan.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.210
And we used Asana, which
is multi-player to-do list.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.530
So, similar to Scrum.

01:02:56.530 --> 01:03:00.080
But ultimately, our
entire team more or less

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.230
got sick over the weekend,
and we didn't actually

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.510
get much work done.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:05.790
So we can't speak
to exactly how good

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.991
are estimates would have been,
or how useful our plans would

01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:09.490
be.

01:03:09.490 --> 01:03:12.270
So all the planning in
the world doesn't help

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.494
if your entire team is in bed.

01:03:14.494 --> 01:03:15.490
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.984
Thank you.

01:03:16.984 --> 01:03:19.970
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:21.466
Blind Aliens.

01:03:27.442 --> 01:03:30.640
AUDIENCE: So our team used
primarily Google Docs.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.150
What we did was we had
our product backlog.

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.300
And we were a little confused
about the product backlog.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.310
So we made it way too detailed.

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.560
But that really
helped with this.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.500
So we ended up copying and
pasting our product backlog

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.100
into our sprint task
list, deleting everything

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.230
we'd already finished.

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:50.490
And then adding based
on what we had done.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.460
And we found that because
we were further along

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:55.080
in our project, it was
really easy to tell

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.820
what needed more
work, and to get

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.250
the tasks more
detailed and better

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:02.238
estimates, just because we
had done a lot of already.

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:13.439
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:13.439 --> 01:04:16.330
AUDIENCE: So we started out
planning on using Trello,

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.320
but did the product
backlog in Google Docs.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.720
And since it's sort of this
information repeated twice,

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.750
we just stopped using
Trello, and ended up

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.151
using Google Docs anyway.

01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:27.400
And that sort of helped us
out now, because all we did

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:30.007
was sort the things in
Google Docs by priority.

01:04:30.007 --> 01:04:32.590
So we looked at the things that
were highest priority so we're

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:34.940
doing this week, and then
we just sort of thought

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.630
about each one.

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:36.590
How can we break this down?

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:37.800
What are the specific tasks?

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.680
You started working on this.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.670
What's left to do here?

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:43.549
And then we put that into
the sprint task list.

01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:45.016
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:04:45.016 --> 01:04:46.483
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:57.250
AUDIENCE: So we've been using
Google Docs from the beginning.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.050
We decided to not
use any other site,

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:01.300
because we had already started
working on Google Docs.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.470
And it's worked out
pretty well for us.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:06.100
We were able to take
our product backlog

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.500
and take the highest priority
that hadn't been completed yet,

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.030
and just split them up
into a finer detail task

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.850
that we can use for
the sprint task list.

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:17.410
And I think that that
worked fine for us.

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:21.199
It helped us really scope out
how much time we had-- helped

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:22.740
us reevaluate how
much time we needed

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:26.310
to complete the task
that we had to complete.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.229
That is going to
help us for planning

01:05:29.229 --> 01:05:30.270
for the rest of the week.

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:32.798
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:34.774
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.812
All right, so I have in fact, as
we say, iterate on everything.

01:05:39.812 --> 01:05:41.270
I've iterated on
this presentation.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.490
And been changing
the order of it.

01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.280
So it may be I get
confused a couple of times.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:44.779
I hope not.

01:05:44.779 --> 01:05:46.730
We'll see.

01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:52.220
We're going to talk a little bit
about high level and low level

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:52.840
here.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.381
But as we said, in
this class we want

01:05:54.381 --> 01:05:56.600
to iterate on as to the
every process you might use.

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.040
This is how you
control your team.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.260
This is how your game works.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.070
Everything.

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:02.420
And this is actually
not a bad philosophy

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.260
to do everything in
your life, that you

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.550
might want to consider
trying stuff, fixing

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.660
what doesn't work, embracing
what does work, and moving on.

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:13.230
But this also applies to
how you write your code.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:16.130
And I can talk about-- on a
high level and a low level.

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:18.220
The where you put
your parentheses,

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.300
and exactly what kinds of
variables you use is a process.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.430
And you make decisions on
that basis every moment

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:25.750
that you're coding.

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.430
And it's a really good idea
to think about what you did

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.440
and how well it worked
for you, or someone else.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:33.450
And this is the kind
of thing that maybe

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:34.950
in your early
programming career you

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.510
don't want to think
about too much,

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:37.860
because just getting
the stupid thing to work

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.319
in the first place
is kind of hard.

01:06:39.319 --> 01:06:41.901
But I'm going to try to convince
you that it's worth your time

01:06:41.901 --> 01:06:43.420
to get these habits
going, so it's

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.420
easier for you in the
future to debug your code,

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.519
or someone else's code.

01:06:48.519 --> 01:06:51.060
So I want to talk a little bit,
very briefly, about something

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.810
I mentioned in the
review on the lecture

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.620
on game engines, which is
that all software sucks.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:00.740
And it sucks in different
ways and all that, right?

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:05.040
Well, the problem with this
is is that yours does too.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.380
Your software is going
to have bugs in it.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.530
And your job is to
try to make that

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:11.792
happen as little as possible.

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:14.000
You want your software to
suck as little as possible.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.474
Now we also talked
about one reason

01:07:19.474 --> 01:07:21.140
we use a game engine
is just so that you

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.870
write less code overall.

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:24.660
You spend less time doing that.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.243
That's because everything that
you do when you're running code

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:28.616
is slow.

01:07:28.616 --> 01:07:33.650
And in particular,
debugging is the slow part.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.229
It's not too hard
to write new code,

01:07:35.229 --> 01:07:37.270
but it's actually pretty
hard to go into old code

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:38.479
and fix what happens.

01:07:38.479 --> 01:07:40.770
At it varies, depending on
the complexity of your task,

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:44.286
but generally speaking,
when you've written a bug,

01:07:44.286 --> 01:07:45.660
later, you have
to spend the time

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.810
to figure out that there was a
bug, figure out where it was,

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:49.934
and then you actually have
to fix the stupid thing.

01:07:49.934 --> 01:07:52.470
And that is actually where most
of your time is going to go,

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.928
when you're trying
to develop code.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.340
So again, figure
out the problem,

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.390
and then change the
code to fix your bugs.

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:04.120
But I acclaim that most of the
time, figuring out the problem

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.435
is more of your time.

01:08:05.435 --> 01:08:07.560
Now this isn't true for
the small bugs, when you're

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.340
typing something
at your computer,

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:10.340
and it doesn't work when
you compile it or whatever,

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:10.890
and it runs.

01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:12.310
You go back and
fix it right away.

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:14.090
Yeah, that part of
debugging is not so much

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:14.750
figuring out the problem.

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:15.834
Because you just wrote it.

01:08:15.834 --> 01:08:16.833
It's fresh in your mind.

01:08:16.833 --> 01:08:18.160
You know what's going on there.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.260
But if it's been a couple of
days or a couple of weeks,

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.710
then actually the hard
part and the slow part,

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:25.970
is figuring out what went wrong.

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:31.066
And so one of the
things that you

01:08:31.066 --> 01:08:33.149
need to think about when
you're writing your code,

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.740
is you want to make it
as simple as possible

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.281
so that you're less likely to
write a bug in the first place.

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:40.340
Or once you've written
a bug, it sticks out.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.514
It's easier to see.

01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:44.180
And the important
thing to remember here

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.763
is that all this
code you have written

01:08:45.763 --> 01:08:47.800
is not as easy to read
as you think it is.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:55.240
And the right way to do this is
to make it as easy as possible.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.802
And the way I like to think
about it, at least today,

01:08:57.802 --> 01:09:00.010
is to make it require as
little knowledge as possible

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.342
to figure out what's
going on in your code.

01:09:02.342 --> 01:09:04.300
If you use some really
fancy language features,

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.790
that's really cool, and
it feel like you're really

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:06.779
smart when you're doing it.

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:08.695
But a week later you
back to look at that code

01:09:08.695 --> 01:09:11.270
to try to figure out, I don't
even know what I did there.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:14.710
And heaven help you if someone
else tries to read your code.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:18.000
So ideally, you don't want to
go too obscure into the computer

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.350
language fancy features.

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:22.054
You don't want to go too much
into your subject matter.

01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:23.514
But there are
exceptions to this.

01:09:23.514 --> 01:09:25.430
If for example, you work
on a very specialized

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.950
piece of software
where everyone has

01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:31.380
to have an arrow engineering
astro degree to actually work

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.227
on the project, you can assume
some level of competency there.

01:09:34.227 --> 01:09:36.060
But generally speaking,
in game development,

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.894
and most application
development,

01:09:37.894 --> 01:09:40.060
you want to assume was
little knowledge as possible,

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.609
so that when you want
to debug your code,

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:43.692
you can look at the little
part of the code you're

01:09:43.692 --> 01:09:47.340
at right now, and see if you
can fit what's going on there.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.450
If possible, you want to assume
no knowledge on the part of who

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:52.652
was reading your code.

01:09:52.652 --> 01:09:54.860
And I'm going to talk a
little bit about why that is.

01:09:56.865 --> 01:09:59.240
This is a useful thing to
think about for user interfaces

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.800
or really any problem solving.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.564
Humans can't hold that much
in their brains at once.

01:10:03.564 --> 01:10:04.980
And if you're
trying to write code

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:07.950
that requires you to think about
10 different things at once,

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:10.980
you're in trouble, because
humans really don't do that.

01:10:13.414 --> 01:10:15.080
Now generally we get
around this problem

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.320
with what's called chunking.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.640
So when you started with math,
you thought about the number

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.130
five wasn't even
a numeral to you.

01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:25.510
It was five objects.

01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:27.800
But you couldn't really
wrap your brain around 12,

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.509
because you can't
look at 12 objects

01:10:29.509 --> 01:10:31.300
and think oh, I understand
what that means.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.425
But as soon as you practice
with your numbers more,

01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:36.432
you begin to think of
number 12 as a unit.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.890
It's not 12 things,
it's one thing.

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:40.247
It's the concept of 12, and
that's really useful to you.

01:10:40.247 --> 01:10:42.080
And then you started
working through algebra

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:42.996
and you got variables.

01:10:42.996 --> 01:10:45.850
And now you're using calculus,
and all the other cool things.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:47.490
You talk about vectors in math.

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.852
A vector represents three
numbers, or a direction

01:10:49.852 --> 01:10:51.310
or position in
space, but you don't

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:52.560
think about all three numbers.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.266
And you certainly
don't think that 35

01:10:54.266 --> 01:10:55.640
is one of those
numbers, and that

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.420
means that there are 35 things.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.140
Your brain isn't
wasting time on that.

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.179
Instead your brain is
thinking, it's a vector,

01:11:01.179 --> 01:11:01.970
it's a point space.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:03.134
That's all I need to know.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:05.050
So your brain is ignoring
a lot of information

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:08.209
by clumping a bunch of
information into one spot.

01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:10.250
I often use phone numbers
as an example for this.

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.120
And it's an
increasingly poor thing

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.930
to use, because
I bet most of you

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:16.880
don't memorize phone numbers,
because why would you?

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.880
But when they started
[INAUDIBLE] phone numbers,

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.546
there are three parts
to a phone number.

01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:25.830
First part is an area code, the
second part is a sub area code.

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:27.610
The third part is
the four digits

01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.950
that are more unique, right.

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:34.549
It's really hard to
remember those 10 numbers.

01:11:34.549 --> 01:11:36.340
But actually, once you
learn the area code,

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:37.631
the area code is three numbers.

01:11:37.631 --> 01:11:39.890
You think of it as one number.

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:42.740
Boston is mostly 617.

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:44.740
The second set of numbers
is also three numbers.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.050
You clump that as well.

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:48.035
And the last four numbers, yeah,
you have to memorize those.

01:11:48.035 --> 01:11:49.993
But basically instead of
remembering 10 things,

01:11:49.993 --> 01:11:52.490
you have to remember six things.

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:54.490
The four numbers and
then the two prefixes.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.290
And another problem with coding
is that as you keep doing it,

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:03.410
you're making decisions
constantly in your coding.

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:04.390
What's the right way to do this?

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:05.530
What's the right variable
you're going to use?

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:06.714
Et cetera, et cetera.

01:12:06.714 --> 01:12:08.130
And as you do this,
you get tired.

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.129
Humans only have so much
decision making in them

01:12:10.129 --> 01:12:11.974
before they need a break.

01:12:11.974 --> 01:12:13.390
So a couple of
things we can do is

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:14.870
we want to reduce
the amount of things

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.830
you have to remember while
you're looking at your code,

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:18.530
and we want to reduce
the number of decisions

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:19.870
you're going to have to make.

01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:22.074
And to some extent, although
I'm not really clear

01:12:22.074 --> 01:12:23.490
on a psychological
basis for this,

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:26.260
I'm going to make a crazy
claim that figuring something

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:28.761
out and deciding what this
thing must mean is a decision.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.010
So even if you're just trying
to figure out something,

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:32.770
that also is a
burden on your brain.

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.520
And what you want to
do is keep your brain

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.890
alert and hopping as much as you
can, for as long as possible.

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:43.550
And to do that again, we want to
simplify your code if you can.

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:47.450
So to go back here, simplicity--
when I say simplicity,

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.435
I mean you want fewer
things to think about.

01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:51.060
Should be easy to
read the code, so you

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.430
don't have to memorize
what the code is doing.

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.888
You can just quickly
glance and get

01:12:53.888 --> 01:12:55.810
a reminder of what it's doing.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.501
You have fewer bugs
because there's

01:12:57.501 --> 01:12:58.500
just fewer moving parts.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.947
Fewer things to go wrong.

01:13:00.947 --> 01:13:03.030
I'm going to say this
hopefully a couple of times,

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:06.835
but a short variable name is
not simpler, it's just shorter.

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:12.840
If you start thinking about
what you spend time doing when

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:15.380
you're writing code, and
trying to get something done,

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.901
what takes the most time?

01:13:17.901 --> 01:13:20.400
I'm willing to bet it's probably
going to be debugging part,

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.020
but maybe you think
it's going to be getting

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.150
the stupid thing to compile in
the first place or whatever,

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.500
but I'm willing to
bet almost none of you

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.830
think that your typing speed
is the thing slowing down

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.067
your coding.

01:13:29.067 --> 01:13:30.900
If only I could type
80 characters a minute,

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.030
I could double my coding speed.

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:35.200
It doesn't work that way.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.664
You do a lot of thinking, and
just a little bit of typing.

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:39.580
So if your variable name
is 12 characters long

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.440
instead of four characters
long, that is not cost you time.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.550
It just costing you
eight keystrokes.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:47.220
And in a modern
development environment,

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.010
you've got auto complete.

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:49.468
You type the first
four characters,

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:51.520
you hit control space,
and you get all 12, hey.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.853
You can't even claim that
you've saved eight characters,

01:13:53.853 --> 01:13:55.680
you've only saved six.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.060
So anyway, I'm going to
talk about that a lot,

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.320
because I believe that
the longer variable

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:06.500
names are really useful cues to
remind you what you're doing.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.630
And one of my favorite
things to talk about

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:11.500
is write once, read never code.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.020
Who here has used Perl?

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.130
Anyone?

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:17.130
Have you tried to read
other people's Perl code?

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.400
Yeah.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.770
Why would you try?

01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:26.336
Have you tried reading
your own Perl code?

01:14:26.336 --> 01:14:26.835
He goes, no.

01:14:29.339 --> 01:14:29.880
That's right.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880
You just write it again.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.560
Absolutely.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.185
So, Perl if you're
not familiar with it

01:14:33.185 --> 01:14:36.120
is this cool scripting language
that's not used as much now,

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:39.090
but it was once the
open source darling.

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:42.650
PHIP is kind of modern
equivalent of, my god,

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:45.177
don't try to read that code.

01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:47.510
Perl had the nice feature
where pretty much every symbol

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:49.694
on your keyboard has a meaning.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:51.360
And if you want to
do something, there's

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.984
probably three
different ways to do it,

01:14:52.984 --> 01:14:55.677
with three different obscure
characters on your keyboard.

01:14:55.677 --> 01:14:58.010
Worse, each of those characters
has a different meaning,

01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:00.480
depending on what
you're using it on.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:04.630
But this is an example
of APL code, which

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.800
a stands for A
Programming Language

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.240
developed in the late
'60s, early '70s.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.580
And it's really painful
because in APL not only

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.110
does every character
on the keyboard

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.200
have meaning, they've
minted special keyboards

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.370
with an extra three
characters per key,

01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:22.570
so that you could
have more characters.

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:25.807
And this is awesome if you think
of writing code as if piece

01:15:25.807 --> 01:15:27.807
of paper with your pencil
and you're doing math,

01:15:27.807 --> 01:15:30.160
and you're writing fancy
integral symbols, and this

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.930
and that, sure.

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.472
It's handy in math to chunk
those concepts this way.

01:15:34.472 --> 01:15:35.930
But for coding,
generally speaking,

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:37.800
we're stuck on our
alphanumeric keyboard

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.990
with a couple of symbols.

01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:42.050
And I advise you to use as few
of those symbols as possible.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:46.100
Try to stick with your
language if you can.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.550
All right.

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:51.541
Who here thinks that you write
enough comments in your code?

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:52.040
Wow!

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:52.770
Some of you do.

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:56.570
But almost none of you-- maybe
a quarter of you are like, yeah,

01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:57.707
I'm proud of my comments.

01:15:57.707 --> 01:15:59.290
It's cool to be proud
of your comments

01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:00.248
if you're writing them.

01:16:00.248 --> 01:16:04.090
And if you're not writing them,
don't be so proud of them.

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:06.750
But sometimes I see comments
that are just duplicating

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:07.890
what the code is saying.

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.000
If your if statement says,
if x is less than 5--

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.230
don't put a comment up there
that says if x is less than 5

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:12.771
do something.

01:16:12.771 --> 01:16:13.920
That's a waste of time.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.510
I can see that in your code.

01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:18.120
But I want to know why you
care if x is less than 5.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:23.220
That's the kind of comment I
would like to see in your code.

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:24.940
And we'll get to this
a little bit later,

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:26.960
but I also talk about longer
variable names, longer function

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.580
names.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.130
Those are useful ways to
dodge writing comments

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.540
if they are correct.

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.500
But really quite
frankly, if you're

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.140
trying to figure
out gosh, I don't

01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:39.355
know if I should comment
this or not, write one.

01:16:39.355 --> 01:16:40.480
It's not going to hurt you.

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:47.790
So here's an example.

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:51.700
These comments don't mimic
the code, but what they do do

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:56.172
is they tell the story of what
the code is actually doing.

01:16:56.172 --> 01:16:57.630
Random aside, font
is actually very

01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.210
important with your editor.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.089
Make sure you use a fixed
width font because pretty much

01:17:02.089 --> 01:17:02.880
all programmers do.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.850
And sometimes you use spacing to
have everything line up nicely,

01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:07.560
and you want to have that
be crystal clear to anyone

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.440
else using your code.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.680
But there's another way to this.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.780
So this is code.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.975
You can figure it out.

01:17:15.975 --> 01:17:17.100
Go ahead and figure it out.

01:17:22.530 --> 01:17:24.250
There's no rocket
science going on here.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.934
We're using the
Pythagorean Theorem

01:17:25.934 --> 01:17:28.350
to calculate a distance, and
make sure that if it's small,

01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:30.040
we return 50.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.490
There's nothing hard here.

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.490
A programmer can
figure this out,

01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:35.920
but the programmer shouldn't
have to figure this out.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.250
And that's my argument.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:39.601
If you takes you-- I don't
know, maybe you're great

01:17:39.601 --> 01:17:41.600
and it takes you two
seconds to figure that out.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.950
Maybe it takes you 30
seconds to figure that out.

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.200
It doesn't really matter.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.200
It should take you less
than that if the code

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.324
has been written correctly.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:53.200
So for example, I'm just looking
at the 900 to 30 times 30.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:53.700
Because why?

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:54.784
The compiler doesn't care.

01:17:54.784 --> 01:17:56.158
It's a little bit
easier to read.

01:17:56.158 --> 01:17:58.505
You can say if the distance
is less than 30, as opposed

01:17:58.505 --> 01:18:00.380
to, if the distance
squared is less than 900.

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:01.796
AUDIENCE: And it's also the bug.

01:18:01.796 --> 01:18:03.037
This also has a bug.

01:18:03.037 --> 01:18:04.370
PROFESSOR: This does have a bug.

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:06.100
Good catch.

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:07.200
There's a bug here.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.520
This code doesn't work.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.290
Because we're saying y0 minus
1 instead of y0 minus y1.

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.730
So there's a better
way of doing that.

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.920
This is even easier to read.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.897
We are using a vector instead.

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:22.730
The vector class has
some internal knowledge

01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:24.230
of what it needs
to attract vectors,

01:18:24.230 --> 01:18:25.750
and what the length
of a vector is.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:32.350
Not only is this less bug prone,
but it's just easier to read.

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:35.906
And that bug that you
caught there can't happen.

01:18:35.906 --> 01:18:37.530
Now this code is a
little bit cheating,

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:38.810
because I used v for the name.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:43.220
So you can guess that they're
vectors, but that's fine.

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.251
Here's comments.

01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:45.250
Basically the same code.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:47.665
I'm saying, hey,
here's some context.

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:53.230
This is a lot more code.

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:55.240
In some ways it's harder read.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.440
In some ways it's
easier to read.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.110
That's one of the
things that you're

01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:59.901
going to have to figure
out for yourselves.

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.240
What coding styles
make sense for you?

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.900
Obviously, simpler is
a subjective question.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:07.470
But I kind of like
the style of code

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:09.220
because what it does
is it means that even

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.110
if you don't comment your code,
your code still is commented.

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.397
Because you can read this
and know what's going on.

01:19:14.397 --> 01:19:15.980
More importantly--
and this is the one

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.940
I've change since the last
year I gave this presentation.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.410
I thought that the
comments saying

01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:23.010
why, and then the code that did
it was probably the better way

01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:23.380
to go.

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:25.380
But a friend of mine
pretty quickly convinced me

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.480
that actually as codes get
maintained for a year or so,

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:30.990
you might change the code and
forget to change the comment.

01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:34.685
And this actually happens a
lot in real software projects.

01:19:34.685 --> 01:19:36.310
With the kind of
commenting or the kind

01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.050
of self documenting code
that I'm using here,

01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:40.270
that can't happen.

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:43.020
If you change the code,
you change the comment.

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:43.520
It's innate.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.270
They're intrinsincally
linked because they

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:46.100
are the same thing.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.253
If you can do this, it
actually helps a lot.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.672
So I'm going to go through
a variety of tips and tricks

01:19:56.672 --> 01:19:58.046
and things that
might make things

01:19:58.046 --> 01:19:59.550
a little bit easier to read.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:01.010
But before I do
that I want to talk

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:06.334
to you a little bit about to why
and who it is you're helping.

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:08.500
So a while back, I was
complaining to my grandmother

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.160
that wow, you know,
last year I made

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.220
a bunch of stupid decisions.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.340
I didn't do this right,
I didn't do that right.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.760
I'm so much smarter now this
year than I was last year.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.620
It's amazing.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.040
My grandma said, yeah,
I feel that way too.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.640
All the time.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.860
She was 84.

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:30.450
And I thought oh no, when I'm 83
I'm still going to be a moron.

01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:32.370
So one of the people
that you're writing

01:20:32.370 --> 01:20:34.826
code for-- one of the people
who will be reading your code

01:20:34.826 --> 01:20:36.200
is not other people
on your team,

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.180
although they're very
important, but it's you.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.620
You will read your code later.

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.260
Have any of you
looked back at code

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:44.452
you wrote six months ago yet?

01:20:44.452 --> 01:20:46.660
You're early in your career,
so not many of you have.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.300
But I'm willing to
bet when you look back

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.280
at the code you wrote six months
ago you think yourself a couple

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:50.780
things.

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:54.800
One, wow, I was an idiot.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.020
And two, you're going
to think to yourself,

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.440
I could write this better now.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.290
And three, you're
probably also thinking

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.360
even if the code works,
the algorithm is solid,

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.922
this is decent, it
could be more readable.

01:21:05.922 --> 01:21:07.380
Maybe you're not
thinking that yet.

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:11.240
I want you to start
thinking that because you're

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.100
going to forget the
code that you write.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:14.808
And again, when you're
just starting out,

01:21:14.808 --> 01:21:16.310
that seems impossible.

01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:18.372
That you can't forget
code that you just wrote.

01:21:18.372 --> 01:21:20.830
But I guarantee you after you've
been writing code for five

01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:22.327
years or more, a
lot, you're going

01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:24.410
to discover that you don't
remember what you wrote

01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:27.329
yesterday, or last
hour, as well as

01:21:27.329 --> 01:21:29.620
now when you're just learning
and getting deep into it,

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:31.716
you remember a lot more
than you're going to.

01:21:31.716 --> 01:21:33.090
But keep in mind
that experience.

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:34.080
And you go back to
your code and you

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.265
don't remember what
you wrote, that's

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:37.120
the experience your
teammates have every time

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:37.920
they look at your code.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.795
They didn't write it.

01:21:38.795 --> 01:21:40.670
They cannot remember it.

01:21:40.670 --> 01:21:44.220
Your code is a communication
opportunity to talk your team.

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.840
To let them know what it
is that your code does.

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.160
So one way to make code more
readable, shorter functions.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.010
You hear this
sometimes, all of us

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:57.344
are eventually write
that 500-line procedure

01:21:57.344 --> 01:21:59.260
that does this, then
that, then the next thing

01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:00.070
to the next thing.

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.111
We all do it, because it's
the easy way to do it.

01:22:02.111 --> 01:22:04.745
You think, I'm going to do this
thing, so I do step 1, step 2,

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.840
and you march on through.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.112
It's reasonable.

01:22:08.112 --> 01:22:10.570
It's a way to get things done,
especially when your work is

01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:11.357
in progress.

01:22:11.357 --> 01:22:13.440
But if you ever want to
go back and fix that code,

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.398
and now you have to figure
out what pretty much

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:16.690
all 500 lines are doing.

01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:18.785
And that's kind of dangerous.

01:22:18.785 --> 01:22:20.410
The easiest thing I
can recommend there

01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:24.010
is really if it is a step 1,
step 2, step 3 kind of thing,

01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:26.020
why not divide steps
and sub functions?

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.049
The subfunction may only get
called once, but that's OK.

01:22:29.049 --> 01:22:30.590
The reason this
helps you is twofold.

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:31.860
One, it gives you a nice name.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.730
For this section of
the code is where

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:37.440
I am going to tell all the
planets to do build spaceships

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.654
this turn.

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:39.820
I make that a function call.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.360
I don't have to worry about
what's inside that function

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.040
if I'm trying to
debug a war mechanic.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.275
Because probably, the
part where all planets

01:22:48.275 --> 01:22:51.820
are building spaceships isn't
relevant to the gigantic space

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.790
battle somewhere else.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:55.950
But 2, when you
subfunction this,

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:58.075
inside that subfunction
you are guaranteed

01:22:58.075 --> 01:23:01.040
that the local variables there
are unimportant for everything

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.170
in the big function.

01:23:02.170 --> 01:23:04.900
The scope is such that they
can't affect the big functions.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:06.000
They are local variables.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.250
You don't to worry about that.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:10.020
So this is a tiny couple
little class of bug

01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.240
that you can kind of dodge
by something as simple

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.900
as subdividing a function.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.020
Two-- and this is the
other important thing--

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.690
you've got this function, you
strip it down so hopefully you

01:23:18.690 --> 01:23:20.190
can see it on a
page in your editor,

01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:22.744
and you can read in English
kind of, what it's doing.

01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:23.910
You see here the five steps.

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:25.029
There they are.

01:23:25.029 --> 01:23:26.070
It's a little bit easier.

01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:28.278
And that's kind of a simple,
straightforward example,

01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:29.870
but it's that way
of thinking again,

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:31.420
that I want you to think about.

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:33.550
If you ask five programmers,
what's the right thing to do?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.780
They're all going to
give different answers.

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.751
And that's fine.

01:23:35.751 --> 01:23:37.250
But the thing I
want you start doing

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:39.019
is thinking about
what is it that you

01:23:39.019 --> 01:23:40.310
think is the right thing to do?

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:43.137
Why would you consider doing
it this way versus that way?

01:23:43.137 --> 01:23:45.470
And if you just write the
code and don't think about it,

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:47.470
you're not going to get
better as quickly as you

01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:50.132
will if you think about why
you wrote the code that way,

01:23:50.132 --> 01:23:51.340
and how it's working for you.

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:57.100
Here's another fine example.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.790
Making wrong code look wrong.

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:03.170
This is perfectly valid code
unless I make my variable names

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:04.650
a little more descriptive.

01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:06.684
And then you discover
that that's wrong code.

01:24:06.684 --> 01:24:07.600
That code is terrible.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.770
Degrees times radians
is a classic mistake.

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:17.950
Centimeters and inches
has destroyed Mars rovers.

01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:22.450
Milliseconds, kilometers,
and miles per hour.

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:24.950
That's probably not
going to work so well.

01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:27.970
And these are actually--
you say, I never do that.

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:32.470
But again, I kid you not, we
have lost billions of dollars

01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:35.440
to unit conversions because
people didn't do this.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.820
It's going to be
annoying to you,

01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.236
when you're typing
it in, perhaps.

01:24:38.236 --> 01:24:40.410
But I guarantee you, you'll
be safer if you do it.

01:24:44.307 --> 01:24:45.140
Again, random stuff.

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.410
You've probably heard all this.

01:24:46.410 --> 01:24:47.405
And we you're doing
games, you get

01:24:47.405 --> 01:24:49.230
a chance to really
experience it firsthand.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:51.229
Try to avoid sticking
numbers deep in your code.

01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:52.030
No magic numbers.

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:53.905
You want to stick it in
a variable somewhere.

01:24:53.905 --> 01:24:55.580
This has a couple good features.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.460
One of the biggest is, you've
got someone else on your team

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.080
can easily look up that
number and change it.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.746
They don't have to
find it in your code.

01:25:00.746 --> 01:25:03.240
They can just look at your
list of variables somewhere,

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.156
and figure it out.

01:25:05.156 --> 01:25:06.530
Immunity, it's
even more awesome,

01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:09.497
because you can just go to the
editor and change it around.

01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:11.330
Also, you can change
it globally everywhere.

01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:12.937
If the number 50
is magical, great.

01:25:12.937 --> 01:25:14.520
But call it something
else so that you

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.871
can change it to 51 when
you're tweaking your game plan.

01:25:17.871 --> 01:25:20.120
I've talked with this before,
and I will talk about it

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.790
again if I get half the chance.

01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:25.490
You want longer variable names
that say exactly what they are.

01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:28.200
You don't want to have to guess.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.650
They should be pronouncable.

01:25:29.650 --> 01:25:31.820
And this isn't true for
everyone, but most people,

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:35.620
will tend to in their mind, to
say a variable name out loud.

01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.840
And so if it's a bunch
of random consonants

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.531
that don't go anywhere, it's
a little bit harder to read.

01:25:41.531 --> 01:25:43.030
If they look similar,
you don't want

01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:46.710
to have a typo
kill your project.

01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:48.350
Spell them correctly.

01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:50.210
And this is actually
really important,

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:51.720
especially in
interpreted language

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.800
that just doesn't do anything
except running at run time.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.420
In Python, for
example, I believe,

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.753
if you declare a variable
that's never been seen before,

01:25:59.753 --> 01:26:01.450
it probably has a valid value.

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:01.950
No.

01:26:01.950 --> 01:26:02.580
OK, good.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.790
I'm glad that's true.

01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:04.290
JavaScript.

01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:06.130
That's what I'm thinking.

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:07.830
But JavaScript--
be very careful,

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:09.705
especially if you're
using Phaser JavaScript.

01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:12.950
If you mistype the name, it's 0.

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:13.960
That's no good.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.104
More and more modern
languages are rejecting that.

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:18.520
But the other thing is just
it's easier for your teammates

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.330
to know how to spell it.

01:26:19.330 --> 01:26:20.370
If you all agree on a spelling.

01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:22.120
And if you're all going
to agree on a spelling,

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.911
you might as well agree
on the correct one.

01:26:25.855 --> 01:26:28.480
And then reusing a variable name
is also a little bit dangerous

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.560
sometimes.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.640
If you're exiting a
loop, and you've maybe

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.306
failed to initialize
the thing properly.

01:26:33.306 --> 01:26:34.902
You reuse a variable
name elsewhere.

01:26:34.902 --> 01:26:36.360
You got this weird
value coming in,

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.818
and that's a bug
waiting to happen.

01:26:37.818 --> 01:26:40.730
And it'll be kind
of hard to find.

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.460
Function Names.

01:26:41.460 --> 01:26:42.930
All the same rules
basically apply.

01:26:42.930 --> 01:26:45.180
You want to have it be
distinctive, spelled correctly,

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.612
you want them to
say what they do.

01:26:46.612 --> 01:26:49.070
It's tempting sometimes, to
make your function name really,

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:50.040
really short.

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.600
Again, that doesn't
speed you up.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.308
If a function is
longer, you get a chance

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:54.885
to read what it actually does.

01:26:54.885 --> 01:26:57.010
But the other thing about
function names-- and this

01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:59.080
is even more true than it is
for other parts of coding--

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.580
is that your function name tells
your other programmers what

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.344
the heck you just did.

01:27:03.344 --> 01:27:04.260
I wrote this function.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:04.920
Well, what does it do?

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.128
Well, read the function name.

01:27:06.128 --> 01:27:07.120
It's right there.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.010
That's ideal.

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:09.580
You can't always pull that off.

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.830
And when your function does
something more complicated

01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:16.259
than you can describe in
four, maybe five words,

01:27:16.259 --> 01:27:18.050
then you need a lot of
comments to describe

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:19.200
what that function is doing.

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.325
Ideally, your function
should be simpler than that,

01:27:21.325 --> 01:27:22.260
if you can manage it.

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.150
By the way, I took to mention
variable names and links,

01:27:28.150 --> 01:27:30.335
and a lot of you are
probably thinking right now,

01:27:30.335 --> 01:27:31.793
yeah, a longer
variable name sounds

01:27:31.793 --> 01:27:33.650
like a good idea in principle,
but I don't want to type that.

01:27:33.650 --> 01:27:35.060
It would slow me
down to read it.

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.170
There's actually been
research done on this topic.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.340
8 to 20 letters on average, is
often a marker for good code

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:43.990
that works with fewer bugs.

01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:45.850
So I'm not talking
a little bit longer.

01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:48.530
If you can push
it, push it harder

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:50.570
to be as long as you can stand.

01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:54.070
And then you'll be a little
bit happier with that.

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:57.710
If you are coding in
VI or Punch Card still,

01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:00.760
you could complain about
a 20-letter variable name,

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.854
but you aren't.

01:28:01.854 --> 01:28:03.770
You're using a modern
development environment,

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:04.895
with auto complete, I hope.

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:10.060
Variable scope and names.

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.090
Ideally, and this is a
thing we strive to do,

01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:14.620
and don't always succeed at,
you should name your variables

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.590
so that you can tell by looking
at them where they come from.

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:19.260
By which I mean is
it a global variable?

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.218
Is it a local variable?

01:28:20.218 --> 01:28:21.960
Is it an argument
to the function?

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.860
That kind of thing.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.460
You can sometimes do this by
prefixing, or post fixing,

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.470
or camel casing, or
not camel casing.

01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:28.630
That kind of thing.

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.640
It doesn't matter
which system you use,

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:33.656
as long as you're
mostly consistent.

01:28:33.656 --> 01:28:35.780
Trying to be consistent
among different programmers

01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:37.980
is often difficult, because
everyone will horribly

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.500
disagree as to what
the correct answer is.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.960
But if you can try to sort of
remove that from your brains

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.760
and say, actually it doesn't
matter what it is this time,

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.499
I just need to know
what you're doing.

01:28:47.499 --> 01:28:48.540
That's the important bit.

01:28:51.790 --> 01:28:53.030
Parallel rays.

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:54.480
These are free arrays.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:57.412
And number 3 in each
array is related.

01:28:57.412 --> 01:28:58.870
This is something
that you're going

01:28:58.870 --> 01:29:02.770
to find yourself very tempted to
do a lot, especially in a game.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.220
And I recommend against it.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.999
Even if you only have
two parallel arrays,

01:29:05.999 --> 01:29:07.790
I recommend making a
container classic that

01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:09.740
contains both pieces
of data, and have

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:11.310
them stick in one array.

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.736
Just because you're going to
get bit sometime by having

01:29:13.736 --> 01:29:14.670
these arrays get out of synch.

01:29:14.670 --> 01:29:16.790
You just want to avoid
that if you possibly can.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.269
Order of Operations.

01:29:21.269 --> 01:29:23.310
There's an expression up
there, which is probably

01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:26.014
legal code in most languages.

01:29:26.014 --> 01:29:28.180
And we are taught in algebra
that we should memorize

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.960
the order of operation so we
know what gets multiplied when,

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.870
and all this.

01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:33.350
But in computer language
we've got a lot more,

01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:35.766
we've got incrementation, we've
got raise to the power of,

01:29:35.766 --> 01:29:38.560
we've got modulo, we've
got all this crazy stuff.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.990
And my argument is don't.

01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:44.242
Why waste brain
space on memorizing

01:29:44.242 --> 01:29:46.450
the order of operations for
the eight different kinds

01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:48.720
operations you have, when
you can just use parentheses

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.770
and remove all doubt.

01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:53.670
Plus, you could also even
divide that-- I'd divide that up

01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:55.690
into a bunch of
statements, actually.

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:57.410
There's no reason to
keep it like that.

01:29:57.410 --> 01:29:58.890
There's no way that someone
looks at that expression

01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:00.650
and thinks, this is
the most intuitive way

01:30:00.650 --> 01:30:02.420
to understand this.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.779
If you're writing on
paper in math class,

01:30:04.779 --> 01:30:07.070
you might find that because
you can use two dimensions,

01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:10.400
you actually can make your
equation more intuitive.

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:13.094
But in code, you mostly
only have the one dimension.

01:30:13.094 --> 01:30:14.510
And so it's kind
of hard to really

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:15.790
make your math intuitive.

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:21.692
So I would put extra effort
into just split it up.

01:30:21.692 --> 01:30:24.340
I also mentioned this last time,
I'm going to mention it again.

01:30:24.340 --> 01:30:25.173
It's very important.

01:30:25.173 --> 01:30:27.260
Warnings should always
be treated as errors.

01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:33.930
I can could repeat it again,
but basically every new warning

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:35.770
is a hint something
might be wrong.

01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:38.049
And if you let your build
be cluttered warnings,

01:30:38.049 --> 01:30:40.340
you will not notice when the
important warning pops up.

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.580
And you can lose hours
to that, just because the

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:43.830
build wasn't at zero warnings.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.640
Backwards Conditionals.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.590
Which of these looks wrong?

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.310
The second one looks wrong.

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.810
I agree.

01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:57.712
The second one totally looks
wrong, and yet it's useful.

01:30:57.712 --> 01:30:59.170
Because what happens
if you mistype

01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:01.766
the equal to equal sign?

01:31:01.766 --> 01:31:03.390
If you mistype the
equal to equal sign,

01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:06.652
that second one doesn't compile.

01:31:06.652 --> 01:31:08.110
Depends on your
language of course.

01:31:08.110 --> 01:31:10.151
But generally speaking,
it's a handy little trick

01:31:10.151 --> 01:31:14.080
that I find useful, and everyone
else I know thinks is terrible.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.959
So don't necessarily
use it, but try

01:31:15.959 --> 01:31:18.500
to find tricks like this that
cause to be the case, that when

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.330
you mistyped your code, you
get a compile error instead

01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:22.620
of a bug in your code.

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.368
AUDIENCE: Do you think
what the signal equals

01:31:25.368 --> 01:31:26.985
might be a client warning?

01:31:26.985 --> 01:31:29.090
PROFESSOR: It will be
a warning, absolutely.

01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:31.440
Which is an even better
reason to not to go down

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:32.770
to zero warnings, right?

01:31:32.770 --> 01:31:34.770
Doesn't help you if it's
a warning that you just

01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:36.286
let go by.

01:31:36.286 --> 01:31:37.410
And it should be a warning.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:38.100
I'm glad they added that.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.470
When I start programing,
it wasn't a warning.

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:40.386
Wasn't that wonderful?

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.360
I mentioned splitting
up the math.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.790
I think that that first
thing is, you can read it.

01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:50.955
You can figure it out.

01:31:50.955 --> 01:31:53.080
I think that the second
thing might be a little bit

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.930
more comprehensible.

01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:57.310
Again, it depends
on who you are.

01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:02.390
This is one that
I'm emphatic about.

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:04.690
I mentioned order of
operations before.

01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:05.860
Bar minus minus.

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.680
That's fancy.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.330
In some languages, and I
assume most of the modern ones

01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:10.850
these days, bar
minus minus means

01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:14.650
do the math, and then
decrement bar by 1.

01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:17.730
If I'd said minus minus bar, I'd
have meant decrement bar by 1,

01:32:17.730 --> 01:32:19.180
then do the math.

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.180
And this is pretty cool.

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.230
It's this nice little
language trick.

01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:24.690
But if you don't happen
to know what that means,

01:32:24.690 --> 01:32:27.330
you just confuse your
fellow programmer

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:28.929
with your language trick.

01:32:28.929 --> 01:32:30.470
That second thing
is perfectly clear.

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:31.730
You know exactly what happens.

01:32:31.730 --> 01:32:32.230
Do

01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:34.665
The math, then
decrement the variable.

01:32:34.665 --> 01:32:36.290
And if you really
want to get pedantic,

01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:38.900
I guess you could say
bar equals bar minus 1.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.430
But you have to draw
the line somewhere.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:48.890
I'm a fan of Booleans
being asking a question.

01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:53.530
Like the Boolean purple
probably means is purple.

01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:58.660
The Boolean hungry probably
would mean are you hungry.

01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.550
But the Boolean desk
might not mean anything.

01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:04.020
But in any event, try
to make your Boolean

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:07.580
into a question that has an
unambiguously yes, no answer.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:08.354
Which way is true?

01:33:08.354 --> 01:33:09.145
Which way is false?

01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.960
Status is a
particularly bad one,

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.300
because I don't know
what that means.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.730
Is status true good?

01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:19.730
Is status true mean that
something bad happened?

01:33:19.730 --> 01:33:23.440
I don't know without some help.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:26.060
You've probably heard this
before, mysterious constant,

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.240
don't do it.

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.260
Ideally, if you can define
it in your language,

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.210
you get an error.

01:33:31.210 --> 01:33:33.660
When you mistype it,
and that's much better.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.010
Mysterious string constants
is particularly the worst.

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:39.640
And you're going to be very
tempted to do it in JavaScript.

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.810
But you should probably
have a defined of some kind

01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:45.560
at the top, so you
don't get that problem.

01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:49.740
This is a language construct
which is very handy,

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:53.000
but I recommend
using it sparingly.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.174
If you are asking
a question-- if you

01:33:55.174 --> 01:33:56.590
want to set a
variable to a value,

01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.690
it's often very convenient
to do this syntax.

01:33:58.690 --> 01:34:02.030
But really, you don't
want to ever nest these.

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:04.430
If you nest them it becomes
unreadable gobbledygook.

01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:06.310
And if your expressions
become complicated,

01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:08.480
it also becomes
unreadable gobbledygook.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.470
Again, I'm not saying
you can't figure it out,

01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:12.030
because I'm confident
that you can.

01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:13.900
But why do you want
your future you

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.790
to have to spend 30
seconds to a minute,

01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:16.540
figuring out what
the heck you were

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:18.120
saying instead of two
seconds figuring out

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:18.995
what you were saying?

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:23.700
Goto.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.419
We are told that goto is
evil all the time, always.

01:34:26.419 --> 01:34:28.710
I claim it's not always evil,
but you should be careful

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:29.736
when you use it.

01:34:29.736 --> 01:34:31.235
It's particularly
useful when you're

01:34:31.235 --> 01:34:33.850
exiting a horrible set
of nested if statements.

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:37.170
But the main reason
goto is evil,

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:39.290
is because of a thing
called proximity.

01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:41.930
Which is that you should
use things near each other

01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:43.010
in the code.

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:45.550
If I declare a variable,
and it's two screen pages

01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:47.990
up from when I use it, that's
kind of a difficult thing

01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:49.172
to figure out.

01:34:49.172 --> 01:34:51.130
That's one reason to keep
your functions short.

01:34:51.130 --> 01:34:52.950
But instead, if I can
clump it together,

01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:55.470
I'm less likely to make
simple little errors.

01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:58.430
Right here, I'm doing the
same thing to x and y,

01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:59.550
and I'm interleaving it.

01:34:59.550 --> 01:35:01.800
Because I'm thinking of it
as, I want to prepare them,

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:04.040
I want to calculate
it, I want to print it.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.620
But it's a little
bit easier, I would

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.720
say, to debug and
think about it,

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.870
if you treat each
one separately.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:12.270
And if you get a lot of these,
write a loop or something.

01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:16.480
There's no reason to
actually type it all out.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.700
All I'm saying is
keep it simple.

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:21.590
As simple as you possibly
can, so that later,

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:24.110
when you go back to it, you
can figure it out quickly.

01:35:27.917 --> 01:35:30.250
You're going to very tempted
to make complicated systems

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:32.520
in your prototype games,
even though you're

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.730
game spec is changing,
probably daily.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.294
So you might want to be a
little bit cautious about that.

01:35:38.294 --> 01:35:40.210
Rather than making a
complicated system, solve

01:35:40.210 --> 01:35:43.727
the problem you have today, and
then maybe two days from now,

01:35:43.727 --> 01:35:45.310
when you know for
sure you're actually

01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:47.710
doing that, you might want
to put more effort into it.

01:35:47.710 --> 01:35:49.710
This is advice that's not
good for all projects,

01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:51.750
but it is good for
very short projects.

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:53.974
It's tempting to create
a complicated system that

01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:55.140
will do everything you need.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.014
And it's tempting to
create one solution that

01:35:57.014 --> 01:35:59.560
will solve all of your woes,
but you might very well

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:02.059
be borrowing trouble and solving
a problem that you're never

01:36:02.059 --> 01:36:02.710
going to have.

01:36:02.710 --> 01:36:05.220
So given that you're probably
talking about fast iteration.

01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:07.240
Your game is changing
all the time.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.530
Don't-- and this is counter
to my architectural design

01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:14.100
thoughts-- but don't
design too much,

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.920
because you're going to
change it all anyway.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.050
Other things that cause
bugs are recursion.

01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:21.010
Recursion is awesome.

01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:22.060
Recursion is fun.

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.285
Recursion is really
hard to debug.

01:36:24.285 --> 01:36:25.910
Try debugging someone
else's recursion,

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:26.870
and you'll be very sad.

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:30.060
To try debugging two things
that call each, other sadder.

01:36:30.060 --> 01:36:34.130
And it looks really cool,
but I recommend don't do it.

01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:36.220
Similarly, optimizing.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:37.340
Wait.

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:40.450
You think you know what
slow and what's fast.

01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:43.350
Chances are, you don't.

01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:46.130
If your development
system has a nice profile,

01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:48.230
it'll tell you exactly
where the bottlenecks are,

01:36:48.230 --> 01:36:49.840
exactly why your code is slow.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.580
Wait for that, and fix
the actual problems.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.091
Don't waste time chasing ghosts.

01:36:55.091 --> 01:36:56.590
Particularly this
happens a lot when

01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:59.380
you're trying to do some code,
and you're thinking oh, this

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.400
is really important.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:03.060
It ends up being
called once per second.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:06.150
Well, once per second in
computer time is never.

01:37:06.150 --> 01:37:07.740
So don't bother optimizing that.

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:09.989
But the nice thing here is
that a profile can tell you

01:37:09.989 --> 01:37:13.290
what you need to actually fix.

01:37:13.290 --> 01:37:15.830
I've mentioned fixed treat
warnings as errors before.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.780
I'll mention it again, probably.

01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:21.490
But similarly, you want to fix
a bug as soon as you find it,

01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:23.830
if it's in your head.

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:26.130
Don't think oh, that
bug is easy to fix,

01:37:26.130 --> 01:37:28.810
I'll get to before
the end of the sprint.

01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:30.660
Because you might
not remember it

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:32.847
four days from now as
clearly as you do right now.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:34.430
Also, if you've just
written the code,

01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:36.604
it's much, much easier for
you to actually fix it,

01:37:36.604 --> 01:37:38.520
because it's all much
more fresh in your mind.

01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:45.360
Strongly consider not fixing
bugs that don't matter.

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.010
And this is a tough one because
I just contradicted myself

01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:49.260
by saying fix them right away.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.990
And I'm telling you
sometimes don't fix them.

01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:54.570
But basically, if fixing the
bug is going to cost a lot time,

01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:57.430
and it's not going to
improve your game enough,

01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:59.350
then consider leaving it.

01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:00.725
That's going to
be a thing you'll

01:38:00.725 --> 01:38:02.683
have to talk about with
other people your team.

01:38:02.683 --> 01:38:05.470
But hey.

01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:08.900
So for example, if you've
got every j in your text

01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:12.202
renders green for some reason.

01:38:12.202 --> 01:38:14.410
And to fix that, you need
to go into the font library

01:38:14.410 --> 01:38:15.560
and do some crazy code.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:17.690
Well don't.

01:38:17.690 --> 01:38:19.900
Claim it's a feature.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:22.127
J's are green.

01:38:22.127 --> 01:38:23.960
Obviously, if you're
doing Microsoft Office,

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:24.950
you can't do that.

01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:26.340
But we aren't.

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:27.690
We're doing games.

01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:30.560
So we can cheat like that.

01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:31.350
Use a debugger.

01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:33.290
If you do not yet know
how to use a debugger,

01:38:33.290 --> 01:38:37.480
take advantage of this class
to learn how to use a debugger.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.320
I can't really say
more about that.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:39.909
Do it.

01:38:39.909 --> 01:38:42.450
When you're also try to figure
out a bug, talk to a teammate.

01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:43.920
Even if your
teammate has no clue

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.130
about your part of the code,
the act of putting into thoughts

01:38:47.130 --> 01:38:49.850
and words, this is what
my system is doing,

01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:52.230
will, a good third of
the time, cause you

01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:54.210
to realize where the bug is.

01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:56.132
It's kind of silly,
but it totally works.

01:38:56.132 --> 01:38:58.340
So if someone comes to you
on your team and says hey,

01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:58.940
I need help.

01:38:58.940 --> 01:38:59.680
You're like cool.

01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:00.910
I'll listen to your problem.

01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:02.800
And they talk to for
15 minutes, and then

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.790
say, I got it, and walk
away, don't feel useless.

01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:08.620
You just saved them an hour.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.840
And it cost you 15 minutes.

01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.820
And that's a bargain.

01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:13.320
And don't feel
embarrassed about it,

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.850
if you're the person
talking about your bug.

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:17.670
It's great.

01:39:17.670 --> 01:39:19.628
They may ask you questions
that are irrelevant,

01:39:19.628 --> 01:39:20.800
and you're like, no, no.

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.110
That's OK too.

01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:23.270
You have to explain it.

01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:27.880
That orders it in your head, and
then you can solve the problem.

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.450
And then of course, take a walk.

01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:32.660
I have solved more bugs going to
get my lunch, or in the shower

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:34.900
in the morning, or whatever,
than I have at my desk,

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:35.620
I would say.

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.790
At least more tough ones.

01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:40.440
Binary search is a thing that's
kind of hard to describe.

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:42.190
But rather than
necessarily saying,

01:39:42.190 --> 01:39:43.940
this could be the
problem, I'll test that.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:45.680
This could be the
problem, I'll test it.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.566
If you can do a test that
says, well, roughly half

01:39:48.566 --> 01:39:50.690
of the potential problems
that could cause this bug

01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:52.640
are over here, and half
of them are over here,

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.306
and I can do one test
that won't tell me

01:39:54.306 --> 01:39:57.360
where the bug is, but will
eliminate this entire tree,

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.790
that's a good test to do.

01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:05.490
You can quickly narrow in on
where your bug actually is.

01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:08.440
And this one happens a lot
too, with beginner programmers.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:15.750
If your bug goes away, it
probably hasn't gone away.

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:17.260
It's just hiding now.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:20.120
So be sure you know
why the bug went away.

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:22.950
If it's the green j's, you might
not need to worry about it.

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.200
But even then, you might
want to think about it.

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.620
Because you thought you knew
what the green j's were,

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.420
and they went away,
and you didn't fix it,

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:29.970
but who knows what's
going on here.

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.880
It's worth putting a little
bit of time in to make sure

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.171
that it isn't some serious
bug hiding under the covers.

01:40:36.084 --> 01:40:37.750
I'm not going into
source control again.

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:39.416
We've already done a
little bit of that.

01:40:41.225 --> 01:40:43.670
You need to do source control.

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:46.130
If it all possible,
everyone on the team

01:40:46.130 --> 01:40:48.860
should be able to just get
the code and do a build.

01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:51.460
That should be as hard is it is.

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:54.427
And on that realm, daily
builds are awesome.

01:40:54.427 --> 01:40:56.260
If you can afford to,
have some on your team

01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:59.790
whose job it is, once a
day, midnight, pick a time,

01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:01.590
do a get, a fresh
get, do a build,

01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:04.220
make sure everything works.

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.940
This sort of forces
all the programmers

01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.650
on the team to sort of be
more careful about making sure

01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:09.760
their code works.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:11.210
And also if something
gets checked

01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:12.780
and it breaks
everything horribly,

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.634
you know about it right
away, not three days later.

01:41:15.634 --> 01:41:17.800
There are automated tools
that will do this for you.

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:19.820
At least they'll check
the compilations step.

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.400
That might not check that
makes sure everything is still

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.640
working, but, you know.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:25.042
It gets there a lot.

01:41:25.042 --> 01:41:25.750
Coding Standards.

01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:28.710
Why we use them.

01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:29.822
We like tidy code.

01:41:29.822 --> 01:41:32.030
And obviously, the braces
go in one place or another.

01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:35.420
Those are terrible reasons
to have coding standards.

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.410
Instead, these are the reasons
that I like a little bit more.

01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:41.680
Which is my code--
don't touch my code.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:42.930
Well, you're on the same team.

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:45.210
I'm going to touch your code if
I need to, and it's midnight,

01:41:45.210 --> 01:41:47.043
and you're asleep and
I need to fix the big.

01:41:47.043 --> 01:41:48.290
That's the way it is.

01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:49.650
You shouldn't be mad about that.

01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:51.209
We're trying to fix the game.

01:41:51.209 --> 01:41:53.500
The fact that that you wrote
the first pass in the code

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:56.910
doesn't really matter.

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.650
And then, of course
decision fatigue

01:41:58.650 --> 01:41:59.690
is a thing I mentioned earlier.

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.180
We talk about what
variable names to use,

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.170
and what algorithm to
use, or this or that.

01:42:03.170 --> 01:42:04.750
We got plenty of
decisions to make.

01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:06.580
Where you put your
curly braces should not

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.170
be something you waste
time stressing about.

01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:12.100
If you have a coding
standard, use that.

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:14.550
If you don't have a coding
standard, be consistent.

01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:16.240
If you're modifying
someone else's code,

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:18.570
stick with their
coding standard.

01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:20.880
Because if nothing else,
when you do the check in,

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.000
it will look like
the entire file

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.166
has changed just because
you changed the indentation

01:42:24.166 --> 01:42:24.666
strategy.

01:42:24.666 --> 01:42:26.165
And that's not very
useful if I want

01:42:26.165 --> 01:42:27.430
to know what changes you made.

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.531
I'd much rather have a
minimal set of changes

01:42:29.531 --> 01:42:31.030
that I can look
through and see what

01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:34.420
the actual meaningful
changes you made were.

01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:36.320
And of course, easy to read.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:36.980
Easy to debug.

01:42:39.196 --> 01:42:40.820
A lot of things I've
been talking about

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.660
are things you can
read a lot more about.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.659
There are people that
have written serious books

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:48.170
on the topic of making your code
as easy to read as possible.

01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:50.650
Steve McConnell
in particular, is

01:42:50.650 --> 01:42:53.080
at this point-- his
books are older,

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.700
but they're still
perfectly valid.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:56.660
Because the science
of writing code

01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:58.030
has not really changed much.

01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:00.640
Joel Spolsky also has
a much easier to read

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.430
set of blog posts that talk
about this kind of thing.

01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:06.710
It's much more
accessible and it's free.

01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:10.790
And he's the person who--
his company is behind Trello.

01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:15.420
Which kind of indicates that
his method of thinking kind of

01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:19.220
matches with our
method of thinking.

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:23.100
There's a lot more things to
think about in these realms,

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.850
in terms of ways to
make your code easier.

01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:26.850
But again, I want to go
back to the core concept

01:43:26.850 --> 01:43:27.840
we talked about before.

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.190
You're going to have a couple
projects during the semester

01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:31.600
where you're going to see
a bunch of different coding

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.200
styles.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:33.390
Yours and other people's.

01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:35.060
Yours might even change over
the course of the semester,

01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:36.240
and that's good.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.890
But you should include, perhaps
as part of your post mortem

01:43:38.890 --> 01:43:41.080
process, what
kinds of things did

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:42.410
you like in the code you saw.

01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:44.691
What can you pull into
your coding style that

01:43:44.691 --> 01:43:46.440
is going to make your
code easier to read,

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.310
or easier to debug?

01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:50.810
And maybe you can try to
influence other people

01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:52.700
to write prettier code.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.390
You're not always going to
agree what pretty code is.

01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:56.849
Try to let that go
when it happens.

01:43:56.849 --> 01:43:59.223
The important thing is you
should think about what you're

01:43:59.223 --> 01:44:01.180
seeing, so that after
your project is over,

01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:02.580
you are better
programmer for it.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.720
And I think at this point,
unless you have any questions,

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:12.550
we'll go on to have this project
time with the remaining 15

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:13.910
minutes.

01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:17.120
