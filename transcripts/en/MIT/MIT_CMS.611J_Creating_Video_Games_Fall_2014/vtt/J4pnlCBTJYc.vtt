00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.676
PROFESSOR: So today
we have from EA,

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:29.380
Timothy Cowan's going to
give a lecture on development

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.622
best practices from
Electronic Arts.

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:35.080
This is about the
time of the class

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.240
where we start doing
hour long lectures

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.780
and then the remaining two hours
is open for your work time.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.880
It's really going to start
being like that probably not

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.910
next Wednesday, but
the following Monday

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.909
is when that's going to
be a pretty stable time.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.720
So when you're working
on project four,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.967
you're going to have a lot more
in class time to work in teams.

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:58.300
Hopefully you've been taking
advantage of the class time

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.960
to work in your teams
for project three.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.530
Today we are doing play testing.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.344
Has everybody already
prepared for what

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:08.260
they're going to do for
their play test today?

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.800
Do you already have
questionnaire, survey, observer

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.805
notes, things like that?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.730
I'm seeing some blank faces.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.430
That's OK.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.610
We're going to give you
15 minutes to set that up.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.560
So we're going to do
lecture, take a short break,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.400
then you'll get 15 minutes to
prepare for the focus test.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120
We're asking you to set
up three workstations

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.850
for the test at all times.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.150
I'll go through the details
when we start that up.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.310
But you'll get a little bit of
time to set up for play test.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.660
Remember, we're asking
for two focus test

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.295
reports for project three.

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:41.920
This is going to
count for one of them.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.180
The other one you need
to do on your own time

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.210
or have already done.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.860
Grading is practically
finished for project two.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.290
And now it's just entering
it all into the Stellar form,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.340
and you'll have all
that by tomorrow night.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.610
What I can say just in
general for grading,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.570
project two looked pretty good.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.730
Most of the games completed
all of the requirements.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.440
The main requirements
that we saw

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.280
that were lacking
in some of the games

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.990
were really the
legal requirements.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.370
Putting your credits, putting
your names on the game.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.300
We asked for that.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540
So please make sure you're
doing for project three.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.510
Even if it's not
in the game itself,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.314
it can be on the full sheet,
the full HTML code for the game.

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.480
So make sure you're putting
your names on your games

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.660
when you're turning them in.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.060
And also if you're
using any outside code,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.260
any outside assets,
that should all

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.440
be listed as where
it's coming from

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.910
and what license
you have for that.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.740
Phaser is MIT licensed,
so there wasn't

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.870
anything special for there.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.130
But if you're using Unity,
take a look at Unity's license

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.620
requirements.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.970
Make sure you're
fulfilling them.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.261
If you're using hacks or
Flixel, make sure your filling

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:52.960
those requirements.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.570
I believe we already gave
you some comments on the post

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.070
forms.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.460
But for the most part,
those also looked good.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.420
For project three, here's the
cheat sheet for product three's

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.660
postmortems.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.800
You've got a page to
write a postmortem.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.500
Make half of it about your
team practices and processes.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.250
The other half about
the game and the design.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.490
That's really what we're
looking for is understanding

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.370
how your team organized itself,
what communication problems

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.090
you had, how you solved them,
and even more importantly, what

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.590
are you going to
do in project four.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.540
Because in product
four, you're going

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.250
to have eight
people on your team

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.780
and problems are going
to show up more often.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.350
So hopefully you're coming
up with ideas and ways

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.900
to be prepared for
those kind of things.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.970
Any other comments?

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.870
Otherwise for the other
turn ins for product two,

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.510
task lists were good.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.420
Backlogs were acceptable.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.790
The focus test reports
for the most acceptable.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.510
We give you some comments
about your focus test reports.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.640
We gave you some comments
about your design change logs.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.110
We also are giving you
a big chunk of comments

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.480
about the game design.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.470
It's going to be labeled
not part of the grade.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.720
So like I said, it's
not a design class,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.570
but we do want to give you
some feedback on your designs.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.415
So we can help you out
with future assignments.

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:11.960
That's it.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.680
Any questions about anything?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.540
Great.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.490
So I'm just going to
hand it off to Tim.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.220
TIM COWAN: Great.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.290
So can everybody hear me?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.380
Sound good?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.050
You can just raise your hand in
the back if you can't hear me.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.750
Good?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.576
All right.

00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:32.950
So let me start off a little
bit with just introductions.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.960
Who I am, my background, where I
came from, why I'm here, maybe.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.560
I'm actually originally
from Oklahoma.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.520
I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.970
And went to Oklahoma
State University.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.930
And going to
university, I actually

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.340
had no idea what I wanted to do.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.640
Kind of just sort of landed at
one of the in state tuitions

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.360
for university.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.550
But I knew my dad was an
engineer, a programmer

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.740
specifically, and I
kind of thought that I

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.091
wanted to go do what he did.

00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.590
So I went into
university, was going

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.905
to go be trained
to be a programmer.

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:09.642
He actually gave me advice to go
work on more pure engineering.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.100
And so for my
undergraduate degree,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.600
I was actually focused on
mechanical engineering.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.350
And I stayed at Oklahoma
State University

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.590
and went on to
aerospace engineering.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.500
Did graduate school.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.800
Was in pursuit of a Ph.D.
with ultimately the goal

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400
I wanted to be an astronaut.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.770
I didn't make it there.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.760
I made video games today.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.190
But I did get a chance to
through graduate school

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.070
work on research for
Dryden Flight Research

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.110
Center in California and
actually spent about 10 months

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.940
there as a visiting researcher
while I was working on my Ph.D.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.900
And what I did for them was what
I'd say were flight simulators.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.700
But not that kind
of flight simulator.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.590
It was more this kind
of flight simulator.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.740
Computer simulation of aircraft.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.810
I did a lot of both the
simulation of the aircraft

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.179
and generating visual
representations

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.970
of the simulations.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.770
And ultimately out of all that
work I did finish my Ph.D.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.300
and sort of officially
became a rocket scientist.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.820
And so then I had to decide
what I wanted to go do.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.870
And my plan really was
to go work at Lockheed,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.800
design aircraft, work on
flight simulators for them.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.420
That was basically my life's
mission coming out of college.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.230
But that didn't
quite happen either

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.920
and I ended up at EA Sports.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.930
So instead of working on
flight simulators, what

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.710
I've done for the
last 14 years is work

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.910
on NFL football simulators.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.890
A recruiter from EA
just basically blind

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.850
contacted me from my resume
posting on Monster.com

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.060
and they brought me
down to Austin, Texas

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.630
to work on my first
video game, which

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.730
was Madden NFL 2002 for the PC.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.350
There was a small team in
Austin of about six people

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.200
that built this product
off of a shared code

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.680
base from the PlayStation
to Xbox and Game Cube.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.190
And I spent about
18 months in Austin.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.164
Built two versions of
Madden PC in that time,

00:07:15.164 --> 00:07:16.580
until they eventually
moved me out

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.050
to Florida, which was where
Tiburon Entertainment was

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.855
located, one of the
studios that's part of EA

00:07:22.855 --> 00:07:25.240
and part of EA Sports.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.710
And I've been there,
really been with Tiburon

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.590
for I guess it's
counting 13 years now.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.500
And in that span
one of the things

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.410
I'm most proud of is I
built 14 versions of Madden

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.550
in that time.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.820
And I can say, with the
exception of Madden 15,

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.470
because my roles changed, I've
contributed at least one line

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.540
of code to 13 versions of
Madden over the last 13 years.

00:07:52.127 --> 00:07:53.710
Things are pretty
different at Tiburon

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.085
from when I started in 2001.

00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:57.460
There were about 200 people
at the studio when I started.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.870
There are 700 at
our location today.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.060
We work on three
different products.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.250
And I'm the group technical
director for the studio.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.590
So I help make sure that all
three of the products we build

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.160
succeeds and sort of monitoring
engineering and technology

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.740
development for the studio.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.520
Our three products
are obviously Madden.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.030
We build NBA Live
and we're working

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.830
on the next generation
of PGA Tour Golf, which

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.880
will be out this March.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.446
So that's my background.

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:30.570
A little bit about my role.

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.169
It is very much it is an
engineering leadership role

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.480
as a group technical director.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.840
And I very much don't
write much code.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840
In fact, I kind of joke
with the other engineers

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.030
that the coding that I do
is PowerPoint these days.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.430
Let's talk a little
bit about Madden.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.650
Set a little bit of
context about some

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.170
of the philosophy
and best practices

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.510
that I hope to a kind
of pass along today.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:00.365
Madden in North America
has been a we'll call it

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.910
a top five product for at least
the last 15 years, typically

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.430
is a top three product
in North America.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.500
Generally the first person
shooters are the big sellers,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.110
especially in North America.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.100
Sometimes you've got
some of the action games

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.475
like Grand Theft Auto.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.850
But depending on what's being
released at any given year,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.930
Madden's always a number two,
number three in North American

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.500
sales.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.805
And you can see FIFA top
10 North American sales.

00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:31.680
They're a different sort
of a sports product.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.750
That is the big sports product
but they have global appeal,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.650
because the sport
has global appeal

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.770
and it sells in a lot of
markets that Madden does not.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:46.430
But as a North American company,
Electronic Arts, the number two

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.680
title in North America.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.930
In fact, on that last
chart, the number one title

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.970
in North America that
EA sold is Madden.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.590
And it's very important to EA.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.020
It's very important
to EA stock price.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:03.760
If you look at any sort of
financial reports or just

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.090
even news briefs on
financial listings for EA,

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.460
you'll often see that the little
blurb at the bottom where they

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.330
kind of describe who
Electronic Arts is, Madden's

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.740
almost always listed as
Electronic Arts, developer

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.650
of products such as
Madden, Battlefield, FIFA.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.400
Madden is very important to EA.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.340
And the success or
failure of that product

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.600
is very important to the
public company's stock price.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.930
If you look at
Madden development,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.430
given its importance
to the company,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.360
given the size of its
sales, it's a big team.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.130
There's over 200
developers on staff

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.060
that do direct
development on Madden.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.780
That includes engineers,
artists, designers, producers,

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:52.240
product managers, quality
assurance testers.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.006
And there are additional
developers that

00:10:54.006 --> 00:10:55.130
contribute through central.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.187
Technology We're a
very large organization

00:10:57.187 --> 00:10:59.020
that contributes in a
lot of different ways.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:02.060
But sort of at our studio
we call it 200 people

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.470
doing direct dev on Madden.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.230
10 million lines of
code, give or take a few.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.910
That's physical lines of codes.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.750
So it includes white
space and comments

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.260
and those kinds of things.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:20.420
But a lot, a lot of code to look
at across 150,000 plus files.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.570
And we do development
distributed across four

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.990
different locations.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.880
So we've got primary
development in Orlando,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.520
but we also have
remote development

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.370
in Austin and a contract company
that we work with Nova Scotia.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:39.560
And Vancouver is the sibling
studio for Sports, EAC,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.220
who makes FIFA, NHL, USC.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.590
They contribute a lot
of central technology

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:48.754
that helps ship
Madden each year.

00:11:48.754 --> 00:11:50.420
So there's really
sort of four locations

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.790
that we're distributed across.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.620
Really the message
here is Madden's big.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.960
It's a big seller.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.660
It has big importance.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.380
And it's big large
scale development.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.180
Large teams, large code
bases, large complexity.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.030
And the other
characteristic about

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.940
is kind of important
to sort of understand

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.100
sort of the nature of this
project, this big project that

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.510
also iterates at an iterative
cycle every single year.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.970
So our sports products come
out at the start of the sports

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.110
season every single year.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:33.000
And it's critical that Madden
comes out on its date in August

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.070
when the NFL season kicks off.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.020
Our gamers expect it.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.610
Our shareholders
expect it to sell.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.660
And if you miss that
start of the NFL season

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.880
and were to, say,
slip your ship date,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.510
that means a lot of lost
opportunity in terms

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.250
of delighting our gamers.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.930
That's very different from
other types of game development.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:02.160
Like certain games, they're
done when they're done.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.850
And even within EA we
do this a little bit.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.790
This was one of
the announcements

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.120
we made about Mirrors Edge.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.500
That's not Madden.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.730
Madden can never miss its date.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.317
And it has come out in
August for the last 25 years

00:13:17.317 --> 00:13:18.400
consistently and reliably.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.280
So given that context, what I
want to talk about a little bit

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.850
first is just some philosophy.

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.490
And this is some philosophy I've
come to over the past couple

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.490
years about what I think
makes a good engineer at EA

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.200
and specifically on Madden
and our sports products.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.240
What some of the mindset
then things that you

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.510
may need to break
out of in order

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.560
to be successful doing
development on the big title

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.072
that's got to come out
on a particular date.

00:13:49.072 --> 00:13:52.160
And when you are big
title and a big team

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.260
and a complicated project that
has to hit a particular date,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.730
the first thing
that happens is we

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.290
go add a lot of really
complicated process.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.160
Because there's a
lot of moving parts.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.680
Everything's got to get tracked.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.540
And if anything
slips, then we're

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.950
not going to hit our date.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.730
You add a lot of checklists
and you check things off.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.280
Hopefully get
everything checked off.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.760
But the reality is there's
always a lot of work to do.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.590
We've got 200 plus
people doing a lot

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.310
of different types of work and
you only have about one year

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.690
to get work done.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.360
And we want to do
and put as much

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.640
as we possibly can into that
product every single year.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.470
Because if nothing
else, I know I'm

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.090
very sensitive to
our sports products.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.470
Because they come
out every year,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.599
we tend to get beat up a little
bit over just a roster update.

00:14:46.599 --> 00:14:47.640
They haven't done enough.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.240
There's not enough improvements
over last year's product.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.857
Well we do a lot of work and
we want to do a lot of work

00:14:54.857 --> 00:14:57.440
to make sure that every single
year we're putting out the best

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.710
possible product that we can.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.180
And it's not just us.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.714
Also our gamers
really want-- they're

00:15:03.714 --> 00:15:04.880
giving us a lot of feedback.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.750
We want this, let's
get this feature in,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.100
Madden would be better
if you just did this.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.630
So there's a lot of work
and our kind of human nature

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.670
is let's do it all.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.350
We're going to get
it all done, we're

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.070
going to ship an
amazing product,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.046
and we're going to get it
all done on time in August.

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:25.730
Well if you take on too much
and you try to do everything,

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.620
disaster happens inevitably.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.200
And one thing we have
to remember in sports

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.700
is development's a
multi-year journey.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.510
It's a path.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.290
Most game products,
especially if you're

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.660
looking at a open world action
adventure game or first person

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.960
shooter, they tend to have
two if not three or four

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.397
years of development.

00:15:49.397 --> 00:15:51.480
We kind of start to think
about Madden development

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.090
in that same way where
it's a three year

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.707
process with incremental
releases along the way, where

00:15:57.707 --> 00:16:00.040
the game just keeps getting
better and better and better

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.680
on a three year roadmap.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.890
And it's important in
this sense because I

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.280
think all game makers want
to do everything, want

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.490
to make the game as
amazing as they can.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.530
But in sports, you really
have to embrace iteration.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.240
And that means kind of finding
the right balance between doing

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.370
everything, doing
everything right,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.060
and especially if you're
an engineer remembering

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.290
that sometimes you have
to balance between getting

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.670
everything done right and maybe
using some duct tape and kind

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.590
of hacking in a quick solution.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.040
Because you've got
three years to make sure

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.910
that you're getting things done
on that road that you're on.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.310
So another idea I'd like to
talk a little bit about, again,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.429
just more philosophy
about engineering.

00:16:49.429 --> 00:16:51.220
I talk about the
difference between science

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.890
and engineering.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.880
And I'm going to sort of give
the extreme examples and maybe

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.585
overgeneralize things.

00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.090
But one of things I talk
about to my engineers

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.630
is, if you look at science,
science at its core

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.319
is about the pursuit
of knowledge.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.430
The idea is king.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.731
You're going to try to
figure out how things work.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.230
You don't know what you're going
to do once you find it out.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.300
But just the fact that
I know how that works,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:24.420
I know this idea, that's
what's most important.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.970
Engineering, on the other
hand, if sort of like the best

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.360
engineer, if you're just the
extreme engineer, the thing

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.850
you get the most
excitement out of his

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.690
taking that knowledge
from the scientists

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.710
and figuring out how to apply
it to solve practical problems.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.740
And cost effective
solutions is definitely

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.270
one of the keys in terms of
that well rounded engineer that

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.760
goes in and is figuring
out how to solve

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.975
a very practical
problem based on a body

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:52.975
of scientific knowledge.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.150
It's really important
for engineers

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.900
remember that there are
solutions to even the hardest

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.800
problems.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.360
If cost is a factor,
you often find

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.030
that engineers will tend to
say this type of problem's

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:12.540
not possible.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.650
But what they really mean is
it's very, very expensive.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.660
But engineers need to
really be focused on,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.740
how do you break down
a problem and come up

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.110
with a solution to that problem?

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:25.260
And sometimes it's duct tape.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.740
And for the Star
Trek fans out there,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.595
remember there are no unwinnable
scenarios in engineering.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.785
There is no Mission Impossible.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.540
I've had engineers on
Madden in particular

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:47.660
where Madden in the
early Xbox 360 generation

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.087
actually ran at 30
frames per second.

00:18:51.087 --> 00:18:52.670
And there were a few
years there where

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.820
we were told it was
impossible for Madden

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.640
to run at 60 frames per second.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.410
And so in a leadership
position, a lot of your job

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.220
is to kind of break through
that this is impossible

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.080
and start to ask
questions on how can we

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.180
break this problem down
and come up with some cost

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.850
effective solutions
that will actually

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.820
allow us to solve this problem.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.360
And at the end of
the day, you're

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.790
not going to solve problems
if you don't attack them

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.450
with enthusiasm.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.930
And so my
encouragement is really

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.990
to challenge the impossible.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.420
Everything is possible.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.276
It maybe might not
be possible today.

00:19:31.276 --> 00:19:32.900
It might not be
possible with the money

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.560
you've got in your wallet.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.230
But given enough time and
money, we can do anything.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.990
And every problem can be solved.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.710
At least at the
core, a good engineer

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.990
really needs to believe that.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.210
So let's go on next idea.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.220
And I want to dispel the
myth of perfect code.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.920
Because this is
one of those things

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.510
that engineers coming into EA,
really coming into any job,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:05.300
have this myth that
there is perfect code.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.100
Because engineers
love perfect code.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.200
And they really love to
argue about perfect code.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.200
Even the best engineers
in the world, this

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.610
is ingrained into every
engineer that not only is there

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.200
perfect code, I know what
that perfect code looks like

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.700
and I'm the only
one that writes it.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.900
But the reality is,
mistakes are always made.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.385
It tends to be the first
time you write code,

00:20:35.385 --> 00:20:36.760
especially if it's
the first time

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.460
you've written code for
a problem you've ever

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.110
solved before.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.571
You're going to make mistakes.

00:20:41.571 --> 00:20:43.930
And I do very much
fundamentally believe

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.800
that kind of at the core
inside that you learn more

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.420
from mistakes.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.820
Hopefully you guys
have heard that before.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.460
And if you never make any
mistakes, you're not learning.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:59.530
And if you're never taking
on really big potentially

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.170
impossible challenges,
you're not learning.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.750
You're not stretching
yourself, you're not growing.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.199
So it's important to remember
that mistakes will be made.

00:21:07.199 --> 00:21:09.740
You're going to learn from those
mistakes, and you know what?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.395
Your code will get better
as you make those mistakes

00:21:14.395 --> 00:21:16.050
and refine it.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:20.630
So remember, there is a
software development life cycle.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.340
And in fact, a lot
of times when you're

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.020
arguing about perfect code,
it's very early on in the cycle

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.350
and you don't even
know what you don't

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.700
know because that code hasn't
been through that software

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.570
development life cycle.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.290
There's almost no guarantee that
there's no bugs in this code

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.210
that you're writing.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.668
And it really isn't until you
make it through that software

00:21:38.668 --> 00:21:43.390
life cycle that you're going to
understand what those bugs are.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.270
Towards the end of
the project where

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.460
you have this
perfect code and all

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.970
of a sudden now it's been
all the way through testing

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:55.760
and certification and now you
see, oops, I made a mistake.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.120
And when you tie that into
our sports iterative cycle

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.540
where we're embracing iteration,
taking on the impossible,

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.170
one of the big things that
try to impress on people

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.140
is try to value less
the perfect code

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.857
and start to think
about proven code.

00:22:11.857 --> 00:22:14.440
Proven code that's been through
that software development life

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.030
cycle, has had the
bugs shaken out of it.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.340
Even if you didn't
write it, that code

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.384
is proven and will have less
bugs typically than code

00:22:23.384 --> 00:22:24.675
that you go right from scratch.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.800
And then the next idea,
and this is the last one

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.360
before we can get
onto the other section

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:39.340
and get out of the philosophy
stuff, is on a big team,

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.080
on that iterative cycle
there's a lot of tasks.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.980
There's a lot of
work to get done.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.840
Everybody's given
their tasks and they

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.060
have to finish their tasks.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.300
They've all kind of got this
little piece of a puzzle

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.970
and they own their
piece of the puzzle.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.636
They've been given
this task and they're

00:22:55.636 --> 00:22:57.470
going to get that piece done.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.200
And it's going to be perfect
given the context that they've

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.170
been given on that task.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.000
The trick is there's
a lot of dependencies.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.740
And it's often very
hard to go see,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.130
how do all those
pieces together?

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:13.720
And when you've got
this kind of situation,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.900
you start to end up with you've
got these features, which are

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.540
actually a collection of tasks.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.490
And those features don't
really have an owner.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.550
All the tasks have an owner.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.300
Someone's doing the tasks.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.559
But what about the feature?

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:27.850
Does the feature have an owner?

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.260
Does anybody know
how all those pieces

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.540
are going to fit together?

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.210
And if you don't have
someone owning that feature,

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.880
you end up with
unfinished projects.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.810
Or potentially you
end up with not quite

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.290
what you were looking for
because you didn't really

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.162
understand from this task
how it all fit together

00:23:47.162 --> 00:23:49.120
and was going to ultimately
deliver whatever it

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.370
was that we were looking for.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.490
And so it's super
important when you

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.500
get immersed into
a really big team

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.000
and you're hand and
a bunch of tasks

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.780
to pick your head up
every once in a while

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.970
and make sure that you're
focused on that feature.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.090
And potentially
you're asking, how

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.120
does this task that I'm working
on fit into this feature?

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.140
Because if you've got that
context, you may even realize,

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.910
hey, my task
actually isn't going

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.440
to help me deliver
on that feature.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.790
I'm not working on
the right thing.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.890
As an engineer with a
technical background,

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.970
I'm building good software,
functional requirements,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.550
et cetera.

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.220
You really need to be
focusing on that feature.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.940
Because your task
is just a means

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.540
to delivering on that feature.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:44.230
So in summary, just a little
bit of philosophy type stuff.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.590
Embrace iteration.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:47.170
Challenge the impossible.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:50.840
Value proven code and focus
on features, not tasks.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.390
And that's kind of my top four.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.242
It's easily a top 10 list.

00:24:57.242 --> 00:24:58.700
The thing is to
kind of think about

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.730
in terms of coming into a big
company, working on a big team.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.490
Some of the philosophy that you
kind of need to take with you

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.470
in your approach on
integrating with that team

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.344
and being successful.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.890
Now I want to talk a little
bit about more on the process

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.020
side, engineering quality.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.790
How do we as a engineering
organization at the studio help

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.780
make sure that we're
delivering a quality product.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:32.460
And game development's
notoriously not very formal.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.070
We are game
developers, after all.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.440
The challenge, though,
when you're not

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.815
terribly formal in your
development methodologies

00:25:40.815 --> 00:25:45.430
and your development
practices is success

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:53.320
starts to rely on individual
heroics or individual heroism.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.302
And that's a bit
of a danger zone

00:25:55.302 --> 00:25:57.260
when you start talking
about shipping a quality

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.270
product that's big and on time.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:02.190
Because quality's
never an accident.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.930
I love this quote.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.970
It's never an accident.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.720
It's the result of
intelligent effort.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.660
Now, before we talk
about processes for this,

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.910
let's decompose
quality a little bit.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:17.300
Because this kind of plays
into some of the thinking

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.287
on our approach to quality.

00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:22.620
And really, it's going to
focus on the different aspects

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.990
of quality.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.560
There's perceptual quality.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.750
Is the game fun?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.450
Is it beautiful?

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.160
It's how the gamer
experiences the game.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.520
There's functional quality.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.760
That's kind of, does it work?

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.740
An engineer is given
a spec and writes code

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.890
and it either does or does not
do what it was intended to do.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.770
And then there's
structural quality.

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:50.744
That's the underlying,
behind the scenes quality.

00:26:50.744 --> 00:26:52.160
It tends to be the
type of quality

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.520
that engineers care
about the most.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.940
That's kind of the
code quality space.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.380
Is my code perfect?

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.990
The top two perceptual quality,
functional quality, those

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.330
are things that the gamer is
going to see in your product.

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.480
Structural quality
is not something

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.400
that the gamer will
actually ever see or notice.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.150
But it is something that
will hold up your project.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.801
If you don't have the right
level of structural quality

00:27:17.801 --> 00:27:19.300
in your product,
it will prevent you

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.990
from delivering that product.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.060
Now ultimately, at
the end of the day

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.480
we're probably most interested
in that perceptual quality.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.200
Because that's the
one that's most

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.890
going to resonate
with the gamers.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.560
Is it fun?

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.640
Is it beautiful?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.600
And we kind of
like it meta critic

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.520
as one possible measure of
whether our game's being

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.970
perceived as a high quality.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.960
This is basically a reviewer
sits down, plays the game,

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.270
or even if you go
look at user reviews.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.550
A gamer sits down
and plays the game.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.130
And then that game
experience gets

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.420
processed through
their filters and they

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.590
perceive it to be at a
certain level of quality.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.160
Now, functional
quality is inevitably

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.630
going to play into this.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.990
But we generally see, I
think, with meta critic

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.350
is a lot of the
functional issues may not

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.260
be seen because it takes hours
and hours and hours of playing

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.860
the game before
those maybe surfaced.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.180
And it tends to be,
especially with meta critic,

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.020
you spend four to eight
hours playing the game,

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.300
you process that
experience, give it a score.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.490
So I tend to kind of
argue, at least when

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.040
we're talking internally
about quality, only

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.250
the absolute worst
functional issues are

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.760
going to show up and play
into your meta critic score.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.142
But the gamer who plays
your game for 100 plus hours

00:28:41.142 --> 00:28:43.600
is really going to notice a
lot of those functional quality

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.100
issues.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.170
We also have been
talking recently

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.570
about kind of a
spectrum of quality.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.390
And this is kind of
tied to meta critic.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:58.750
And I steal this from one
of our executive producers

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:04.520
where from 0 to about 69,
those games are sort of just

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.250
foundationally solid.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.590
If you're anywhere below
69, sort of the upper end

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.300
of that spectrum.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.460
You get to about 69 or 70 by
being foundationally solid.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:18.520
Anything below that, you're
buggy, you're broken,

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.530
you've got a lot of issues.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.920
And from there,
quality kind of builds.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.997
If you're buggy, broken, and
have just glaring problems,

00:29:26.997 --> 00:29:28.830
you're never going to
get to that next level

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.790
where you've got good function.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.560
It functions and if you have
a competitor in the space,

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.300
it functions at least as
well as the competitor.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.587
And that's kind of
that 70 to 79 range.

00:29:40.587 --> 00:29:43.170
But what we really want to do
is we want to get up above that.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.170
This is interactive
entertainment.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:49.420
We're trying to really delight
the gamers that play our game.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.020
And from 80 to 89,
we kind of start

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.020
to talk about, all right,
that's the point where

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.400
your game is getting immersive.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.410
Especially for Madden, it's
starting to be very realistic

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.640
and they feel like they're
there on Sunday watching a game

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.620
and they're sort of
immersed in the experience.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.580
And then even above
that, which is

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.830
where we really want to get
to is 90 to 99 or even 100.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.150
I don't know if it
actually goes to 100.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.020
But that's where
now not only are

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.880
you immersed in the
experience, but the game

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.735
is evoking emotion.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:32.300
So when you get up
into those upper bands,

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.292
that's where perceptual quality
really starts to come in.

00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:36.750
I'm going to talk
a little bit more

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.916
about that foundational and
that functional quality,

00:30:38.916 --> 00:30:43.470
because that's what engineers
and development directors are

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.480
ultimately paid to solve.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.980
And so the question
is, on a big project

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:56.845
with a lot of complexity that's
got to hit a particular date,

00:30:56.845 --> 00:30:58.470
inevitably need to
put a lot of process

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.680
in place to try to do make
sure that you're putting out

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.620
that quality product or
at least at a minimum

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.760
were able to hit that
foundational and functional

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.490
quality so that the
designers and everyone

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.345
else can help push us up
into those perceptual realms.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.255
The first process
is code review.

00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:19.130
So let's talk a little
bit about code review.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.530
Because engineers
love code review.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.560
Especially because
their code is perfect

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.637
and no one needs to
look at this code

00:31:27.637 --> 00:31:29.220
to figure out whether
or not it should

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.428
be allowed to get checked in.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.020
At EA and on Madden
in particular,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.250
we do have a blanket policy,
all code gets reviewed.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.870
If you're going to check code
in, it's got to get reviewed.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.170
We even in this day
and age where data

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.039
is a huge part of development.

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.080
Actually there's a lot of
data that gets reviewed

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.590
before it gets checked in.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.102
But code review is sort
of the primary function

00:31:52.102 --> 00:31:54.060
where all right, you're
going to check in code.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.101
It needs to get reviewed.

00:31:55.101 --> 00:31:57.955
And the goal there, let's
make sure there's no bugs.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.050
Get a second set of eyes,
have someone look at it.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.122
Shake out all the bugs.

00:32:05.122 --> 00:32:07.580
Because the second set of eyes
will find the bugs before it

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.450
makes it to QA.

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:14.610
There was an interesting
study recently, Rebel Labs.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:19.250
They did a survey and
asked development teams,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.180
how many of you do code
review and how often

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.610
do you code review?

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.160
Code review is very
prevalent coming out

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.690
from this industry survey.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.745
I think it was 76% of teams
do a lot of code review.

00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:35.660
And their ultimate
goal with this survey

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:40.690
was to figure out the impact
of code review on quality.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.720
And quality for them was
defined by lack of bugs.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.270
So the functional
realm of quality.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:52.687
And their study produced kind
of an interesting result.

00:32:52.687 --> 00:32:54.770
They were actually looking
at two factors, quality

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.330
and predictability.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.992
Both super important for sports.

00:32:58.992 --> 00:33:01.070
And they found that
code review really

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.720
helped with predictability.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.250
It indexed well.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:09.670
You could see if you did no code
review, there was an 11% or 10%

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:14.030
swing between no code review
and always doing code review.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.140
Much less influence
though on quality.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.950
They found that there
was not actually

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.330
not much of a difference between
teams that did code review

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.080
and didn't do code review
in the span of quality.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.020
Again, quality is
measured as bugs.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.794
AUDIENCE: What is
predictability?

00:33:29.794 --> 00:33:32.210
TIMOTHY COWAN: Predictability
is able to hit your schedule

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.709
on time.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.307
Now, that's not to say that we
don't find bugs in code review.

00:33:40.307 --> 00:33:42.640
But I think that's interesting
because it kind of aligns

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.210
with some of my experience
within EA that, now, don't get

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.450
me wrong, we put code
review in place because we

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.560
wanted to find bugs early.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.690
And when I started at EA we
did not do any code review.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.810
In 2001, again, this is
kind of individual heroics,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:58.241
pretty informal.

00:33:58.241 --> 00:34:01.940
On a 200 person team, you've
got to do code review.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.619
And we do want to find bugs.

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:05.160
But it's actually
a little surprising

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.920
that we don't find many
bugs in code review.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.520
And I see that at
our studio as well.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.963
How many people here know C++?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.010
All right.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.380
Awesome.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.199
Let's play a little
game quick here.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.509
It's called find the bug.

00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:22.675
You guys are code reviewers.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.550
Raise your hand if
you can spot the bug.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.512
There is a bug here.

00:34:31.512 --> 00:34:32.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.510
TIMOTHY COWAN: You can't see it?

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.010
OK.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.850
Is it the contrast
or the lights?

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.579
Anybody that can see it spot it?

00:34:55.579 --> 00:34:56.495
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.420
TIMOTHY COWAN: Good.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.950
Good.

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.590
That is the mistake.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.720
It's a cut and paste error.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.830
So someone moving fast.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.640
And it tends to be pretty
easy not to notice this.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.930
It's just kind of hidden
in a block of code.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:24.760
It actually was
intended in this case.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.970
It's just kind of following
a pretty simple pattern.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:32.890
They should have been copying
PURL into the STR web URL.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:38.360
This was code that was written,
tested by the engineer that

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.190
wrote it, I presume.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:46.970
Code reviewed, checked in, and
made it all the way out to QA.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:49.280
I don't know if an
actual bug manifested,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.590
but this code did make
it through code review.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.570
In fact, all this code
we're going to look at

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.840
made it through code review.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.576
How about this one?

00:35:59.576 --> 00:36:02.041
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:02.041 --> 00:36:04.020
TIMOTHY COWAN: All right.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.990
Yeah.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.460
That is kind of the trick with
code is it's kind of tiny text.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.925
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.395 --> 00:36:16.520
It's probably the sunlight.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.510
People in the front
row can see it?

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:28.010
No?

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:34.620
I guess this game's
a little less fun

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.030
than maybe I was hoping.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.220
In this case, you've
got two different files

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.824
and this is a function call.

00:36:42.824 --> 00:36:44.240
And there's one
line of code where

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.120
they're using the function.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.680
In the second file,
if you're doing

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.890
a code review you've actually
got to-- in this case,

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.920
someone added a line of code.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.340
And when you get
that code review,

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.110
you get just that file
with a little diff

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.646
and you see their line
of code that they added.

00:36:57.646 --> 00:36:59.020
You won't actually
spot this blog

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.700
unless you open
up the other file

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.290
that they didn't edit and
go look at that function

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.430
and how it's used.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.890
Because they've actually got
the two parameters reversed.

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.550
They're both bools.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.040
Track actives versus
track passives.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.270
And the function they're
calling has those two parameters

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.130
reversed.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:25.800
Again, written, tested,
code reviewed, checked in.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.470
I don't know if this
one's readable at all.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.970
I kind of have to
skip through this.

00:37:39.352 --> 00:37:41.319
In the interest of time,
I'll go ahead and just

00:37:41.319 --> 00:37:42.110
skip through these.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:47.230
Because I think they're all
somewhat fuzzy and small text.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:52.530
In this case, if you don't know
C++ or don't know the syntax,

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:55.260
with that indentation there's
an if statement there.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.690
With the indentation
it was probably

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.210
expected that that
code would only

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.930
get it executed if the
if condition was true.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.440
They missed their curly braces.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.180
And that that
indentation tends to,

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.040
if you're reviewing the
code, kind of draw your eye.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.042
It's like, yeah,
that code looks OK.

00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:14.250
You're kind of inspecting it.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.680
And I'm sure that they
knew what they were doing.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.140
And you kind of missed that
the braces aren't there.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.800
And this one's maybe-- no.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:32.020
So in this case,
their if statement,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.430
it's actually a constant number.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:36.560
This will always be true.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.620
And they probably actually
meant to check if that value was

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.250
equal to some particular value.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.510
But they actually just
put the mask right

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:47.470
into the if statement.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:51.170
And that will always
be a number greater

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.710
than 0, which will be true.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.860
And last one.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.310
This last statement here.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.290
This last statement
doesn't do anything.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.620
They're just assigning
one variable to itself.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.760
Again, really easy
cut and paste errors.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.042
And I think the surprising
thing in a lot of cases, again,

00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:16.000
we've got this process.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.579
We do find bugs.

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:21.870
But you don't find all of them.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:25.790
And a lot a really simple ones,
things that after the fact,

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.390
when you get a bug report from
QA and you go look at that

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.000
and you're like, how
come no one caught this?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.480
How come the person that
wrote it didn't catch it?

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.760
How come the code
reviewer didn't catch it?

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.510
I'll tell you, in some
cases it's not even

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.390
just one person code reviewing,
but you may have five people

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.860
that code review it.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.270
Again, we're big,
multi-disciplinary.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:49.610
Sometimes one check in may take
five different subject matter

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.360
experts where I need
a rendering engineer,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.610
I need a physics engineer,
and I need a UI engineer

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:55.310
to review this code.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.710
And five different people review
the code and no one catches

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.050
the problem.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.110
But there are other
reasons for code review.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.320
And this is one of the
things I'm pretty adamant on.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.420
Because when that report
comes out that says,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.492
code review doesn't
really find bugs.

00:40:11.492 --> 00:40:13.200
And in fact, if you
don't do code review,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.420
you're not all that bad off
in terms of finding bugs.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.281
I say, wait a minute.

00:40:18.281 --> 00:40:20.280
We're not going to stop
our code review process.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.910
Because there's other reasons
for doing code review.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:26.010
And finding bugs is actually,
I would call, my fourth reason.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.890
Really, code review's about
monitoring structural quality.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:35.570
And that's why that report
says if you do code review,

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.584
you get better predictability.

00:40:37.584 --> 00:40:39.000
Because your
structural quality is

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.450
this underlying quality
that's going to help you

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.310
be successful.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.310
It's going to help with
your predictability.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:47.840
It's going to help with
knock-on effects, where

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.230
if you write code that's
consistent, reliable, robust,

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:55.080
and file certain
programming patterns,

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.880
you're going to end up with a
better result in the long term

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.171
and you'll be more predictable.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.120
It's also about
knowledge sharing.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.080
So on a big team
of 150 people where

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.680
everyone's got their
own little task

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.590
and they own their
little task, we

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.560
need to make sure that
the whole team has

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.460
some insight into what all the
other developments are doing.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.330
And if you're out sick
or you win the lottery

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:25.050
and stop working, someone else
at the company's has maybe

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.260
done some code reviews and
has seen what you're doing

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.020
and has learned from that and
knows about how that feature,

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.440
how that task works.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.830
And then it's also
about education.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.120
So if you are the best
engineer on the planet,

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.210
you've been writing
code for 14 years,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.460
and you've learned
from all your mistakes,

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:49.891
and you write the most perfect
code, having a new engineer who

00:41:49.891 --> 00:41:51.265
just came to work
at the studios,

00:41:51.265 --> 00:41:52.780
is writing their
first line of code

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:57.900
ever review your code teaches
that person something.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.936
And then the last point
is obviously catch bugs.

00:41:59.936 --> 00:42:01.810
We do want to catch bugs
through code review.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.210
It's just it's not the
only thing that you get out

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:06.160
of code review.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.570
And really, static analysis
and rigorous testing

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.460
is the best way to catch bugs.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.690
And in fact, all those
examples I just went through

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.610
are caught by static
analysis that we apply

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.690
to our code base every day.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:22.390
Static analysis today is
actually very good at pattern

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:25.890
matching and identifying
those types of issues.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:29.400
And on a code base our
size, you see a lot of them.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.420
And static analysis is
actually a very important

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.170
additional process, I'm not
going to talk a lot about that,

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.925
to layer into a robust
development process.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.124
All right, so the next piece.

00:42:43.124 --> 00:42:44.540
All right, if we
want to find bugs

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.040
we want to drive
functional quality,

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.800
we need quality testing.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.550
And your game
development's messy.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.580
You're never going
to find all the bugs.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.194
And really testing is
only good to find bugs.

00:42:56.194 --> 00:42:57.610
No matter how much
testing you do,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:58.820
you're never going
to know what bugs

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.210
you haven't found, obviously.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.420
So we've got to make
sure we do testing.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.980
And there's a lot of
different types of testing.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.890
There's the engineer doing
their own software testing.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.610
There's our QA department
who does black box testing.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:17.750
There's automated testing.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.240
There's a whole
spectrum of testing

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.060
that we do on our
product to help

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.180
make sure that the product
we put out is amazing.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.810
But inevitably, game
development's messy.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.280
No matter what we do,
things do slip out.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.830
In fact, in the first 48
hours of Madden launching,

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:41.230
there is more testing done
on our product by the gamers

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.750
than we do an entire 10 month
development cycle by ourselves.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.210
So one of the big processes
we have in place today

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.670
is test automation.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:58.100
You can't hire enough QA
people to test your game

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.530
for the scale and the size of
games and complexity of games

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:02.310
today.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.290
So we do lots and lots
of test automation.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.030
And basically the goal is to
get hours and hours and hours

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:10.600
of testing through automation
on hundreds of dev kits

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.510
that sit idle at the studio at
night when people are at home.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:16.962
There's one big
piece that I want

00:44:16.962 --> 00:44:18.670
to talk about with
test automation, which

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.565
is when we talk to
engineering, verification,

00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:25.060
and validation,
testing is a means

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:29.660
to compare the execution,
the results of the test

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.420
against the expected
results for that test.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.510
And one thing that we're
starting to do a lot more at EA

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:39.040
is we're kind of
looking at testing where

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.740
automated testing in particular
where kind of the only expected

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.950
result is that the
test completes.

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:47.250
That test may take five minutes.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:50.250
It may take 50 minutes.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.670
All we're doing is looking,
hey, did that test complete.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.180
And within that span
of say 50 minutes,

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.830
there's all kinds of
other things that went on.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.600
And we're not really testing
whether all those things

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.530
between here and here met
what our expected results are.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.600
So really, this is about
measurement and functional

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:17.010
quality measurement, which
starts with technical KPIs.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:21.020
Over a 50 minute test, did
the game run at frame rate?

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.670
What are the load times
between your different modes?

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.780
Did they meet what our
expected requirements were?

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:32.140
Obviously there's crashes,
desyncs, and disconnects,

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.920
which are very abrupt
failures for that test where

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.300
it won't actually complete.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.520
But there's all these
other technical KPIs

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.620
where the test will
continue, but it may not

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.614
have been doing what
you'd expect it to do.

00:45:45.614 --> 00:45:46.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.940
TIMOTHY COWAN: So what we're
starting to do more now

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:01.990
is measure and make sure that
every build so that every test

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.380
where an automated
test, no one's

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.230
sitting there watching it.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.280
I may not know.

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.510
If a QA person doesn't sit there
and watch that automated test,

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.070
we don't know that it's not
running at target frame rate

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.875
unless we measure
it and report it.

00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:16.920
And with online
services today, you

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.020
can do a lot of measuring
and automated reporting,

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.460
capture all that data,
and create dashboards

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.650
that can show, all right, what's
the performance of my Game

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.310
this is one the first ones we
put in over the last couple

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:29.810
years.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.130
We've always had
performance analysis.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.300
But what we now have
is automated solutions

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.170
with very detailed
level of reports,

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.580
so that every time
someone plays our game,

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.260
we're getting frame rate
reports out of that game.

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.600
And you can drill down a little
bit to look at for Madden

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.250
by stadium.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.680
Every game that's been
played in each stadium, what

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.930
does the frame rate look like?

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.870
And look and see are
there certain stadiums

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.530
that have problems.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.607
And you can even look
at an individual session

00:47:03.607 --> 00:47:05.940
and say, all right, was there
an individual game session

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.710
that had a strange
frame rate problem?

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.800
Now beyond our technical
KPIs, those key performance

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.310
indicators, there's other
types of functional issues

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.030
that we need to look to measure.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:23.430
Bugs do slip out into the wild.

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.880
This was one that got a
lot of publicity this year,

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:26.585
the tiny titan.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.410
UFC had some well known
glitches in its game

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:38.139
where a lot of funny animation
and physics problems.

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:39.680
Inevitably when
these types of things

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.060
happen, if you're familiar with
the notion of asserts, sort

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.300
of non fatal errors or
warnings that engineers put

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.510
into their code to catch non
fatal problems and warn them

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.870
that, hey, you might
want to look at this.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:56.370
I guarantee when both of those
problems showed up in a debug

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:59.190
build, an assert probably
would've yelled at a developer

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:02.490
and m, hey, something's wrong.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.410
So there's this class of non
fatal functional problems

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:09.080
that are pretty severe, because
if they get out into the wild,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.912
this breaks the immersion and
ability to experience emotion

00:48:13.912 --> 00:48:14.870
when you play the game.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.800
Or at least in some
cases, this one's

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.040
probably a negative emotion.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.630
We need to start to
shift our focus on as you

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:25.160
build engineering systems.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.720
This is, again, as an engineer,
what you bring to the table

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:34.450
is this methodology and process
of verifying and validating

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.289
against functional requirements.

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:38.080
Make sure as you're
building your features,

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.746
you're thinking about
testing and you're

00:48:39.746 --> 00:48:41.270
thinking about measuring.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.510
Is this doing what
it's supposed to do?

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:48.400
Because I've got a code base
of 10 million lines of code,

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.700
200 people contributing to it.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.450
There's a lot of complexity.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:55.510
And you never know throughout
that software development life

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.800
cycle what types of
problems might show up.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.470
So as you're going into your
design and requirements,

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.990
start thinking about what
types of failure modes

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.730
are critical that I should
be measuring and reporting

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.540
through online systems.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:14.650
We're starting to do a lot
more of this at our studio.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:18.860
So in summary, we really talked
about two things, code review

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.230
and testing.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.130
And specifically measurement
when you're doing that testing.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.600
But it's really about,
for me, an engineer's

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.300
responsible for
driving the functional

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.760
quality of a product.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.770
We write the code, we
write the specifications.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:39.100
We have to drive the functional
quality of game software.

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.640
And a well executed project
has both the technology

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:45.150
and processes in place
to do that and make sure

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.690
that you're able to
take that big project

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.320
and get it done by
August every single year.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:53.870
So that's it.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.590
I think I maybe talked a little
bit longer than I originally

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:57.100
expected.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.730
But we've got a
little bit of time

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:02.820
for Q&amp;A. I think I was told
you guys take a break at 2:00.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.810
But you can go ahead
and ask any questions

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.460
and I'll answer anything I can.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.340
When we take the
break, if one on one

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.230
if you want to ask
more questions,

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.960
I'll probably hang around
while you're doing play testing

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:19.332
and can talk more.

00:50:19.332 --> 00:50:19.915
Any questions?

00:50:22.194 --> 00:50:23.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.640
TIMOTHY COWAN:
Today it is all C++.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.140
100%.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.490
I did a talk yesterday sort
of to a general audience

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:38.650
about how the
industry's evolved.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.850
There used to be a lot of
assembly language intermixed

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.125
with C++.

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:46.700
We don't do that anymore
today on today's consoles.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:53.250
And there is in data
we do do Lua scripting.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.920
There is ActionScript.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.190
There is shader code and shaders
for graphics programming.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.660
I bucket those more as data.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.620
And they tend to be-- we have a
Lua interpreter that's written

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:10.172
in C++ the can load Lua
data scripts and process it.

00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:11.630
We have an ActionScript
interpreter

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:14.360
that loads ActionScript
and processes it.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.240
So generally when I'm talking
the 10 million lines of code,

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.000
it's the C++ game engine client.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.230
But it does interact
with other types of code

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:23.744
that we consider data today.

00:51:26.588 --> 00:51:30.380
AUDIENCE: So I've been in code
review situation all the way

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:33.080
from [INAUDIBLE]
mostly automated

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.348
through some sort of
code tracking system

00:51:35.348 --> 00:51:39.046
or commit system where someone's
about to commit something,

00:51:39.046 --> 00:51:43.090
[INAUDIBLE], or all the
way to the other end

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.430
where someone just grabs me and
makes me look at their screen.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.330
How does that work?

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.640
Can you walk us through
how review works?

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.680
TIMOTHY COWAN: Sure.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.145
The policy is all
code gets reviewed.

00:51:58.806 --> 00:52:00.180
With that kind of
policy, there's

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.780
a lot of flexibility in
how the teams actually

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.710
implement the process.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:10.020
But the tool set we give
them, we do have a server.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:15.970
We actually use a software from
SmartBear called Collaborator.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.080
And when you're going to
submit code to Perforce,

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.610
we use Perforce
for source control,

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:25.060
you upload the diffs to
Collaborator and assign

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.340
that to a reviewer to
go look at those diffs.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:31.420
And they can mark it up, put
little bugs and comments,

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.060
send it back to you, and you
can kind of go back and forth.

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.160
So it's one option.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.610
That's how 90% of the
code review gets done.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.390
But the thing I tell
the teams is you

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:42.720
don't have to do it that way.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.496
In fact, having someone come
to your desk and talk to you

00:52:45.496 --> 00:52:47.120
and look at the code
over your shoulder

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.290
can, in a lot of cases,
be much higher value.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.270
Because that can
help set some context

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:55.460
on why did you
write it this way,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.300
and you can have a conversation.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.220
So that's an option as well.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.290
And you also have
the flexibility,

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.340
depending on the
situation, sometimes

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.110
code gets reviewed
after check in.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.740
It doesn't have to get
reviewed prior to check in.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.350
That's kind of up to the teams,
up to the urgency of the check

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.050
in, the seniority of the review.

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.160
But the request is that
all code gets reviewed.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.720
Again, it kind of hit the
four bullet points on why.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:25.180
So I guess basically it depends.

00:53:27.856 --> 00:53:29.230
It is game
development, so we try

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.035
to be a little informal about
it and give you the flexibility

00:53:32.035 --> 00:53:36.740
to do the review
the way you see fit.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.450
But provide a lot of tools
and process and formality

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:45.570
kind of through a prescribed
automated system as well.

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.763
I think there was a
question in the back.

00:53:47.763 --> 00:53:48.388
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:48.388 --> 00:53:50.858
How much additional
work is for you

00:53:50.858 --> 00:53:56.243
to do things like hoarding
the same game to Xbox,

00:53:56.243 --> 00:53:57.225
PS1, [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.830
TIMOTHY COWAN: For today's
consoles, Xbox One,

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.630
PlayStation 4.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.410
You're really starting to get
to hardware that's converging.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:12.170
It's becoming more PC like.

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:14.300
Probably the biggest
difference is actually

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.900
going to be in the
operating system.

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.920
Each of those consoles
has an operating system.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:23.050
Xbox One ends up being
sort of flavor of Windows.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:28.470
And PlayStation 4 ends up
being some variety of Linux.

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.270
So you've got this
operating system and driver

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:34.100
layer that is different.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:35.580
But with the way
EA's structured,

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.570
obviously we're cross platform.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.190
Madden, when I showed
the charts earlier,

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.330
actually shipped on
seven different platforms

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:45.770
that one year for Madden 13.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:50.410
We've always built
cross platform support.

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:55.710
I characterize it as about
a 70-30 to 80-20 rule, where

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.200
the majority of your
code has no idea what

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.690
hardware it's running on.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:04.130
And there's just kind
of this base layer

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:05.610
that interacts
with the operating

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:10.000
system and the drivers and does
what it has to do specifically

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.790
for the console.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:14.900
And so it's call it
80-20 in terms of code

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.640
and 80-20 in terms of effort.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:24.110
So that 20% layer generally gets
built by our central technology

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:29.200
groups, whether it's the base
level rendering layer, the base

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.900
level file system layer, the
base level of memory management

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.670
layer.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.690
At EA we've got
central technology

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.960
where that gets built
centrally and all teams use it.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.700
And then the teams
take that technology

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:45.910
and build their platform
agnostic game on top of it

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.200
where it kind of doesn't
care whether it's

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.570
Xbox One or PlayStation 4.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.320
But then the other
space that is different

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.350
is just really, I'd
say, performance.

00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:00.620
Each of the systems has
slightly different bottlenecks

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:02.230
in terms of what's
fast and what's

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:08.141
not, whether it's memory
bandwidth, shader pipelines.

00:56:08.141 --> 00:56:10.390
They have slightly different
strengths and weaknesses.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.010
They're tuned differently.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:16.010
So you tend to have to look
at your content and your data

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.700
and structure it
in a way where it's

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.330
optimal for the two systems.

00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:25.920
In the space of just kind of
art contact, how many polys,

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.170
how your textures are
structured and bundled,

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:32.830
how you write your
shaders especially.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.730
There's quite a bit of space,
quite a bit of, I'd say,

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:37.471
platform specific
optimization work

00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:39.220
to make sure we're
really taking advantage

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.011
of the different
bottlenecks in the system.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:46.440
AUDIENCE: Why did
you choose to join

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.731
[INAUDIBLE] in the first place?

00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:54.490
TIMOTHY COWAN: To be
honest, I had no idea

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.510
that you could make a
career in video games.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.060
Like I said in the
intro, I wasn't

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.627
looking to go work
on video games,

00:57:02.627 --> 00:57:04.460
mostly because I didn't
know that you could.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.760
One of the games I played
the most growing up actually

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.080
was Madden.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.570
In fact, really football games.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:17.760
Anywhere from Tecmo Bowl on the
original Nintendo Entertainment

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.430
System to Madden on
the Sega Genesis.

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:26.430
I played a lot of NFL
football games growing up.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:32.650
It was actually the
NFL football games

00:57:32.650 --> 00:57:35.000
that I played that got me
interested in the sport

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.630
of football versus the
other way around where

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.410
I was a fan of the sport
so I played the games.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:44.810
It was actually the games as
a junior high, high school

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:47.800
student that I really enjoyed
playing those football

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.820
games the most and enjoyed
beating my friends at them

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.810
if I could.

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:56.080
And so when I got contacted
by the recruiter where

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.240
I'm going to go
work at Lockheed,

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.410
hey, come work on
the next generation

00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:03.395
of interactive entertainment,
make a football simulator,

00:58:03.395 --> 00:58:06.220
I was like, well,
that would be great.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:09.270
I used to love
playing those games

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:13.300
and was really excited about
coming down and getting

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.235
to work on some of
the games that I loved

00:58:15.235 --> 00:58:16.360
playing when I was younger.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.790
Anything else?

00:58:26.427 --> 00:58:29.760
AUDIENCE: Do know of SB Nation's
"Breaking Madden" series?

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:33.720
And if so, do you have
any opinions on that?

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.323
They deliberately set the game
up with extreme characters,

00:58:38.323 --> 00:58:41.221
like 90% skill everything
and 0% skill everything.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.250
TIMOTHY COWAN: I did actually.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:48.350
I think it was probably about
two weeks ago I watched that.

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.362
So I do know what
you're talking about.

00:58:50.362 --> 00:58:51.820
My opinion, I think
that's awesome.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.100
Madden and EA
Sports, at its core,

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:00.330
is all about
authenticity and realism.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.710
EA Sports, it's in the game.

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:05.890
And we're pretty serious about
that authenticity, realism,

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:08.790
almost to the point
that, it's just

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:10.930
me talking as a
gamer, where we tend

00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:13.550
to be a little too serious.

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.390
And I kind of like
that kind of stuff

00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:17.680
where it's more just
having fun with the game,

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.780
which is what it's all about.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:24.670
And giving, I think, the
content creation tools

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:26.840
in the hands of the
gamers, where you're

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.880
starting to see
a lot more gamers

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.180
love to create just as
much as they love to play.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.890
And giving them the flexibility
that they can go in do,

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:37.560
it's an open sandbox,
do whatever you want.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:40.360
We've maybe put a few
walls and barriers around.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.170
But I would love to be
able to put into Madden,

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:46.590
hey, let's tweak the gravity.

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:49.960
Let's really change
up the physics.

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:53.840
Now, the core of madness is
about authenticity in realism.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.900
So there's certain things
that we're not going

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.530
to deviate from that core.

00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:59.730
But what little
flexibility we can

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:03.080
put in where you can break
Madden and have a little fun.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.090
Because ultimately it's games.

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:08.680
You want to have fun and
that's what you want to do.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.560
Personally I love
to see that we've

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.542
got that support in there.

01:00:14.542 --> 01:00:19.490
And that's where the tiny
titan that slipped through.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:21.300
That wasn't intentional.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:24.560
I think we later just sort
of having fun and laughing

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.310
at ourselves we went ahead
released a ultimate team card

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:33.560
pack that allowed you to unlock
that as an intentional bug.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:37.480
But the original case, it was
actually another one of those

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:43.380
we make a change and in our
excitement about getting that

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:46.395
change out to our
gamers, we move fast,

01:00:46.395 --> 01:00:48.520
maybe don't have all the
processes in place that we

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:49.590
should've.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:53.650
Someone does some rough testing,
looks good, push it out,

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.740
and something slips through.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.330
But it's a big game.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:02.487
When you start talking
about that program testing

01:01:02.487 --> 01:01:04.070
and verification and
validation, there

01:01:04.070 --> 01:01:06.281
are so many different
permutations

01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:07.280
that have to be covered.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.010
So many different modes.

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:14.040
It's not infinite, but it's
a very large finite number.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.480
And it's almost impossible
to test everything,

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.990
which is why we're
trying to start

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:21.900
to get to a lot more
rigor in our testing

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.700
and how we measure and verify
that everything is on track.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.300
Let's go ahead and take a break.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.380
And I think, like I said, if you
have a question that you just

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.760
want to ask individually,
I'll be here

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.770
to talk a little bit longer.

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:40.669
So thank you.

01:01:40.669 --> 01:01:43.483
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.310
PROFESSOR: So the
clock says 2:08.

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:50.722
Back in this room at 2:18.

01:01:50.722 --> 01:01:52.680
We're going to give you
time to start planning.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.500
You're going to run two tests.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.930
And then you're going to
have a little bit of time

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.569
to reflect on your test
and just a really quick

01:01:59.569 --> 01:02:00.860
tell us what you learned today.

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:08.690
OK, it's 2:18 or thereabouts.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.080
Schedule for today is
you've got about 15 minutes

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.330
to do planning.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:17.320
That means you should
know what observations

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.520
you're going to make when
you're doing these tests.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.420
If you're going to do questions,
either creating a quick survey

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:27.900
or having questions you're
going to ask your testers.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.545
Just like we asked
for last time.

01:02:30.545 --> 01:02:32.670
You're going to spend 30
minutes doing a play test.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.044
That means you're
going to set up

01:02:34.044 --> 01:02:39.990
at least three computers
with three observers

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.890
to run those tests.

01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:45.100
At 3:05 I'm going
to say, hey, switch.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.280
That means anybody who's
doing an observation

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.030
is switching with the people
who are doing testing.

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.740
Everyone should have a chance
to both observe and play

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:58.074
at least three or four games.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.490
That lasts for
another 30 minutes.

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.470
At 3:35, you're going
to time in teams

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.199
to complete your
focus test reports.

01:03:04.199 --> 01:03:05.990
And then we'll just
ask you a few questions

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:09.560
about what you observed, but
no formal presentation today.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.411
We just want to kind of
know what you saw today.

01:03:12.411 --> 01:03:12.910
Questions?

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.700
All right.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.240
So I'm going to yell at
2:35 to have your play

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.510
tests ready to start by 2:35.
