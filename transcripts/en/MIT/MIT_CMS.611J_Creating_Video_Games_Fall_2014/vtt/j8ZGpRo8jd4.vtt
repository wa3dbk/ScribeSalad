00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.440
SARA VERILLI: OK.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.507
So I get to do the introduction
spiel for today's class.

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm going to start by
just saying what we're

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.870
doing in class
today, so you've got

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.260
sort of a framework of what
we're doing, because we're

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.450
doing a whole lot of things.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.408
And we're going to be
jumping between speakers,

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:40.160
and workshops, and
lectures, and in class work.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.750
So we actually
have a lot of stuff

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.208
to try and get
through today to get

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.290
you guys started on Project 1.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.119
So we're going to
introduce Project 1.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:50.910
And that's actually
what my brief lecture's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.340
going to be after I get
done with the class spiel.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.949
We're going to hear lectures
on how to do brainstorming.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.490
And then we'll ask
you to brainstorm.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.060
We're going to do
lectures on prototyping.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.740
And then I'm going to give
a more pointed lecture

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.870
on what we mean by
low-fidelity prototype, which

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.920
is what Project 1 calls for.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.770
And we are going to
do all those bits

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.260
of in-class work, hopefully,
scattered along the way.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.210
OK.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.014
So moving on to introducing
Project 1, so that you've got--

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:21.180
and the reason we're
introducing Project 1 before we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.888
give the supporting
lectures is so you've

00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:24.140
got something to frame.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.090
You're going to be hearing
lectures about prototyping

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.650
and brainstorming, which we
want you to do in Project 1.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.305
We want you to be
thinking about the project

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:34.680
as we give you the lecture,
so you can try and figure out

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.540
how you're going to be applying
that information to the thing

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.850
we're going to be asking
you to be doing, OK?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.480
So the overall goal is-- and
I have to actually stand back

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.730
so I can either see my notes,
or I can see the slides.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.390
But I can't see both--
to demonstrate a working

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.240
mechanic via a low-fidelity
paper prototype,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.590
to service the prototype
for a digital game

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.850
while tracking and understanding
how your game design changes

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.590
over time.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.614
Any words there you
didn't understand?

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.030
Because we've got
a lot of jargon,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.156
actually, up there, a lot of
game design jargon up there.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.381
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.617
AUDIENCE: What is
actually a mechanic?

00:02:10.617 --> 00:02:11.700
SARA VERRILLI: A mechanic?

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.980
That's actually a
really good question.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.210
A mechanic is
usually a key chunk

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.860
of a game by which
the player takes

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.030
actions in the game or
the game takes actions.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.530
So if you're playing like a
basic platforming digital game,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.772
one of your basic mechanics
is your character can jump.

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:32.480
And that's what your
character often uses

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.940
to solve a lot of problems.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.820
A very common mechanic
in games is shooting.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.290
So a mechanic is basically
an in-game action.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.102
It's a game design
term for that.

00:02:44.102 --> 00:02:44.935
Any other questions?

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.060
OK then.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.650
So we're hoping that
this project will

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.596
teach you to do
prototyping, which

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:57.220
is a skill we will hope you will
use again in Projects 3 and 4,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.506
and we expect you to.

00:02:58.506 --> 00:02:59.880
And we're also
going to introduce

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.080
our very first project
management tool, which

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.860
is the design change log, which
is, hopefully, a reasonably

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.680
quick and concise way to record
the changes your team makes

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.760
to your design as your design
evolves and helps you keep

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.400
a group memory of
what you've done,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.710
so you don't end up doing
the same things again.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.649
But that's not actually
all we're hoping to do.

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:22.940
That's just the official goals.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.830
We're also using it to
give you a small group

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.640
experience working in teams
on a creative project.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.610
This is the first
and last time you'll

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.320
be in nice, small, tight
teams of three people.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.100
Project 2, we boost you all
the way up to six people.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.440
And by the end, we're going
to be in eight-person teams.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.180
And you're going to get to
see just how more complex

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.790
it gets working with
bigger and bigger groups.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.000
But we're going to start you
small for your first project,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.032
so you get a chance to
learn how to communicate.

00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:52.490
We're going to
teach brainstorming.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.830
We're going to expect you to
brainstorm again for Projects 3

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.050
and 4, although we're not going
to formally tell you where

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.310
to do it or when to do it.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.810
We're just going
to expect you, when

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.891
you form your groups, to
start going over ideas

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.140
to use the techniques we've
taught you in this project

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.009
to do that on your own.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:07.550
We're also going to
teach you-- and I

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.200
think the most important
thing here is-- working fast.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.010
You've got one week
to do this project.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.250
The final version and your
project reports on this

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.986
are due next Monday.

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:21.610
You're going to get
some time in class.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.725
But unfortunately,
we have a lot to say,

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.000
to teach you everything you
want to do in this class.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.050
So you're not going
to get all of class.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.280
You're going to get a
small portion of class

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.530
Monday and Wednesday.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.060
And we're going to expect you
to be able to play something

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.940
on Wednesday in class.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.820
Or hopefully, you'll
be running play tests.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.370
We expect you to have
something working.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.650
So you're going to have
to learn how to work fast.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.560
How do you get those ideas
out of your head, onto paper,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.450
and usable quickly?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.510
And finally, the prototypes
you're using here

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.551
are going to move on to Project
2, probably about half of them.

00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.300
Your team sizes are
going to be shrinking,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.600
so we'll be doing fewer of them.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.820
We, the instructors,
are going to take a look

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.850
at the prototypes
as they come in,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.400
both during the
presentations and

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.179
during the playable
playtesting sessions.

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:06.220
And we're going to decide
which of those projects

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.340
we think really do
have the potential

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.770
to go on to be Project 2.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.070
If your prototype
isn't chosen to go on,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.220
that doesn't mean it's
not a good prototype.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.790
We may choose to exclude
things because we think

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.080
the scope is too big
for a two-week project,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.960
we think it's a
little too complicated

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.750
to try and
communicate the ideas.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.210
We may also think that there
are other projects that sort of

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.460
nailed the requirements better.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.977
So your prototype hasn't
failed if it doesn't move on,

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:42.060
it's just that there were
other ones that we think

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.420
fit all the constraints better.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.710
And all the prototypes
are important to do.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.310
All right.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.750
So that's that.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.850
OK.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.570
So the breakdown of the
project is, today, we'll

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.810
be forming teams,
doing brainstorming,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.790
and getting started
working on things.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.810
We will do the first
formal playtesting

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.380
session on Wednesday, Monday,
everything gets turned in,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.690
and including your change
log and a presentation.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.590
The vision document, we
will be making in class.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.860
So don't worry about
that, because we'll

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.720
be explaining what
a vision document is

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.160
and how you make one in class.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.240
So don't worry too much about
that particular requirement.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.520
The presentation,
the one-minute pitch,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.230
will be one of the things that
helps sell your classmates

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.480
on joining your team and
will be one of the things

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.980
that we use to
decide whether or not

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.190
we think you guys have
a good enough core

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.840
idea and enough core excitement
to move that prototype forward.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.544
So it's actually
pretty important.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.210
And remember, it needs
to be one minute.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.270
We're going to have like
10 groups up pitching,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.730
so it's going to
have to be fast.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.250
Finally, design change
logs, which some of you

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.460
may never have heard about.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.140
Whoa.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.010
Oh, no.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.944
My slide, it isn't there.

00:07:11.944 --> 00:07:12.610
PHILLIP TAN: Oh.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.026
Because that
screen's [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:15.990
SARA VERRILLI: Because
this one isn't-- aha.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.850
Oh, boy.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.422
PHILLIP TAN: Let me
restart this presentation.

00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:22.880
SARA VERRILLI: So
who here has used

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.120
a design change log before?

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.900
Because if you've taken
608, I know you have.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.400
All right.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.580
So those are your experts.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.970
If you have one of those
people on your team,

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.845
you're in good shape.

00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:32.900
Talk to them.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.130
But essentially, what
a design change log is,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.720
it's actually really simple.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.360
It's a table, three columns.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.720
You've got a date.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.740
You've got some action
you made on your design

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.448
to change it in some
way, and then you've

00:07:46.448 --> 00:07:48.137
got the reason why
you made the change.

00:07:48.137 --> 00:07:49.970
And every time you make
a significant change

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.620
to your project, and/or every
day you work on your project,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.474
you make another entry so
that your team and the people

00:07:59.474 --> 00:08:01.640
working on it and the people
looking at your project

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.040
to see where it is now can see
why you made the decisions you

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.970
made and what
decisions you made,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.320
what features you dropped,
what features you added,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.950
what problems you
were trying to solve

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.650
when you made those changes.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.150
Yeah.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.660
I was probably-- anyway.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.320
So that is, in fact,
a design change log.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.070
There's an example of one at
the bottom of the Problem 1

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:29.490
handout of the-- there's an
example of one at the Project 1

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.470
handout, so you can
see an example there.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.470
Are there any questions?

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.059
Hearing no takers, I
hand you over to Phillip

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:41.950
for brainstorming.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.616
PHILLIP TAN: OK.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.730
All right, let's talk
about brainstorming.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.460
How many of you have done
brainstorming in any class?

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.130
High school?

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.034
Before high school?

00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:54.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:55.400
PHILLIP TAN: Wow.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:55.640
OK.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:55.950
All right.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:56.450
OK.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.920
So it's a term that gets
bandied around a lot.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.320
Let me see.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.500
Awesome.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.120
However, there is a
problem with brainstorming.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.030
And a lot of people
have practiced it

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.490
without actually knowing
why certain things are

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.760
done in a certain way
and, as a result of that,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.010
may actually be
doing it incorrectly.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.650
We have an excerpt
of an article--

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.160
I'm sorry-- a chapter
from a book called,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.762
Applied Imagination, which
is written by Alex Osborn.

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:26.220
This is a guy who
actually came out

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.960
with the term brainstorming
and the practice of it.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.560
He worked in advertising.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.200
And he has lamented
since he wrote that book

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.685
that a lot of
people kind of liked

00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:40.060
the output of brainstorming,
but didn't really understand

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.450
the practice of it.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.290
So I'm going to try to
start from first principles

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.100
so that you understand
why brainstorming is

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.130
and how it's supposed
to be working.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.870
And hopefully, you can sort
of get the benefits of it,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:57.420
without maybe, say,
overstating its power.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.740
Now, the main reason why we're
doing brainstorming in groups--

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.369
you will hear people out there
in the game industry saying

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:05.160
that brainstorming's
not necessarily always

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.940
the best way to be able to come
up with an idea for a game.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.630
However, in this
class in particular

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.830
and in a lot of video game
design outside of this class,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.450
game design is coordinated,
creative collaboration

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.620
involving different
skilled workers.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.980
And if this is going to
be the first time you're

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.790
going to work with
a team, you need

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.130
to understand who are the people
who you might be working with.

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.660
Brainstorming, if nothing else,
can be a really, really good

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.850
way to just be able to get a
sense of who it is that you're

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.960
going to be working with.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.484
And when we start
forming up teams,

00:10:36.484 --> 00:10:37.900
you're not going
to necessarily be

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.440
able to choose who you're
brainstorming with.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.620
So you want to be able to get
a quick read of their ideas

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.850
and what their interests
are and maybe decide,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.700
hey, this is a person I'm going
to do Project 1 with later on.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.180
However, there are very
strong social pressures

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:58.490
of being imaginative in a
collaborative environment,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.560
especially here in MIT.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.760
There's a lot of pressure
to hold back your ideas

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.990
or maybe not say what's
coming to your mind

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.794
because you think
that's kind of dumb,

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.960
but other people are going
to think that I'm stupid,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.986
or anything like that.

00:11:12.986 --> 00:11:14.610
And brainstorming
has certain practices

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.700
to be able to get you past that.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.800
So there are four
principles of brainstorming.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.610
The [INAUDIBLE]
just do this thing.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.740
This was the four principles
laid out by Alex Osbourne.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.570
And he was Advertising Manager
at BBDO, which is a very, very

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.990
large advertising agency.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.860
And there are certain
similarities at marketing

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.190
and video game design, right?

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.680
You can produce ads, you
can produce marketing,

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.450
you can produce games,
without necessarily saying,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.440
yes, we solved the problem.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.030
There's a lot of
different solutions

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.570
for exactly the same problem.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.180
And advertising is trying to
get people to pay attention

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.570
to the ad, and maybe
you'll buy stuff.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.365
In video games, it's
trying to create

00:11:56.365 --> 00:11:59.820
an entertaining experience
for somebody else.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.910
Millions of ways to be
able to accomplish that.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.790
So we're not looking for
like, here's a engineering

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.530
solution to a engineering
problem where it does,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.747
you know, if the
thing doesn't explode,

00:12:09.747 --> 00:12:11.080
you know you've done a good job.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.110
That's sort of like a very easy
metric to be able to measure

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.010
success.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.030
For games, for
advertising, not so easy.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.864
So here's the first
principle, no criticism.

00:12:21.864 --> 00:12:24.030
How many of you have been
in a brainstorming session

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.100
where you said your idea,
and then somebody said, oh.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.710
Yeah, OK.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.210
All right.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.230
I see some hands go up.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.730
All right.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.240
OK.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.630
So this is the
most important rule

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.100
of a brainstorming session.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.810
If you do not
stick to this rule,

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.800
if everybody around the group
doesn't stick to this rule,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.590
you can ruin the entire session.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.560
The whole session can
just become worthless.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.780
You can give positive feedback
that says, thanks for the idea.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.440
Just simply writing it down
is positive feedback of we've

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.260
received your idea.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.110
But you want to hold back on
adverse judgment or any kind

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.340
of negative reinforcement.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.420
You can share that after
the brainstorm session.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.350
You just don't want to do that
during a brainstorm session,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:11.430
because it inhibits the
process of creating new ideas.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.170
Again, that's sort of
like professional shame,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.760
especially in a place like
MIT, but also if you go out

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.510
into the corporate
world, this idea of you

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.790
don't want to look bad.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.250
And then you can't
have that in your head

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.540
to have a proper
brainstorming session.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.201
If you're worried about how your
ideas are going to be taken,

00:13:28.201 --> 00:13:30.450
then you're not actually
generating ideas at the speed

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.140
that you need to be.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.180
So you need to be able to
let your entire group know

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.640
that we now have total freedom
to explore all territories.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.087
Whatever idea you generate,
we're going to write down.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.670
And then we'll figure out which
are the good ideas after we've

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.250
generated all of these ideas.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.170
Secondly, you kind of
want to be freewheeling.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.350
Typically, the crazier
the idea, the better.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.400
It's easier to be able
to tame down a crazy idea

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400
than to take a fairly
unambitious idea

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.900
and scale it up.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.250
So typically, you will
get your best ideas

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:10.980
from some sort of pipe
dream or blue moon

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.800
idea, something
that's out of scope,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.040
something that's unfeasible.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.780
And then you sort
of scale it down

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.680
into the thing that
is actually feasible.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.710
So go ahead and
shoot for the moon.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.770
Shoot for the game
that you can't possibly

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.960
develop in the next week or
in the next couple of weeks.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.190
And then, after the
brainstorming session,

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.420
figure out how you're
going to pare down

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.880
that idea into something
that you can do in a week

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.400
or in two weeks.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.850
Now you can expand
on simple ideas.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.680
And I'll talk a little bit about
some strategies on doing that.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.180
But usually, reworking a
wild idea to become feasible,

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.390
there's usually a
nugget there that's

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:52.425
a lot easier to identify
when you start big

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:55.122
and then shrink down.

00:14:55.122 --> 00:14:56.080
What are you going for?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.530
You're trying to come up with
as many ideas as possible.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.650
Quantity.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.160
The greater number of
ideas, the more likelihood

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.890
that some of those ideas are
actually going to be useful.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.840
You're not actually
trying to solve

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.280
the problem in brainstorming.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.340
Say, if the problem that
we're asking you to solve

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.000
is create something
playable in a week,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.980
we're not asking you
to solve that problem

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:20.420
during the brainstorm session.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.320
That comes after the
brainstorm session.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.986
That comes with things
like prototyping,

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.660
which we'll get to later today.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.080
Now, that's a simple
metric that you

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.480
can use to gauge the success
of a brainstorm session,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.570
how many ideas that you
generate, at what pace

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.430
are you generating them at.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.740
Again, that's why you don't
want to be judging ideas

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.500
while they're being generated.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.310
All ideas should be included.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:43.650
Nothing is excluded.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.054
And you're going to
need to reinforce that

00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:48.470
within the group of people
that you're brainstorming with.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.178
There's somebody who's
actually got a job

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:53.030
to specifically do that, but
you've got to help with that.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.490
And you can build on ideas.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:03.090
You can refer back to ideas that
have already been mentioned.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.100
Take the notes off,
and then combine them

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.850
with your own idea, even
if ideas that other people

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.070
have come up with, to be able
to come up with something

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:15.211
synthetically more complex.

00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:16.710
Great ideas are
often generated when

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.220
disparate ideas are
combined, LEGO plus Star Wars

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.000
equals LEGO Star Wars.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.790
Which is awesome, you know?

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.040
Marvel plus Capcom,
Marvel vs. Capcom.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.390
OK, great ideas there.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.117
And often, that's actually where
a lot of your really good ideas

00:16:34.117 --> 00:16:35.700
are going to come
from, because you're

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.210
going to come up with a whole
bunch of really mundane things

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.140
that basically refer back
to games that you've already

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.780
played or ideas
that a lot of people

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.450
have encountered, but maybe
not encountered together

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.860
in the same context.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.580
So this is how you're
going to do it.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.360
You're going to start
off with a really,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.710
really-- try to create
a little casual spirit.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.250
This is not like a really
straight laced, formal affair.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.819
Start with giving your
worst idea, the worst

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:10.160
idea that you can possibly think
of, the most useless, terrible.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.680
If you have to do
offensive, sure,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.660
but usually there's just an
idea that you know is dumb.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.220
Just tell people that.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.950
Everyone put it down.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.660
Write it down.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.140
While someone is speaking,
don't interrupt them.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.765
But do designate a
facilitator at the beginning

00:17:25.765 --> 00:17:26.390
of the session.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.599
And it's going to
be that person's job

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.840
to keep things moving.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.750
So you don't really
need to explain

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.677
so much, because again,
you're not trying

00:17:33.677 --> 00:17:34.760
to solve the problem here.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.968
You're just trying to be
able to get enough ideas out

00:17:36.968 --> 00:17:39.630
so that whoever's performing
the role of the secretary

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:40.380
can write it down.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.900
And again, before you
start the entire session,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.325
make sure everybody
understands this process.

00:17:49.325 --> 00:17:51.450
If there's somebody who
walked in late in the class

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.241
or something and is
just joining your team,

00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:56.130
make sure they understand all
of these rules, these four rules

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.240
that I went through.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.200
And write down everything.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.200
Now, don't just write down
the title of the idea--

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.472
turtle tower defense,
I don't know--

00:18:10.472 --> 00:18:12.180
those are three easy
words to write down,

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.544
but it might be difficult
for you to then remember

00:18:14.544 --> 00:18:15.960
exactly what that
idea-- were they

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.060
like anthropomorphic turtles?

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.470
Are the turtles the towers?

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.030
Are the turtles
marching into towers?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.740
You know, it's like,
what was that again?

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:25.910
Let whoever is taking down
notes take a little bit

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.270
more information, maybe
like a line of information,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.420
just so that, when you
come back to that idea,

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.470
you don't look at a title
as, that looks like a--

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.710
what was that idea again?

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.480
Does anybody remember
what his idea was?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.850
Just take the time to be
able to write things down.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.430
Now, this is more general.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.280
Today, we're asking
you very specifically

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.310
to brainstorm about
the game that you're

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.890
going to be prototyping
for Project 1.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.960
But in general, you
can apply brainstorming

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.040
to a bunch of
different ideas, even

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.810
in the middle of a
project, Project 1 or later

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.530
or to other domains.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.040
But it's very, very
important to be

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.220
able to know what
kinds of problems

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.428
are good for brainstorming
and what kinds of problems

00:19:07.428 --> 00:19:09.580
are terrible for brainstorming.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.190
You need to be able
to find a problem that

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.810
is very clearly defined.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.606
The problem should be simple.

00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:18.480
If you've got a problem
that's really, really

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:25.280
complex with lots of very
different opposing factors

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.490
that you have to be taking into
account, optimize, something,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.240
you can either try to divide
those complex problems

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.160
into subdivisions where each
one of those subdivisions

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.812
could have a separate
answer, or you

00:19:38.812 --> 00:19:41.020
could try to use a different
problem solving strategy

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.510
entirely.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.968
You don't necessarily
need to apply

00:19:42.968 --> 00:19:44.170
brainstorming to everything.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.485
You should be able to articulate
the problem simply and clearly.

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:50.360
But just because I can
articulate the problem

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.160
doesn't necessarily
mean that it's

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.080
appropriate for brainstorming.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.660
Osborn, for instance, gives
you an example of get married.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.570
That's your problem.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.070
All right.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.260
OK.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.801
And then you're
trying to solve that.

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:05.120
Brainstorming's a really
terrible technique for that.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.170
Here are all the ways
that you can get married.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.336
It's like that doesn't help.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.750
Maybe that doesn't identify
the problem in the first place.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.800
It's is a complex problem
that's a little bit too large.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.790
What's your game
going to be about?

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.940
Or what is your player
going to do 80% of the time?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:27.010
What's the one action
that your player

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.490
is going to do 80% of the time.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.470
Where is our game set?

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.570
Who is our main character?

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.050
These are sort of
well-articulated problems

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.110
that brainstorming
does work for.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.600
Now, responsibilities.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.280
Again, I said designate
someone to be a facilitator.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.450
And this person's job
is to basically keep

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:49.990
this whole session moving.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.120
We don't like to use
the word "leader,"

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.341
because their job is not to be
the head of the brainstorming

00:20:56.341 --> 00:20:56.840
session.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.290
Your job is to facilitate it,
is to be the clerical equivalent

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:07.950
of moving the process along.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.740
So you need to
understand the problem

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.100
and then make sure that
everybody around the brainstorm

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.136
group also understands
this problem.

00:21:17.136 --> 00:21:19.510
And then, when the session
actually goes, every time, you

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:21.932
sort of sense that there's
some criticism coming out,

00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:24.265
and you say, all right, we'll
put that aside and move on

00:21:24.265 --> 00:21:25.240
to the next idea.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.210
Try to defuse any criticism
when you see it coming.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.470
And encourage people who
aren't speaking up to speak up.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:36.740
Just simply, it's like
what's on your mind?

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.180
Or you'll call
out someone's name

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:42.920
and just say, any of these
things give you any ideas?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.720
Try to sort of call
out those people who

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.096
aren't already
very much involved

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:48.220
in the process to try to
get them into the process.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.170
Because the more people
riff off each other,

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.300
the more ideas you're going
to be able to generate.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.050
Encourage people to
join ideas together.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:56.716
Sometimes, you'll
just do that yourself,

00:21:56.716 --> 00:21:58.310
just like look at
two random things

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.347
that you wrote down and just
try to slam them together,

00:22:01.347 --> 00:22:02.680
just to get the process started.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.900
And maybe other people will
do more logical compositions.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.240
Make sure that no voices
are lost in this process.

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:14.400
It's not the facilitator's
job, by the way,

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.380
to identify what's the
best solution on the board

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.760
or on the computer when you're
taking down these ideas.

00:22:23.416 --> 00:22:26.180
That may not actually be the
job of brainstorming at all.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.710
That's actually a
problem that you

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.050
come to later when you see
the whole pile of ideas

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:30.910
that you generated.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.440
And now, you figure
out what it is

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.700
that you're going to
choose for, say, Project 1.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.750
Now, there's a second
person who's involved.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.440
This is the person who either
has a giant Post-it pad,

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.240
or a chalkboard, or a
computer usually connected

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.840
to a projector.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.930
And that person is the
secretary whose basic job

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.980
is to record every
single idea in a way

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.290
that everybody around the group
can actually see those ideas.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.710
You don't want to just work
on your own personal laptop,

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.709
on your own screen where
no one else can see it,

00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:02.266
because then other
people can't, say,

00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:04.140
look at ideas that have
been mentioned before

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.099
and combine them.

00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:07.390
So make sure that you're
writing things up on somewhere

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:08.348
where everyone can see.

00:23:08.348 --> 00:23:12.150
We've got some giant
Post-it pads right here.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.430
And you can grab them.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.370
And we've got some markers.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.880
Stick them up on the
wall and write on them.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:23.410
So you want to
try to just report

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.670
on what people are saying.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.330
Don't try to be
editorial about it.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.060
Don't say, good idea, bad idea.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.365
That's your job either.

00:23:31.365 --> 00:23:32.990
You do want to keep
an eye on the time,

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.360
especially because we're
doing this in class and time

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.310
will run out.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.640
So make sure that you
actually have enough time

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.120
to get down the to those
last couple of ideas

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.120
before we go into our next
part of our class, which

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.920
I think is prototyping.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.760
The secretary can participate
in a brainstorming.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.680
It's sometimes a
little bit tough.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.370
It's tough to write
down and listen

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.030
to what other people
are saying while trying

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.640
to generate your own ideas.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.180
So what you might want to do
is split up your brainstorming

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.680
session into,
basically, two halves.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.804
How much time are we giving
them for brainstorming?

00:24:06.804 --> 00:24:07.780
PROFESSOR: 30.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:08.840
PHILLIP TAN: 30 minutes?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.090
So split it into like
two 15-minute chunks.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.200
And either the facilitator
and the secretary

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.787
can switch, or just
get two other people

00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:18.120
to be secretary and facilitator.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.760
So the people who were
facilitator and secretary

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.285
can sit down and have the space
to generate their own ideas

00:24:24.285 --> 00:24:26.160
while someone else is
taking notes and making

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.390
sure the process is running.

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.569
So that's what we're
asking you to do.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:31.985
Any questions about
brainstorming?

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.958
Or anything else I've said?

00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:37.930
Yep?

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.800
AUDIENCE: Is there a limit
or a minimum number of ideas

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800
we have to come up with?

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.241
PHILLIP TAN: Is there
a minimum of ideas?

00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:45.740
No.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.390
In fact, that's probably
counterproductive.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.081
Don't say, oh, we have to hit
a least 30, no-- it's 30 ideas

00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:57.330
and we're done-- because
that implies that once you're

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.950
over 30, you can stop.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.946
You don't want to stop.

00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:01.320
You want to keep
generating ideas

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.730
until you run out of time.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.440
And if it takes you 30 minutes
to come up with two ideas,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.940
that's fine.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.690
That's the group.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.320
That's what your group
was able to come up with.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.040
Generally, you want
to be generating

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:20.282
like a lot, several dozen
ideas in a 30-minute session.

00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:21.740
SARA VERRILLI: I'm
going to ask you

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.340
to form groups of six people.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.970
Grab the people who
are nearest you.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.230
These groups of six are
going to like-- do us

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.490
a favor and everybody stand up.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.370
As you form groups, sit down.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.070
You've got three
minutes to form groups.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:51.700
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.360
PHILLIP TAN: So we just finished
the brainstorming session,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.216
and I'd like to get some
people's impression about what

00:25:57.216 --> 00:25:57.715
worked.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.622
Do you need some
time to get started?

00:26:03.622 --> 00:26:05.080
Were people kind
of feeling it went

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.320
a little slowly at the beginning
and then picked up or died off

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.025
halfway?

00:26:10.025 --> 00:26:10.900
Tell me some results.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:11.400
Yeah?

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.163
AUDIENCE: I think it's
like the sessions were

00:26:14.163 --> 00:26:17.394
like, instead of two-minute,
three-minute sessions,

00:26:17.394 --> 00:26:18.885
they were like even shorter.

00:26:18.885 --> 00:26:21.469
And like broken up into kind
of a mini theme [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:21.469 --> 00:26:22.135
PHILLIP TAN: OK.

00:26:22.135 --> 00:26:24.264
AUDIENCE: And it felt
like it ran out of steam.

00:26:24.264 --> 00:26:24.930
PHILLIP TAN: OK.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:25.540
All right.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.182
So sort of like
breaking up even further

00:26:28.182 --> 00:26:29.390
into smaller chunks and that.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.440
OK.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:29.980
Sure.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.800
That's a good idea.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.797
How about the note-taker as
a facilitator [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:35.797 --> 00:26:38.088
AUDIENCE: I think starting
with words and themes helped

00:26:38.088 --> 00:26:40.360
us get just basic concepts
out there and then sort

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.610
of applying them, rather
than jumping into game ideas.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:42.930
PHILLIP TAN: Right.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.430
And one of the
reasons why we did

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.410
that will also give you an idea
of what's a theme versus whats

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:48.300
a mechanic, right?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.258
Yeah.

00:26:49.258 --> 00:26:51.590
AUDIENCE: It gets hard to
avoid the scenario of someone

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.090
writing an idea,
and then everyone's

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.048
like, oh, that's cool.

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:56.443
Let's talk more
about that thing,

00:26:56.443 --> 00:26:58.850
instead of just throwing out
completely different ideas.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:59.641
PHILLIP TAN: Right.

00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:01.775
Oh, so switching to a
different idea, right?

00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:04.317
Oh, you know, that's
not necessarily

00:27:04.317 --> 00:27:05.650
a failure of the process either.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:06.110
But you're right.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.380
You're trying to
generate quantity.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.060
And instead, people
trying to improve

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.620
the quality of the idea.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:18.740
So yeah, but still that's a
happy problem to have, right?

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.900
It is a good point.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.900
Yeah.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.570
AUDIENCE: I think, for our
team, jokes helped us a lot.

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.320
PHILLIP TAN: Sure.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.195
AUDIENCE: Our first
situation was more tense.

00:27:27.195 --> 00:27:29.780
And then, after one
or two specific ideas,

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.666
everyone became more casual
in saying more ideas.

00:27:33.666 --> 00:27:36.290
PHILLIP TAN: And that's why the
throwing out the bad ideas part

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.020
helps as well.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:42.770
It helps you get into that
mood of we can be silly now.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:47.470
Something that might help with
the switching gears problem is

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:53.910
the act of writing it down, to
begin with, of course, sort of

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.440
says the idea is on record.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.360
And you can always say,
let's get back to that later,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.509
because you will get
back to it later anyway.

00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:05.300
And there will be time
for that discussion.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.180
It doesn't always work,
but it's worth a shot.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.990
Cool.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:11.910
OK.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.290
Let's talk a little bit
again about Project 1,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.170
just as a reminder.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.919
There is a theme for
Project 1, and that's

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:19.270
planning for randomness.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.670
You generated a lot of ideas.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:25.769
We didn't really over-emphasize
that constraint right

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:27.560
at the beginning of
the brainstorm session,

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.934
because we wanted
you to generate

00:28:28.934 --> 00:28:30.510
tons and tons of ideas.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.430
But now, you should be looking
at that theme and the ideas

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.620
that you've generated
and figuring out

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.920
which ones of those kind
of match that theme.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.290
Now, that's sort of
your overall constraint,

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.670
over-constraint of what we
want the players to be doing

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.040
is planning for randomness.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.290
But is it in space?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.780
Is it some sort of like
dice rolling mechanic?

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.350
Is it some sort
of race mechanic,

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.830
are just a branching decision
tree or something like that?

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.680
That comes into
themes and mechanics.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.490
So you want to be
identifying that,

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:08.490
as well, as part of Project 1.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.440
So what I'm going to be
asking you right now is that,

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.060
from your
brainstorming group, we

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.710
want you to split
into two groups.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.890
That's your prototyping
group for Project 1.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.470
You only have to work with this
group for one week, you know?

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.750
This is not a
long-term commitment.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.470
And there were eight
brainstorming groups,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.050
so basically, we're
looking for 16 teams.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:33.600
And so we're
encouraging everyone

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.090
to be in groups of three.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.046
Not only does that
mean that we will

00:29:40.046 --> 00:29:41.670
get the right number
of groups, it also

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:44.280
means that if somebody
falls sick in the next week,

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:48.590
your team still has at least
two people to work on it.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.065
So for each group of
three, first of all,

00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:52.940
you figure out who you're
going to work with.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.444
And then you choose one
item from your list, one

00:29:55.444 --> 00:29:57.360
of these ideas from your
list, keeping in mind

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.290
those constraints
that I just mentioned.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.600
And we will be using that idea
for the upcoming prototyping

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.040
workshop, which I
will be leading.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.470
So once you know
what your idea is,

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.040
you know who you're
working with,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.390
I will go into the
prototyping workshop

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.346
to tell you what you do next.

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:15.720
And the goal will
be to then test

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.154
that idea through the
process of prototyping.

00:30:18.154 --> 00:30:20.070
And if it doesn't work,
you are free to choose

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.050
a different theme.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.870
But you still have to
stick with your team.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.370
OK?

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.160
You stick with your team, you
can choose a different theme,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.160
just to be clear.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.755
All right.

00:30:28.755 --> 00:30:29.630
AUDIENCE: 10 minutes?

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.100
PHILLIP TAN: We have 10
minutes to figure out

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.610
who you want to
work with and what

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:38.210
your initial idea that you want
to work with, so go for it.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.455
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:30:42.455 --> 00:30:45.466
And your team was six, right?

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:46.930
Cool.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.695
You used the computer
control, so it

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:51.322
was really voice-activated.

00:30:51.322 --> 00:30:52.358
It just didn't work.

00:30:52.358 --> 00:30:53.274
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:59.662 --> 00:31:01.370
PHILLIP TAN: How many
of you have seen me

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.980
give this presentation before?

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:04.480
OK.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.300
How many of you are
thinking does Phillip

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.510
give his presentation
every class?

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.690
Correctarino.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.592
I do.

00:31:11.592 --> 00:31:14.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.630
So I apologize to everyone
who's seen this presentation.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.600
Maybe there's one or two
little points in here

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.120
that you might not
have seen before.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.090
But for the most
part, it is the same,

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.390
because it is the
fundamental skill

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.740
that we try to teach in every
single game design class,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.647
because it is basically
the first skill that you're

00:31:31.647 --> 00:31:33.230
going to need to be
able to figure out

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.810
whether an idea works.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.480
How many of you have made
prototypes in any field,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.570
say engineering,
software, whatever?

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:45.268
All right, why do
you make a prototype?

00:31:45.268 --> 00:31:47.240
AUDIENCE: Because it's cheaper.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.620
PHILLIP TAN:
Because it's cheaper

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.744
than making the real thing.

00:31:49.744 --> 00:31:50.820
Sure.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.320
I thought I saw
some hands up there.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.530
Yeah?

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.250
AUDIENCE: It's faster than
making the whole thing.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:55.500
PHILLIP TAN: It's faster
than making the whole thing.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.010
Yeah.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.720
But that kind of goes
hand in hand too, right?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.729
Time is money.

00:31:59.729 --> 00:32:02.145
AUDIENCE: Making drastic changes
is a lot cheaper on paper

00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:03.284
than it is the built system.

00:32:03.284 --> 00:32:04.110
PHILLIP TAN: Ah, OK.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:04.610
All right.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:08.832
You can sort figure out what's
broken and then make changes.

00:32:08.832 --> 00:32:10.720
AUDIENCE: It shows
the proof of concept.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.511
PHILLIP TAN: It shows
the proof of concept.

00:32:12.511 --> 00:32:14.867
You can show it to
other people, and not

00:32:14.867 --> 00:32:15.950
just prove it to yourself.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:16.934
Right.

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:19.394
AUDIENCE: It's a lot easier
to experiment and make changes

00:32:19.394 --> 00:32:21.227
that are necessary when
you're not committed

00:32:21.227 --> 00:32:22.850
to something like [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:23.070
PHILLIP TAN: All right.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:24.350
You can try a lot of
different ideas, right?

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:26.510
It's like, I'm not quite
sure which way I want to go,

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.676
so I'm going to try a lot
of different alternatives.

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:31.474
AUDIENCE: It helps you realize,
maybe, your flaws [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:31.474 --> 00:32:33.140
PHILLIP TAN: Catch
the big problems that

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.570
are going to break your design.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.440
Yeah.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.910
AUDIENCE: To move from 2D to 3D?

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.650
PHILLIP TAN: To
move from 2D to 3D?

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.630
You'll make a 2D
prototype, before taking it

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.620
into a more complex design.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.970
All of those are
absolutely true.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.680
You know, just for
the general sense

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.340
of why you want to do a
prototype at all is to get

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.240
feedback from other people.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.320
And you get it early,
you get it cheap.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.370
And of course, we talked
about making changes

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.524
early on in the process.

00:33:02.524 --> 00:33:04.190
Usually, it costs
less money because you

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.000
haven't committed anything.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.870
You haven't invested a whole lot
of resources in something just

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.819
to have to change it again.

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:14.360
If you're not quite sure which
direction you want your design

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.050
to go, you want to be able to
have lots of different ideas

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.890
on the table and actually
see how all of them

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.460
work in one way or another.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.960
We talked about how
easy it is to be

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.190
able to change our ideas
when you're prototyping.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.310
But also, it's easy to
discard a prototype.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:33.590
It's easy to just say,
well, that was a bad idea,

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.010
because you haven't really
spent all that much time on it.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.230
And in many ways,
that's something

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.100
you're going to need to
do in game design a lot.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.100
You're going to pursue
some of these ideas, some

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.260
of these ideas that you've
already been discussing.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.320
And you're going to start
prototyping it today.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.500
And then you're going to say,
well, that was a bad idea

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.666
and shove the whole thing
off the table into a trash

00:33:53.666 --> 00:33:57.430
can somewhere and start afresh,
because you've spent what?

00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:00.230
An hour designing this thing?

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.050
It's not going to be
a whole lot of time.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.610
And then you can learn
from that process

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.710
and build something new.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.730
So that is very
good mindset to be

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.960
able to have in
early iterations,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.880
that this thing
that you're making

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.780
is meant to be informative.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.090
It's meant to teach you
something about this project

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.530
that you're working on, but it's
also meant to be disposable.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.969
It's something that you do
not have to make look good,

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:30.520
or you don't have
to make it last.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.377
You don't have to
make it perfect.

00:34:33.377 --> 00:34:34.960
You are just trying
to learn something

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.170
through the process
of prototyping.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.110
Now, when you're
making games, this

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.909
is what you're
trying to figure out.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.159
You're trying to find the fun.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.870
And we've talked about
games being a series

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.620
of interesting choices.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.310
And when you're prototyping,
what you are trying to do

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.840
is you are trying to identify
what are those few game

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.180
mechanics that are going
to be able to sustain

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.850
the interest of your players
over a significant amount

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.880
of time.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.970
So the nice thing
about prototyping

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.024
when you're, say, trying to
design a computer game using

00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:08.690
paper materials or
something is that you

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.770
have to define those mechanics
down to the very purest form.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.110
So for instance,
I could say, oh,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.780
this is going to be a
game about space aliens.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.440
And you're going to
run around shooting

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.230
different kinds of weapons and
occasionally throwing grenades

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.130
and taking cover.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.940
And you get to fly ships
and drive things around.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.460
But what I can do when I'm
prototyping is that, all right,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.990
I'm going to make a
game where you come out

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.450
and take a few potshots,
go under cover,

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:39.880
wait for your [? shoots ?]
to recharge, throw a grenade,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.490
wait for [? shoots ?]
to recharge,

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.760
come out and take
a few potshots.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.390
That's basically what game?

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.120
AUDIENCE: Halo.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.990
PHILLIP TAN: That's
basically Halo.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.160
That's the thing that you
do every 20 seconds in Halo

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.180
all the time.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.070
And that's really
the thing that you

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.650
have to nail and get
absolutely right.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.120
So when you are
making a prototype,

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:02.160
you can identify, oh,
this core little loop

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.500
is the thing that's interesting.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.400
And if we can
actually get it right

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.904
and tuned perfectly in
[? additional ?] game, then

00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:10.070
we know players are going
to do this over, and over,

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.710
and over again, and
it's gong to feel good.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.340
So you're trying
to find that fun.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.673
So you're going to focus on
the small handful of choices

00:36:16.673 --> 00:36:20.140
that a player must make in
order to play your prototype.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.960
And you model the system
with a few basic rules

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.030
that creates interesting
choices for the player.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.870
Always ask a question
about your game.

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.390
Make sure it's falsifiable.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:35.560
Anyone heard that term,
"falsifiable hypothesis"?

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.052
No?

00:36:37.052 --> 00:36:38.310
Yep.

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.105
What's that mean?

00:36:39.105 --> 00:36:43.542
AUDIENCE: Basically, it
means some kind of opinion

00:36:43.542 --> 00:36:45.350
that can be proven wrong.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.100
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.610
You could say, well,
say the question is

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.270
that we think the players
are going to enjoy making

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.650
these kinds of decisions.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.870
And the answer could
be, no, they don't.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.630
You want that information.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:03.360
It could be something like
this particular design

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.060
is going to save time, right?

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.740
It's going to be less
of a cognitive load.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.040
Or it's going to be easier
for players to understand.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.660
And it should be
that kind of question

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.690
that you ask when you're
making a prototype.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.230
Your prototype should be
able to be designed in a way

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.270
where you can sit someone in
front of it, play through it,

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:26.850
and then tell you yes or no,
was that hypothesis true or not.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:29.240
Now, physical prototyping,
paper prototyping,

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.640
doesn't give you insight
into everything that you

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.642
can achieve in a digital game.

00:37:33.642 --> 00:37:35.600
It doesn't say, for
instance, tell you terribly

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.530
much about the sensory
experience of playing that game

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.440
or how feasible a certain
feature is going to be.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:45.590
So you don't discover everything
through making a prototype,

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.750
but you do get a lot.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:50.350
Now, the other thing that
a few people alluded to

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.080
is the ability
for your prototype

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.170
to communicate to other
people, especially

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.080
other people on your team.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.610
So imagine getting into a
room full of developers.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.940
All of you are game developers.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.990
And you don't know what's in
each other's heads right now.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:12.710
You maybe have come
down to a certain theme.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.040
And all of you have
different versions

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.980
of that game floating
in your head somewhere.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.930
Now, if you want to be able to
explain that to somebody else,

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.200
it can be near to impossible
to communicate that.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.570
You can try doing it verbally.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.580
You can try writing it down.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.630
But all of those
methods don't really

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.130
compare very well to something
you can actually set somebody

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.910
in front and play.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.450
So what you are
trying to do is you're

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.720
trying to give you own
team, to start with,

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.980
something solid to work from.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.030
It may not necessarily be--
it will almost certainly not

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.390
be the idea that
you're going to end up

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.725
implementing in the long run.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:50.100
But you're going to start
creating some sort of framework

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.265
for you to then say,
well, I didn't like that.

00:38:52.265 --> 00:38:53.140
I should change that.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.990
Or I really like that,
and we should try

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.300
to polish that a little bit.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.940
So it's a communication tool.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.720
And any kind of game
design definitely

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.720
benefits tremendously from early
stages of physical prototype,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.810
because it forces you
to think through how

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:14.520
your game is going to work.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.680
Every little detail about how
your rules worked, at least.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.800
Maybe not how your
game looks, maybe not

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.810
what your input mechanism
is, but certainly

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.976
what are the decisions
you're asking for your player

00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:26.740
and what are the consequences
of those decisions.

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.970
You have to define them.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:29.720
You have to write
them down in rules

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.730
that your players, as
well as your design team,

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.410
actually understand.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.140
And then they're
going to try it out.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.514
And you're going
to see all kinds

00:39:37.514 --> 00:39:40.260
of emergent little dynamics
pop up when all of these rules

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.850
are put together that you
didn't anticipate, and could

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.371
be really cool or could
completely break your game.

00:39:45.371 --> 00:39:46.620
And you want to find that out.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.340
I talked about
bringing in testers.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.919
And as we keep
harping on this class,

00:39:54.919 --> 00:39:56.710
and again, every single
class that I teach,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.380
testing's incredibly important.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.130
But the nice thing
about paper prototyping

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:04.450
is that you don't really
need special skills.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.710
You need third grade arts
and crafts skills, really.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.100
Maybe MIT math.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:10.960
Sure.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.070
But actual, we're
talking about using

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:18.060
markers and scissors and
kindergarten counters and dice.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.310
And the nice thing about it
is that, as your team gets

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.530
larger and larger, everyone can
still contribute to the paper

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.100
prototype.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.730
It could be an artist.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.870
It could be a designer, a
producer, a [? quoter, ?]

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:30.780
a QA tester, even someone that
you just brought in for a day

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.210
to play your game,
can all contribute

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.250
to the design of the game,
because it can give you

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.490
feedback of, well, what if,
instead of rolling this dice,

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:40.500
I roll that dice.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.080
Or what if the grid was
a little bit bigger?

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.430
What if my pieces were
a little bit larger

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.100
and took up more
space, for instance?

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.310
A paper prototype itself is not
just interactive in its play,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.970
but is interactive
in the design.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:57.610
You can just open up the
hood of your paper prototype

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.450
and change a rule.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.600
Do not do that when
you're working with code.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.170
In the middle of
a playtest, do not

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.530
change your code, for god sake.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.550
But you can do that with
the paper prototype.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:12.802
And many times, you
might want to do

00:41:12.802 --> 00:41:14.010
that in the middle of a test.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.840
It's like, you're
playing a game.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.140
10 minutes into the game,
it's like, oh, my god,

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.300
this game is hurtling
downhill into a pit.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.560
And you can see it.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.590
And the player sees it.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.230
And you know there's a problem.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:29.003
You can just change
a rule and just say,

00:41:29.003 --> 00:41:32.127
what if we did this
instead, mid-game even,

00:41:32.127 --> 00:41:32.960
and then try it out.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.287
And says, oh, that seemed to
maybe address the problem.

00:41:35.287 --> 00:41:36.870
Then start the game
from the beginning

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.480
and see if it actually did.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.030
But you can do that
with a paper prototype.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.100
Paper prototypes,
in particular, are

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.970
very good at revealing
usability problems.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:52.260
The simple issue of a
player has a decision,

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.420
knows what he or
she wants to do,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.360
and has no idea how to
actually execute that.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.710
It's like, does that mean
I roll first and then move,

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.340
or do I move first and
roll, which piece do I

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.780
move, things like that.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.280
Paper prototypes
are very, very good

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.470
in sort of just
laying that bare.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.760
Your team will see where
those problems are, as soon

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.190
as somebody who's
not part of your team

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.481
sits down and tries to play it.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.120
Let's see.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:25.500
Now, players do tend to
more readily give criticism

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.432
when they see something that's
very clearly incomplete, very

00:42:28.432 --> 00:42:30.390
clearly something that
you're still working on.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.950
And if you've got a
hand-drawn cardboard paper

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.760
prototype in front
of them, they know

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.060
you're right at the
beginning of this project.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.940
They know that they can
tell you something about,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:41.996
I really don't like how
this character looks.

00:42:41.996 --> 00:42:43.120
And it's like, that's fine.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.840
We spent two minutes
drawing that character.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.470
We can completely redo that.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.480
And they'll tell you that, if
it feels like you haven't spent

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.230
a whole lot of time in it.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.600
And that's a useful trick,
by the way, if you are doing,

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.700
say, the digital version
of your games later on.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.070
It can actually be
easier to get feedback

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.340
if you deliberately insert some
things that look incomplete,

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.307
a giant box that says Place
Order right there while you're

00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:12.140
doing your testing,
just to get a little bit

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.024
more feedback from your testers,
so they feel, OK, yes, they're

00:43:16.024 --> 00:43:16.690
working on this.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:19.760
I can tell you that
character looks terrible.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.720
And it's like, we
spent three days on it,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.860
but you don't say that.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.440
You don't say that
in front of them,

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.270
because you want that feedback.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:31.540
But when they give you
feedback, you take everything

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.810
that they're telling you
with a grain of salt,

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.760
because, in the
paper prototype, it's

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.060
very, very easy for
a tester that says,

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.660
I don't like pieces
that are this color.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.010
I want pieces that
are that color.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.330
And it's, OK.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.670
You could just make
the substitution.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.320
But what you should do is you
should think back a little bit

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.230
and try to figure out
why they're giving you

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:54.940
this piece of feedback.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.440
They may have a
personal preference,

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.941
and they think this is the
way how it should be executed.

00:43:58.941 --> 00:44:00.690
But probably what
they're say is that they

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.250
have some sort of actual
problem with your game,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.790
and that's the only solution
that they can think of.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.040
So for instance,
why does this person

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.840
want to change the
color of the pieces

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.980
that they're moving around?

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.670
Is it because they're
having trouble

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.300
telling the pieces apart?

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.820
That may be the real problem.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.902
And the solution may
not be change the pieces

00:44:19.902 --> 00:44:22.110
to a different color, it
may be like change the piece

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:24.470
into a completely
different shape,

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:26.540
stick a little sticker on them.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:30.020
On a computer, it's going to be
different kinds of solutions.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.400
Vet every little
bit of information

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.480
that comes into you.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.390
People can make
suggestions on how

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:37.710
you're going to
change your design,

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.000
but it's up to the team
to actually provide

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.860
some sort of unified
direction on where

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.600
you want the game to go.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.450
So the feedback is valuable.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:48.480
The solutions they're
providing may not

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.840
be the solutions
you want to use.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.266
Any questions so far about
why we're doing prototyping?

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.620
No?

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.890
OK.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.330
We'll have more questions later.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.871
So here are the kinds of tools
that you're going to be using,

00:45:02.871 --> 00:45:06.160
very large sheets of paper.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.080
This is probably the smallest
sheet of paper-- well,

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.730
we're going to be using
index cards as well.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.980
A lot of you have seen this
before in my other classes

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.480
as well.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.550
This is a square grid on one
side, hex squared on another.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.604
For spatial games,
you can use this.

00:45:20.604 --> 00:45:22.270
But sometimes, it's
much better to start

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:23.780
with a blank sheet of paper.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.910
So don't immediately
start designing grid games

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:31.690
just because we happen to
have sheets of gridded paper.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.650
But we do want them to be
large, so that everyone

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.900
around the team can
actually see what you're

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.530
working on at the same time,
as well as the people playing

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.150
the game.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.147
If you're going to be designing
something like an iPad game

00:45:44.147 --> 00:45:46.230
or something like that,
don't use something that's

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.660
literally the size of the iPad.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:49.440
Use something a
little bit larger,

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.160
so that everyone
around the table

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.980
can see what the tester
is doing while they're

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.580
testing your prototype

00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.090
We use index cards for a
lot of different things,

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:02.720
writing down rules.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.350
You can shuffle them and
use them as playing cards.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:09.510
You can record data on them.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.440
They're very disposable, more
accurately, very recyclable.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.670
Please, please recycle
any paper material.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.740
Dice, of course.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.130
They can be tokens.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.600
They can be used to help
keep track of stats.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.910
But something that I've seen
a lot, that students like

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.060
to use a lot, is they
use two 10-sided dice

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:34.270
to keep track of a number
between zero to 99.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.740
That's a really bad idea.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:40.650
One brush of the hand, and
that variable is gone, right?

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:44.820
You can swap the tens and
the ones really easily.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.470
It's like, was that 91 or 19?

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.130
I can't remember.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:50.000
So if you want to
record variables,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.815
just gram an index card and
just write down the variable.

00:46:51.815 --> 00:46:53.540
And then, whenever
the variable changes,

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.420
cross it out right
in your variable.

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.760
It's much better for
you to use a dice either

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.930
as actual randomizers, or
you can use them sometimes

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:07.630
as tokens that move
around on the board.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.190
Let's see.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:11.070
What else?

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.800
Game bits, pieces
from other games

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:18.400
are wonderful, but sometimes
a little irritating because,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.960
if you took them
out of the game box,

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.780
then you have to put them back
into the game box, otherwise,

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.530
you've just ruined
your copy of the game.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.230
So I like using disposable
kindergarten counters a lot,

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.170
because I don't really care
about returning exactly

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.740
the same number I took out.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.620
And there's usually
less assumption

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.350
about what a kindergarten
counter is supposed to be.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.290
Is it a number?

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.680
Is it a person?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:42.224
Whereas, if you use game bits,
that's kind of person-shaped,

00:47:42.224 --> 00:47:43.140
[? meatball-shaped. ?]

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.610
Post-it glue and
notepads-- well, I

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:51.070
don't think we actually have
any Post-it glue right now,

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:53.700
but they're
basically glue sticks

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.480
that don't stick permanently.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.730
So you put that on an index
card or on a piece of paper,

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.790
and suddenly, it
becomes a Post-it.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.000
But what we do have are a
lot of Post-it note pads,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.320
both big ones and small ones.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.780
And these are useful for
you to simulate displays,

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.560
for instance, or variables and
information that a player is

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.400
supposed to have.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.850
And you don't want that to go
flying off if somebody sneezes.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.584
Of course-- oh, right.

00:48:19.584 --> 00:48:21.500
I have a picture of some
Kindergarten counters

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.734
up there-- pencils, pens,
markers, scissors, tape,

00:48:24.734 --> 00:48:26.400
just to be able to
hold things together,

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.300
write down information.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.810
Something else about
Kindergarten counters.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.280
We have a particular kind
of Kindergarten counter,

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.150
which is an interlocking cube.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.440
You take it out?

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.140
PROFESSOR: Every year, we've--

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:42.859
PHILLIP TAN: Well,
it is possible

00:48:42.859 --> 00:48:45.150
that we took them out because
they're very problematic.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.970
Because once I give
you interlocking cubes,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.310
you make games about
interlocking cubes.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.894
It's like handing LEGOs.

00:48:52.894 --> 00:48:54.310
And then, the first
thing everyone

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.690
thinks of is let's
make it a game

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.690
where you put things
together and assemble them.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:58.840
AUDIENCE: Like
stacking counters.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.900
PHILLIP TAN: Stacking counters.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.358
AUDIENCE: So you
make games about--

00:49:01.358 --> 00:49:02.770
PHILLIP TAN: Stacking.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:03.390
Yeah.

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.120
The pieces that you end up
prototyping with sometimes

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.520
ends up shaping the
direction of your game.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.830
And then, sometimes, if you
are dealing with a designer's

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.260
block, that can be helpful.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.220
That gives you a path to follow.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.330
But in many ways,
that's a distraction.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.830
You start becoming constrained
by your tools, instead of

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.970
the idea that you're
trying to work with.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:28.005
So if we managed to get rid
of the interlocking cubes,

00:49:28.005 --> 00:49:28.630
that's awesome.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.730
But if they're still in
there, by all means, use them.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.140
But don't automatically
assume you

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:37.950
have to make a game
about interlocking cubes.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:41.690
Now, don't forget to keep a
record of everything, including

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.690
all of the notes
that you've had.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.160
Use your phone camera
doing the session.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.170
At the end of your
project, make sure

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.710
that you try to
get them scanned,

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:53.900
photocopied in some way.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.920
There are a lot of photocopy
machines around campus now.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.440
There are actually scanners.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.780
And you just put the
raw materials on top.

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.040
And instead of
generating a copy,

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.880
you can have them email a color
scan to your email account.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:10.005
Those things are really useful
for your final assignment.

00:50:10.005 --> 00:50:11.102
OK.

00:50:11.102 --> 00:50:12.060
So those are the tools.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.660
Who are the people
sitting around the table?

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.870
When you've actually
made a prototype, what

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.960
happens is-- I guess I got
some of my slides mixed up--

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.620
this usually happens at
the end of having designed

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.325
a workable prototype
is that there

00:50:31.325 --> 00:50:33.840
is going to be a bunch of
people sitting around the table.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.620
And each person has
a different role.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:36.730
That's, of course, the
person who's actually

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:38.390
going to be playing
the game, preferably

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.080
somebody from a different
team or somebody who's

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.361
even outside of this class.

00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:43.360
It could be one of us
instructors, for instance.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.340
It could be one
of the OCW people.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:50.622
And somebody in your team is
going to be a facilitator.

00:50:50.622 --> 00:50:52.330
This is the person
who's going to present

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.830
the rules to the person
who's going to play,

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.920
you know, tell them that we're
looking for your feedback.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.919
Make them comfortable.

00:50:58.919 --> 00:51:00.710
Make sure that they
understand what they're

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.720
supposed to be doing and
basically making sure

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.190
that the session runs
according to script.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:12.280
That person, or somebody else,
can also be the computer.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.580
This is the person who is
actually making the prototype

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:19.630
work, updating variables,
moving the positions of pieces

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.510
on the board, revealing
new dialogue boxes,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:27.160
or basically making the
board respond to what

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.230
the player decides to do.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:34.100
And the computer is trying
to do all the computation

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.110
that your actual
computer will do,

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:37.880
if you're making a digital game.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.380
The computer should not do
anything that a real computer

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:40.880
wouldn't.

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.800
So for instance, if somebody
doesn't understand a rule,

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.580
the computer person shouldn't
be correcting the player.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.211
The facilitator could.

00:51:51.211 --> 00:51:53.210
But sometimes, what I
find is really interesting

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.560
is that somebody thinks
a rule works differently.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.990
I let them play through it.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.150
And that becomes like
a different iteration

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.210
of the game.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.380
And sometimes, it
turns out to be better.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.210
Then you can run
through the iteration

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:06.400
with the correct rule.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.342
Yeah?

00:52:07.342 --> 00:52:09.092
AUDIENCE: So the person
who's the computer

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:11.590
does have to make a choice
at that point of whether they

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.302
would let them play according
to what they think the rule is?

00:52:15.302 --> 00:52:16.010
PHILLIP TAN: Yes.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:18.016
AUDIENCE: Or what
the computer-- like

00:52:18.016 --> 00:52:20.196
if it were a real
computer, it would just

00:52:20.196 --> 00:52:23.000
think [INAUDIBLE] something
that doesn't work [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.590
PHILLIP TAN: And
it puts it in play.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:27.146
And the computer says,
nothing happens, you know?

00:52:27.146 --> 00:52:28.520
It's like you can
do that, right?

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.780
It's like if the person
really doesn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.810
But if you notice, say,
this person is clearly

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.830
playing a really
sub-optimal strategy,

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.286
just respond like
a computer will,

00:52:38.286 --> 00:52:39.910
lead them to
[? that loose ?] condition

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:43.250
or whatever it is that happens.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.300
Because in many ways,
that's how an actual player

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.160
is going to learn how to play
your game in the long run.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.290
They're going to make
a lot of bad decisions.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.820
The computer is
going to respond,

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:53.861
and then they're going to
learn from the mistakes

00:52:53.861 --> 00:52:57.900
that they made and then
try it differently.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.832
Let's see.

00:52:59.832 --> 00:53:01.290
Something else that
the facilitator

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.540
can do while the game
is going on-- say,

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.998
the player is
actually playing-- is

00:53:04.998 --> 00:53:08.530
to encourage the
player to think aloud.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:12.900
So the person that you
brought in to play your game

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.750
is trying to
understand your game

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:16.700
and is just like
sitting there in silence

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.800
looking at the board.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.470
And you don't know if they're
bored, confused, or really

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:21.500
into it.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.850
So you ask them, what
are you thinking now?

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:27.734
And if they're saying,
what are all these pieces?

00:53:27.734 --> 00:53:28.400
All right, then.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.300
You know that they're confused.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.840
The facilitator can
help, can say, all right,

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.150
let's start again,
and I'll explain

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:36.420
what all these pieces are.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.880
They could be, ah, I've got
like five different strategies,

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.380
and I'm trying to figure out
which-- you know, I'm thinking,

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.220
maybe, if I move this here,
[? I move this out, ?] OK,

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:44.540
that person's into it, right?

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.810
That person's really thinking
hard about this problem.

00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:50.502
Everybody else in your
team watching that board.

00:53:50.502 --> 00:53:52.460
And this is the reason
why we have a big board.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.560
As an observer, you
want to be able to see

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.120
what's going on in your game.

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.135
You want to be able to write
down the information in a note

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:03.231
book or on your laptop and try
to record whatever information.

00:54:03.231 --> 00:54:05.480
Most importantly, look at
the face of the person who's

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:07.360
playing the game.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:11.630
Again, that helps identify
whether they're confused

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:13.806
or whether they're
really into it

00:54:13.806 --> 00:54:15.305
and trying to make
a tough decision,

00:54:15.305 --> 00:54:16.350
or they're just bored.

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.995
Don't offer help to
the user, especially

00:54:20.995 --> 00:54:22.370
if you're on the
development team

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.210
and you know all
about this game.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.260
It can be a real temptation to
basically just tell the user,

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:30.030
this is what you want to do.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.620
Don't do that.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.430
Sit on your hands.

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.570
Bite your tongue.

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.200
It can be hard to
take notes when

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.870
you're sitting on your hands,
but, you know, take notes.

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:43.210
And the person who's
being the computer

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:47.030
and being the facilitator really
doesn't have the bandwidth.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:49.370
Those people do not have
the bandwidth to take notes.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.594
So someone has to be
officially designated

00:54:51.594 --> 00:54:53.760
with the job of actually
taking notes and observing.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:59.790
What we're going to be
doing is a Wizard of Oz test

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.110
for your games.

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:03.900
And that is someone's
playing the computer.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.950
It's very constrained in
terms of communication

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.060
between the computer and the
person who's testing your game.

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.486
The rules are
usually pretty rigid.

00:55:12.486 --> 00:55:14.110
And the nice thing
about it is that you

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:19.180
can do a pretty deep
analysis of a game.

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:24.040
You can make a game that sort of
goes through multiple decisions

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.716
into sort of long-term
consequences.

00:55:26.716 --> 00:55:28.090
That's not
necessarily what we're

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.549
asking you to do for Project 1.

00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:32.090
I'm just telling
you this because you

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:35.560
might want to do this
for Project 2, 3, or 4.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.930
A Wizard of Oz test
allows you to really

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:41.080
do a deep dive into how a
particular feature works,

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.320
for instance.

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.490
And since it's a human
simulating the back end,

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:50.210
simulating the
computing, you can

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:54.450
be very high-fidelity
with very little cost.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.210
That's not, again, we're
asking you to do for Project 1.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.670
We're asking you to do a
low-fidelity prototype.

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.940
And we'll go into a little bit
more detail about what that is.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:03.570
Very important.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.903
Don't let the player know
what the computer is thinking.

00:56:05.903 --> 00:56:07.600
The computer only
displays information.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.630
You do not reveal
how the computer

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.922
is coming to those conclusions.

00:56:12.922 --> 00:56:14.880
There are a couple of
other kinds of prototypes

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.660
that you could design.

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.076
I'm going to run through them
very quickly, because that's

00:56:18.076 --> 00:56:20.740
not what happens in this class.

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.520
Player versus player, what
you'd expect in a board

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.440
game or a card game situation.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.850
We have a class just for that.

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:30.124
And you can make cooperative
games, competitive games.

00:56:30.124 --> 00:56:31.540
You can make games
where everybody

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.100
has the same role, a symmetric
game, or asymmetric game where

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:35.927
everyone has different roles.

00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:37.510
The problem about
that is that there's

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.000
a lot of loose
miscommunication happening

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.370
between the people who are
actually playing your game.

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:44.200
And they may decide
on a house rule

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.840
that was totally not
what you intended

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.240
or designed as developers.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.680
And that turns
out to be the rule

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.690
that you end up playing with.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:52.160
Again, what I like
to do is I like

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.676
to see them play
through that rule.

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.550
Then, at the end of the
game, I correct them,

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:56.920
and I have them play
through the rule

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.870
that I originally designed,
because sometimes,

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.327
the rule that they
came up with is better.

00:57:01.327 --> 00:57:03.410
The facilitator, again,
helps to explain the rules

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:04.680
at the beginning of the game.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.670
And then you kind of
just watch after that.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:10.190
It's hard to get consistent
results across tests

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.770
when you're doing
a multiplayer game,

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.660
because it's very
hard to duplicate

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.070
exactly the same situation.

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:16.820
Whereas, you can do
that on a Wizard of Oz

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.384
test pretty easily.

00:57:18.384 --> 00:57:20.050
But if you're making
a multiplayer game,

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:22.090
you have to do a
multiplayer test.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.020
So this might actually
happen-- actually,

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.162
are we saying that you
can only do single player

00:57:26.162 --> 00:57:26.995
games this semester?

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.650
I'm not quite sure
what the constraint is.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.010
You can also do live
action, not for today.

00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:42.319
But I actually enjoy
these where you actually

00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:44.860
have predetermined rules that
are explained between the game.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.820
And then you just
let real human beings

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.849
walk around and do stuff.

00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:52.390
The problem with this is there's
a very limited communication

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:55.070
between people who are playing
a game or even the people who

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:58.740
are running the game, because
everyone's kind of physically

00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.970
spread out.

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:03.157
But it can be really
useful for a game,

00:58:03.157 --> 00:58:05.240
if your game is really
about a human being walking

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.335
through a space, such
like a stealth game

00:58:07.335 --> 00:58:08.449
or something like that.

00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:10.490
Yes, that's actually a
person in that U-Haul box.

00:58:13.454 --> 00:58:14.940
All right.

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.440
So when you're actually
making your prototype,

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.440
here are the things
that you have

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.680
to make sure you do for
every single prototype.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.790
Keep it hand-drawn, because
hand-drawing is fast.

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:28.540
You want to keep it
really, really sketchy

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.620
and look really sketchy
and rough, again,

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.981
because that actually gets you
feedback from the people who

00:58:33.981 --> 00:58:34.480
are testing.

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.180
You make it look
too pretty, people

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.940
are going to hesitate
on commenting on how

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.330
your game looks, for instance.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:42.510
Or they may actually
hesitate on commenting

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:46.354
on how your game works,
even though that may not

00:58:46.354 --> 00:58:47.770
be the prettiest
part of the game,

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:50.590
because they can tell you spent
a lot of time on this game.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.570
Again, you want it to be big.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.350
Everyone needs to be able to see
what's going on during testing.

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:59.660
And just use one dark color,
if you can for your inks,

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.430
for your markers.

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.980
It needs to be
dark, high-contrast,

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:07.630
so that everyone
can read it easily.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.580
You can use different
color cards, for instance,

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.150
to be able to tell this card
is a different kind of card

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.360
from that card, but
don't use multiple colors

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.130
on the same card.

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:18.772
That's just not
worth the effort.

00:59:18.772 --> 00:59:20.480
And again, it gives
people the impression

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.980
that you spent a lot of
time on this prototype.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:25.110
And even if you
have, you don't want

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:28.600
to give them that impression.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.900
You write your rules on cards.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.929
So keep track of your rules.

00:59:31.929 --> 00:59:33.970
Eventually, you're going
to end up typing it down

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.950
on your laptop, because that'll
make it easier for you to turn

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.070
in your work for Project 1.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:41.132
But while you're
working on a prototype,

00:59:41.132 --> 00:59:42.590
try writing your
rules on the cards

00:59:42.590 --> 00:59:44.465
instead, because that
allows you to do things

00:59:44.465 --> 00:59:49.300
like rearrange the steps in
which certain rules operate.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.050
It allows you to change
out a rule really easily,

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:54.575
while keeping the
old rule around.

00:59:54.575 --> 00:59:56.200
And you can just swap
things in and you

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.120
can try things differently.

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.490
Every time you change a
rule, change the card.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:03.680
If you are changing the number
of rules, instead of taking,

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.182
say, take three
steps every turn,

01:00:05.182 --> 01:00:07.640
you say take two steps every
turn, just cross out the three

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.700
and write two in there.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.280
Now, periodically take photos
with your phone cameras.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.690
And always try to simplify.

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:16.270
Always try to get
down to the smallest

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:20.010
set of rules that is necessary
for you to test your idea.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.140
Part of that is just
to speed up testing.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.850
You're going to test
within your team

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.780
first, just to be able to see
whether this basic mechanism

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.280
works.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.360
And eventually, you're going to
end up testing with each other.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.792
And the simpler your
rules, the less time

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:35.500
it is to be able to
start a new playtest,

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.130
because there's less
for you to explain

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:41.060
to somebody else who's
never seen your game before.

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.275
So try to get your rules to
be as simple as possible.

01:00:46.444 --> 01:00:48.360
Also, if you have too
many rules and something

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.120
breaks in your game,
it's sometimes harder

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.074
to figure out which
rule was the culprit.

01:00:53.074 --> 01:00:55.490
If you have fewer rules, it's
usually more obvious for you

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:58.010
to spot.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.190
Now, we talked about
iterative design a lot.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.070
And this is basically
the loop that we're using

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:06.200
while we are paper prototyping.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.390
You start with a question,
a falsifiable question,

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:11.370
a yes/no question.

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:16.630
And what is this prototype
going to achieve?

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:20.600
Maybe in this particular
case it's going to be,

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.690
does this theme that we picked
actually have randomness in it

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:25.980
that you can plan for?

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.540
Or is it the randomness
so random to the point

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.390
where you can't plan for it?

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.010
Or is it really just very
deterministic, and when

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.840
you play the game, you can
really tell, yeah, here's

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.420
the optimal solution?

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.690
You can look at
axiomatic design--

01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.330
anyone heard of this term?

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:48.180
[? Mackee, ?] in particular,
uses this a lot--

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.500
which is, basically,
you establish axioms,

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.520
which are things that you
are taking to be true,

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.470
a baseline that
need to be fulfilled

01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:57.230
by any workable design.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:01.490
So it could be we assume
that this game needs

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:05.750
to have some sort
of random condition

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.570
that's generated that
changes during the game.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:13.630
And we need the
player to identify

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:17.310
that this number is changing
and anticipate where

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.410
that number might end up going.

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:21.540
And if your prototype
fulfills both of them,

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.152
then you know that
prototype worked.

01:02:23.152 --> 01:02:25.110
And you can build a lot
of different prototypes

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:26.734
that fulfill those
same two conditions.

01:02:26.734 --> 01:02:30.960
That's another way to
start with a question.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.570
And then you actually
start designing, grabbing

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:36.860
those pieces of paper, writing
out your rules on cards,

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:39.790
brainstorming on what
your game's all about.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:42.170
But you want to do this
as quickly as possible.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:44.410
The less time you
can spend talking

01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:46.896
about this, the more
different kinds of ideas

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.520
you're going to be
able to run through.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.480
And that's what we're trying
to do during a prototyping

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.380
process.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.480
If you're ever in
a situation where

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.897
you've got two different
options, this might be better,

01:02:58.897 --> 01:03:00.480
or this might be
better, or you're not

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:04.560
quite sure, it's
usually faster in paper

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.910
prototyping to just start making
both prototypes, you know?

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.070
All right, you do this
version, you do this version.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.650
Generate the cards, play
through both of them.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:17.942
And you'll get actual evidence,
actual playtesting evidence

01:03:17.942 --> 01:03:19.400
on which idea seems
to work better.

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.110
After you design,
you play through it.

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:25.610
First within your
team, and then you

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.395
grab somebody from
some other team,

01:03:27.395 --> 01:03:28.670
or one of the instructors.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:32.580
And we'll sit down and we'll
play a game and see where

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.410
the strength in this design,
where are the weaknesses.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:36.910
Whatever you design
within an hour

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:41.326
is going to be clunky and
broken and really, really not

01:03:41.326 --> 01:03:42.450
quite where you want to be.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.600
That's find.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.590
Do a playtest with
that expectation

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:47.480
that there are going
to be problems.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.160
And you'll get a
lot more information

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.930
out of that playtest than
you will working on your own.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:54.590
And then you use
that information

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.950
to revise your design.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:59.640
Make changes, and then you
repeat this entire process

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.550
again.

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:03.160
Either you amplify
it on the strengths,

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.380
you figure out what
your weaknesses are

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.260
and you make big changes.

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:10.170
So you repeat that.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:14.460
And here are a couple of tricks
that can work, sometimes,

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.600
if you have trouble figuring
out what sort of changes

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.490
to make in your design.

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:22.680
Killing a rule, just
like taking a rule out

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.750
sometimes fixes problems more
than trying to fix the rule

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:26.862
itself.

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.570
A certain thing is
bogging down the game,

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.650
a certain thing
is too confusing.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:33.300
Just does the game work if
you just take that rule out?

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.250
Sometimes it does.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.400
You can make a resource
that's limited, unlimited,

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.020
or make an unlimited
resource limited,

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:47.170
limited health, unlimited
health, limited ammunition,

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.500
money.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.660
Player interference is more
for multiplayer games where,

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:57.710
sometimes, if everybody is
playing their own little solo

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.980
game and they're not
interacting with each other,

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.010
you'd come up with ways to
mess up each other's plans.

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:07.340
That doesn't always apply
with single player games.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:11.160
But if you've ever played a
game like a role playing game

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.550
where you can delay an enemy.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.870
Has anyone seen
one of those where

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:22.719
you can like cast slow
or something on an enemy,

01:05:22.719 --> 01:05:25.260
and then they can't attack you
for another turn or something.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.810
That's player
interference, right?

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.660
Only the player that
you're interfering with

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.170
happens to be the computer.

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:36.015
What can you do to basically
get into somebody else's plan

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.410
and change it?

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:40.950
And the computer can
have those rules too.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:42.320
Mess with the play order.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.930
Mess with the order
of your rules.

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:45.610
Just try rearranging
the order of rules.

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.700
And sometimes by grouping
things into logical chunks,

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.646
it can make the game
easier to understand.

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:52.770
Instead of saying, first,
you decide whether you're

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:53.610
going to do this.

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:55.420
Then you decide whether
you're going to do this.

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.378
Then you're going to
decide whether to do this.

01:05:57.378 --> 01:06:03.270
Maybe you just say, make two of
these three decisions, right?

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:07.220
And every turn, you get
two out of these three.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.900
Make them any order you want.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.410
That's a way that you
mess up play order.

01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:13.420
If you're going to
change variables,

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.460
either multiply or
divide them by two.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.610
There is not enough
granularity in the prototypes

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:23.710
that you're making today
to do like a 10% change

01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:25.219
in a certain
variable and then be

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.510
able to detect whether that
change was the right change

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:28.010
or not.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.770
That's not going
be obvious enough.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:34.069
Do like big multiples
of two, of three,

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:36.610
to be able to see whether that's
the change that's necessary.

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:39.150
You can tune things
later when you

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:42.570
are preparing the project for
the playtest on Wednesday,

01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:43.630
for instance.

01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:49.290
But when you're in this class,
do things by big multiples.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:50.940
If your game's
really, really, really

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.910
kind of getting bogged down
and taking too long to play,

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.880
try to get down to
the core set of rules,

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.650
the minimum set of
rules that's necessary

01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:00.100
even just for your game to work.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.240
Just for the game
to run at all, try

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.530
to figure out what that core
is, the minimum set of rules.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:08.080
And then you add in
each rule, one by one.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.370
Reconstruct your game.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.880
That's one way to identify
where the main problems are

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.620
in your game because, as you
add the problematic rule,

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.160
things start to break.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.230
And finally, be willing to
just throw away everything

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.820
that you generate in
the next hour, OK?

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:27.150
Anything that you
make in the next hour

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.880
might, in fact,
just be terrible.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.500
And you're going to learn that.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.680
And that's fine.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.138
That's why we're
making prototypes,

01:07:33.138 --> 01:07:34.680
so that they can be disposable.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.510
That's how I started this talk.

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.801
So any questions before we
actually start making stuff?

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.060
Coming up with rules?

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:50.010
You're going to grab
pieces and create

01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:53.610
some sort of a play
surface or cards

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:55.460
that people are
going to play with.

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:59.470
You don't need to put
anything on a board.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:02.390
And before everybody runs
down and grabs things,

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:05.440
I guess we're going to go
back and remind people what

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.169
a low-fidelity prototype is.

01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:16.153
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

01:08:16.153 --> 01:08:18.320
PROFESSOR: --terrible as
long as you're aware of it.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.736
AUDIENCE: I thought I replaced
it with a stacking counter,

01:08:20.736 --> 01:08:22.141
so I guess it didn't work.

01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:29.640
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.140
[? ANDREW GRANT: All right. ?]
So we just have a couple more

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.250
minutes left of class.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:36.689
A couple of things to
remember before you leave.

01:08:36.689 --> 01:08:39.640
Take pictures of all of
your brainstorming notes.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.069
And keep your notes with you,
so take them away with you.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:46.470
Make sure everyone on your
team can access those notes.

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:49.020
Make sure you know the email
addresses of the people

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.550
you're on your team with,
so you can talk them again.

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:56.069
And before you leave
the classroom today,

01:08:56.069 --> 01:09:00.020
start up a document and
enter your change log.

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:04.117
So put in what
you designed today

01:09:04.117 --> 01:09:06.200
and what problems you found
by the end of the day.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:10.950
So I'm going to repeat
that one last time.

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:16.350
Before you leave class
today, start up a document,

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:19.560
open it up, and start up
your new design change log.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.790
Put the date.

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.990
Put what you did
today, so a brief, two

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:26.590
or three-sentence description
of what you designed today

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:29.460
and what are the problems
you're facing now.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.660
That'll be important to you
both for when you meet as a team

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.300
again to remember what
you did, but also later

01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.689
on to have a full history of
everything that you've done.

01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:40.840
OK?

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.560
One more thing.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.210
Yes?

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:44.120
SARA VERRILLI: One more thing.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:44.620
Tomorrow--

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.090
[? ANDREW GRANT: Wednesday. ?]

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:45.787
SARA VERRILLI:
Wednesday, rather, we

01:09:45.787 --> 01:09:47.415
are going to have playtests.

01:09:47.415 --> 01:09:50.270
We're going to be playtesting
all the prototypes.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:54.449
So you need a playable prototype
for Wednesday, 3 o'clock.

01:09:54.449 --> 01:09:56.240
[? ANDREW GRANT: And ?]
then we're starting

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.320
Wednesday's class off with
discussions about the gaming

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.600
tutorial, so bring
your problems,

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.300
bring your questions about the
engines that you were assigned.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.650
And we'll talk about them.

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:08.150
All right.

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.020
See you Wednesday.
