00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.170
PROFESSOR 1: So today
is all about you.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.570
We are introducing Project Two.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.340
We are starting off with
the Project One pitch

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.350
presentations, then
we're going to have

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.500
prototype demonstrations.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.560
The idea is that
everyone in class

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.810
should have heard about all
the games that were made

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.722
and should have at least
seen all the games be played.

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.180
it's going to be
kind of difficult,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.596
but we're going
to try to do that.

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.271
After that, we're
going to form teams.

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:48.770
So we're going to choose a few
of these games and form teams

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.720
around them.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.980
And then after that,
assuming we have time left,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.950
we're going to work
in our new teams.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.470
You're going to rewrite that
Project One vision statement

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.250
and you're going to modify
the paper prototype on volume

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.215
here has a group just to kind
of see what the mechanics were

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:05.150
and what you're going to
have to do for Project Two.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.450
So starting off, Project Two--
it's another low fidelity

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.380
prototyping, but
this is more digital.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.996
So you're going to actually
make a digital game.

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:14.870
We're asking to create
this digital prototype

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.330
in a short time frame.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.800
You had about a week
to do Project One.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.430
You're going to have about
two weeks to do Project Two.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.374
There will be some of
the work done in class.

00:01:24.374 --> 00:01:26.540
Unfortunately, it's not
going to be the programming.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.110
That's going to happen
outside of class.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.750
In class, we're doing
a lot of the meetings

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.875
and a lot of the project
management stuff in class.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.150
And we'll be walking
through a lot of that.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.944
You're going to be basing that
game off of a Project One game.

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:39.360
And then yeah, we're going to
integrate project management

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.818
concepts into your process,
and we'll be talking about some

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:44.830
of that stuff
starting Wednesday.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.870
Extra goals-- you're
going to be working

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.300
as a team for the first time
using a common game engine.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.960
So hopefully some of the
lessons from that game

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.420
engine tutorial we did
last week work out-- I

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.392
think that was last week,
yeah-- work out for you.

00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:00.100
You're going to be
doing version control,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.200
so it looked like
we had everybody

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.160
able to use some kind of version
control with all those engines.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.440
That's a good sign.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.380
And then you're also going to be
managing your time commitments.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.838
This is the first
time you're going

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.920
to have six people on one
project for this class,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.120
and then you're going
to continue like that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.580
for the rest of the semester.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.040
So coming up with
strategies on how

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.710
to work with each other, how
to maximize the work you do

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.691
in person, and what you
can do when you're not

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:25.190
next to each other, when you're
working from your dorm room,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.800
from a study area,
things like that.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.629
So the deliverables
for this one-- today,

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.920
we are going to do this
workshop, this team information

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.530
workshop.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.970
On Wednesday, we're going to
be work shopping the product

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.030
backlog, and you're
going to be turning in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.610
to Stellar-- actually, I
meant the vision statement.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.800
But on Wednesday,
by the end of class,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.300
we'd like you turn
in the Stellar

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.400
an updated vision statement.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.170
So take the statement you were
working on for Project One,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.984
modify it based on
the new team you have.

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:54.900
You'll do a little bit
of that today in class,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.470
and then you'll turn it in by
the end of class on Wednesday

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.170
to Stellar.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.420
The following week, you're
going to turn in to Stellar

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.440
before class starts a
product backlog based

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.230
on the workshop you
did the week prior.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.220
And in class, we're going to
talk about sprint back task

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.500
lists.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.837
So you don't know what a
sprint task list is right now.

00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:14.670
You don't know what
estimates are right now.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.230
You'll be working
on that on Monday,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.710
and then each team will give
a short presentation to us

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.820
about the work that you did.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.932
On Wednesday you'll turn in
that task list you created.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:25.390
And in class on
Wednesday, we'll be

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.950
playing all the digital games.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.640
So you have to have
something running

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.960
by Wednesday at 1:00 PM.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.570
It could be running and broken.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.910
You might not get much
good feedback out of it,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.850
but it must be running
by Wednesday at 1:00 PM.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.460
And then the following
Monday, the project is due.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.010
Yeah, really, really short.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.540
On Stellar you're going to
turn a whole bunch of stuff.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540
All of your games should
compile out to HTML,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.540
either be playable on a website
or use a website plug-in

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.890
like Unity or Flash or whatnot.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.480
So there is more details
in the handout in Stellar.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.570
I updated that this morning,
so please take a look at that

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.695
once your teams are formed.

00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.361
So it's probably one
of the first things

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:07.640
you should do is take a
look at those requirements.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.681
Again, you'll need a
written a written postmortem

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:10.654
from each of you.

00:04:10.654 --> 00:04:12.320
We'll ask for a design
change log, which

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.785
your first entry will be today.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.410
You'll need an updated
vision statement

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.950
if anything changed from the
one you turned in on whatever I

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.140
said it was, Wednesday.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.540
If anything's changed,
you'll turn it in again.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.970
And you'll be doing
focus test reports.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.560
So we're doing
some focus testing,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.310
some testing in the next week.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.640
And then, you'll also do
a postmortem presentation.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.425
And so, this presentation
will actually

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:39.460
be five minutes per team.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.925
The requirements
are on the handout,

00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:45.640
and we'll talk about it a little
more later in the next week

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.140
or so.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.820
But basically, it's
tell us what went right,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.190
tell us what went wrong,
tell us what you learned.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.809
We don't necessarily want to
see the game being played.

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:56.850
We want to see what you've
learned from the game,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.230
so highlight that with
screenshots, with video, stuff

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.010
like that.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.740
All right, so this is what
we're doing for the next--

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.230
we've got 15 slots-- so for
the next 15 or so minutes--

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.880
elevator pitches.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.030
Why are we asking you
to do an elevator pitch?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.800
If you can succinctly describe
your game in one minute,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.720
it's probably pretty well
scoped for Project Two.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.980
Also, you probably have a handle
on what you're actually making.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.540
You know what the game's about.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.590
You can describe the
game to another person.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.320
To us that means,
great, that project

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.562
is probably going to be
a Project Two project.

00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:33.770
If you have a little bit of
difficulty describing it,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.144
if you go a little
bit over time,

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:38.420
we're going to allow you
to go over time, but don't.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.790
Why do I even tell you that?

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.040
I just messed
everything up, didn't I?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.520
But if there's some
issues going on with that,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.880
that'll let us know a little bit
about the scope of the project.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.560
Don't show us the game, don't
use visuals, don't use laptops.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.670
You're in an elevator
with an executive.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.700
They said, fine, you
got a minute of my time.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.180
Tell me what you're
trying to do.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.110
Bam, convince them
that your game is cool,

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.820
depends on what your game does.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.240
In this particular case,
we want to know why it's

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.640
about planning for randomness.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.290
Remember, that's our design
constraint for the Project

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.650
One and Project Two.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.260
What about your game is
planning for randomness?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.580
What is the core piece
of game play in it.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.110
Remember in your
vision statement,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.609
in one of the
versions, we asked you

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:20.126
for 20 or 30 seconds
of game play.

00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:21.750
That's a great thing
to put in a pitch.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.610
So you've got all the material,
just take your minute, go.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.940
Afterwards, we're going
to do demonstrations,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.640
and I'll bring that
slide up later.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.509
But basically we're
not going to just rely

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:33.800
on you talking about your game.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.070
We're going to be able to see
all the games being played.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.070
And we're going to, again,
try to get everybody

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.260
able to see all the games
being played if they

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.050
haven't been played already.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.800
And after that, we're
going to try to form

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.350
teams, which is really hard.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.230
So that comes later.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.670
All right, any questions
before we move on?

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.480
Any additional
comments from y'all?

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.740
Oh yeah, remember to check
handout 2 on Stellar.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.260
So yes.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.540
by the end of class today.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.580
All right, so first
team is Lazy Beaver.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.480
Again, you only need
one person from the team

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.360
to come up if you don't
all want to come up.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.257
Come up here, stand
about right here,

00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:13.590
there's a microphone right here.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.807
It'll capture you-- talk.

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:17.890
Lazy Beaver, come on down.

00:07:27.044 --> 00:07:28.460
STUDENT 1: All
right, hi everyone.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.590
Our name is called Lazy Beaver.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.630
Lazy Beaver is a
survival game in which

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.820
players must take on a chaotic
world full of surprises.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.940
These surprises come in the form
of random environmental events

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.950
such as hurricanes,
predators, and even Ebola.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.810
The player takes
one action every day

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.260
which either replenishes or
depletes their finite resources

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.500
with the objective of
surviving the elements in order

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.080
to build a set number of dams.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.490
Since the environment
is so unpredictable,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.410
the player must carefully
plan their actions or risk

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.250
losing by running out
any of their resources.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.580
This lets the player
either choose to be risky

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.400
or play it safe.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.145
The digital prototype will
maintain the same core gameplay

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:09.840
of choosing actions,
reacting to the environment,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.860
and preparing for disasters.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.060
We will take the opportunity
to carefully balance

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.820
events and resources to tune
the difficulty to appeal

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.000
to all types of players.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.745
Lazy Beaver should
move on to Project Two

00:08:20.745 --> 00:08:22.730
because during
testing players found

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.190
our game both delightful
and difficult.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.850
Also, the technical
scope of the game

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.540
is fitting for Project
Two's timeline,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.170
and the mechanics
of the game are well

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.086
suited for the preparing
for randomness theme.

00:08:38.738 --> 00:08:40.450
PROFESSOR 1: Dragon's Lair.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.872
Come on down.

00:08:47.104 --> 00:08:48.270
STUDENT 2: Hello, everybody.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.060
Our game is called
Dragon's Lair.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.100
The game's point is
you are an adventurer

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.420
and you come into
a dragon's lair.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.420
You have 20 actions you
take, but after every time

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.345
you take action, the dragon
destroys one of them.

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:02.970
The point is you want
to try to collect

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.520
as much gold as possible.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.165
The game ends when all the parts
are either discarded by you

00:09:08.165 --> 00:09:09.910
or destroyed by the dragon.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.515
And then you count up how
much gold you got at the end.

00:09:12.515 --> 00:09:14.720
The game is lost,
thought, if you

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.930
run out the dragon's patience,
because the dragon can only

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.520
put up with you being
in its lair for so long.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.490
The game would be
good for Project Two

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.855
because it has a small scope.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.105
The only thing we want to
do for the digital prototype

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:29.910
is get some artwork in there,
a little bit of ambient music,

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.480
add a timer so
that people aren't

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.940
taking too long at each turn.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.540
And add a high score
table because the game

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.090
has high replay ability value.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.810
So we want people to be able
to see their achievements.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.990
People found it fun and it
was difficult, and so yeah,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:45.508
we think it's a good game.

00:09:45.508 --> 00:09:46.990
PROFESSOR 1: Great, thank you.

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:53.412
Fight or Flight, come on down.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:08.350
STUDENT 3: Why is it that in
every Indiana Jones movie ever

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.970
there's a temple
that gets destroyed.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.735
A temple gets destroyed
because it turns out

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:18.350
that running out of a temple
is really, really fun.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.370
Our game-- Fight or
Flight-- forces the players

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.870
to run from a randomly but not.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.234
Environment that gets randomly
destroyed behind or in

00:10:29.234 --> 00:10:31.650
front of them and
balance their actions

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.420
between fighting their
pursuers and just

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.390
running as quickly as possible.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.670
It works for Project Two because
it's fun, dynamic, and actually

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.190
pretty simple at its core.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.130
Thank you.

00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:50.172
PROFESSOR 1: Plunder Winds.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.640
STUDENT 4: Hi, everyone.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.160
Our game is Plunder
Winds, a pirate themed

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.640
treasure hunting game.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.250
Our game is based around
three simple core mechanics

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.170
that interact with each other.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.860
The first one is a random
encounter mechanic,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.100
which controls the probability
of finding treasure.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.290
And you can affect this
as the game progresses.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.760
An exploration mechanic,
which tells you

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.650
what the risk level of
nearby encounters will be.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.610
And then wind mechanic,
which limits your moving

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.960
and forces the player to make
strategic decisions about where

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.170
they move.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.376
Our game's digital prototype
would have the same core

00:11:34.376 --> 00:11:35.750
mechanics as our
paper prototype,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.580
but it would be faster
and more graphics

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.930
so it'd be easier for
players to pick up.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:45.550
We could also add on unique
encounters and abilities

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.220
to improve replay ability.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.960
So our project should
on to Project Two

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.050
since it's easy to implement.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.590
And also, throughout
play testing,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.070
we found that players
found it easy to pick up,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.880
but also found it
hard to master.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.939
So you should come join
our crew-- Plunder Winds.

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:07.328
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:09.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.960
PROFESSOR 1: Blind Aliens.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.487
WT.

00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:15.820
STUDENT 5: It's a working title.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.391
PROFESSOR 1: Uh-huh.

00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:18.390
STUDENT 5: Hi, everyone.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.130
We're Blind Aliens.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.050
Our game is Blind Aliens.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.185
The premise of the game
is aliens, blind aliens,

00:12:26.185 --> 00:12:30.490
have invaded the Earth and you
are one of very few surviving

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.400
humans.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.880
And the game is very simple,
it's in a very small room.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.870
There's aliens that come
in through random gates

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.490
around the edges.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.580
And they randomly roam
around searching for you,

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.640
but they can't see you
because they're blind.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.755
So you have three options.

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:48.880
You can sneak away very slowly.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.950
Or you can run very
fast, which is loud.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.000
Or you have a gun, you can
shoot at them, which is also

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.184
very loud and you'll be risking
getting discovered and eaten

00:12:59.184 --> 00:12:59.910
alive.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.870
So the game should
move on to Project Two

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.590
because it's very simple.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.230
During testing, we
found that people

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.950
found it very engaging in
that it was not boring at all.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.494
So, yeah.

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:12.994
Thanks.

00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.630
PROFESSOR 1: Next up is Live On.

00:13:26.135 --> 00:13:27.296
STUDENT 6: Hi, everyone.

00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:28.670
Live On is a
survival themed game

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.610
that takes place in a
hexgrid based world.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.860
The player needs to stay
alive and move from the start

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.461
to the goal.

00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:34.960
There are four type
possible terrain

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.000
to raise-- river, mountain,
plain, and forest-- each

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.850
with simple costs and benefits.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.080
The key mechanic for the
game is that at every turn,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.621
the player needs to
choose which tile

00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:46.300
to move on to next based on what
information he has available.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.341
So the player only has
limited vision on one hand

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:49.980
is important to
choose grids that

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.059
will lead to a good
location for the next move.

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:53.475
On the other hand,
the player need

00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:54.850
to plan for the
[INAUDIBLE] tiles

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.402
that he can't see at the moment.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.360
The game will be a good
project for Projust Two

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.443
because, in my opinion,
not only does making plans

00:14:00.443 --> 00:14:02.890
based on incomplete
information and random events

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.600
lies at the heart of
the games mechanic,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.580
we implement a good set
of tradeoffs and balances

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.038
between the different
terrains that

00:14:08.038 --> 00:14:10.230
serve to offer the player
meaningful, consequential

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.384
choices of which path to go.

00:14:12.384 --> 00:14:14.800
In the digital version, in
addition to the core game play,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.009
we seek to add randomized
map generation and multiple

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:18.466
characters with
different abilities

00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:19.837
to further enhance the gameplay.

00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:21.920
We'll stay with a 2D game,
the grid representation

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.640
of the world, and turn
based actions, as opposed

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.460
to continuous work over
the time game plan.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.038
Thank you.

00:14:30.979 --> 00:14:32.270
PROFESSOR 1: Beaver Evolutions.

00:14:41.372 --> 00:14:43.080
STUDENT 7: All right,
so Beaver Evolution

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.430
is exactly what it sounds like.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.130
You have a colony
of beavers, and you

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.940
have to fight against nature
and evolve your beavers

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.950
over generations to
survive against the trials

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.630
and tribulations that
nature will throw at you.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.320
The core mechanic
of the game is based

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.570
around making a choice between
three different options

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.090
for every generation.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.500
You can either build your
exam, popular beavers,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.880
or choose an evolution
traits help develop you

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.880
colony to fight against the
natural disasters that will

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.790
try to hinder your progress.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.590
Our game is going to be a
great game for Project Two

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.710
because we have a lot of
ideas for implementing it

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.980
in a real time world,
currently as a turned based

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.870
game were you make a
choice and then you

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.900
respond to a natural disaster.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.890
We think that it'll be great
to implement a real time

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.810
game because you will be able
to respond to natural disasters

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.113
and allocate your beavers
to either work on you

00:15:37.113 --> 00:15:38.590
dam or work on evolving.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.590
And you have to have
quick reflexes in order

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.928
to survive through the
game and win the game.

00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:45.428
Thanks.

00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:49.766
PROFESSOR 1: Comcastic.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.570
STUDENT 8: Hello.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.779
Comcastic is a cable
monopoly simulator

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:03.070
where you are trying to place
your oddly-shaped service

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.554
centers into an
existing city landscape.

00:16:05.554 --> 00:16:06.970
Your goal is to
make as much money

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.707
as possible while caring about
your customers' satisfaction.

00:16:10.707 --> 00:16:12.290
STUDENT 9: So in the
digital prototype

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.772
we're basically going to have
a grid where all the homes

00:16:14.772 --> 00:16:16.480
and businesses are
laid out, and the user

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.480
will see the inconvenient-shaped
pieces for your service

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.420
centers.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.110
And then, when they
select a center,

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.260
they will see how many
people it can serve

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.280
and the price that it'll
cost them each month.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.410
And then, they will need to
place these on the board.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.120
STUDENT 10: We think this is
a good project for our Project

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.055
Two because we've found
that playing the game

00:16:36.055 --> 00:16:38.860
and creating the game
is both very simple.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.940
And we found that it
was really engaging.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.720
We had a few random
testers kinda

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.740
describe it as a strategic
version of Tetris, basically.

00:16:53.067 --> 00:16:54.400
PROFESSOR 1: Sparkly Redemption.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.890
STUDENT 11: Boosh!

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.270
You're a lady with only
one arm, and your other arm

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.641
is a gun that shoots things.

00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:07.849
You're a disgrace in your
nation and your only chance

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:09.984
at redemption is to get
all of the sparklies.

00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:11.900
However, the place where
all the sparklies are

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.280
are filled with monsters.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.440
And depending on which
sparklies you pick up,

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.235
sometimes you get
better arm gun powers,

00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:19.299
but sometimes the monsters
change their behavior

00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:21.220
and you have to adapt
to that, or just

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.910
be strategic about
picking up your sparklies.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.460
Our game is super cool because,
even with our simple paper

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.800
prototype version, people
had a lot of fun with it.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.660
And the sort of game
that's pretty easy

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.320
to implement at a most basic,
just fun to play stage.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.420
But then it's good to
add stuff on top of it,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.546
like extra monster behaviors
and super shooty arm powers.

00:17:38.546 --> 00:17:41.000
Plus you're a lady
with one arm and a gun

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.908
that shoots thing,
which I think is cool.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500
PROFESSOR 1: Modgi Dice.

00:17:52.587 --> 00:17:53.670
STUDENT 12: Hey, everyone.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.580
So Modgi Dice is a math
puzzle game like Sudoku

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.300
or 2048 where the user navigates
a dice around a square grid,

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.000
rolling the dice
one side at a time,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.916
and adding that side
of dice to the square.

00:18:04.916 --> 00:18:06.290
The cool mechanic
of this game is

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.530
that each square is modular
7 and the goal of the game

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.080
is to reset all of
the squares to zero.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.960
This game will work
well for Project Two

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.652
because it is a fast paced
mover game kind of like 2048.

00:18:16.652 --> 00:18:18.860
And you can move those around
very quickly while also

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.090
having to plan out your moves.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.005
Thank you.

00:18:25.472 --> 00:18:26.680
PROFESSOR 1: City Evacuation.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.775
STUDENT 13: In City
Evacuation, your goal

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:39.316
is to escape the
city because there's

00:18:39.316 --> 00:18:40.650
an earthquake in your city.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.960
And you have to do
that while saving

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.456
three friends along the way.

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:45.955
And what will happen
during the game

00:18:45.955 --> 00:18:48.025
is you might get
hit by an explosion,

00:18:48.025 --> 00:18:52.424
or abridgement fall down, or
you might have some [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.090
STUDENT 14: As far
as the digital scope,

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.290
we're going build
a 2D game that's

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:59.990
dependant on your dice roll and
will generate random disaster

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.190
cards that will come
up and the hardest part

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.500
will be the graphics.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.230
STUDENT 15: We think this is
a good project for number two

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.830
because there's a
lot of randomness,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.784
but we also give the player
tools to plan and strategize

00:19:09.784 --> 00:19:10.549
around that.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:12.840
Additionally, people thought
it was really fun to play.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.429
And though it's sort of simple
to implement at the beginning,

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:17.470
we think there's amble
challenge in the graphics,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.300
the sounds, and the
animations that can be

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.222
built on top of that framework.

00:19:22.222 --> 00:19:23.198
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.880
Shoutkey.com/doorway?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.640
STUDENT 16: All right,
the next 12 hours,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.397
our game is called
Shoutkey.com/doorway.

00:19:36.397 --> 00:19:37.980
Here's the idea--
you're playing World

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.805
of Warcraft--
sorry, Warcraft 3--

00:19:39.805 --> 00:19:42.330
and you see that guy with
the second and a half ping,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.740
and you get really jealous.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.660
Man, I wish my ping
were that high.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.355
So then you start
encouraging your pet

00:19:47.355 --> 00:19:50.100
to chew on your ethernet cables,
get those dropped packets.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.420
You really want that
slow, unresponsive feel.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.930
So we take that
desire and mix it

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.190
with a platformer to make a
really frustrating game where

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.310
as you play it, your
controls become increasingly

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.510
unresponsive.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.931
And I think it's
hilarious and fun.

00:20:04.931 --> 00:20:05.555
Yeah, it's fun.

00:20:05.555 --> 00:20:06.818
Yeah.

00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:09.313
Shoutkey.com/doorway.

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:10.311
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.315
Lost Underground.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.000
STUDENT 17: So,
Lost Underground.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.185
You are a traveler and
you fall down a hole,

00:20:29.185 --> 00:20:31.780
and you get lost in
an underground mine.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.300
So the goal of the game is,
equipped with some bombs--

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.940
infinite amount of
bombs, because that's

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.520
just how games work--
you're supposed

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:46.560
to escape from the underground
by planting bombs and trying

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.150
to move through barriers
that you can clear.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.050
The randomness comes in with the
addition of some of ghost bombs

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.720
that will be floating around.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.820
And they will not chase you,
but they would go through you

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.590
and would explode
at random moments.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.270
So you have to plan around
getting to the end of the level

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.750
and also not dying
before you get there,

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.110
which is common in a game.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.320
This is a good project
because it's simple

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.310
and it's sort of
reminicent of Bomberman,

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.312
which is a great game.

00:21:15.312 --> 00:21:17.240
So, yeah.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.614
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:21.440
Dice Traders.

00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:30.990
STUDENT 18: Dice Traders
is a multiplayer card

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.050
game where you play a card
combo in order to score points.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.450
Importantly, you can trade
your cards with other players

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.784
in order to improve your combos.

00:21:37.784 --> 00:21:40.033
But if you do that, you might
be giving your opponents

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:41.000
what they need to win.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.690
And so this introduces a lot
of strategic considerations

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.301
about things like what
your opponents score is,

00:21:47.301 --> 00:21:49.300
how large there hand is,
and so on and so force.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.841
And you have to keep all of that
in mind when you're playing.

00:21:51.841 --> 00:21:54.810
And our playtesters really
enjoyed the complex strategy

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:58.010
that arose from these
simple elements.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.290
It would be good for Project
Two because the mechanics

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.370
are very simple,
which would make

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.630
the game easy to implement.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.560
However, it is designed
as a multiplayer game,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.830
so it would require
some sort of AI.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.206
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:15.944
And, last but not
least, Gravity Shift.

00:22:15.944 --> 00:22:17.360
That is the last one, right?

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.580
Nobody else?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.080
All right.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.121
STUDENT 19: So our idea
was for a puzzle platform

00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:23.810
with the following
characteristics--

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.380
it's a basic platform,
you have a guy

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.963
on one side trying
to get to the other

00:22:26.963 --> 00:22:28.220
with a bunch of platforms.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.410
Unfortunately for you,
the platforms are all

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.960
spaced so that it's completely
impossible to reach them

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.750
fortunately for you, you
can place a number of blocks

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.630
anywhere you want on the stage.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.322
Unfortunately, again,
they all cost points

00:22:40.322 --> 00:22:42.030
and you'll lose points
if you place them.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.020
And every time you land on
a space, it'll disappear.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.610
The twist is, once you
get to the end of a stage,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.650
everything will
rotate 90 degrees.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:52.110
All your platforms will
become walls and vice versa

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.619
and you'll have
to make it again.

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:55.910
If you weren't ahead, then
the second part of the stage

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.530
will not possible, which is why
it requires the actual thinking

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.976
ahead to solve the challenges.

00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:04.350
The reason that this would be
a good idea for Project Two

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.440
is because it's a
pretty basic idea,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.420
but it's actually a
deceptively difficult game,

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.600
and it's really easy
to make a stage that's

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.910
really hard to solve.

00:23:17.687 --> 00:23:19.270
PROFESSOR 1: OK,
that was really good,

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.060
you all kept to under a minute.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.830
Next up, we're going to
take five minutes, set up

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.616
your games, try to
put a lot of space

00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:29.740
around where you're set up.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.690
I know it's going to be hard.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.150
But put enough
space around where

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.150
you're set up so people can
watch what you're doing.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:44.190
Take one of these Post-its and--
how the hell do these work?

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.940
There we go.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.930
Oh, yeah.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.000
Take one of these
Post-its, put your name

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.150
on it wicked big, planted
down on your table

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.670
so we know what
we're looking at.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.010
So set up your games, all
the stuff that you might need

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.345
is up here in these two boxes.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:14.820
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.840
The goal is to make the
[INAUDIBLE] geological center.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.582
So you roll the dice--

00:24:28.582 --> 00:24:29.540
PROFESSOR 2: All right.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.570
It's about time,
so thanks everyone.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.220
And first of all, all of you
have playable prototypes.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.742
So for Project One go you.

00:24:41.742 --> 00:24:42.700
You were totally there.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.360
A couple of things that I wanted
to say about all the projects--

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.900
actually we expected
that a lot more projects

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.640
were going to be vastly out
of scope than we actually got.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.170
A lot of stuff that we saw
here could actually just

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.200
be fine for Project Three.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.730
A lot of games that we saw here,
once you're a little bit more

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.420
comfortable with the technology
and the build process--

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.280
and in some cases, it's going
to be just the efficiencies

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.960
of knowing the people on your
team a little bit better--

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.820
you'll be able to execute any
of these games for something

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.390
like Project Three.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.620
But we would like
to actually guide

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.390
this next step where we move
from Project One to Project Two

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.260
a bit of a better.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.380
So we are going to cut
a couple of projects,

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.090
just to make the team building
process go a little bit faster.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.640
Otherwise, having to
select which one of the 15

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.730
projects that we're
going to carry on

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.610
is just going to
take way too long

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.590
than we have class session.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:47.870
But we didn't do it
completely arbitrarily.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.882
We're going to talk
about our concerns.

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:53.090
If you're one of those games
that we're going to cut,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.730
and you really, really want
to do that for Project Three,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.370
I want you to use the
time over Project Two

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.105
to think over your design and
see how you will address all

00:26:01.105 --> 00:26:03.480
of these concerns while you're
working on somebody else's

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.760
project too, because we
saw a lot of really, really

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.400
good stuff here today.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.730
Let's see, so a couple of
games that we're cutting.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:19.150
Gravity shift we are going to
cut that because the randomness

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.140
isn't really integrated into the
design at this point in time.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.570
Again, think about
it, figure out

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.090
how you would do that
for Project Three.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:32.300
I actually had a concern
about the UI of the game,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.170
because a lot of these
games-- sure, some of you

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.210
are working in Unity
3D-- that seems

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:42.690
to be a game that UI wise seems
to suggest that it should be

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.380
a 3D game, because you need to
know what the sides of the dice

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.200
are before you roll things.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.800
But how do you convey
that to a player

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.175
in a way that's
not going to have

00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:53.105
them to deal with a camera?

00:26:53.105 --> 00:26:55.860
And you could also
do it in 2D, but then

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.000
how to convey that
information to the player?

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.372
PROFESSOR 2: Yes.

00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:03.372
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:04.330
PROFESSOR 2: Oh, sorry.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.010
That was the feedback
I had for Modgi Dice.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.820
My mistake.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.590
Sorry, I did, in fact,
get that mixed up.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.020
For Gravity Shift,
the UI problem

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.172
was how do you
convey to your player

00:27:17.172 --> 00:27:18.880
which way things are
going to shift next?

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.379
Right?

00:27:19.379 --> 00:27:22.670
Is it relative to the player,
or the relative to the level?

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.315
When the gravity shifts, are
you rotating the entire level

00:27:25.315 --> 00:27:28.085
or are you rotating the players.

00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:30.500
Now the player's falling
sideways on the screen.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.442
These are all like
big UI challenges.

00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.400
Assignments we actually
happens to be about UI,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.947
so that's a good time to
be able to tackle that.

00:27:36.947 --> 00:27:37.780
So think about that.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.460
Sorry-- sorry to Modgi Dice.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.800
PROFESSOR 1: For project
three, though, for that one,

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.750
still bringing in the
randomness and actually bringing

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:45.560
in the design constraint
for project three

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.130
will be important for that one.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.050
PROFESSOR 2: Yep.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:55.480
OK, then for Final
Flight and Dice Traders,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.360
we have very similar feedback.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.710
Right now, your design
is specifically--

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.810
the fun of your games are really
in the multiplayer right now.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.310
That is absolutely fine.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.470
In fact, they are really,
really solid game designs.

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.730
The problem is that
project two is really short

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.860
and AI is time-consuming.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.020
It's not necessarily hard.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.190
It's just going to take
a lot of time to work on.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.910
So we're going to say let's
not do that on project two.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.700
You might want to save
that for our project three.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:33.430
Finally, for two more games,
for City Evacuation and Doorway,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.740
actually, technically,
both games are feasible.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.330
I am actually fairly
confident that the games

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.070
that you showed today
could be done in the time

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.230
span of project two.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.180
However, I feel that a lot
of the fun in those games

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.730
comes in multiple
levels-- being able to get

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.880
different environments
and different scenarios.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.640
And that's going to be very
time-consuming, which you don't

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.180
have time for in project two.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.585
So it's an evaluation.

00:29:00.585 --> 00:29:02.790
It's kind of like the
size of your level

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.000
and all of your elements
that you've got in it.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.810
It's just going to take
a lot of man hours just

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:14.340
to be able to generate one
map, let alone multiple maps.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.830
Doorway, it seems
to me that playing

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.040
through one round of
the game on a computer

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.996
can go through pretty quickly.

00:29:20.996 --> 00:29:22.150
Actually, where's Doorway?

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.700
I like to make eye contact.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.210
Yeah, there.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:24.710
OK.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.543
It seems to me like
playing through a level,

00:29:26.543 --> 00:29:28.080
at least the first
couple of levels,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.190
could go through pretty
quickly, which is fine.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:34.412
Players like that, especially
when they're wrapping up right

00:29:34.412 --> 00:29:35.620
at the beginning of the game.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.110
But that means you have to
generate a lot of levels.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.970
And that's just a lot of
time that you don't have.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.800
So for the rest of
the projects, we're

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.010
going to put them up around.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.060
And we are going to ask
you to put your names using

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.500
the little Post-its to show
which team you're signing on.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.790
But I still have more feedback,
because the other games

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:02.210
have challenges that you're
going to have to overcome too.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.970
Dragon's Lair, there,
so much information,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.850
so much information for players
to have to understand what's

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:09.460
going on.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.600
How are you going to convey
that over to a player?

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.990
The good news,
your information's

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.860
relatively static.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.650
It's not like you have numbers
changing in the middle.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.510
[INAUDIBLE], you do
have numbers changing

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.660
in the middle of the
game-- so many numbers, so

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.280
many little variables
and factors.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.820
So how are you going to
convey all of that information

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.540
to a player?

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.790
So you have a UI
challenge there.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.010
Beaver Evolution.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.700
There's a-- Beaver Evolution?

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.000
Beaver Evolution.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.440
You have a range of
possible bad things

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.250
that could happen to a player.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.930
How do you explain
that to the player

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.510
before it actually
happens to them

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:48.020
so that you can sort of like
anticipate and plan, right?

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.020
You could say, oh, well.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.540
They'll play it through
once, and then they'll die,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.956
and then they'll
restart the game.

00:30:51.956 --> 00:30:53.740
That's not a great solution.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.920
Think about something
better than that.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.695
Comcastic-- Comcastic,
very specifically

00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:03.070
is a UI problem,
because how are you

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.160
going to show the
players what they're

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.966
about to put down on
the screen, and then

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:10.340
show them the consequences of
what they've just put down?

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.100
Because your game is all about
how do I rotate this thing

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.500
and then figure
out where it goes

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.490
and what's going
to be the outcome,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.400
your problem's
mostly user input--

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.680
how to get user input in game.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.530
And Modgi Dice, I
already mentioned it.

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.370
How do you do this in 2D?

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.750
It's-- yep?

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.850
Is that a hand?

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.350
Oh, sorry.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.480
I thought you were
putting up a hand.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.320
How do you explain
to the player if you

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.020
rotate it, the
dice, this way, this

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.730
is a number that's going to
be coming up, versus that way?

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:45.320
If you're going to
do it in 3D, fine.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.730
But 3D's at least twice as long
in terms of development time.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.200
So you have to
keep that in mind.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.740
For Blind Aliens and
Sparkly Redemption,

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.690
you're going to
need some art just

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.530
to be able to convey to players
what the heck is going on

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.600
in your game.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.890
The good news is that as
long as you have some art,

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.020
I think you can make it work.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.030
But that's going to
be your bottleneck.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.840
That's going to consume
up all of your time.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.280
Things that we feel
that can probably

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.880
work that we're
fairly confident is

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.530
within the scope of this project
include Lazy Beaver, Live On.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.440
Lost Underground.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.600
Some of these games resemble
other games that exist,

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.870
so you already have kind of
like a template to work on.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.430
For some of the games,
the paper prototype

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.070
really kind of already
gives you a pretty good idea

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.860
of how the computer
game is going to work.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.670
So I'm not too worried about--
if your game just ran on text,

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.060
it could still be
comprehensible.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.840
So I'm not so
worried about that.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.080
But so these are the games
that we have short-listed.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.080
Not all these games necessarily
become project two games,

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.790
because we've got-- one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.750
eight, nine, 10-- 10.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.607
And we're hoping
for teams of six.

00:33:09.607 --> 00:33:10.690
PROFESSOR 1: Teams of six.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.401
PROFESSOR 2: We do not have
60 people in a classroom, OK?

00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:13.901
So--

00:33:13.901 --> 00:33:15.984
PROFESSOR 1: We have about
47 last time I checked.

00:33:15.984 --> 00:33:18.446
So about seven teams?

00:33:18.446 --> 00:33:20.070
PROFESSOR 2: About
seven teams, so that

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.260
means three of these projects
will have to get cut.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.290
And we'll probably
just cut them based

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:28.630
on whether they have enough
people on the team, which

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.280
means then the people who
have signed up on those teams

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.130
will have to find
some other team.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.769
Now, that's going to
be really obvious.

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:36.310
Once you have your
Post-its up there,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.768
you're going to
see how many people

00:33:37.768 --> 00:33:39.010
have signed onto each team.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:45.130
And we want you to try to get
to a team of at least five.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.530
Six is good, OK?

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:52.530
PROFESSOR 1: So team formation.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.320
Come on down.

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.080
Put your name on a Post-it.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.310
You do not need to choose the
game you were on previously.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.030
Once you've put your
Post-it down, sit back down.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.210
Sit down.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:13.819
Come on back.

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:14.360
Come on back.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.679
We'll read off the names and
we'll see how this is going.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.320
Come on back.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:19.969
Come on back.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:22.566
Come on back.

00:34:22.566 --> 00:34:23.690

AUDIENCE: What's up?

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.530
PROFESSOR 1: Did

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.302
AUDIENCE: I did, yeah.

00:34:26.302 --> 00:34:27.635
PROFESSOR 1: Then sit back down.

00:34:27.635 --> 00:34:28.730
Sit back down.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.553
Sit back down, back down.

00:34:31.553 --> 00:34:33.469
AUDIENCE: Can I add my
name if there's already

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.139
six on something?

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:34.679
PROFESSOR 1: Yes, you can.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.699
It just means you're
going to get moved

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.089
or somebody's
going to get moved.

00:34:37.089 --> 00:34:39.940
OK.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.769
If you're not decided, you can
sit down with your name, too.

00:34:43.769 --> 00:34:44.622
All right.

00:34:44.622 --> 00:34:45.330
Everybody's down?

00:34:48.414 --> 00:34:48.914
All right.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.250
Lazy Beaver, sorry to say.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.910
Maybe we'll see you
in project three.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.430
We've got three, three,
three-- no, wait.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:03.883
That's more than three.

00:35:03.883 --> 00:35:07.110
Three, three, three and two.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:11.730
And we've got one, two, three,
four five; one, two, three,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.110
four, five six, seven.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.290
The Future-- maybe
you're moving.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.186
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:35:22.186 --> 00:35:23.530
eight, nine-- oh, my god-- ten.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.810
We're cutting that with two.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.762
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:35:26.762 --> 00:35:27.750
You're OK.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.460
One, two, three, four, five.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.060
All right.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:37.400
So Blind Aliens is set with
Roy, [? Mikael, ?] Miriam,

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.210
[? Shalam, ?] [INAUDIBLE],
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.070
Apologies if butchered the name.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.885
Blind Aliens, you're done.

00:35:45.885 --> 00:35:47.760
Where there any other
sixes that I'm missing?

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.259
No.

00:35:48.259 --> 00:35:54.479
OK, so the big ones, Comcastic--
one, two, three, four, five,

00:35:54.479 --> 00:35:55.210
six, seven.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.430
We need at least one to leave.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:58.750
Is that you, Sam?

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:00.900
Maybe it's Matt.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.910
Julia?

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:02.900
Sabrina?

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.320

Derek, I said big letters.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:21.643
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:22.996 --> 00:36:25.660
You're lucky I'm wearing these.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.875
Anybody I just
named, come on down.

00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:28.375
Move.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:34.830
You have a couple minutes
to discuss down here.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.940
So Modgi Dice, come over here.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.140

00:36:59.628 --> 00:37:00.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:00.912 --> 00:37:01.620
PROFESSOR 1: Why?

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.923
Why do you want people?

00:37:02.923 --> 00:37:04.988

very nice people.

Come on.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.980
All right.

Sparkly Redemption,

00:37:49.844 --> 00:37:51.510

Lost Underground,

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.060
We need one of you
to self-destruct.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.860
Come on down if you
want to self-destruct,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.092

We've got one, two,
three that we're rolling.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.510
We've got a 6-sided die.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:50.860
How should I do it?

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.645
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.117
PROFESSOR 1: It's cool.

00:39:11.117 --> 00:39:12.450
You could do it for project two.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.040
Come on down.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.494

PROFESSOR 1: What's up?

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:19.830
Aha.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.030
All right, that's six.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.960
It's done.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.290

you've been redeemed.

One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.800
Plunder Winds, you are all
set to go, to sail away.

00:39:55.095 --> 00:39:56.720
How many more of
these do I have in me?

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.760
We do have uneven numbers.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.670
Life is unfair.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.035
Randomness, people, randomness.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.480
One, two, three, four, five.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.910
One, two three.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.790

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:25.854 --> 00:40:27.020
That's up to them to decide.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.353
But they can do it if they want.

00:40:28.353 --> 00:40:30.370
I don't recommend
it, by the way.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.807
But you can choose any one of
these that's on the board, too.

anything on the board?

three, four, five, six,

seven-- you've got
seven choices, so many.

00:40:45.875 --> 00:40:47.750
No, too many, too many.

No.

to join this one.

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:54.048
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:40:54.048 --> 00:40:55.424
PROFESSOR 1: Sorry.

00:40:55.424 --> 00:40:56.090
You were second.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.007
You were so close.

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:01.290
So don't choose this one.

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.060
And don't choose this one.

One, two three, four,
five, six, seven.

You've got Blind Aliens, Beaver
Evolution, Plunder Winds,

00:41:09.677 --> 00:41:10.510
or Lost Underground.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:16.430
All right.

PROFESSOR 1: You had
two for project one.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.200
You've got five for
project two I think you're

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.350
cheating somehow, myself.

Yes?

encourage, actually,

we ask people to move
around because [INAUDIBLE],

and we just give people spots
to regroup in [INAUDIBLE].

PROFESSOR 1: We meet as teams?

00:41:52.818 --> 00:41:55.626
PROFESSOR 3: Meet
at their team tags.

00:41:55.626 --> 00:41:58.760
And then find a place
in the room to sit down,

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.575
re-discuss vision statements,
and start planning out

PROFESSOR 1: So no.

Huh, you're right.

to do exactly as Sara said,

did because I was listening.

what we're going to do,

Talk about your schedule.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.290
Talk about your
vision statement.

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:38.520
Look at your prototype.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.090
Work on your
prototype some more.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.310
Re-write your vision
statement, and talk

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.590
about what it
actually means to make

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.330
a digital version of this game.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.080
So Sparkly Redemption.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.520
PROFESSOR 3: And
whatever you do,

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.639
do not forget to exchange
contact information.

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:54.680
PROFESSOR 1: Oh, my lord.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.320
PROFESSOR 3: Email--

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.497
PROFESSOR 1: Were you not going
to give each other your email

00:42:56.497 --> 00:42:56.997
addresses?

00:42:56.997 --> 00:42:59.181
PROFESSOR 3: Phone
numbers, whatever.

00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:00.180
PROFESSOR 1: Modgi Dice.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.150
Blind Aliens.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.240
Beaver Evolution.

00:43:15.757 --> 00:43:16.340
Plunder Winds.

00:43:24.805 --> 00:43:25.445
And Comcastic.

00:43:33.735 --> 00:43:34.735
This is the safe, right?

00:43:39.319 --> 00:43:40.732
PROFESSOR 2: That was fast.

00:43:40.732 --> 00:43:41.674
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:43:41.674 --> 00:43:44.007
No, it's one of the things
where you might not be happy,

00:43:44.007 --> 00:43:44.925
but it gets done.

00:43:44.925 --> 00:43:47.050
PROFESSOR 3: Hey, I think
you ran that really well,

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:47.551
by the way.

00:43:47.551 --> 00:43:48.508
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

00:43:48.508 --> 00:43:51.370
PROFESSOR 3: That was a hard
team formation, especially when

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:52.820
people had to jump ship.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.460
PROFESSOR 1: I wanted to just
put one of them on that one,

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.700
but I didn't want to be the
one placing people in teams.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.155
PROFESSOR 3: Yeah, and I think
that's the right way to do it.

00:43:59.155 --> 00:43:59.905
PROFESSOR 1: Yeah.

00:44:02.583 --> 00:44:03.083
What's up?

00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:04.070
AUDIENCE: What should
we do with the stuff--?

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.510
PROFESSOR 1: Oh yes,
someone just asked.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.260
What do you do with
the old prototype

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.610
that didn't get chosen?

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.180
Take pictures of it first.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.170
Set it aside.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:14.960
Maybe put it in an envelope.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.930
And then maybe it
might come back

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:21.020
for project three, so
don't forget about it.
