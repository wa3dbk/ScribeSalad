00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:23.510
RIK EBERHARDT: I
also had a couple

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.150
of students asking
me about, what

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.299
do you do after this class?

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:29.340
If you want to take more
classes in games, if you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.048
want to take more
classes in game design,

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:33.470
if you're thinking about
the spring semester,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.880
I just wanted to throw some
course numbers up here.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.290
So there's CMS.301.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.070
It's Introduction to
Game Design Methods.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.570
If you're interested
in design research,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.820
if you're interested
in design methods,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.110
and you happen to also
be interested in games,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.060
but you're likely going to
be doing things in design

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.010
elsewhere-- so that might
be application design,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.519
toy design, anything physical,
anything game-like, whatever.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.310
The methods they're
going to teach in there

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.143
are going to be useful
for all those things.

00:01:04.143 --> 00:01:07.540
But the class is focused on
using game design as a way

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.650
to talk about design
methods-- so CMS.301.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.420
CMS.608 is a class Phillip
teaches, and I co-teach

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.210
with him, on game
design-- so if you

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.390
want to know more about
how games are designed.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
Some topics we talk about
are things like game balance,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.400
tuning.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.690
The projects are all board
games and card games.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.390
So the entire class is done
with analog game design.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.180
So we can actually get more
detail into how rules work,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.989
how rules mix together.

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.280
We play a bunch of board games.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.400
We analyze them.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.776
And then we make board games.

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.650
It's very similarly
structured to this class.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.910
It's team-based.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.450
You'll do four game design
projects in that class.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.670
There is CMS.610.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.610
That is Media Industries and
Systems, the Art, Science,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.790
and Business of Games.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.130
That's taught by Chris Weaver
from Bethesda Softworks.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.669
He worked on the Elder
Scrolls series for a while.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.612
His class is focused on
the business and publisher

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:16.320
side of the equation
of game development.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200
So if you're thinking
about doing this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.164
as a professional
career, at some point

00:02:21.164 --> 00:02:23.330
you're likely going to have
to deal with publishers.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.140
Either you're going
to be working for one,

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.140
you're at a studio that
will be working for one,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.830
or you will be pitching
to one yourself.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.920
So the big focus of
that class is the pitch.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
How do you pitch your
ideas to another group?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.580
And it's also
focused on the demo.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.430
So if anybody's heard
of the term E3 demo--

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.280
basically how to make
your game look good

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.480
even though it doesn't work.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.980
Hopefully the game
works at the end.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.830
But it's really focused on,
what do you need in your game

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.980
in order to communicate
that game to another person

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.430
in order to provide
funding for your game?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400
So that's CMS.610.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.580
It's a really great course.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.280
He has a lot of really
good war stories

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.340
from what the game
development process

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.360
was like from the '80s on up.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.330
And then lastly, CMS.617--
Sara and I teach that course.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.070
It's called Advanced
Game Studio.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.450
It's basically an independent
study, but with teams,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.250
to make games.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.620
You spend the entire semester
making a single game.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.720
Sara and I act kind
of as your publisher,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.050
kind of as your mom and
dad, kind of as your mentor.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.140
Basically we are there to
help you make your game,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.240
and to help your game
from start to finish.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.950
But you have something
that you can either

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.200
submit to a festival, you
could show to another person,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.470
or put in a portfolio.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.990
Before you start this class,
you should be in a team already.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.790
So we'll be sending
emails out about this.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.820
We try to do a few
events in January

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.840
for networking and for people to
meet each other to form teams.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.340
But you could form
teams with people

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.170
you've met in this
class and other classes.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.960
I have a feeling that people
who took this class last year

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.370
are going to be looking
for teams for this year.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.470
So there'll be some
emails going out

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.450
around December and
January, and hopefully

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.149
one or two events going on at
the Lab in January about that.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.649
Yeah.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.190
And then if anybody
has any questions

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.307
about if you want to
minor in games at MIT,

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:25.390
if you want to do a
concentration in games at MIT,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.431
you can do that through
Comparative Media Studies

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.140
and Writing.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.160
You can talk to me
about that after class.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.230
You can also go to
the CMSW website

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.960
and talk to Rebecca
Shepardson about that,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880
and what the requirements
are for that.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.100
It's comparative media studies,
so it's multiple media.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.790
But games is one of
those media that you can

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.500
focus on and concentrate in.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.480
OK.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.360
So that is the advertisement
part of this class.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.230
So today we're going to
finish up team formation.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.550
I'm going to introduce the
Project 4 deadlines, which

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.164
I briefly mentioned last week.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:01.080
And then we're going to
start Project 4 today.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.730
You've got a lot of time
today to do brainstorming

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.140
and to do prototyping
in your teams.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.620
We're recommending,
because you're

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.840
going to have
eight-person teams,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.550
breaking up into smaller groups
to do some initial prototyping.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.360
You want to basically
think of this as

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.139
prototyping as a
means of brainstorming

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.305
to come up with lots of
different kinds of mechanics

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:21.510
and actually try those mechanics
out, and play with them

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.707
a little bit, before
you decide on one.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:26.415
We're giving you a
lot of time to do this

00:05:26.415 --> 00:05:28.680
this week because we want
you to have something

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.199
playable by next Monday.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.105
So that's that.

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:39.660
For teams, it sounds to me
like we had five topics that

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.020
were interesting to folks.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.130
Is anybody still interested
in the malaria topic?

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.070
OK.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.380
Not malaria.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.430
Why do you let me come
up here and talk to you?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.320
What was it?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.040
Ebola.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.680
Ebola, yeah.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.130
So nobody was
interested in that.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.510
All right.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.200
So I've got early warning
leading to early action

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.910
for heat waves, cholera
prevention and hygiene,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.800
forecast-based funding, SNAP,
and adapting to climate change.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.580
Even though we've
got five topics,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.550
that does not mean we need
to have one team per topic.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.920
We can have multiple teams
doing the same topic.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.000
And that's OK.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.250
So raise your hand if you
don't think you're on a team

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.670
right now.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.577
OK, that's a good
portion of you.

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:26.660
So what we're going to do
is, just like last time,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.160
we're going to break up into
groups based on the room.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.690
If you're interested in the
topic, go to that group.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.240
Talk with those folks.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.880
If you are in that group
and you signed off,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.890
you said that you are
definitely on this team

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.350
through the mailing list,
identify yourself to the group

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.060
as yes, I signed up for
this on the mailing list.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.690
This is what the team is so far.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.690
Here are the people on
this team right now.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.070
And actually, to help that
through, what I'm going to do

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.040
is put these on the board.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.700
And then I'll have
people who signed up

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.060
for that team come down first.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.930
And then everyone
else come down.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.720
So over here, let's
do heat waves.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:16.240
Over here, let's do cholera,
SNAP, climate change,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.620
and forecast-based funding.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.110
So if you are already
on one of these teams,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.340
and you've said this is
the team I want to be on,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.860
go to that area right now.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.000
Ah, whatever.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.500
That's OK.

00:07:49.516 --> 00:07:56.310
All right, so heat waves--
one, two, three, four, five.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.720
Cholera-- one, two,
three, four, five.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.220
Cholera?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.400
Six.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.180
Cholera, seven.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.220
Are you-- standing up--
anybody here on SNAP?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.890
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.470
OK, cool.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.800
If you're on SNAP, come on down
with the rest of the group.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.790
Adapting to climate change--
if you're on the team,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.040
or if you think you're
on that team-- OK.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.420
And then forecast-based
funding, if you think you're

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.070
on that team-- one, two so far?

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.070
AUDIENCE: Everyone who
thinks they're on a team,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.360
put their hands up.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.590
RIK EBERHARDT: OK.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.284
All right, so if we're going
to-- one, two, three, four,

00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:36.450
five, six, there's only six.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.030
OK.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:41.230
So move to whatever team
you're interested in right now.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.570
Talk with some folks.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.370
If you're on the team already,
talk about some of the things

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.140
that you talked about last
week, brainstorming-wise.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.714
If you want to be on that
team, talk with the members

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:55.630
and ask if you can be
on that team, basically.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.860
I'm going to check in
on you in ten minutes

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.460
to see what it looks like.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.752
AUDIENCE: Right now
it seems small enough

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:04.835
that we could be one team.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:07.160
Also Liz wants [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:28.339
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:29.380
RIK EBERHARDT: All right.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.819
After this amount of
discussion, how many people

00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:35.110
are still undecided about
what team they want to be on?

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.750
Kind of undecided?

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.210
Anybody else kind of undecided?

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.790
All right, so if you
are 100% decided,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.880
put your name on your post-it.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.350
Put it up on one
of these things.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.630
Do it really, really quick.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.170
Come up.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:50.670
Put it up.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.200
Sit back down, please.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.171
All right, so the dangers of
having more than 10 people.

00:09:56.171 --> 00:09:56.920
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:02.840
So in fact, there
is already dangers

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.490
of having eight people or more.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.280
But this class was actually
intended for you to actually

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.670
feel that pressure, right?

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.840
When you've got an
eight-person team,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.689
you're going to have
communication problems

00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:15.230
up the wazoo.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.250
That table might tip.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.000
Be careful.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.208
RIK EBERHARDT: It'll be fine.

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:19.076
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.410
Your laptop's on it.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.730
Once you get to a
10-person team, what

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.390
we've seen from
previous years is

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.750
that 10 people and larger
teams don't actually

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.980
outperform six-person teams.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.972
They actually get about
the same amount done.

00:10:34.972 --> 00:10:35.930
RIK EBERHARDT: Or less.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.221
PHILLIP TAN: Or sometimes less.

00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:39.820
Because the communication
overhead actually

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.890
breaks down further.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.560
You might get a lot
of content done.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.760
And it turns out to be
very uneven in quality,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.810
because you have multiple
people doing content.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.960
Now you could succeed
in breaking your team up

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.930
into little subgroups and be
able to organize yourselves

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.900
that way.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.210
But we've never seen
it done successfully

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.750
in this class with students
with your level of experience.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.070
So what we will recommend is
that if you've got something

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.930
like 12 people--
or 13 people, now?

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.680
RIK EBERHARDT: 13.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.430
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.520
You will probably get more done
by splitting into two groups.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.300
If you are deliberately
brainstorming in order

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:20.784
to take advantage of 13
people, then of course

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:22.450
you're going to come
up with a game that

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.529
can only be executed by a
very large number of people.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:30.070
What we're just saying is that
those games have traditionally

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.240
not done very well in our class.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.437
They may be functional.

00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:36.020
They may actually
deliver on the thing

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.410
that you intended to make.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.800
But we've seen six-person
teams do much more.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.790
Partly because they
iterate a whole lot faster.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.080
And they may have smaller ideas.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.660
But the ideas end up being
a whole lot more polished.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.320
So that's our advice to you.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.650
If they really want to
do a 13-person team,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.080
are we going to let them?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.600
RIK EBERHARDT: Um, wow.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.100
Yeah.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.480
PHILLIP TAN: Against
our better judgement.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.730
RIK EBERHARDT: Against our
better judgement, we might.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.970
But what we're going
to ask, I think, today,

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.640
is to break up into two smaller
teams for brainstorming.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.262
We actually want
all the big teams

00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:13.720
to even break up
into smaller teams

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.920
anyway to do some brainstorming
and to do some prototyping.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.990
Once you have all that
figured out, in class today--

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.090
by the end of class today--
you can decide how big

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.790
you want the team to really be.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.835
The one issue that
we have, though,

00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:26.959
is we've got some people
who are not in class today

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:28.220
who will be coming into class.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.928
We've got the three
that we talked about.

00:12:29.928 --> 00:12:31.560
There might be one or two more.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.290
If there are any other
people like that,

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.500
they will be automatically put
on the smallest of these teams.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.380
So I'd rather a
six-person in cholera

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.676
turn to seven, rather than
an eight turn into nine.

00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:47.300
Because these eight-person teams
are actually just good enough.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.610
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.020
The eight-person teams
are just about the size

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.170
that we were hoping for.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.650
Six-person teams, actually--
to be perfectly honest,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.000
I think the six-person
teams have an advantage.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.877
But that's just how
the numbers break down.

00:13:00.877 --> 00:13:01.710
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.150
When we have seen a 10-person
team actually work, what really

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.786
happened was it was 10 people.

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.160
Eight of them
worked on the game.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.515
Two of them worked on
the networking component.

00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:12.290
The networking
component did not work.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.279
Yet the game was
still as feature

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:16.070
complete as it could
be without networking.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.410
It could work without
the networking.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.240
That's not what
we're looking for.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.157
We want the game that
you are submitting--

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:25.740
the game that you're creating,
the design document that you're

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.690
submitting to us on Wednesday,
and the game that you're

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.030
playtesting on Monday--
to be the actual game.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.110
All those features
that you're saying

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.220
are going to be in that game.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.780
We want that to be the
actual game that you submit

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.160
at the end of the semester.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.500
So don't think of it as, well,
if two people flake, then

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.605
it's back up.

00:13:40.605 --> 00:13:41.220
It's not.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.240
If two people flake--
if you're too big,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.340
and you've got two people who
don't know what's going on,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.980
and they cause some
issues, it's just

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.771
going to be a disaster
for the entire team.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.860
So this year, all of the
Project 2 and Project 3 teams

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.700
were actually bigger than we've
done them in previous years.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.550
Previous years, they were about
four people, maybe five tops.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.840
And we had you do six and
seven, I think, right?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.010
Did anybody feel like with seven
people they got a communication

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.550
method that worked really well?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.365
Like already--

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.494
PHILLIP TAN: I see--
what was the method?

00:14:23.494 --> 00:14:24.428
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:26.763
It's not perfect.

00:14:26.763 --> 00:14:27.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.250
PHILLIP TAN: Yeah.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.774
It's the sort of thing
that-- whatever method

00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:32.690
you use will definitely
improve with practice.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.620
So if you've got something
that sort of worked well,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.320
that's something you try again.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.770
But the fact that most
people didn't should already

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.490
give you some warning
of what a large team is

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.560
going to feel like.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.500
It's going to be tough.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.580
RIK EBERHARDT: For the structure
of the class, on Wednesday

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.970
we're going to be talking about
more of the requirements--

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.800
the aesthetic requirements--
for Project 4.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.930
We'll have basically
another design discussion

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.440
next Wednesday.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.650
On Monday we're having a
short design discussion

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.030
about educational games.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.840
And then we'll have one
of our first discussions

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.550
trying to talk about some of
the person-to-person issues

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.642
we see in making games.

00:15:13.642 --> 00:15:15.350
In this case, it's
team dynamics, and how

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.704
to identify team dynamics.

00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:18.370
We'll have a couple
more talks like that

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:22.720
to kind of help you get used
to running in a bigger team.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.280
But between now and
next Monday, we're

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.030
hoping in class to
give you plenty of time

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.710
to actually work on some of it.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.876
One of the biggest issues
with working in a big team

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:33.484
is just figuring out,
what is that core thing

00:15:33.484 --> 00:15:34.650
that you're actually making?

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.310
What's the thing
that you're trying

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.260
to communicate to each other?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.440
We've talked about how
you can use the division

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.035
document for that, and how you
can use the actual prototype

00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:44.307
you make for that.

00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:45.890
But often, it is
just having everybody

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.172
in the same room at the
same time talking and just

00:15:48.172 --> 00:15:48.880
working together.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.074
So we're trying to give you
as much time as we can--

00:15:52.074 --> 00:15:52.990
PHILLIP TAN: In class.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.770
because it's hard enough to
get six people outside of class

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.730
to meet up, let alone
an eight-person team.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.240
Right?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.114
So we're going to give
you more time in class

00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:02.984
to meet up with each other.

00:16:02.984 --> 00:16:04.400
That does not mean
that you should

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.490
be spending all your
time in class planning

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.020
on getting your
face-to-face coding done.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.420
That's actually a waste of time.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.960
Because you could be
talking to each other.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.861
You can use it for
things like code reviews.

00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.110
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah, code
reviews, stand-up meetings--

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.818
things like that.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.520
All right.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.520
So we're going to put
this on hold for a second.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:32.040
I'm going to go over, very
quickly, the deadlines.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.290
And then we're going to
take a break and come back.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:40.640
So if this will move
forward-- all right.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.701
So why did I react so strongly
about the Animal Crossing,

00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:44.950
all these sorts of mini-games?

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.074
It's because of what we're
asking you to do-- whoa.

00:16:47.074 --> 00:16:48.190
Don't do that.

00:16:52.285 --> 00:16:53.660
So what we're
asking you to do is

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.530
create a small, fully
functional, polished browser

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.100
game.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.290
One of those many
games would count

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.121
as a small, fully functional,
well-polished browser game.

00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:06.579
And we're asking you to use
the design iteration techniques

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.467
you've used in the past.

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:10.300
What does that mean?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.341
We're actually talking
with the same design scope

00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:13.609
as the previous two projects.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.040
It's just you've
spent more time on it

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.040
to actually get it working
exactly the way you'd

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.020
want it to work.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.390
It may be slightly larger.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.420
So if your previous two products
had maybe one core mechanic

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.859
and one supplementary,
there might

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.359
be two supplementary
mechanics to that core.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.240
But that's about it.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.680
If you've got a game
that has an overworld,

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.160
then the overworld should
be the bulk of your game.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.640
If the mini-games that
you decide to make

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.600
are the same size as
that overworld in scope,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.420
that's already way
too over-scoped,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.420
if that makes sense.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.980
It's an eight week project.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.020
You've got about two weeks to
concept and prototype multiple

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:53.780
game experiences.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.360
So what we're asking for today
and tomorrow, or on Wednesday,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.080
is you're not just
prototyping one game.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.730
You're prototyping lots and
lots of different little games.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.720
You're looking at
all of those games.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.136
You're actually
going to have time

00:18:05.136 --> 00:18:09.000
to spend on multiple
different prototypes,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.955
rather than just a single
prototype that you iterate on.

00:18:11.955 --> 00:18:13.330
So what we're
asking is if you've

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.160
got an eight-person
team, break yourself

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.210
into two groups of four,
four groups of two--

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.050
create some really small,
board-gamey-looking things,

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.682
some very small interactions.

00:18:22.682 --> 00:18:23.640
Maybe they're playable.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.390
Maybe they're something
you just describe.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.239
But really go big blue sky.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.280
And try to think of all
the different things that

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:29.780
can happen.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.640
Because these topics that you're
dealing with are very large.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.922
Make sure that your design
is grounded-- very, very

00:18:36.922 --> 00:18:38.630
well-grounded-- in
the sources that we've

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.064
been given by the client.

00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:41.480
There's going to
be multiple times

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.040
that they'll be here
to see your games

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.610
and talk about your games.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.762
They'll be on your email,
so that you can ask them

00:18:48.762 --> 00:18:49.970
questions about that as well.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.930
So design constraints--
use all the mechanics

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.870
that we've been
practicing in class

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.470
with your previous projects.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.130
PHILLIP TAN: Not all of the
mechanics simultaneously.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.300
Use any of those mechanics.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.084
RIK EBERHARDT: Any
of those mechanics.

00:19:04.084 --> 00:19:05.250
So it could have trade-offs.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.291
It could have randomness.

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:07.910
It is not required to have both.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.324
It's required to have whatever
it takes for the topic

00:19:11.324 --> 00:19:13.740
that you're working on, whatever
makes sense for the topic

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.698
that you're working on.

00:19:14.698 --> 00:19:18.916
Those top two tend to be in the
realm of what those topics kind

00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:20.040
of lean themselves towards.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.910
But if you find
something else and you

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.400
want to use that
something else, great.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.830
Spend some time
really working on it.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.580
Spend a couple weeks
working on it before you

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.474
make a full commitment.

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:33.390
So your target audience--
each of those topics

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.670
has their own target audiences,
which they talked about.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.900
The top three are the
ones to really focus on,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.900
depending on your topic.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.790
So Red Cross staff and
volunteers-- people

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.640
who are knowledgeable and
motivated about the topic

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.570
already, who just need a little
bit of extra information--

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.975
community organizers,
and then youth-- people

00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:53.600
who are motivated, but maybe not
knowledgeable about the topic.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.590
Again, the other requirements--
we are holding you to these.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.370
Maximum play length
of 10 minutes.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.590
Single or multiplayer game.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.100
Test your user interface well.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.460
It must use and play
audio for the player,

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.950
unless audio is absolutely
not required for your design.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.550
If you design really
does not need audio,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.560
then don't use audio.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.728
But a, if it's a web
browser experience,

00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:21.103
there probably
should be some way

00:20:21.103 --> 00:20:24.500
to use audio as a method of
getting feedback to the player.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.960
So it could be as simple as a
ding when something happens.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.907
And that's OK for this project.

00:20:29.907 --> 00:20:32.490
What matters to us is that you
have a unified aesthetic, which

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.752
we'll talk about on Wednesday,
what exactly we mean by that.

00:20:35.752 --> 00:20:37.960
And then also we're asking
you to give design thought

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.120
to spectating users.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.687
In the final
presentation, you're

00:20:40.687 --> 00:20:42.770
going to be presenting the
games on the projector.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.860
People are going to be watching
the game as it's being played.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.560
They should be able to
understand how the game is

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.727
worked, just by watching it.

00:20:47.727 --> 00:20:49.560
Maybe they might need
to watch it one or two

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.800
times to figure that out.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.980
But they should be
able to figure out,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.063
what are the things that
are going on in the game?

00:20:54.063 --> 00:20:58.370
And how are all those
interactions happening?

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.420
So your deliverables--
that was from up till now.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.440
So on Wednesday, turn in to
Stellar a high-level design

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.190
doc or "back of box"
copy-- the same form

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.394
we've been using previously.

00:21:08.394 --> 00:21:09.810
It's some kind of
vision statement

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.930
that says at this
point, these are

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.330
what we think the
features are going to be.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.230
If at any point you make a
significant design change that

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.500
says, our feature list
is going to change,

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.490
our game is going to
look different, update

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.710
that document.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:28.600
You have up until the end
of the semester to do that.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.000
And whatever you turn in--
whatever that document is

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.330
on the last day of class should
be what game you're turning in.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.280
So that document and
the game should have

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.410
the same features in there.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.370
But we would like to see any
changes that happen between now

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:42.870
and then.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.420
We'd like to see how those
changes happen and why.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.035
So reflect them in that.

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:50.079
On Monday, turn in
a product backlog.

00:21:50.079 --> 00:21:52.370
You're going to do a two-minute
presentation-- the core

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.710
of your game design idea.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.970
And then we're going
to do a playtest.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:22:01.060
On the 27th, we are going
to have at least one,

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.970
possibly two, of our
clients in on that day

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.860
to play those games.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.590
Jano and Jared--
both of them came

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.840
in for the first day of class.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.543
They were not in class
when Pablo was on.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.864
We are asking for some
kind of Sprint tasklist

00:22:21.864 --> 00:22:23.280
to be submitted
to Stellar weekly.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.030
What exactly that is is
completely up to you.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.270
We've given you a
format that we like.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.960
We've given you a method
that we know works.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.940
If you decide to
change that method,

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.390
let us know what you decided
to change it to and why.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.310
But whatever you
have-- every week,

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:38.700
I should be able
to go to Stellar

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.300
and see what tasks you have
to do for the next week's

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.100
worth of work.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.040
We are asking for
product backlogs.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.650
That's actually a concrete.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.026
Please give us a
product backlog.

00:22:50.026 --> 00:22:50.525
The

00:22:50.525 --> 00:22:53.310
Format you use for the product
backlog doesn't matter to us--

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.970
the feature list, if it's
a list of user stories.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.620
What matters is that all
the features that you think

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.280
are going to be in
the game are listed.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.470
All the features that are
done are listed as done.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.210
And you've done some
kind of estimation

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.910
on what size those features are.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:12.410
And then we're going to have
you do two-minute presentations

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.370
in class.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.420
And all these dates
are in Stellar,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.490
in the Stellar calendar.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.160
So the next two-minute
presentations

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.550
are also on November 12
and then November 26.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:27.220
Any questions so far
about any of this stuff?

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:27.910
All right.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.340
So the project is due on
Wednesday, December 10.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.940
On Stellar, turn in all
of your previous builds,

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.020
your written postmortems,
your design change

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.930
logs, your updated document.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.320
And this time we're asking
you for focus test reports.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.420
There are in-class playtests
on the 27th, the 5th,

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.470
and the 24th.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.369
Two of those can be used
for focus test reports.

00:23:49.369 --> 00:23:50.660
The other two must be external.

00:23:58.685 --> 00:23:59.310
And then, yeah.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.184
We're going to have
postmortem presentations.

00:24:01.184 --> 00:24:03.997
So on postmortem presentations,
instead of five minutes,

00:24:03.997 --> 00:24:05.330
you're going to have 20 minutes.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.420
We're asking for a polished
presentation of the work that

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.700
went into developing the
project-- all of the iterations

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.450
that you made.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.408
So we want to know about
your design iterations

00:24:15.408 --> 00:24:16.297
in this presentation.

00:24:16.297 --> 00:24:17.880
We also want to know
those five-- what

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.850
went right, what
went wrong, what

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.650
was interesting in the project.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.020
So that's about 10 to 15
minutes given on process,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.260
and team management, too.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.760
For all of your
games, someone who

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.760
hasn't played the game
before will play the game

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.710
live on stage.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.280
So that's basically
one way for us

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.880
to see somebody who hasn't
played the game before try it

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.360
out and see how it works.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.526
AUDIENCE: Who's in charge
of acquiring the person who

00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:47.505
hasn't played the game before?

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:50.130
RIK EBERHARDT: It's a little bit
of you and a little bit of us.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.171
We'll do the best we can.

00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:52.920
So we're asking
guests to come in.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.979
We're hoping our clients
are going to be in.

00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:57.270
Some of them might have
already seen your games before.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.250
Some of them haven't.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.670
If you have friends,
we actually suggest

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.590
you bring in friends
to come in and to watch

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.850
the presentations--
maybe not play your game,

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.300
but play somebody else's game.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.370
But we open the final
presentation to the public.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.680
We have a rehearsal
on Monday the 8th.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.090
And we have the final
on Wednesday the 10th.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.200
So on Monday the
8th, you don't need

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.150
to do the play the game
part of the rehearsal.

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.026
But you do need to do
a full dress rehearsal

00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:26.150
of the entire presentation.

00:25:28.642 --> 00:25:30.100
And the reason why
we're doing that

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.849
is we're going to give you
feedback on that, on what you

00:25:33.849 --> 00:25:35.390
might have missed,
and what we'd like

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:36.681
you to see in the presentation.

00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:40.110
And you've got a couple
days to apply that feedback

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.685
to your presentation and to
make it better, basically.

00:25:42.685 --> 00:25:45.110
And I think that's it.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.610
Yeah.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.380
That's all from the other day.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.244
So any questions about the
postmortem presentations?

00:25:52.244 --> 00:25:54.660
Previous years-- I'll send out
the link to previous years,

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.240
so you can see what
these tend to be like.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.740
But we've recorded
them in the past.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.040
So you can see what
other people have done.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.950
And that'll go to the
Announcements page on Stellar.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.350
All right.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.090
It's 1:50.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:10.100
Take a 10-minute break.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.590
Come back at 2:00.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.320
And work in your teams.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.710
PHILLIP TAN: So the
rest of class today

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.660
is pretty much for you to
figure out what is this project,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.955
and get working on who you're
going to be working with

00:26:23.955 --> 00:26:24.830
and things like that.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.450
So what we're going to first
do is the typical brainstorming

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.130
process.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.230
We're not going to guide
it so much this time.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.340
But just a quick reminder--
you want somebody

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.174
who is in charge
of facilitating it,

00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:36.340
which means reminding
everybody what the problem is,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:41.414
and also calling out people
who may have trouble getting

00:26:41.414 --> 00:26:42.830
their words in
front of the group,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.280
like people who are trying
to get in a word edgewise--

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.002
so basically moderating
a discussion.

00:26:47.002 --> 00:26:48.960
And someone, of course,
should be taking notes.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.420
We have our giant pads
of paper in front.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.590
You can use chalkboards.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.810
For the cholera team, we
suggest splitting in half.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.790
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:06.458
that your brainstorming team
is necessarily your game team.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:10.040
What we are thinking is
that after brainstorming you

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.450
will better know whether
your ideas can be

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:15.910
split into two projects or not.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.420
Given how many cards
disappeared on there, we really,

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.670
really, really recommend
that you split in two groups.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.650
But there may be a more
organic to split that.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.865
Because your ideas may
actually fall down on a more

00:27:27.865 --> 00:27:29.510
clearly defined lines.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.760
I noticed that you already did
some brainstorming up there.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.210
But think, what would you do
with half the size of the team?

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.020
Then after that,
have the discussion

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:43.140
about who is on which team.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.820
By the end of class
today, you should

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.244
know exactly who
is on your team,

00:27:46.244 --> 00:27:48.410
how to get in touch with
each other, what your email

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.000
addresses are, what
your phone numbers are,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.210
or instant messaging
handles or whatever.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:28:00.530
And make sure that
you've figured that out.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.320
Let's see.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.000
One thing that I wanted to
tack on to Rik's presentation

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.500
earlier about the expectations
for the postmortem--

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.820
we brought up the
person who has not

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.370
played your game before
coming up and actually playing

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:14.870
your game.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.430
And I know some of you
might be worried about that.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:22.680
Do be aware that however well
or badly that person performs,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.610
no matter how much
they like the game,

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.690
or completely misunderstand
what your game's about-- that

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.660
is going to be, at best, 1.5%
of your total semester grade.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:35.870
That's not really significant.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.970
It's not going to
really swing anything.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.830
So don't worry about it.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:44.750
But we are actually using those
sessions to gauge usability.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.400
To what extent have you
actually designed a game

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.640
to make your game easy
for people who've never

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.280
seen your game to get into it?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.950
These are the things that we
want you to be iterating on.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.324
These are the things that we
want you to be catching for.

00:28:58.324 --> 00:29:01.000
And without having a
real-life, high stakes--

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.010
there is going to be a
person who hasn't played

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.296
your game in front
playing your game--

00:29:05.296 --> 00:29:06.670
you may not take
it so seriously.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.635
So we want you to be
taking usability really,

00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:09.420
really seriously.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.296
That's why Rik said,
the scope of the game

00:29:11.296 --> 00:29:12.920
doesn't necessarily
need to be all that

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.170
different from the past.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.850
But the amount of polish,
the amount of time

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.480
that you've thought
through your UI--

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.910
it's what you should be
spending all your time on.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.170
Finally, we're going
to go a little bit more

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.900
into games for learning
in the next week.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.340
But one thing that we want
you to be thinking about

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.380
while you're brainstorming
is, of course,

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.069
what is the player doing?

00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:39.610
Now if you're trying to teach
something to someone, if you're

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.530
trying to get them
in a situation

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.450
where they're learning
about a certain concept,

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.480
it is ideal if the thing that
you are trying to teach them

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.337
is actually the thing
that they are doing.

00:29:51.337 --> 00:29:53.170
Now there's a couple
of other ways-- actual,

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.470
can we bring up
Constantine's slide?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:58.910
Sorry.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:00.660
The dongle's there, too.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.200
There are a couple
of other things

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.590
that you probably are
already considering

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:08.310
putting into your game.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.250
Things like, what is the theme?

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.840
I noticed the brainstorming
for the cholera

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.560
already started talking
about things like story line.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.607
So does the theme of the
game actually match not just

00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:23.190
the topic that you're
trying to teach,

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:28.100
but also the mechanics that
you're designing for it?

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.660
You want to be thinking--
and a couple of you

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.010
have already been asking--
about things like, who's

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:36.410
going to be playing your game?

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:38.170
What's the demographic?

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.790
Also be thinking,
what situation are

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.490
they likely to be playing in?

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.930
Are they likely to be playing
it on their own at home?

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.539
Is what you want to design for?

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:48.580
And you can specify this.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.022
You can say, this
is a game that's

00:30:50.022 --> 00:30:52.380
meant to be played by
an individual person

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.930
with an individual
computer on their own time.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.240
Or this is meant to
be played in a group

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.370
like the SNAP game
was played in a group,

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.130
in front of everybody else.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:14.940
And that, by the way, falls
into the framing idea.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.142
What is the context in
which someone's actually

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:18.350
going to be playing the game?

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.350
To what extent have
they played games

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.200
like what you're describing?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.830
If you are making some sort
of hard core strategy game,

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.390
to what extent do people need to
be familiar with strategy games

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.156
in order to be able
to play the game?

00:31:30.156 --> 00:31:32.070
Or do they just
need to be familiar

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.820
with things like Facebook
games, for instance?

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.230
Or do you really want to make
a game that doesn't assume

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.920
much play literacy at all?

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.320
You want to be looking,
of course, at the data,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.890
and that means all
of the material

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.389
that we provided you, as well
as any information that you're

00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:54.960
looking at in Google searches
or academic research,

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.620
or information that you're
getting from your domain

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.860
experts, from either the
Humanitarian Response

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.580
Lab or the Climate Centre.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.510
Is that right?

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.910
Yeah.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.130
So make sure that
we are representing

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:15.360
that as fairly as we can.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.660
Because this is a game,
you do have liberties to

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.850
at which point you can sort
of abstract out those numbers.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.500
Maybe they're not mathematically
very, very precise,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.954
because you're trying to get
a sudden feel of the game.

00:32:27.954 --> 00:32:30.120
And that, of course, goes
into the aesthetics part--

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.740
not just the graphical
aesthetics, but the way

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.740
how your game feels.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.400
If you're trying to represent a
really, really tense situation

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.980
on the ground, and the way
how your data model makes

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.200
it resolve makes it feel like
your game is really clinical,

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.890
and it's very, very easy
to deal with the situation

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.170
as long as you know the
tried and true formula,

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.700
then you're not accurately
representing the situation.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.420
Even though you may be
accurately using data.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.000
So make sure that
you're balancing

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.080
that aesthetic feel
together with the content

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.010
and whatever real world facts
you're putting into your game.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:13.330
Because these games are all
really about real world things,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.120
you might want to make sure that
your fiction and narrative is

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.680
something that's
not too fantastical.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.930
Or at least, if there is
a fantasy element of it,

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.580
it is the part that
has least to do

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:27.080
with the believability
of the things

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.690
that you're trying
to communicate.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:37.110
You can say that there is
a village or a city that's

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.060
dealing with a cholera
epidemic or something,

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:44.790
and that's not a real city
anywhere on a map of the world.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.260
But you can look at
that city and imagine

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.960
this could be a real city
somewhere in the world.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.170
You could go as
far as saying, OK,

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.125
this is like the dark ages
or something like that.

00:33:58.125 --> 00:33:59.500
Because the disease
has certainly

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.420
been around for a long time.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.670
But you want to be able
to keep reminding people

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.650
that this is a real thing.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.280
If you say that this is a
science fiction thing where

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.909
you're on a different
planet and it's

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.580
a completely different kind
of bug that behaves exactly

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.699
the same as cholera--
I'm starting

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.500
to feel that maybe the
fiction that you're

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.620
creating for your game is
undercutting what you're

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.500
trying to get this game to
do, which is to actually teach

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.194
something real.

00:34:24.194 --> 00:34:26.360
RIK EBERHARDT: To jump in
on the fiction narrative--

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.850
so things to think about.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.230
Your games are being played
by a specific culture--

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.550
people with a specific
cultural background.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.929
Especially the cholera
game will likely

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.370
be played by-- I
believe it was Ghana.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.370
Yeah, it's Ghana.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.719
So students who are in Ghana--
what kind of culture do they

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.659
have?

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.190
You're going to have
to research that

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.260
and figure that out
for those games,

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.230
to figure out what kinds
of common backgrounds

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.480
might they have that
you can talk about.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.000
For the heat waves
game, that actually

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.140
has more of a focus on Red
Cross volunteers and university

00:34:59.140 --> 00:34:59.910
students.

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:02.589
You can specify, we
understand that the people

00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:05.130
who are playing this game are
likely going to be from Europe.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.950
And they're likely going to
have this kind of background.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.720
When you're creating your high
level game design document,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.460
come up with what you imagine
your target audience to be,

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.992
so you have some kind of
cultural background to use.

00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:20.450
Again, you're
choosing fiction that

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.590
is going to be so
supportive and helpful,

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.780
and not fiction that
might be not known

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:27.090
or might undermine the idea.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.470
One thing to keep in mind
with the fantastical-- studies

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.760
have found that
some games-- when

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.630
it comes to pandemics
and outbreaks,

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.150
using the zombie fiction
actually can work sometimes.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.910
There is something to be said
about using a common fiction

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.260
that people know.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.920
People can say, all
right, I understand

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.390
how zombie pandemics work.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.556
Because I've seen all
these films about it.

00:35:50.556 --> 00:35:52.430
Whereas if you just told
me it was a disease,

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.910
I might not have
seen enough films

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:58.070
that had anything about how
disease actually spread.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.000
So really think about
what is your problem?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.680
What fictions might be useful?

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.025
What narratives might be
useful for the problem

00:36:04.025 --> 00:36:04.900
that you're fighting?

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.910
PHILLIP TAN: Use fiction to
keep the topics relatable.

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.659
And if that means drawing on
things in popular culture,

00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:12.200
that's great.

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.540
That's a tool in your hand.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.780
Don't use fiction
as a way to paper

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.520
over design problems,
which I've often seen.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.250
You know, if we set
this game in space,

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.100
then we can sort of skip over
all reality, or something

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.757
like that.

00:36:26.757 --> 00:36:28.840
When you're brainstorming,
make sure you know what

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.850
you're brainstorming about.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.240
Are you brainstorming mechanics?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.500
Is it about what people
are going to be doing?

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.980
Are you brainstorming what
the fiction is going to be?

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.180
I would say do a separate
brainstorming session

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.388
for each one of these things.

00:36:40.388 --> 00:36:42.232
Maybe just spend 10 minutes.

00:36:42.232 --> 00:36:44.190
You don't have to brainstorm
every single thing

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.310
that we're showing you here.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:50.430
You could brainstorm what is
they aim and impact that you

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.400
want to achieve in this game?

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.840
How are you going to do that?

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.170
Are all of you even
on the same page

00:36:56.170 --> 00:37:00.550
about what you want your
game-- the kind of change

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.730
you want to see in the world?

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.410
And that's going
to be your purpose.

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.590
That is going to be-- do you all
understand what this thing is?

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.200
A lot of it has been
defined for you.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.080
But I'm not guaranteeing
that everybody on your team

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.990
necessarily shares
the same idea.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.700
So the brainstorming process
might be able to get that out.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:23.050
And at some point in time
within the next couple of weeks,

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.681
you should have a
pretty good idea.

00:37:25.681 --> 00:37:28.180
You should have had a chance
to at least talk with your team

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.140
about every one
of these elements.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.380
This is a research
framework that's

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.060
been put together by one up
our colleagues, Constantine

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.720
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.197
I think we can put
a link to this.

00:37:39.197 --> 00:37:40.030
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.060
I'll post the slides, and this
particular slide, to Stellar.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.750
PHILLIP TAN: And
we might get back

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.210
to elements of this
later in the week.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.360
But right now, this is
just basically something

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.077
to help guide your
brainstorming.

00:37:52.077 --> 00:37:52.910
RIK EBERHARDT: Yeah.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.710
Aesthetics we're
recovering on Wednesday.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.584
Fiction we're covering
in a couple of weeks.

00:37:57.584 --> 00:37:59.000
PHILLIP TAN:
Finally, one reminder

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.260
about brainstorming-- if your
brainstorming session runs

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.790
more than 10 minutes,
you'll want to flip

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.307
your secretaries around.

00:38:08.307 --> 00:38:09.890
So that somebody
else is taking notes.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.040
Let the person who's
been frantically writing

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.320
things down actually
get their ideas in, too.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.340
OK?

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.882
We're not going to
time that for you.

00:38:17.882 --> 00:38:19.423
That's going to be
something for you.

00:38:19.423 --> 00:38:21.570
And once they've got their
teams, email, video game

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:23.440
bosses?

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.310
RIK EBERHARDT: Put
your vision statement--

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.450
it should have all your team
and all your member names in it.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.769
And that's due on Stellar
on the date that it says,

00:38:30.769 --> 00:38:31.310
on Wednesday.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.480
PHILLIP TAN: So put all your
names in the vision statement.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.060
The rest of class is yours.
