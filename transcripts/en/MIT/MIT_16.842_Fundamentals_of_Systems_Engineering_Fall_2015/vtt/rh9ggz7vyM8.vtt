OLIVIER DE WECK: Teamwork is
an essential part of the class.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
Because any great system
or product is really

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.070
the result of a
teamwork, where in a team

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.240
you have to balance
essentially your own ideas

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.530
and your own desires with
what your teammates think.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.740
And the dynamics
of successful teams

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.050
show that diversity
is important,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260
being able to openly
share ideas, also

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.040
the ability to compromise and
not always getting one's way.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.010
What we found over the years--
and I think this is also

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.580
supported by research and
scholarship in design--

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.600
is that the optimal
team size is about five.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.890
Four to six, maybe
up to seven people

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.240
is the ideal size of teams
for this kind of project.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.560
And why is that?

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440
If you create a
smaller team, you

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.150
have less diversity of ideas.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.940
And you also have less man
or brain power, of course,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.920
to get work done.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.670
Since once you decompose the
project into its elements,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.550
each of these elements
needs to be done carefully.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.960
So you want to
have a team that's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.560
large enough to do the work
within the time constraints.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.480
On the other hand, if
the team is too large,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.240
then there's a lot
of coordination,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.620
there's a lot of overhead.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.340
Just being able to meet whether
it's physically or online

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.600
becomes harder.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
And the efficiency of
the team goes down.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.780
And so we found that a team
size of about five people

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.128
is ideal for this
kind of a project.
