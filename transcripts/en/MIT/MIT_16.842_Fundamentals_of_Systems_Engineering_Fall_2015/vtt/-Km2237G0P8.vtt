OLIVIER DE WECK:
Assessing student work

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.540
as a team has
different challenges.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.390
Of course, the
first thing you do

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.600
is assess the output
of the team's work,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.150
whether that's a
requirements set,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.690
whether it's a set
of initial concepts,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.550
whether it's a
presentation that's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.790
given at a preliminary
design review,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.470
whether it's a physical
prototype that they present

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.230
as a team--

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.150
so that always should be the
first thing that is assessed

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.590
is, what is the net output
that the team has produced?

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.700
Within that, it is not
always easy to discern

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.920
what has been the
individual contribution

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.350
since the whole
purpose of the team

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.110
is that the sum that
comes out is greater

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.770
than the individual parts.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.410
So in the
best-functioning teams,

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.910
there is a magic that happens.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.740
There's a synergy that happens.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.660
There's an output
that's only produced

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.490
by these synergistic
interactions of all the team

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.990
members.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.200
In a sense, trying
to dissect, what's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.180
the individual piece
that everybody did,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.850
is countering this
idea of team synergy.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.350
That being said, we also
need to assess individually

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.240
the contributions and the
learnings of students.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.350
And we do this through
a couple of mechanisms,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.700
for example, a peer review.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.160
So you can do a
peer-review process.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.460
It's trickier in smaller
teams than in larger teams.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.920
But if it's done
properly, peer review

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.530
can be very effective in not
only helping one understand,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.230
who are the contributors?

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.930
And who are the free-riders?

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.820
This is always a
big issue in teams,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.000
is that the free-rider
syndrome, where

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.310
some team members contribute
significantly less than others.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.570
And this often can be
a source of conflict.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.690
And so understanding
this is important.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.850
But also, have other
mechanisms in the class,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.850
such as an individual
final exam, and then

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.210
the other written exam,
which is administered online.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.710
And the other thing
we started doing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.710
is oral exams, which
seems old-fashioned.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.800
But I have to tell you,
in 15 to 20 minutes

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.110
of a one-on-one
conversation with a student

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.720
at the end of the class,
you really learn a lot.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.160
You learn a lot
about what they've

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.700
learned, where they may
still have confusion

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.670
or misconceptions, and also the
feedback that they give you.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.250
So I highly recommend to do
oral exams if it's possible.
