OLIVER DE WECK:
Concept questions

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.740
are a fairly recent
instrument for checking

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.430
the understanding of students
in real time during the class.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.500
One way to administer
concept questions

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.570
is using clicker systems.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.640
They've been around
for several years.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.390
A concept question is
typically a very short question

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.600
that requires either
reflection, or some very simple

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.940
calculation, that can be
done in less than a minute.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.130
The concept question is intended
to surface misconceptions,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.040
but also alignment
and understanding.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.920
And I do administer the
concept questions using,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.230
in this case, Google Forms.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.110
But there's other ways to
do it, essentially providing

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.120
the students a very short URL--

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.250
a link that they can enter
either on their laptops, even

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.770
on their smartphones
or on their tablets.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.460
And usually, a concept question
is a multiple choice question.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.080
Sometimes, it's very easy.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.240
Sometimes, it's quite tricky.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.150
And I give the students
about 30 seconds

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.100
or so to think about it, work
out an answer, respond online.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.640
And then, once the
answer period is over,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.390
I display the
responses in real time.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.420
And what's nice about it,
in the context of a SPOC,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.520
it doesn't matter
where the students sit,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.360
whether they're with
you in the classroom,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.400
whether they're online.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.990
Everybody has the same link.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.810
So you're getting everybody's
responses at the same time.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.620
So it's a great
mechanism for engagement.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.330
Sometimes, everybody agrees--

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.520
100% or 90% agreement.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.590
Everybody chose
the right answer.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.560
And in that case, there's
not much discussion needed.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.080
Because it's clear
that it clicked.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.120
You know the concept
is well understood.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.680
My favorite concept
questions are

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.430
the ones where the answers
are all over the map.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.650
You have five possible
choices, and each of them

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
got close to 20%.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.250
That's great, because now, you
have a hook for discussion.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.550
So I would then,
if that happens.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.890
spend the next three,
four, five minutes

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.620
in the class
reiterating the concept,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.380
and then asking students,
who voted for A?

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.490
Who voted for B?

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.660
Why did you do that?

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.370
What was your opinion?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.590
And so you get a great
discussion going,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.110
which, again, can have
the in-classroom, and then

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.040
the online component, as well.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.840
We also use the chat during
those post-concept questions.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.890
And it's a great
way to activate it.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.150
And there's a
second reason I also

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.940
do concept questions,
at least one

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.740
during lecture, which is, it's
a great way to track attendance.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.280
And I'm up front with
the students about this.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.940
Because you can see the time
tag when students responded.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.790
So you know exactly who
responded to the chat

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.110
during the class.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.120
And I do use that for
participation grading.
