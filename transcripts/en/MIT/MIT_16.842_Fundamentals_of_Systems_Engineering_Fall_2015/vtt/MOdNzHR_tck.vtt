OLIVIER DE WECK: My
name is Olivier de Weck.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.920
And I'm a professor here at MIT
in the AeroAstro Department,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.100
also known as the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.400
And I've been in the
department since 2001.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
And my passion is
aerospace vehicle,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.180
anything that flies,
airplanes, rockets, satellites.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.020
And it's been my passion
since I was a kid.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.229
So I grew up in
Switzerland in the Alps.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.380
And the Alps, especially
in the wintertime

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.030
when it's a clear
night, are amazing.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.500
You look up at the night sky.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.080
And you can see the stars.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.850
You can see the Milky Way.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.920
And as a kid, it
really inspired me.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.250
I wanted to do
something with stars.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.680
Initially, I thought I was
going to be an astronomer.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.750
But then, I really
liked building things.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.720
And so aviation,
rockets, spacecraft

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.030
really became my passion.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.280
Later, I did my
military service.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.260
And I worked on planes, flight
operations, maintenance,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.370
repair, really learning
planes in and out,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.610
the engines, the hydraulic
system, the avionics,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.130
working with others
and pilots to keep

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.110
airplanes flying safely.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.480
And that really was the
origin of my passion

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.200
for systems engineering.
