00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.120
So at the end of the
class, there are really

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.760
two major forms of assessment.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.820
One is an online
written exam, which

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.040
is an exam where the questions
and the way to submit

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.050
the answers is fully online.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.600
And that link is
unveiled, and then I

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.270
give three to four days for the
students to answer this exam.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.330
It is an open book,
open internet exam.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.740
They can use any materials they
want, but no collaboration.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.670
So I don't have a formal
way to check for this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.400
but essentially it's
an individual exam.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.260
And by submitting
the answers online,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.040
again using for example a
mechanism like Google Forms,

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.750
you can relatively quickly
compare the answers and grade

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
these exams very
efficiently and also see

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.099
if there's any patterns.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.120
So this is a way to essentially
check individual learning

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.820
with all the materials at hand.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.610
The way I structure
the online exam

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.160
is a mix of multiple-choice
questions, essay questions,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.320
but also some calculations.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.150
And the exam starts with
some very easy questions

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.220
that can be referenced
in readings or materials

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.580
in textbooks,
interpretive questions.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.580
And then they get
progressively more difficult.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.080
And the last two questions--

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.830
in one of the questions,
I give them a calculation

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.230
that they have to do that has
a very non-obvious answer.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.580
And it's interesting to
see some students that

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.160
force an answer that's not
actually the right answer

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.480
because somehow they believe
that any question given

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.930
on an exam must have
this one correct answer.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.460
And other students scratch
their heads and say,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.250
I don't think this question
has the right answer.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.790
And so it's a very
interesting thing

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.080
because, in the real world,
you often get requirements

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.560
from customers that are
unrealistic or can't

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.730
be fulfilled.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.130
And so the purpose
of these questions

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.190
is to really get students
to think and connect

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.260
the material to
real-world situations

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.770
that they will encounter.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.197
In the last question, I
then ask about systems

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:41.530
engineering-relevant things
that have happened that they

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.060
might have seen in the news.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.430
So for example, one year I asked
about the Volkswagen emissions

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.130
scandal, which is very related
to system engineering, trade

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.770
offs between fuel efficiency,
cost, NOx emissions.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.000
It's very much current affairs.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.150
This year, I asked the
students about the problems

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.590
that Samsung experienced with
their Galaxy Note 7 batteries

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.690
and what is the root
cause of those problems.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.840
And how are those problems
related to the material

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.220
that we teach in class?

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.800
So I recommend that one
of the last questions

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.010
connect the students
with things that they're

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.540
seeing in the news.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.200
The oral exam is given either
in person in the same room

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.490
or through an online platform
like Skype or WebEx or Google

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.450
Hangouts.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.540
The quality of the
online experience,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.810
the image, the sound,
is generally so good

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.370
that there's virtually
no difference

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.900
between doing the oral exam
in person or over the web.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.740
And the oral exam is anywhere
between 15 to 20 minutes

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.910
per student.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.740
That doesn't sound
like a lot of time,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.190
but with well-structured
questions you can learn a lot

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.710
and have a great dialogue
with the students.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.640
I try to put the
students at ease.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.000
It is more a discussion
than a classical exam.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.160
Nevertheless, it's
a great way for them

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.320
to engage with the
material again,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.950
to engage with us as
instructors and TAs,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.769
and usually it sort of puts
a nice bow on the class,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.220
and it's a nice finishing
touch to the class.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.440
Logistically, the way
we do the oral exam

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.040
is we open up typically
one or two full days.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.380
So I have to reserve
a couple of days

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.010
on my calendar just
dedicated to the oral exams.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.690
And then there's
sign-up slots where

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.580
students can just sign up online
and show up at the right time.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.780
And it's been
working pretty well.
