00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.160
PROFESSOR: Many of you
have heard of MOOCs.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.850
They're very famous,
Massively Open Online Courses.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.760
MOOCs are very open and large
classes, often with thousands

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.210
or tens of thousands
of participants.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.160
And MOOCs are essentially
a big movement

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.350
to really democratize education.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.800
SPOCs are a little different.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.530
So 16.842 was run as a SPOC,
which stands for Small Private

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.730
Online Course.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.950
So like a MOOC, a SPOC
is also offered online.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.300
You can take it in person
in a classroom at one

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.360
of the hosting
universities or you

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.010
can take it entirely online.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.150
It's really up to you.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.290
It's small because we have
a few dozen students instead

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.910
of thousands, and it's
private because in order

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.180
to take the class
it's by invitation.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.820
In this particular instance,
we had two universities that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.349
co-sponsored this class.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.710
One is MIT and the
other one is called

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.530
EPFL, Ecole Polytechnique
Federale de Lausanne

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.900
in Switzerland, which is also
quite active in the world

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
of online education.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.220
The way fundamentally
that a SPOC works,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.350
is that you have the
course management

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.490
system at each of the hosting
universities and institutions.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.640
And you essentially post the
same materials, the lectures,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.300
the readings, the
exercises, you post them

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.810
in parallel at each of
the hosting universities.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.460
The lecturers
themselves, however,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.900
are run online using an
open collaboration platform,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.640
like WebEx for example.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.620
You can do it with
Google Hangouts.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.520
There's a lot of
different platforms.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.210
And this is important
because it is

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.660
important to have live
connections between the faculty

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.460
and the students,
but also the students

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.500
amongst themselves can discuss.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.990
The trickiest part of
running a SPOC, of course,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.080
is the time zones and
the time differences.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.300
In this case, the
two universities

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.700
were six time zones apart.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.490
And so it was offered in the
morning here at MIT and then

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.080
the afternoon in Europe.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.940
If you're running this
as a global class,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.800
it will be more
challenging to find a time

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.680
slot that works for everybody.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.040
The feedback from the students
has been very positive,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.130
because you can think of a
SPOC in this particular class

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.740
as a blended form of education.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.750
Part of the class is live.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.550
The lectures are given live,
and every lecture is recorded.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.850
So even if you miss a
lecture as a student,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.480
you can watch it later.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.510
And so there's a record of it.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.370
The assignments
are asynchronous,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.600
and there are some assignments
that are individual.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.850
And there are team
assignments as well.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.860
And so it's a blended
form of education,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.270
which is an important
trend in education where

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.790
we take the best of
the online experience,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.920
and we try to combine
it with the best

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.680
of the in-person experience.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.020
Teaching a SPOC is fun and
challenging at the same time.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.850
It's fun because you get
to converse and interact

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.030
with students, not just in
a physical classroom at one

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.160
university but across
multiple institutions.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.400
And that enhances the class,
because students will speak up

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510
with experiences from
different cultural backgrounds.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.160
But it's also
challenging, because you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.140
have to keep track of what's
happening at multiple places.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.620
And you have a mix of students
from different backgrounds

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.910
and different institutional
constraints as well.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.030
And so it's both
challenging and fun,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.710
but it's a very
focused experience.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.000
And the feedback from the
students has been great.
