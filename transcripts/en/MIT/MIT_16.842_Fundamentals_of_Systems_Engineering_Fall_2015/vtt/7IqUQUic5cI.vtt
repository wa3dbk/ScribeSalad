OLIVIER DE WECK: One of
the first assignments

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.300
that I ask students
to do in the class

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.010
is to write a team charter.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.330
Now what is a team charter?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.470
You can think of a team
charter like a manifesto.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.860
It's essentially defining
the identity and the goals

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.960
that the team wants to pursue.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.990
And in this kind of class, there
could be many different goals.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.640
For example, as a team
you want to learn as much

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.610
as you can about the process of
systems engineering and design

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.110
and so forth.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.950
Another charter could be
that you are very ambitious

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.120
and you want to win
the competition.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.360
So you want to score
as high as you can.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.990
And the ultimate goal is to be
as highly ranked as possible

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.460
in the competition.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.400
Another goal could be just
to have fun, you know.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.490
To just have a good
time, to learn,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.800
but essentially to
really be together

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.320
in this learning
environment, to learn

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.310
and have fun at the same time.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.080
And so the flavor of each team
is a little bit different.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.160
And rather than just letting
it happen without much thought

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.820
or discussion, the purpose of
the team charter or project

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.200
charter is to encourage
these discussions early,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.410
such that the team
is on the same page

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.991
as they proceed
into the project.
