00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.540
OLIVIER DE WECK: One of
the key ways of learning

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.210
is to look at examples,
past examples,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.960
of both successful and
failed projects or designs.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.880
What we find in
systems engineering

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.590
is that often the problems
begin at the requirements stage,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.540
where either a requirement is
missing, or there's redundancy,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.100
or in some cases
requirements are

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.960
written that are
overly ambitious

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.900
and utopian given the time
frame and the budget available.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.130
So what you have is always a
trade off between how ambitious

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.380
you are technically,
the schedule,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.510
and the budget that's
available, and how much

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.260
risk you are willing to take.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.410
And so the students are
pushing the envelope

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.860
in these different dimensions
and learning what's feasible,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.650
what's not feasible,
and what can we

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.750
learn from past failures.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.600
We can learn from general
examples of projects

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.230
that had difficulties,
either in aerospace,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.740
in the automotive industry,
in consumer products.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.690
In hindsight, one
is always smarter.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.120
But it is worth
to look at these.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.640
Specifically with the
CanSat competition,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.350
since the competition has a rich
history, and a very active set

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.660
of sponsors, and quite
a good website as well,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.330
there's a lot of
opportunities to learn

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.810
from mistakes that other
teams have made in the past.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.490
For example, designing a
glider where there's not

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.330
sufficient tolerances
between the vehicle itself

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.080
and the container, and basically
the deployment doesn't go well.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.740
Another example is
designing a glider

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.130
that does not fly properly
in a circular pattern,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.150
and flies too well actually, and
flies off into the woods never

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.480
to be seen again.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.650
There's, of course, a
lot of lessons learned

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.470
from establishing a stable
communications link,

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.810
from having worked
out procedures.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.310
How do you deploy your system?

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.549
How do you test it?

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.840
How do you communicate with it?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.060
How do you collect it?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.620
How do you
post-process the data?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.870
In each of those
critical areas, we

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.030
see that learning
from the past is

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.760
critical to avoid
mistakes that could be

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.230
avoided with these learnings.
