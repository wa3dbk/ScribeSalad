00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.020
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.700
Welcome back to 6046.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.660
Today, we start
an exciting series

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.150
of algorithms for graphs.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.860
We've done a lot
of data structures.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.910
We're starting to get
back into algorithms

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.510
with dynamic
programming last week.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.460
And today and the
next few lectures,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.050
we're going to see lots of
cool algorithms about graphs.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.720
First a bit of
recall-- we're starting

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.100
with shortest
paths, which you've

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:51.250
seen in 6006 in the context of
single-source shortest paths.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.620
So typically, like you do a
Google Maps query, you think

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.090
of, I want to go from A to B.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.550
But what you solved in 6006
was a harder problem, which

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.239
is I give you a point A-- here
it's called S for the source.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.010
I give you a source vertex.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.020
And capital V is a
set of all vertices,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.980
capital E is a set of all
edges, remember graph notation.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.360
Let's say it's a directed graph.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.740
You've got edge
weights, like the time

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.710
it takes to traverse each road.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.410
And you want to
know how long's it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.320
take me to get from
S to V for all V.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.580
So this is from one given
point to everywhere.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.160
Today, we're going
to solve a harder

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.590
problem, which is all-pairs.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.029
I want to go from all A to all
B. But what you saw in 6006

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.570
was single-source, where I just
give you one of the vertices,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.070
and I want to know how
to get to everywhere.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.850
The reason you saw this version
and not the A to B version

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.780
is because the best way
we know to solve A to B

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.320
is to solve this problem.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.310
So at least from a
theory standpoint,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.630
we don't know how to
beat Dijkstra's algorithm

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.690
and Bellman-Ford's algorithm
for the A to B problem.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.050
So you get a little bit
more than what you asked

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.660
for sort of for the same price.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:08.810
So let me remind you in a
few different scenarios what

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.550
algorithms we have,
and how long they take.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.630
So the scenarios of interest
are the unweighted case,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:32.920
a non-negative weighted
case, the general case,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.920
arbitrary weights,
positive and negative,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.460
and DAGs acyclic graphs.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.300
These are some
interesting special cases.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.190
And you should have seen in 006
algorithms for each of them.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.290
Let's see if you remember.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.860
So what's a good algorithm
for single-source shortest

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.030
paths in an unweighted graph?

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.400
BFS, good, Breadth-first
Search, that takes how long?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.110
V plus E, good.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.550
That's-- for graphs, V plus
E is considered linear time.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.780
That's how long it takes
to represent the input.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.240
So you got to look at the
input, most algorithms,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.110
and the BFS is
optimal against that.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.510
But we're going to start
getting worse as we--

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.020
well, for these two situations.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.630
So for non-negative edge
weights, what do you use?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.990
Dijkstra.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.440
Ah, everyone's
awake this morning.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.870
That's impressive.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.520
And that takes how long?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.110
This is a tricky question.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.460
V log V plus E, wow, nice.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.500
So this answer kind of depends
on which heap structure

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.140
you use, but this
is the best we know.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.110
If you use a Fibonacci heap,
which we don't actually

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.530
cover but it's in
the textbook, you

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.240
achieve log V for extract
key and constant amortized

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.690
for each decreased
key operation.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.655
So sorry, this is
for extracted min,

00:04:00.655 --> 00:04:01.970
and this is for decrease key.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.480
And so this is the
best we know how to do

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.730
with a Dijkstra-type approach.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.947
If you use other heaps,
you get slightly worse,

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.280
maybe you get a log factor here.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.680
But this is good.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.280
This is almost as good as V plus
E. For moderately dense graphs,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.310
if E is bigger than V log
V, then these are the same.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.396
But if your graph is
sparse, like E is order V,

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:22.520
then you lose a log factor.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.640
But hey, it's just a
log factor, not too bad.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.210
We're going to get worse.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.439
So for general weights,
what do you use?

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.980
Bellman-ford.

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:36.790
OK.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.420
Which takes how long?

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.750
VE, that's the usual statement.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.320
Technically, you should
assume VE is at least V

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.830
for this bound to hold.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.190
But that's the way
to think of it.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.970
So this is not nearly as good.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.060
This is a lot slower.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.210
If you think of-- we can
think of two situations.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.340
One is when E is theta V, so a
very sparse graph like a tree

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.070
or planar graph or something.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.640
And we could think of
when E is quadratic.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.200
That's the dense case.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:16.710
So here we get, whatever,
V and V squared for BFS.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.660
For non-negative edge weights we
get V log V in the sparse case.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.880
And we get V squared
in the dense case.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.390
And for Bellman-Ford, we get
V squared in the sparse case,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.640
and V cubed in the dense case.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.200
So this is like a V
factor, a linear factor

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.890
larger than non-negative
edge weights--

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.790
makes a huge difference.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.180
And finally for acyclic
graphs, what do you do?

00:05:44.582 --> 00:05:45.790
STUDENT: Dynamic programming.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.130
PROFESSOR: Dynamic programming
is one answer, yeah.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.939
That works.

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.480
In some sense all
of these algorithms

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.780
are-- especially Bellman-Ford
is a dynamic program.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.640
We'll see that little bit.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.040
Another interpretation?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.930
Topological sort, and
then Bellman-Ford,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:14.540
yeah-- say, one round
of Bellman-Ford.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.290
So Bellman-Ford actually
works really well

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.050
if you know the order you
should relax the edges.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.000
And if in an acyclic graph,
you can do a topological sort,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.840
meaning you visit
all the vertices,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.360
so that whenever you visit
the right endpoint of an edge,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.250
you've already visited
the left endpoint.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.986
If you do Bellman-Ford
in that order, then

00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:32.860
you only have to do one
pass and you're done.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.960
Whereas normally, here,
you had to do it V times.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.060
So the total cost of
this is just linear.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.860
Good thing to remember,
especially on quizzes

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:44.610
and so on.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.850
If your graph is acyclic,
you can achieve linear time.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.530
But in the general
case, Bellman-Ford

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:51.710
is your answer
for single source.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.270
Now, these are the
best algorithms

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.740
we know for each of these cases.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.700
So I'm not going to
improve them today.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.890
You saw the state
of the art 006.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.450
But for all-pair shortest
paths, we can in some sense

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.770
do better, sort of.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.060
So let me just quickly
define the problem,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.400
and then tell you all
of the results we know.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:20.710
And also, the results
we're going to cover today.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.580
I didn't remind you of
the delta definition.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.460
I want to go over this briefly.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.910
So delta of s comma
v is the weight

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.115
of the shortest path from S to
V. The weight is well-defined.

00:07:44.115 --> 00:07:45.990
Even though there may
be many shortest paths,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.430
there's one best weight.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.940
But there's some special cases.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.420
It could be infinity,
if there's no path.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.140
That's sort of by definition.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.710
Say, well, it's infinite costs
to get-- if there's no path,

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.340
then we said there's
infinite weight one.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.140
And it could be minus
infinity in the presence

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.551
of negative weight cycles.

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.300
So let's say, if there's
a negative weight

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:17.540
cycle on the way, if you
could reach a negative weight

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.150
cycle from s, and then still
get to V from there, then

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.260
the best way to get there
is to go to that cycle loop

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.130
around infinitely many
times, and then go to V.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.640
OK, so the algorithms
you saw probably

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.890
didn't actually compute
correctly in this case.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.230
They just said,
negative weight cycle--

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.450
I don't know what to do.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.549
But it's actually not that hard.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:38.720
With a little bit
more effort, you

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.590
can figure out where the
negative infinities are.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.464
We're not going to rely
on that, but I'm just

00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:45.914
throwing it out there to make
this a well-defined definition.

00:08:45.914 --> 00:08:47.580
Once you have the
shortest path weights,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.420
you can also store
parent pointers,

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.470
get the shortest path
tree, then you can actually

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.634
find shortest paths.

00:08:53.634 --> 00:08:55.550
But again, we're not
going to talk about here.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.470
We'll focus on computing delta,
but with the usual techniques

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.980
you saw in 006, you could
also reconstruct paths.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:11.040
So for all-pairs shortest
paths, we have a similar set-up.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.420
We have a directed graph, V,E.
And we have an edge weight

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.430
function w-- in general,
could have negative weights.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:30.780
And our goal is to find delta of
u comma v for all u and v. OK.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.360
Single-source shortest
paths is the sort of thing

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.350
that you might want to do
a few-- just given a graph,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.770
and you want to find a shortest
path from A to B. I said,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.946
this is the best way we know
how to do A to B, essentially.

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:44.760
But all-pairs
shortest paths is what

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.840
you might want to do if
you're pre-processing.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.050
If you're Google
Maps, and you want

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.720
to be able to very quickly
support shortest path

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.460
queries between major
cities, then you

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.277
may want to first compute
all-pair shortest paths

00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.610
for all major cities, because
road networks don't change

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.400
very much, the large scale.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.350
This is ignoring
traffic and so on.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.484
Pre-compute this, and then
given a query of two vertices,

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.150
come in-- probably
get a million queries

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.940
a second-- you could
very quickly know

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.240
what the answer is.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.187
And this is the basis for
real world shortest paths.

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:19.270
Typically, you don't compute
shortest paths from A

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.930
to B every single time.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.220
You use waypoints along the way.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.300
And you have pre-computed
all-pair shortest paths

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.100
between waypoints.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.141
So that's the motivation.

00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:31.450
Yeah, I guess in some
sense, internet routing

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.140
is another situation
where at any moment

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.550
you may need to
know the shortest

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.950
path to get to-- the
fewest hop path say

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.480
to get to an internet site.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.580
You know the IP address.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.020
You need to know where to go.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.080
You don't need to
know the whole path.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.470
You need to know the next step.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.720
But in some sense,
you're computing

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
all-pair shortest paths.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.771
That's a more dynamic situation.

00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:50.270
OK.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.785
So here are the results we know
for all-pair shortest paths.

00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:03.540
I think I'm going to cheat,
and reuse this board.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.680
So same situations,
except I won't think

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.819
about acyclic graphs here.

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:12.235
They're a little
less interesting.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.912
Actually now, I'm
curious, but I didn't

00:11:16.912 --> 00:11:18.120
intend to talk about acyclic.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.990
And so the obvious thing to
do to solve all-pairs shortest

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.280
paths is just run the single
source algorithm V times,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.290
once from each source.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.240
So I could do V times
Breadth-first Search, V times

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.557
Dijkstra, V times Bellman-Ford.

00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:40.265
And now, I just need
to update my bounds.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.880
OK so VE becomes
V squared plus VE.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.740
If you're a little bit clever,
or you assume E is at least V,

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.980
that becomes VE.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.900
If I run Dijkstra
V times, I'm going

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:10.080
to get V squared log
V plus V times E.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:21.040
And if I run Bellman-Ford
V times, I get V squared E.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.577
OK.

00:12:21.577 --> 00:12:23.160
And over here,
everything's just going

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.740
to increase by a V factor.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.920
So a little more intuitive is
to think about the sparse case.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:34.250
I get V squared, V squared
log V, and V cubed.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.290
Check that those match
over there-- 1 equals V.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:44.290
And over here, I get V cubed,
V cubed, and V to the fourth.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.790
OK.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.810
So pretty boring so far.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.470
The interesting
thing here is that we

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.900
can beat the last result.
The last result, which

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.840
is the slowest one,
could take as long as V

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.800
to the fourth time.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.310
We can shave off
a whole V factor.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:10.700
So a better general
case algorithm

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.530
is called Johnson's algorithm.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.430
That will be the last
algorithm we cover today.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:26.560
And it achieves
this bound, which

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.360
is the same as running
Dijkstra V times.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.900
So it's between V squared
log V and V cubed.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.210
And that's cool, because
this is the best algorithm

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.020
we know for all-pairs,
non-negative edge weight,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.130
shortest paths, just
running Dijkstra V times.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.810
Not very smart-- but it's the
best thing we know how to do.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.770
And what this says is, even when
we have negative edge weights,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.980
actually we can achieve the
same bound as running Dijkstra.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.480
This is a bit counter intuitive
because in 006 you're always

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.990
told, if you have negative edge
weights, can't use Dijkstra.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.730
Turns out, in the all-pairs
shortest paths case,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.290
you kind of can.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.170
How can that be?

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.760
Because this is
a harder problem.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.010
If you could solve all-pairs
shortest paths, of course

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.910
you could solve single-source.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.340
And that's actually the luxury.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.770
Because it's a
harder problem, we

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.530
have this VE term
in the running time,

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:26.230
which lets us do things
like run Bellman-Ford once.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.860
And running
Bellman-Ford once will

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.440
let us run Dijkstra V times.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.610
That's the reason we
can achieve this bound.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.650
But we won't be seeing
that for a while.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.110
For starters, I want to
show you some connections

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.300
between all-pairs shortest
paths, and dynamic programming,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.250
and matrix multiplication,
which turn out

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.590
to give-- for
dense graphs, we're

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.340
just achieving V cubed
in all situations.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.990
So our first goal is going
to be to achieve V cubed time

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.890
for general edge weights.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.960
So we're going to first
achieve this bound.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.330
That will be a lot easier.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.390
And then eventually, we
will achieve this bound.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.070
So the Floyd Warshall
algorithm and some of these

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.500
will get very close to V cubed.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.670
All right.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.020
So we're going to start
with our first approach

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.640
to solving all-pairs
shortest paths-- that is not

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.727
using an existing single
source algorithm-- is

00:15:28.727 --> 00:15:29.560
dynamic programming.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.210
Someone mentioned that already.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.360
It's a natural approach.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.080
Shortest paths is kind
of dynamic programming.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.540
In fact, most
dynamic programs, you

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.540
can convert to single-source
shortest paths, typically

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:47.260
in a DAG-- not all,
but a lot of them.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.660
So we could try
dynamic programming.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.200
Now, I'm going to preach
to you a little bit

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.300
about my way of thinking
about dynamic programs.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.190
If you watched the
006 OCW version,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.770
you've seen the five easy
steps to dynamic programming.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.720
And if you haven't, this will
be new, otherwise, a reminder.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.970
First thing I like to think
about in a dynamic program

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:11.470
is, what are the subproblems?

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.540
The second thing I like to think
about is, what am I guessing?

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.320
I'm going to guess some
feature of the solution.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.720
Third thing is, I want to
write a recurrence relating

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.340
subproblems solutions.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.000
Then, I'm basically
done, but there's

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.360
a couple wrap up
things, which I'm

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.170
going to have to use
another board for.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:55.320
So number four is, I need
to check that I can actually

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.310
resolve these subproblems
in some order that's valid.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.550
Basically, this is saying
that the constraint

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.599
graph on some problems
should be acyclic.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.910
Because if there's a cycle
in the constraint graph,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.310
you take infinite time.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.852
Even if you memoize, if you do
infinite recursion-- bad news.

00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:12.434
You'll never actually
finish anything,

00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:15.030
so you never actually write
anything in the memo table.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.009
So I want to make sure
that it's acyclic.

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:19.550
I mean, this is
really the same thing

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.230
we're talking about in
this erased row, which

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.480
is topological ordering.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.200
Personally, I like to-- you
could argue that it's acyclic.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.530
I like to just write down,
here's a topological order.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.330
That's a nice proof
that it's acyclic.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.690
If you write that
down as for loops,

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.740
then you actually
have a bottom up dp.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.710
If you just take the recurrence,
stick it inside the for loop,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.310
you're done, which
we'll do in a moment.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.640
I guess I need a row for that.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:51.529
And finally, you need to
solve the original problem.

00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:53.070
And then, there's
analysis and so on.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.510
But for specifying
the algorithm,

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.295
these are the key
things you need to know.

00:17:57.295 --> 00:18:00.010
The hard part is figuring out
what the subproblems should be,

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.919
so that your dp becomes fast.

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:03.960
Running time is going to
be number of subproblems

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.410
times time per subproblem.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.000
For each subproblem,
usually we're

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.590
going to want to guess some
feature of the solution

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.430
to that problem.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.630
Once we do that, the recurrence
becomes pretty trivial.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.110
Just for each guess, you
say what it should be.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.850
So these are the
really hard two steps.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.490
And then, OK, we checked
that it's acyclic.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.357
And we make sure
that we can actually

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:29.690
solve our original problem
using one of the subproblems.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.770
Sometimes, our original problems
are some of the subproblems.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.550
I think that will happen here.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.410
But sometimes you need to do a
little bit of post-computation

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.120
to get your answer.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.620
All right.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.820
So what am I going to
do for subproblems?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.770
Well obviously, I have a bunch
of different problems involving

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:50.700
pairs of vertices.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:56.300
I want to find delta of u,v for
all u and v. That, I erased.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.230
But that's the problem.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:04.230
So I want to know what is
the weight of the shortest

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:15.020
path from u to v?

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.650
If I stop there and said
that was my subproblems,

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.350
bad things are going to
happen, because I will end up--

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.150
there's no natural way to
make this thing acyclic.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.660
If I want to solve u to
v using, I don't know,

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.800
u to x, and then
x to v, something

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.570
like that-- there's
no way to get out

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.750
of the infinite recursion loop.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:34.250
OK?

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.640
So I need to add
more subproblems

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.690
to add more features to my
solution, something that

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.866
makes it so that when I
try to solve my subproblem,

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:45.240
I reduce it to
other subproblems.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:50.460
Things get smaller, and so I
could actually make progress.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.330
So there are actually two
natural ways to do this.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.480
I'll call them method
one a method two.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.730
Method two is actually
Floyd Warshall.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.740
But any suggestions on
how we might do this?

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.120
This is a harder problem.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.440
This is in some sense,
a kind of guessing,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.580
but it's like I'm
going to guess ahead

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.900
of time that somehow
there's an important feature

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.790
of the shortest path.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.880
I'm going to
parameterize by that,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.720
and somehow it's
going to get smaller.

00:20:21.978 --> 00:20:22.934
Yeah?

00:20:22.934 --> 00:20:23.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:26.275 --> 00:20:27.650
PROFESSOR: Right,
shortest path--

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.060
it uses at most a
given number of edges.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.850
Let's parameterize
by how many edges.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.820
I think I'll use m.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.095
So using at most m edges.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.550
Very good.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.290
So good, I think it
deserves a purple Frisbee.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.930
All right, I'm getting
better, slowly.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.990
By the end the semester,
I'll be pro at frisbee.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.150
I should enter a competition.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.340
So this is, of course, an
additional restriction.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:06.990
But at the end of the day,
the problem I want to solve

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:12.580
is going to be essentially
duv, let's say, n minus 1.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.620
If I want a shortest
path that does not

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.350
repeat any vertices,
then certainly

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.210
it has at most n minus 1 edges.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:28.630
So in fact, the claim would
be that duv equals duv n.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.990
I mean, and so on.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.004
If you go larger than n minus
1, it shouldn't help you.

00:21:33.004 --> 00:21:34.670
If you know that your
shortest paths are

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.878
simple-- if you know that
shortest paths don't repeat

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:37.580
vertices.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.635
So this would be if there are
no negative weight cycles.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.380
If there are no
negative weight cycles,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.890
then we know it never
helps to repeat vertices.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.890
So in that situation,
we would be

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.790
done, if we could
solve this for all m.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.950
Now, slight catch--
well, how do we

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.220
know there's no
negative weight cycles?

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.350
You know, we could run
Bellman-Ford, I guess.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.760
That's a little tricky,
because that only

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.820
finds reachable
negative weight cycles.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.280
In fact from this
picture, we will end up

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.070
knowing whether there are
negative weight cycles.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.390
So there will be no negative
weight cycles, if and only

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:27.490
if there's no negative diagonal
entry, say dvv n minus 1.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.740
So it turns out,
this algorithm will

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.400
detect there's a
negative weight cycle

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.950
by finding that the distance
from v to v is negative.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.534
Initially, it's going to be 0.

00:22:35.534 --> 00:22:36.950
If it turns out
to be negative, we

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:37.970
know there's negative
weight cycle.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.386
With more work,
you could actually

00:22:39.386 --> 00:22:41.346
find all the reachable
pairs, and so on.

00:22:41.346 --> 00:22:42.470
But I'm not going to worry.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:44.300
I'm just going to say, hey,
a negative weight cycle.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.008
I'm going to throw my
hands up in the air

00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:50.360
and give up for today.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.471
OK.

00:22:51.471 --> 00:22:51.970
Cool.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.150
So I can solve my
original problem,

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.790
if I can solve
these subproblems.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:02.070
And now, things are easier,
because we can essentially

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.290
assume in solving this
problem that we've

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.660
solved smaller subproblems
for however we define smaller.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.530
That's what's given by
this topological order.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.300
Obvious notion of
smaller is smaller m.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.070
Presumably, we
want to write this

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:21.570
with an m in terms of this
with an m minus 1 or smaller.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.790
So this gets to
our guessing part.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.470
What feature of a
shortest path could we

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.650
guess that would make
it one edge shorter?

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.910
There's probably
two good answers.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.870
Yeah?

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.761
The next edge, which I guess
you mean the first edge?

00:23:40.761 --> 00:23:41.260
Sure.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.676
Could guess the
first edge, or you

00:23:42.676 --> 00:23:44.110
could guess the second edge.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.612
Or no, that would be harder.

00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:47.570
Or I mean, the last edge,
that would also work.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.101
Okay, this is a harder one.

00:23:50.101 --> 00:23:52.250
Uh, nope.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.380
Good thing there's students
everywhere to catch it.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.090
Cool.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.235
So I'm going to
guess the last edge.

00:23:59.235 --> 00:24:00.860
That's just how I've
written the notes.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.780
But first edge would
also work fine.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.530
So I'll call the last
edge x comma v. We

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.540
know we end by going into v. So
let's guess the vertex previous

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.022
to it in the shortest path.

00:24:18.022 --> 00:24:19.980
Now of course, we don't
know what that edge is.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.140
The guessing just means try
them all as you saw last time.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.544
So now, it's really
easy to write

00:24:26.544 --> 00:24:29.210
the recurrence-- see if I can do
it without looking at my notes.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:34.700
So we've got duv of m.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.120
We want to write-- we want
to find the shortest path,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.700
so it's probably going to
be a min on the outside.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.920
And we're going to consider
the paths of the form-- d go

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.405
from u to x using fewer edges.

00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:52.540
Right, if this is the last edge,
then we use m minus 1 edges

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.010
to get to x.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.990
And then, we follow
the edge x comma v.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.270
So I'll just add on the
weight of the edge, x comma

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:05.620
v. If x was the right answer,
this would be the cost

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:09.720
to get from u to v
via x, where xv is

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.646
a single edge at the very end.

00:25:11.646 --> 00:25:13.520
We don't know what x
should be, so we're just

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.640
going to do for loop
over x for x in v.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.020
So this is using
Python notation.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.210
And that will find
the best answer.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.845
Done, easy.

00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:25.470
Once you know what
the subproblems are,

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.540
once you know what
the guessing is,

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.980
basically, I'm just adding
in a min and a for loop

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.220
to do the guessing.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.070
So that's my recurrence, except
I should also have a base case.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.120
Here it's especially important.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.690
So base case is going to
be when m is the smallest.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.540
So that, let's say, is 0.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.200
What is the weight of getting
somewhere using 0 edges?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.230
Well, typically it's
going to be infinity.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.930
But there is an interesting
situation, where at 0 namely

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.700
when u equals v.
Hey, there is a way

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.350
to get from u to
itself with 0 edges.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.510
And that costs 0.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.720
But anywhere else is
going to cost infinity.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.780
There's no path.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.230
So the sort of a
definition, I should say.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.420
If it exists, otherwise
it's infinity.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.730
So then I get those infinities.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.870
But this is kind of important,
because maybe I actually use

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.420
fewer than m edges.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.480
I wrote less than
equal to m here.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.350
This is also less than equal
to m minus 1 edges here.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.370
But in some sense, I'm
including the case here,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.860
where x equals v. So I just
stay at v at the very end.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.850
So it's because I have
a 0 here, I'm implicitly

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.910
including a situation
where actually, I

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.250
just use duv m minus 1.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.560
That's in that min here.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.280
So it's important to
get the base case right.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.170
Cool.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.920
Almost done.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.660
I need an acyclic ordering.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.240
So as I said, things get
smaller when m is smaller.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:07.950
So all that means is do the
for loop for m on the outside.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:14.490
Then do the for loop for
u in v. For those, it

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.510
doesn't matter what
order you do it,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.100
as long as you've done
all of m equals 0,

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.650
before you do all of m equals
1, before you do all of m

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.700
equals 2.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.510
So that's the nested for loops
that gives you the right order.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:30.950
And so, I guess I take this
line and put it on the top.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.790
And I take this line, the
induction of the currents,

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.722
put it inside the for loops,
that is my bottom-up dp.

00:27:38.722 --> 00:27:41.610
OK, I'm actually going to
write it down explicitly

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.835
here for kicks.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.184
Should I bother?

00:27:49.184 --> 00:27:50.648
Uh, what the hell.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.850
So first we do a for loop on m.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:14.680
Then, we're going to do
the for loops on u in V.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.870
Now, inside the for loop,
I want to compute this min.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.850
I could use this
single line, but I'm

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.285
going to rewrite it slightly to
connect this back to shortest

00:28:26.285 --> 00:28:26.785
paths.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.930
Because this type of
statement should look familiar

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.770
from Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.695
This is called the
relaxation step.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:08.900
OK.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.399
It probably would
look more familiar

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:13.130
if I wrote here w of x v.
You could also write wxv.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:23.030
That's an alternative
for both of these--

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.020
probably should
write the same way.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.400
But in either case, we call
this a relaxation step,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.820
because-- it's kind
of a technical reason

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.840
but-- what we'd
like to satisfy--

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.590
we know that shortest paths
should satisfy the triangle

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.800
inequality.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.220
If you look, there's three
vertices involved here,

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.392
u, v, and x.

00:29:45.392 --> 00:29:47.100
We're looking at the
shortest path from u

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.100
to v compared to the
shortest path for u to x,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.140
and the shortest
path from x to v.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.640
Certainly, the shortest
way to get from u to v

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.110
should be less than or equal
to the shortest path of u

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.660
to x plus x to v, because
one way to get from u to v

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.050
is to go via x.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.345
So this if condition
would be a violation

00:30:07.345 --> 00:30:08.470
of the triangle inequality.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.678
It means we definitely do
not have the right distance

00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:14.341
estimates if duv is
greater than ux plus xv.

00:30:14.341 --> 00:30:14.840
OK.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.130
So if it's greater, we're
going to set it equal.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.690
Because here, we know a way
to get from u to v via x.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.610
We know that it's possible to do
this, assuming our d values are

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.880
always upper bounds on reality.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.220
Then, this will be an
upper bound on the best way

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.076
to get from u to v.

00:30:32.076 --> 00:30:33.700
So this is clearly
a valid thing to do.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.890
Relaxations are never bad.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.950
If you start high,
these will always

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.140
improve your shortest paths,
so you get better estimates.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.900
And that's exactly what
Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford did,

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.450
maybe with w instead
of d, but they're all

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.884
about fixing the
triangle inequality.

00:30:49.884 --> 00:30:51.550
And in general and
optimization, there's

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.560
this notion of, if
you have a constraint,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.360
an inequality constraint
like the triangle inequality,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.370
and it's violated,
then you try to fix it

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.030
by the successive relaxations.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.860
So that's where the
term comes from--

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.020
doesn't really matter here,
but all of our shortest path

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.840
algorithms are going
to do relaxations.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.980
All the shortest path algorithms
I know do relaxations.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:16.400
So this is familiar, but it's
also doing the same thing here.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.800
I just expanded out
the min as a for loop

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.930
over x, each time checking
whether each successive entry

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.070
is better than
what I had already.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.580
And if it is, I update.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.960
So in the end, this will
compute a min, more or less.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.470
I cheated also because I
omitted the superscripts here.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.610
If I put m here, and m
minus 1, here and 1 here,

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.940
it would be exactly
the same algorithm.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.480
I'm omitting all
the superscripts,

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:46.450
because it can only help me.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.460
Relaxing more can
only get better.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.559
And if I was guaranteed
correct over there,

00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:53.350
I'll still be guaranteed
correct over here.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.766
You have to improve
the invariant,

00:31:54.766 --> 00:31:57.190
but you never--
relaxation is always safe.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.170
If you start with upper bounds,
you always remain upper bounds.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.410
You're doing at least the
relaxations over there.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.770
And so you will in the end
compute the correct shortest

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.730
path weights.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.260
The advantage of that,
mainly, is I save space.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.210
And also, it's simpler.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.870
So now I only need
quadratic space.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.620
If I had a superscript,
I'd need cubic space.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.120
Right?

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.840
So I did a little simplification
going from the five step

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.500
process to here-- both of the
polynomial time and space,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.490
but this is a little
bit, a little bit better.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.170
But how slow is this algorithm?

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.435
How long does it take?

00:32:28.435 --> 00:32:29.770
Yeah?

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.490
V cubed, that would be great.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.202
V to the fourth, yeah, good.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:46.130
Sadly, we're not doing so great
yet-- still V to the fourth.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.410
V to the fourth, I guess
I already knew how to do.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.032
That was if I just run
Bellman-Ford V times,

00:32:53.032 --> 00:32:54.740
I already knew how to
do V to the fourth.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.170
So I haven't actually
improved anything.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:00.720
But at least you see, it's all
dynamic programming in there.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.060
So n here is the size of V.
That's probably the first time.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:08.190
Cool.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.239
I omitted 0, because
there was the base case.

00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:12.530
That's done separately in
the line that I didn't write.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.280
So that was dp one.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.810
Time for dp two, unless
there are questions?

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.030
Everyone clear so far?

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.646
Yeah?

00:33:28.646 --> 00:33:30.020
STUDENT: When you
iterate over x,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.700
why do you do you
every [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.103
PROFESSOR: As opposed to--?

00:33:34.103 --> 00:33:36.357
STUDENT: Like, just adjacent
vertices [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:36.357 --> 00:33:37.190
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.690
OK.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.280
Good, fair question-- why do I
iterate over all vertices, not

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.170
just the incoming?

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.740
If I'm writing w of xv, I
could afford to just say, just

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.480
consider the incoming vertices.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.280
And that would let
me improve probably

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.190
from V to the fourth to V cubed
times-- V squared times E,

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.450
I think, if you do
the arithmetic right.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.520
You could do that.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.679
It would be better.

00:34:04.679 --> 00:34:06.470
For dense graphs, it's
not going to matter.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.429
For sparse graphs
it will improve

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:11.194
V squared to E, basically.

00:34:11.194 --> 00:34:12.610
But we're going
to do even better,

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.276
so I'm not going to
try to optimize now.

00:34:14.276 --> 00:34:16.150
But, good question.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:18.870
When I say this at
the moment, if there

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:23.100
is no edge from x to v,
I'm imagining that w of xv

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.290
equals infinity.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:27.850
So that will never
be the minimum choice

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.190
to use a non-edge.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.010
I should say that.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.130
If there's no edge here,
I define the weight

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.139
to be infinity.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.560
That will just make
algorithms cleaner to write.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.139
But you could optimize
it the way you said.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.706
So, where were you?

00:34:40.706 --> 00:34:43.071
Yeah.

00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.310
Ah, perfect.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.270
OK.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.230
Other questions?

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.190
More Frisbee practice?

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.690
No?

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:49.630
OK.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.310
So that was dp one.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.139
Let me do dp two.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.920
Not yet, sorry-- diversion.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.270
Diversion is matrix
multiplication.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.180
Before I get to dp
two, I want to talk

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.346
about matrix multiplication.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.990
This is a cool connection.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.030
It won't help us directly
for shortest paths,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.690
but still pretty good.

00:35:30.662 --> 00:35:33.120
And it will help-- it will
solve another problem especially

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.619
fast.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.370
So shortest paths is
also closely linked

00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:45.140
to matrix multiplication,
a problem we've

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.110
seen a couple of times,
first in the FFT lecture,

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.600
and then in the
randomization lecture

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.090
for checking matrix multiplies.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.750
So you remember, you're
given two matrices, A and B.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.330
And you want to
compute C equals A

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:04.030
times B. You've seen Strassen's
algorithm to do this.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.300
There's also these--
here A and B are squared.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:07.800
OK.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.610
So the n by n, product
will be n by n.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:15.560
So standard approach
for this is n cubed.

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.850
With Strassen, if
I can remember,

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.740
you can get n to the 2.807.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:28.220
And if you use CopperSmith
Winograd, you get 2.376.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.720
And then, if you use the
new Vassilevska-William's

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:38.910
algorithm, you get n to
the 2.3728 and so on.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:40.660
And that's the best
algorithm we know now.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.920
There's some evidence maybe
you can get 2 plus epsilon

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.030
for any epsilon.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.960
Turns out, those are going
to help us too much here.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.770
But what I want to show is
that matrix multiplication

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.380
is essentially doing
this, if you redefine

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.030
what plus and dot mean.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.740
We redefine addition and
multiplication-- talk about

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.740
whether that's valid
in the moment--

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.040
so remember what is
matrix multiplication?

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.060
Cij is a dot product
of a row and a column.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:11.414
So that's aik with bkIj.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.800
K equals 1 to n.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.300
OK.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.080
Now that sum looks
a lot like that min.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.130
Actually, more like the
way I wrote it over here,

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.400
with the d's instead of the w's.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.210
This-- right-- x is the
thing that's varying here.

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:40.330
So this is like, aik plus
bkj, except, I have plus here,

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.370
whereas I have times over here.

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:46.310
And I have a min out here,
but I have a sum over here.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:51.910
So it sounds crazy, but let's
define-- be very confusing

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:55.180
if I said define dot
equals plus, so I'm

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.910
going to define a new
world called circle world.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.570
So if I put a circle around
a dot, what I mean is plus.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:08.570
And if I put a circle around
a plus, what I mean is min.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:09.070
OK?

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.100
So now, if I put a
circle around this dot,

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.369
I mean circle everything.

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:15.660
So I've got to circle the
summation, circle this thing.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.550
So then I get shortest paths.

00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:20.695
Crazy.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.535
So all right, I'm going to
define d to the m-th power.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.785
I should probably
circle-- whatever.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:52.550
Slightly different.

00:38:59.842 --> 00:39:02.110
OK, I want to define,
like, three things at once.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.390
So let me write them down,
and then talk about them.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.368
So many infinities.

00:39:08.368 --> 00:39:09.356
All right.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.260
OK.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.290
I guess, I should
write this too.

00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:53.620
OK.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.740
If I define the vert-- suppose
I number the vertices 1

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.440
through n, OK?

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.670
I just assume all vertices are
an integer between 1 and n.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.550
So then, I can actually express
things in a matrix, namely

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.620
the weight matrix.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.620
This kind of defines
the graph, especially

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.060
if I say wij is infinity
if there is no edge.

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.430
Then, this is the matrix of
all pairwise edge weights.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.370
For every i and j, I
have a weight of ij.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:22.190
That gives me a matrix, once
I set V to be 1 through n.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.560
Now, I'm also defining this
distance estimate matrix.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.700
So remember, we
defined duvm-- I'm

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:31.620
going to now call it dijm,
because the vertices are

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.674
integers.

00:40:32.674 --> 00:40:34.340
That is, the weight
of the shortest path

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.050
using, at most, m edges.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.090
If I define it that
way, then I can put it

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:42.020
into a matrix, which is for
all pairs of vertices ij.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.130
What is the distance,
shortest pathways

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.680
that uses it at most m edges?

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:50.820
That gives me a matrix,
d parenthesis m.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.440
Then, I claim that if I take
circle product between d

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:02.349
of m minus 1 and w, that is
exactly what's happening here,

00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:03.640
if you stare at it long enough.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.610
This is the inner
product between row u

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:13.100
of d to the m minus
1, and column v of w.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:16.510
And that's exactly what this
circle product will compute.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:20.660
So this is dp.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.990
But when you look at
that statement, that's

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.290
saying that d to
the parentheses m

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:30.010
is really w to the
circle power m, right?

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.010
This is a definition
in some sense of power,

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.740
of exponentiation,
using circle product.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.290
So when I circle
the exponent, that

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:42.252
means I'm doing circle
exponentiation in circle land,

00:41:42.252 --> 00:41:45.060
OK?

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.850
OK so far?

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:50.470
So this is circle land.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.980
So you might say, well, then I
should compute these products

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.990
using matrix multiplication.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.550
Now, just to see how
good we're doing,

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:05.220
if I execute this operation
n times, because I

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.180
have to get to d
to the n minus 1--

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.050
so it's basically d to the n.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:13.410
If I do this product n
times, and for each one of I

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.650
spend n cubed time, then I get
an n to the four algorithm.

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:20.135
Same algorithm in fact,
exactly the same algorithm--

00:42:20.135 --> 00:42:23.940
I've just expressed it
in this new language.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.490
OK, there are two ideas
on the table though.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.690
One is, maybe I could use a
better matrix multiplication

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.050
algorithm.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:33.726
Let's shelve that for a moment.

00:42:33.726 --> 00:42:35.350
The other possibility
is, well, maybe I

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.940
can exponentiate faster than
multiplying by myself n times,

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.070
or multiplying by w n times.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.170
How should I do it?

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.710
Repeated squaring, good.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.540
You've seen that
probably in 006.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:57.180
Repeated squaring idea is, we
take-- to compute w-- well,

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.140
I take w to the 0.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.320
I multiply it by w to the 0.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:06.264
Sorry, circle 0--
that's this thing.

00:43:06.264 --> 00:43:08.120
Oh, that seems weird.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.930
Let's start with 1.

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.579
1 seems better.

00:43:13.579 --> 00:43:15.870
I'm not going to get much if
I multiply that by itself.

00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.850
I should get exactly
the same matrix.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:21.030
So I take the circle product
between w to the 1, w to the 1.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.770
That gives me w to the 2.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:29.360
And then, I take w to
the 2 times w to the 2.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.890
Everything's circled.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:33.010
I get w to the 4.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.220
Oh cool, I doubled my exponent
with one multiplication.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:43.030
If I take w to the 4 by w to the
4, I get w to the 8, and so on.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.930
My goal is to get to n, so I
have to do this log n times.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.870
Log n squaring operations,
each squaring operation

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:53.100
is an n cubed thing.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.570
So this is repeated squaring.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.510
And I get V cubed log V--
finally, an improvement.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:14.040
So we went from V to the 4,
which was in the dense case

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.830
the same performance
as Bellman-Ford,

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.270
running it V times.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:21.370
But now in the dense case,
I'm getting V cubed log V,

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.840
which is actually pretty good.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.250
It's not quite V
cubed, but close.

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.821
All right.

00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.820
I'm pointing at V cubed.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.060
This is actually the one
result that is not optimal.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.130
This is the one we
want to improve.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.444
But we're kind of-- we're
in this space right now.

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.485
We're getting close to as
good is this algorithm,

00:44:42.485 --> 00:44:44.456
the Johnson's algorithm.

00:44:44.456 --> 00:44:46.640
But we still a log V Factor.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.040
So this is great,
just by translating

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.844
into matrix multiplication.

00:44:50.844 --> 00:44:52.260
Now technically,
you have to check

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.860
that repeated squaring actually
gives you the same result.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:59.690
Basically, this works because
products are associative.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.130
Circle products of
matrices are associative,

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:07.880
which works because circle
land is a semi-ring.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.600
If you want the
abstract algebra,

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.211
a ring is something that
you wear on your a finger.

00:45:15.211 --> 00:45:15.710
No.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:20.070
A ring is an algebra where
you define plus and times,

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.700
and you have distributivity.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:28.330
Semi-ring, there's no minus,
because min has no inverse.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:30.140
There's no way from
the min to re-compute

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.120
the arguments, right?

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.080
No matter what you apply to
it, you can't-- you've lost

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.200
information.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.600
So that's the semi-ring.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.670
Normally, you have a minus.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.760
But semi-ring is enough
for the repeated squaring

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.370
to give you the right answer.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:49.220
However, semi-ring is not enough
for all these fancy algorithms.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.070
So if you look at Strassen's
algorithm, the one you've seen,

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.420
it uses minus.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.750
There's no way to get around
that, as far as we know.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.910
So if you have no minus, n cubed
is the best we know how to do.

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.350
So sadly, we cannot improve
beyond this with this

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:04.260
technique.

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.290
It sucks, but that's life.

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:10.305
However, we can do something.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.360
If we just change
the problem, there

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.070
is another problem which
this is the best way to do.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:28.780
So let me briefly tell
you about that problem.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:31.070
It's called transitive closure.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.300
Transitive closure
is, I just want

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.000
to know is there a
path from i to j.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.270
So it's going to be 1, if there
exists a path from i to j.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.665
And it's going to
be 0 otherwise.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.300
OK.

00:47:05.554 --> 00:47:07.720
I guess it's kind of like
if you set all the weights

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.372
to 0 or infinity.

00:47:10.372 --> 00:47:12.330
Then, either there's
going to be as 0 way path,

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.966
or there's no path, meaning
there's an infinite way path.

00:47:14.966 --> 00:47:16.090
So it's not quite the same.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.290
Here, I want 1 and 0.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.930
I flipped.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:23.560
It used to be, this was
infinity, and this was 0.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:27.050
This is one saying there is a
path from i and j, 0 otherwise.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.350
If I write it this
way, and then I

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.110
think about what
I need to do here,

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:36.950
it is still in some sense
plus and min, but not really.

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.820
Because I just want to
know, is there a path?

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.694
So if I have a way to get
there and a way to get there,

00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:44.110
instead of adding
up those values,

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:49.230
really I'm taking
some other operator.

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:51.510
So I want to know OR.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:52.750
Yeah, exactly-- who said OR?

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.913
Yeah, all right, tough one.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.360
Close, close, close.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:10.120
So here, we have basically
a circle product is OR,

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:14.310
and circle sum is AND.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:15.000
OK?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.670
I mean plus and min
would work, but it's

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.110
a little bit nicer over here.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.460
Sorry, it's the other
way around, I think.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.080
It's definitely Booleans.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.364
We want to know there is a
way to get to x, and then

00:48:37.364 --> 00:48:38.530
from x to where we're going.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:39.700
That's an AND.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.370
And then, to get
a path in general,

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.850
it has to work for some x.

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:45.480
So that's the OR.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.170
And this is a ring.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.920
And once you're ring,
you have negation.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.460
You can apply
Vassilevska-Williams.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:02.420
And you solve this problem
in n to the 2.3728.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.550
And if I just make a little
change in the dot dot dot,

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:06.980
I can absorb the log.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.470
So you could put a log n here.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.370
And it's log n if you get
the exponent exactly right.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:15.830
But if you just tweak the
exponent by 0.00000001,

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.250
that's bigger than log n.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.710
So we usually omit
the log there.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.580
Cool.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:25.110
Transitive closure-- so it's
a problem you didn't know you

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:28.301
want to solve, but it is
actually a common problem.

00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:29.800
And this is the
best way we know how

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.110
to solve it for dense graphs.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.900
OK, it beats, you know, V cubed.

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.915
This is the algorithm we're
aiming for for dense graphs.

00:49:38.915 --> 00:49:41.340
For sparse graphs,
we can do better.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.150
But for dense graphs,
this is better.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.050
Finally, we get to go to
dynamic programming number

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:57.450
two, also known as the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:01.395
So we had this dp
in V the fourth.

00:50:01.395 --> 00:50:03.530
If we forget about
transitive closure,

00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:06.280
we've now are down
to V cubed log V.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:12.170
Our next goal is to achieve V
cubed, no log V. Let's do that.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.600
So again, I'm going to
express it in my five steps.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.740
First step is, what
are subproblems?

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.410
And this is the key
difference, and the key insight

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.640
for Floyd-Warshall is to
redefine the dij problems.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.280
To avoid conflict,
I'm going to call

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:59.980
them cij, or in this case,
cuv, because here, the matrix

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.406
product view will
not work, I think.

00:51:04.406 --> 00:51:07.399
Yeah, it won't work.

00:51:07.399 --> 00:51:08.940
So it's a totally
different universe.

00:51:40.326 --> 00:51:43.120
I'm still going to assume that
my vertices are numbered 1

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.020
through n.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.596
And now, the idea
is, first I'm going

00:51:47.596 --> 00:51:51.240
to think about the graph formed
by the vertices 1 though k,

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.240
roughly.

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.700
And I want to know for every
vertex u and every vertex v,

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.714
what is the shortest
path from u to v,

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:59.630
or the weight of the
shortest path from u to v

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:03.670
that only uses intermediate
vertices from 1 through k.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.010
So actually, u and
v might not be--

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.850
they might be larger than k.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:11.330
But I want all the vertices
in the path to be 1 through k.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:13.960
This is a different way
to slice up my space,

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.120
and it's the right way.

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.440
This is going to do
a factor of n better.

00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.660
It turns out, and
that's just an insight

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.800
you get from trying all the
dp's you could think of.

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.400
And eventually, Floyd and
Warshall found this one,

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.090
I think in the '70s.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:35.930
So it was easier back
then to get a new result.

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.180
But I mean, this is very
clever-- so very cool idea.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.960
So now the question is,
what should I guess?

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.700
Before I guessed what
the last edge was.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.600
That's not going to
be so useful here.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.114
Can anyone think of a
different thing to guess?

00:52:58.114 --> 00:52:59.780
We're trying to solve
this problem where

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.460
I get to use
vertices 1 through k,

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.570
and presumably I want
to use subproblems

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:07.070
that involve smaller k,
that say involve vertices 1

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:09.090
through k minus 1.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.250
So vertex k is relevant.

00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.230
What should I guess
about vertex k?

00:53:23.646 --> 00:53:24.638
Yeah?

00:53:24.638 --> 00:53:27.614
STUDENT: Guess that vertex
k is the [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:31.124 --> 00:53:32.790
PROFESSOR: You want
to guess vertex k is

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:34.170
the i-th intermediate vertex.

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.870
That would work, but I would
need to parameterize by i here,

00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:40.590
and I lose another
factor of n if I do that.

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.080
So I'd like to avoid that.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.545
That is a good idea.

00:53:46.545 --> 00:53:47.531
Yeah?

00:53:47.531 --> 00:53:51.265
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] visit
k, before you visit v.

00:53:51.265 --> 00:53:53.265
PROFESSOR: You're going
to guess that I visit k,

00:53:53.265 --> 00:53:56.200
and then I go to where
I'm trying to go.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:56.700
OK.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.750
That's not a-- OK.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.610
That's a statement.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.650
But to guess, I should
have multiple choices.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:06.179
What's my other choice?

00:54:06.179 --> 00:54:07.117
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:11.025 --> 00:54:11.650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:15.870
So either I use
vertex k, or I don't.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:25.120
That's the guess-- is k in
the path at all from u to v?

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.880
So that's a weaker
thing than saying,

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:30.700
k is at position i in the path.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.150
Here I'm just saying,
is k in the path at all?

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.410
And that's nice,
because as you say,

00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.800
I already know how to get
there without using k.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.340
Because that's cuvk minus 1.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.840
And then, you just also have
to consider the situation where

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:45.140
I go to k, and then I leave.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:55.460
So the recurrence is going to be
cuvk is the min of two things.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:01.580
One is when k is not in the
path, that's cuvk minus 1.

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:05.020
And the other option is that
I go to x first-- or sorry,

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.070
I go to k first.

00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:06.770
It used to be x.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.270
Now, I've renamed it k.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.360
I don't know why.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:18.390
k minus 1-- and then I go
from k to the v-- k minus 1.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.699
That's it.

00:55:22.699 --> 00:55:25.240
Min of two things-- before, I
was taking the min of n things.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.360
Before, there were n
choices for my guess.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.620
Now, there are two
choices for my guess.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.970
Number of subproblems is
the same, still V cubed.

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:35.250
But the guessing part
and the recurrence part

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.860
is now constant time
instead of linear time.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:43.170
So I'm now V cubed
time-- progress.

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:43.670
OK?

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:45.360
This is pretty cool.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.380
The old dp led us to this
world of matrix multiplication.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:49.780
That's why I covered it.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.280
This new dp is just
a different way

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.863
of thinking about
it-- turns out to be

00:55:52.863 --> 00:55:58.230
faster, just by log factor,
but a little bit faster.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:04.950
I need some base cases-- cuv
of 0 is going to be-- now

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:10.185
it's the weight of the edge uv.

00:56:10.185 --> 00:56:11.310
It's a different base case.

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.810
Before, I was using 0 edges.

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:15.960
Now, it's not using any
intermediate vertices.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:18.440
So that's how the weights
come into the picture,

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:20.750
because actually there are
no weights of edges up here.

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:21.860
So that's a little weird.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:25.490
The only place the weights
come in is when k equals 0.

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.600
This is in some sense
still relaxation,

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:35.720
but it's a little bit weirder,
little bit different order.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:39.470
I mean the key thing
here is, because the way

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:42.630
we set up these subproblems
with the intermediate vertices,

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:45.200
we know k is the only
vertex in question.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.830
Before it's like, well, I don't
know where you go at the end.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.770
But now we know that either
k is in there, or it's not.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.540
And in each case, we can compute
it using smaller subproblems

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.573
and so we save
that linear factor.

00:56:58.573 --> 00:57:00.447
STUDENT: Is this only
for [INAUDIBLE] graphs,

00:57:00.447 --> 00:57:01.790
or is does it also [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:05.570
PROFESSOR: This is
for directed graphs.

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:07.450
u and v are ordered here.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:12.290
And this is the weight from u
to v-- will work just as well.

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:14.310
It's probably a
little bit instructive

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:17.970
to write this down as
nested for loops again.

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:19.809
Why not?

00:57:19.809 --> 00:57:21.975
Because then, you'll see
it's just relaxation again.

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:29.370
So I'll even write the base case
here, because it's very simple.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:39.050
We're doing k in
order, let's say.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:40.940
These are really the
same kinds of for loops.

00:57:43.655 --> 00:57:46.030
But I'll write them slightly
differently, because here we

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.775
care about the order slightly.

00:57:47.775 --> 00:57:49.150
Here, we do care
about the order.

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:51.330
Here, we don't care
about the order.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:58:08.510
Vertices, and all we're
saying is-- almost exactly

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:10.430
the same code as before.

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.450
This is, again, just
a relaxation step.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:14.140
We're just relaxing
different edges

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:19.150
in different orders, basically,
because k is evolved in here.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.340
We do that for k equals 1.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:22.770
Then for k equals 2, and so on.

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:24.450
But in the end, it's
just relaxations,

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.179
so you can use that to prove
that this actually computes

00:58:27.179 --> 00:58:28.220
the right shortest paths.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.130
I won't do that here.

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:33.750
But clearly, cubic time
instead of quartic.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.420
Pretty cool.

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.770
That's Floyd-Warshall.

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.180
It's very simple.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.800
And so a lot of
people-- if you need

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:41.022
to solve all-pairs shortest
paths in dense graphs,

00:58:41.022 --> 00:58:42.480
this is the best
we know how to do.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.021
So this is what you
should implement.

00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:46.250
It's like, five lines of code.

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.070
And you achieve this bound.

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:50.050
But for our sparse
graphs, we can do better.

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.540
And the rest of
lecture is going to be

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:56.290
about Johnson's algorithm,
where for sparse graphs

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:58.170
we're going to get
closer to quadratic time.

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:02.240
We're going to match
running Dijkstra,

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:08.010
and it's V squared log
V plus E times V, sorry.

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.360
So when E is small, that's
going to be close to quadratic.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.610
When E is big, it's
going to be cubic, again.

00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:17.400
So we'll never be worse than
this Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.170
But for sparse
graphs it's better.

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.567
OK.

00:59:35.567 --> 00:59:36.400
Johnson's algorithm.

00:59:49.027 --> 00:59:51.360
I was going to make some joke
about Johnson and Johnson,

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.330
but I will pass.

00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:56.620
So Johnson's algorithm--
I mean, dp is five steps,

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.940
but Johnson's algorithm's only
three steps-- clearly simpler.

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.800
It's actually much
more complicated,

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.150
but it's all about
what the steps are.

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:08.890
So here's the crazy idea
in Johnson's algorithm.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:12.130
We're going to change
the weights on the edges.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:17.790
And to do that, we're going
to assign weights to vertices.

01:00:17.790 --> 01:00:19.410
We're going to
choose a function h.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:21.380
Think of it as a height
function, I guess,

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.180
that maps vertices
to real numbers.

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:29.710
And then, we're going to
define w sub h of u,v.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:34.280
This is a new way to think about
edge weights that depends on h

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.730
that's defined in a simple way.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:42.644
It's the old edge weight
plus h of u minus h of v.

01:00:42.644 --> 01:00:44.060
You could define
it the other way,

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.600
but it's better to
be consistent here.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.140
So this is a way to
tweak edge weights.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.990
For every edge-- this is
for directed graphs clearly.

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.962
For u, u is the beginning,
the head of the-- I

01:00:56.962 --> 01:00:58.670
don't know if it's
the head or the tail--

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:00.520
the beginning of the edge.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.800
v is the end of the edge.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.020
I'm going to add
on the height of h,

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.320
and subtract out
the height of v. OK?

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.670
Why?

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:11.960
Because that's the definition.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.910
I want this to be greater
than or equal to 0.

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.940
That's the such that.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.300
I want to assign a function
h, so that these new weights

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.890
are all greater or equal to 0.

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:27.605
This is for all u and
v. Why would I do that?

01:01:30.429 --> 01:01:31.970
STUDENT: To use
Dijkstra instead of--

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.790
PROFESSOR: To use Dijkstra
instead of Bellman-Ford,

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.970
exactly.

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:39.340
So that's step 2.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:47.434
Run Dijkstra on, I
guess, the usual graph.

01:01:47.434 --> 01:01:48.850
But now, this new
weight function,

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.910
w sub h, if all the
weights are non-negative,

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:54.490
I can run Dijkstra.

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:57.550
So this will give me what I
call the shortest path sub

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:02.632
h of u comma v for all u and v.

01:02:02.632 --> 01:02:05.090
It doesn't give me the actual
shortest path weights I want.

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:08.900
It gives me the shortest
path weights using this wh.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.020
But I claim that's
almost the same.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:16.160
I claim that this
re-weighting preserves

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.970
which paths are shortest.

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:28.130
Because-- so in particular,
I claim that delta of u,v is

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:32.790
delta sub h of u,v--
should be the other way--

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:37.960
minus h of u plus h of v. OK.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:41.150
If this was a single edge, you
can see I'm just cancelling off

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:42.270
these terms.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:46.870
But in fact, I claim for a whole
path, every path from u to v

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:50.347
gets changed by exactly
the same amount.

01:02:50.347 --> 01:02:52.180
So this is a claim about
the shortest path--

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.880
in effect, a claim
for every path from u

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.320
to v, shortest or not.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.340
If I measure it in
regular weights w,

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:04.180
versus weights w sub
h, the only difference

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.650
is this fixed amount,
which depends only on u

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.700
and v-- does not
depend on the path.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.410
And therefore, which paths
are shortest are preserved.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.590
And so when we compute
these shortest path weights,

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.530
we can translate
them back to what

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.095
they should be in the
original weighting function.

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:21.970
And furthermore, if you
have parent pointers,

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.830
and you actually find the paths,
the paths will be the same.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.321
Shortest paths will be the same.

01:03:27.321 --> 01:03:27.820
OK.

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.424
So let's prove that claim.

01:03:29.424 --> 01:03:30.590
It's actually really simple.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:57.840
Let's look at a
path from u to v.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.620
So I'm going to label the
vertices along the path.

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:02.520
V0 is going to be u.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:07.760
That's the first one, then
V1, then V2, and so on.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.860
Let's say path has length k.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:18.430
And Vk is v. OK, that's just
a generic path from u to v.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:29.560
And now, I want to compute
the w sub h of that path.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.970
Excuse me.

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:33.649
So the weight of a
path is just the sum

01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:34.690
of the weights the edges.

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:39.298
So I could write this as
a sum from i equals 1 to k

01:04:39.298 --> 01:04:44.965
of w sub h of Vi
minus 1 comma Vi.

01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:47.840
I think that works,
got to be careful not

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.750
to get the indices wrong.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:55.820
OK, now, w sub h is defined
to be this thing-- w

01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:03.471
plus h of u minus h of v. So
this is the sum i equals 1 to k

01:05:03.471 --> 01:05:17.470
of w Vi minus 1 Vi plus h
of Vi minus 1 minus h of Vi.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.275
What does the sum do?

01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:23.775
Telescope.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.870
So success-- this Vi is going
to-- this negative h of Vi

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.971
is going to cancel with
the plus h of Vi minus 1

01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:45.470
in the next term, except for
the very first one and the very

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:46.070
last one.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:49.860
So this is going to be
this sum, which is just

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.920
the weight of the path according
to regular weight function,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.465
plus h of V0 minus h of Vk.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:09.325
And that is just the weight to
the path plus h of u minus h

01:06:09.325 --> 01:06:13.480
of v. Did I get it right?

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.628
Nope.

01:06:15.628 --> 01:06:16.622
Yes?

01:06:16.622 --> 01:06:18.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
subtract [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:25.840
PROFESSOR: But it's not-- it's
opposite of what I claimed.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.434
So right, because it's
the other side, good.

01:06:29.434 --> 01:06:30.850
This has h on the
right hand side.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:32.840
This has not h on
the left hand side.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.350
But here, I have h on the
left hand side, and not h

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:36.860
on the right hand side.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.090
So if I flip it around,
if I take these two terms,

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:40.590
put them on the
left hand side, then

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:42.440
I get this with the right sign.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.790
Cool, whew.

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:45.220
Self-consistent.

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:45.720
OK.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:50.282
So this was talking
about are arbitrary path.

01:06:50.282 --> 01:06:51.990
And so this is proving
the stronger thing

01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:55.440
I said, that every
path gets lengthened

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.980
by this function,
which is purely

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.760
a function of the endpoints.

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.740
So in particular, that means
the shortest path in w land

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.380
will still be the shortest
path in w sub h land--

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:11.640
slightly less cool name than
circle land, but oh well.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.040
All right, so this means
shortest paths are preserved.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.456
Shortest paths are
still shortest.

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:23.420
And therefore, if I look at
the delta function, which

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.655
is about the shortest path
weights, this claim holds.

01:07:27.655 --> 01:07:29.030
So that's the
proof of the claim.

01:07:33.771 --> 01:07:34.270
Cool.

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:42.050
There's one gaping problem
with this algorithm,

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:45.320
which is how in the
world do you find this h?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.300
If we could find h, then we
know we could run Dijkstra,

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.620
and we can do this thing.

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.960
And Dijkstra is going to
cost the VE plus V squared

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:58.480
log V. I didn't say it, but
we run V times Dijkstra.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.410
All right, we run it V times.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:04.850
That's going to take V
squared log V plus VE to do.

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.600
This is just going to
take quadratic time,

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.890
V squared to update
all the weights,

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:11.940
update all the delta functions.

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.580
The missing step is how do
we find this weight function?

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:20.779
I claim this problem of finding
h that has this property,

01:08:20.779 --> 01:08:25.750
is very closely related
to shortest paths.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:29.040
It's weird, but we're going
to use shortest paths to solve

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:29.910
shortest paths.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:36.260
So let's do it.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:45.859
Step 1, finding h.

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:50.550
What I want to do, so I
want to have w of u,v--

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:55.359
let me just copy that down--
plus h of u plus h of v to be

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.484
greater than or equal to 0.

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:01.860
Whoops, minus.

01:09:04.426 --> 01:09:06.550
I'm going to put the h's
on to the right hand side,

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.040
and then flip it all around.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:13.550
So this is like saying h of
v minus h of u is less than

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:25.910
or equal to w of
u,v for all u and v.

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:28.170
This is a problem we
want to solve, right?

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:29.330
w's are given.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:30.990
h's are unknowns.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:35.375
This is called a system
of difference constraints.

01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:38.779
If you've heard about linear
programming, for example,

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:42.334
this is a special case
of linear programming.

01:09:42.334 --> 01:09:44.250
Don't worry if you haven't
heard, because this

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:45.521
is an easy special case.

01:09:45.521 --> 01:09:47.520
We're going to solve it
much faster than we know

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.760
how to solve lineal programs.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.100
It's a particular kind of thing.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.433
This is actually useful problem.

01:09:52.433 --> 01:09:54.860
You could think of,
these are maybe times

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.530
that various events happen.

01:09:56.530 --> 01:09:58.710
And these are constraints
about pairs of them.

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:01.690
Says, well, the start
time of this event

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:04.300
minus the end time of that
event should be less than

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.870
or equal to 1 second.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:10.260
You can use this to do
temporal programming,

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.690
if you could solve
these systems.

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.690
We're going to solve
these systems, when

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:16.560
they have a solution.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.350
They don't always have a
solution, which is a bit weird,

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.330
because we're relying on them
always having a solution.

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:26.370
How can that be?

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:28.650
Negative weight cycles.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:31.910
This is all going to work, when
we don't have negative weight

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.060
cycles.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.800
And that's exactly going
to be the case when

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.110
this system of difference
constraints has no solution.

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:47.270
So let me show you that
in a couple of steps.

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:53.640
First theorem is that if the
graph V,E,w has a negative

01:10:53.640 --> 01:11:12.730
weight cycle, then that
system has no solution--

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:14.750
no solution to the
difference constraints.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.680
This is going to be,
again, an easy proof,

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.395
kind of similar to
last one actually.

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:33.800
So consider a
negative weight cycle.

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:51.470
Let's call it V0, to V1,
to V2, to Vk, back to V0.

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:54.707
So the claim is the sum of
these weights is negative.

01:11:54.707 --> 01:11:57.040
And now, I'm just going to
write down these constraints,

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:01.200
which are supposed to have a
solution, or maybe they won't.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.670
So if it has a
solution, then this

01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:06.750
must be true, where u
and v are plugged into be

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:11.480
Vi and Vi minus 1, because
those are all edges.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:21.380
So I'm going to write h of
V1 minus h of V0 is less than

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.730
or equal to w of V0 wV1.

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:31.072
And then h of V2 minus
h of V1 less than

01:12:31.072 --> 01:12:34.842
or equal to w of V1 V2.

01:12:34.842 --> 01:12:37.430
Repeat that k times,
I'm going to get

01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:42.340
h of Vk minus h of Vk minus 1.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:52.155
And then, the last
one, the wrap around h

01:12:52.155 --> 01:13:07.500
of V0 minus h of Vk w of V--
did I get it right-- Vk V0.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.470
What do I do with
these inequalities?

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.230
Sum them.

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:25.465
Time for a Good Will Hunting
moment-- do you remember?

01:13:25.465 --> 01:13:28.050
I hope we've all seen
Good Will Hunting.

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:30.180
I don't have a
janitor here, so I

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:35.810
have to do all cancels
by hand-- and this.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:39.640
So I end up with
0 at the bottom.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.250
Everything cancels, and then,
over here I have less than

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.699
or equal to the weight
of the whole cycle.

01:13:46.699 --> 01:13:48.490
I'm just adding up the
weight of the cycle.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:51.730
I didn't give the cycle
a name-- call it C.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.500
Now, the cycle has
negative weight.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.010
So this is less than zero,
strictly less than zero.

01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:59.690
So we're saying that 0
is strictly less than 0.

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:00.892
That's not true.

01:14:00.892 --> 01:14:02.350
So that means
there's no way to get

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.800
all of these constraints
simultaneously true-- proof

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.460
by a contradiction.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.480
So that establishes a
connection in the direction

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.170
we don't want it.

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:15.850
What we want is
they're converse,

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.160
which is if there's no
negative weight cycle,

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.190
then there is a solution.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.630
Luckily, that is also true.

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.740
But this is a little
easier to see.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.220
So now, we do the other half.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:35.095
OK.

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.120
And this will-- I mean, it's
going to be constructive proof.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.220
So we're going to
actually know how to solve

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:51.690
this problem with an algorithm.

01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:12.840
So it's going to be-- there
is a negative weight cycle if

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.270
and only if there's no solution.

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.000
So in particular, the
case we care about

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.160
is if there's no
negative weight cycle,

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.290
then there is a solution.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.880
We kind of care about both,
but this is the more practical

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.020
direction.

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:26.930
So let's prove it.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.350
You can already
see-- you've seen

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:34.640
that there's a connection
in negative weight cycles.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.150
Now, I'm going to show there's
a real connection to shortest

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:37.650
paths.

01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:39.149
Negative weight
cycles are just kind

01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:44.950
of a symptom of the shortest
paths being involved.

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:48.740
So now, we're going
to use shortest paths.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.000
Suppose we have some graph.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.955
I'm going to draw a simple
little graph with weights.

01:16:01.377 --> 01:16:03.210
What I'd like to do is
compute shortest path

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.700
from a single source
in this graph.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:06.950
The question is, which source?

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:10.960
Because none of the vertices--
I guess in this case,

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.730
this would be a pretty good
source, because it can reach.

01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:16.150
From here, I can
get to every node.

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:18.580
But in general-- maybe
there's another vertex

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:24.900
here-- draw a more
complicated picture.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.410
It could be, there's
no one vertex

01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:28.150
that can reach all the others.

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:30.400
For example, it may be
the graph is disconnected.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.060
That's a good example.

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.710
So there's no single source
that can reach everywhere.

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:36.280
I really want to
reach everywhere.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.620
So what am I going to do?

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.415
Add a new source.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:43.920
Call it s.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:46.870
I'm going to add an edge
to every other vertex.

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:49.141
Now, I can get
everywhere from s.

01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:49.640
OK?

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.650
What are the weights?

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.300
0.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.507
0 sounds good.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.590
I don't want to change the
weights, in some sense.

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:56.740
So I put 0, and add
0 to everything.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:58.750
That's not going to change much.

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.140
Now, notice I add no
cycles to the graph.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.280
So if there were no negative
weight cycles before,

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.571
still no negative weight
cycles, because the cycles are

01:17:05.571 --> 01:17:07.540
the same as they were before.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.330
But now, from s I
can reach everywhere.

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:10.871
If there's no negative
weight cycles,

01:17:10.871 --> 01:17:13.300
that means there's a
well-defined, finite value

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:19.890
for delta of s comma v
for all V. And that is h.

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:22.722
What?

01:17:22.722 --> 01:17:24.060
It's crazy man.

01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:31.110
All right, so we add s to
V. We're going to add s

01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:37.670
comma v to e for all
V. That's the old V.

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:40.610
And I'm going to set
the weight of s comma v

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:46.500
to be 0 for all V. OK,
that's what i just did.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:56.320
And so now, delta of s
comma v is finite for all V.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.020
It's not plus
infinity, because I

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:00.320
know there is-- it's got
to be less than 0, right?

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.250
I can get from s to everywhere.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.600
So it's less than
positive infinity.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.440
It's also not negative
infinity, because I've

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.570
assumed there's no negative
weight cycles anywhere.

01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:17.710
So I'm going to let h
of v be delta of s,v.

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:21.810
I claim that just
works, magically.

01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:22.680
That's insane.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.160
Every time I see it, it's
like, got to be crazy

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:29.700
man-- crazy but correct.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.325
That's Johnson.

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:36.490
It's like you just pray that
this happens, and it works.

01:18:36.490 --> 01:18:37.440
Why would it happen?

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.360
Why would it be that--
what do we want to say--

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:50.300
w of u,v plus h of
u minus h of v--

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:52.880
we want this to be greater
than or equal to 0.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.710
I guess I had already
rewritten this way.

01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:58.800
Neither way is the right
way, so it doesn't matter.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.610
So let's see.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:04.730
We have a weight of u,v. We have
the shortest path from s to u.

01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:07.780
And we have this the
shortest pathway from s

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:10.930
to v. We want that to be
greater than or equal to 0.

01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:12.220
Why?

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:18.390
Put this over there, and I get
delta s,v is less than or equal

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:25.620
to delta of s,u plus
w of u,v, which is?

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:29.000
Triangle inequality,
which is true.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.050
It turns out, this thing we've
been staring at for so long

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:40.110
is actually just
triangle inequality.

01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:42.240
So of course we want to
compute shortest paths,

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.100
because shortest paths
satisfy triangle inequality.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.250
The whole name of the
game in shortest paths

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.230
is to find a place
where you don't satisfy

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:51.870
triangle inequality and fix it.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:55.860
So if it makes sense, if
that's possible to do,

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.437
Bellman-Ford will do it.

01:19:58.437 --> 01:19:59.770
So how we're going to do step 1?

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.770
We're going to run
Bellman-Ford once.

01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:04.600
We're going to add this
source vertex, so that there

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:08.040
is a clear source to
run Bellman-Ford from,

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.310
and then, run Bellman-Ford
from there only.

01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:12.770
That will give us
a weight function

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:14.750
for the vertices,
namely how long

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.700
does it take to get from
s to those vertices.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.970
Those weights will
actually all be negative.

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:21.280
But then, we're going
to modify all the edge

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.520
weights according to
this formula, which

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520
negates some of them.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.875
So some of them are going
to go up some, some of them

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:26.750
are going to go down.

01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.110
It's kind of weird.

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:30.070
But when we're done,
all of the weights

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:33.260
will be non-negative because
we had triangle inequality.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.955
And now, we can run
Dijkstra from every vertex.

01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:37.580
So it's like we
bootstrap a little bit.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.288
We run Bellman-Ford
once, because we know

01:20:39.288 --> 01:20:40.730
it handles negative weights.

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:43.850
It will also tell us if there
are any negative weight cycles.

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:46.400
That's why we want this theorem.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.390
Maybe Bellman-Ford says, I can't
satisfy triangle inequality,

01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:50.440
because there's a
negative weight cycle.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.580
I don't know what to do.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.040
Then, we know, well actually,
then there was no solution.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.830
OK, that's kind of interesting.

01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:59.910
But then, we'll have to
deal with the shortest

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:02.644
paths-- sorry-- deal with
those negative weight cycles.

01:21:02.644 --> 01:21:04.060
I won't cover how
to do that here.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.070
But you can.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.320
And otherwise, there's no
negative weight cycles, then

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.190
Bellman-Ford finds valid h.

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:12.760
Then, we plug that h into here.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.290
Then, we have
non-negative weights.

01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:20.410
So in VE time, we've
reduced to the non-negative

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:22.000
all-pair shortest paths.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.795
And then, we run
Dijkstra V times.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:25.420
Then, we get almost
our answers, but we

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:28.170
have to modify them to get
back the correct weights

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:29.420
on our shortest paths.

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:35.440
And so we computed shortest
paths in V squared log V

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.060
plus VE, because this is
how much Dijkstra costs,

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:41.590
and because Bellman-Ford
takes less time.

01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:43.220
We're good.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.600
That's the magic.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.990
And that's all-pairs
shortest paths.
