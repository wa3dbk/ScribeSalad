00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.150
PROFESSOR: So this
is a 2-3 tree.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.340
So as you can see, every node
has-- so the 2-3 is either

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.840
two children or three children.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.350
Every node can have either
one key or two keys.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.665
And the correlation
is that every--

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.610
so if there are n keys in a
node, it has n plus 1 children.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.740
So the way that works is
similar to binary search trees.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.350
So if you have value here, the
two children surrounding it--

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.850
so this side is less,
this side is more.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.010
So it's essentially sort of
going in order reversal, left

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.830
child, root, right child.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.440
So [INAUDIBLE], it's ordered.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:04.010
So generally a B tree
will have some nodes.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.610
So let's say n and
n plus 1 children.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.130
And if you take
anything in the middle,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.260
look at the two children,
all the keys in this sub-tree

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.360
are smaller than the key
here, and all the keys

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.680
in this sub-tree are
larger than the key here.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.320
So that's the general node.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.570
So before we go
into more details

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.520
of the properties
and everything,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.330
the question is why use B-trees.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.380
So if we do a quick
depth analysis,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.760
we can see that the
depth is to log n rate.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.630
Is that clear to everyone sort
of, why the depth is log n?

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.025
Because you have branching just
like in binary search trees.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:53.860
In fact, you have
more branching.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.020
But in any case,
depth is to log n.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.260
But why use B-trees over
binary search trees?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.920
Anyone have a
reason why you would

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.500
prefer to use B-trees or not?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.370
So all the operations
are still log n.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.910
Any guesses?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.080
None.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.500
OK.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.240
Well, OK, the reason
is memory hierarchy.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.340
So normally in
[INAUDIBLE], we just

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.320
assume that the computer
has access to memory,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.150
and you can just pick up things
from disk and constant time

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.890
and do your operations with
it, and you don't worry

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.294
about caches and everything.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:35.710
But that's not how
computers work.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.692
So in a computer, you
have-- so those of you

00:02:37.692 --> 00:02:39.400
who have taken some
computer architecture

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.730
class [INAUDIBLE] or something,
you will know that hierarchy.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.570
So there's a CPU-- so
let's draw it somewhere.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.020
So you have your CPU.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.570
And [INAUDIBLE] CPU,
you have some registers.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.930
You have your caches,
L1, L2, L3, whatever.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.080
You have your RAM.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.610
You have disk after that.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.860
So disk [? loads. ?] Then
you have your, I don't know,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.090
your cloud, whatever.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.130
So each level, your
memory size grows

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.430
and your access
time grows as well.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.650
So in the basic memory
hierarchy model,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.930
we have just two levels
of hierarchy, let's say.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.370
So you have cache connected
by a high bandwidth channel

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.370
to the CPU, and you have a
low bandwidth channel to disk.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.754
So the difference
is-- so essentially

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:27.920
you can consider that cache
just has infinite speed.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.790
Cache, just like,
whatever you can take it.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.790
You don't have any cost for
bringing in stuff from cache.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.680
But it's finite size.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.560
So the way cache works is it
has a bunch of words, which

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.740
is a finite number of words.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.915
So each word has size B, and
let's say you have m words.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.340
However, hard disk is just,
let's say, infinite memory,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.130
but it has some cost
associated to accessing things.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.580
Also when you access
things from hard disk,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.630
you copy them into cache.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.990
When you copy a block of
size b, you take it up

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.800
from the hard disk,
and you take a block,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.920
and you put it into cache.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.510
And you have to get rid of
something because it's fine.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.460
So what you want to do
is you want to utilize

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.010
that b block efficiently.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.459
You just want to bring
a b block every time

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.170
you want to access a new node.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.170
In a binary search tree,
normal operations are what?

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.520
You start in the root
and go to a node.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.880
But that's not very easily
correlated with this.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.380
Right?

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.779
So if you want to
utilize an entire block,

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.320
you would want something like
a block which sort of goes down

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.709
the tree.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.500
But that's not how
binary trees are stored.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.450
Binary trees are
stored this way.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.660
So that's the nice
thing about B-trees.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.452
So this is just a 2-3 tree.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:46.660
This is not a general B-tree.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.840
A general B-tree will
have a bunch of nodes,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.690
and we'll come to that number.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.610
But generally you want to make
that number of nodes something

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.380
like the cache-- what is it?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.910
The word size in the cache.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.860
So once you do that, you can
get an entire node from disk,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.950
like work on that, and then
get another [INAUDIBLE],

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.629
so your height is reduced.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:09.420
And you can do your
operation much quicker,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.940
because you're not accessing
disk every time you're

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.060
going down a level.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.560
Sorry.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.930
You are accessing disk every
time you go down a level,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.490
but you're utilizing
the whole block

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.226
when you're accessing disk.

00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:23.100
Good?

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.180
Sort of make sense?

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.370
OK.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.460
So let's write down the
specifications for B-trees now.

00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:35.316
All right.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.460
So number of children.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.510
So first of all, a
B-tree has something

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.960
called a branching factor.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.567
So in the 2-3 tree, the
branching factor is two.

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.650
So what that means is
simply that it just balances

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.608
the number of children.

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:04.460
So the number of children has to
be greater than or equal to 2.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.690
Other than the root node.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.970
The root node can have
less than B children.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.200
It's fine.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.670
Also it's upper bounded
by 2B [? plus ?] 2B.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.760
Notice that this is
a strict upper bound.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.140
So you can have at most 2B
minus 1 children from a node.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:29.790
Also remember that the number
of keys, the number of keys

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.640
is just 1 less than
the number of children.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:40.730
Therefore, these inequalities
are just reduced by 1.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.260
So you have minus 1 and
you have 2B minus 1.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.760
So the number of keys can be
between minus 1 and 2B minus 2.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.270
The rationale for that
will become clear-- yeah?

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.345
AUDIENCE: Is B the
height of the tree?

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:56.567
PROFESSOR: No, B
is the branching.

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.650
B is the branching factor.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.497
So that is the
number of children.

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:00.830
It's not the number of children.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.650
It's a bound of the
number of children.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.050
So like in the 2-3
tree, B is equal to 2,

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.840
and this is a 2-3 tree.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.950
So the 2 refers to-- you
can have either two children

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.660
or you can have three children.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.520
And so the upper bound on
children is 2B minus 1.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.240
2B minus 1 is equal to 3.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.180
So you can have two
or three children.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.830
And correspondingly, you
can have either one or two

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.251
keys in a node.

00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:37.750
Make sense?

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.374
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:38.374 --> 00:07:39.340
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.200
OK So coming back to this.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.630
So the root does not
have a lower bound.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.160
The root can have one
child in any tree.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.355
So you have a B equal
to 5 tree, the root

00:07:50.355 --> 00:07:52.050
can still have
one child-- sorry.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.480
Not one child, one key
element, two children.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.900
All right.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.760
It's good.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.370
Also it's completely balanced.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.310
So all the leaves
are the same depth.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.780
So you can see it here, right?

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.350
So you can't have a
dangling node here.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.880
This is not allowed.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.047
You have to have a leaf.

00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:28.630
You have to have
something going down,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.400
and everything ends
at the same level.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:31.900
All right.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.110
So that's the thing.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.520
So also the leaves obviously
don't have children,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:43.130
so this condition is
violated by the leaf.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.380
So that's the basic
structure of a B-tree.

00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:51.100
So the first operation
we'll consider on B-trees

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.560
is searching.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.160
So that should be
relatively straightforward.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.110
So remember how searching is
done in the binary search tree.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.900
You bring in a value
x compared to the key.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.875
Let's say x is less than
K, you go down this path.

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:08.120
Let's say x is greater than
K, you go down this path.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.570
So similarly in a B-tree.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.010
So let's say we
bring in a value.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.770
Let's say you are
looking for 20.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.120
So you bring in 20
compared to this.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.190
20 is less than 30,
so you go down here.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.852
Now you have two values.

00:09:23.852 --> 00:09:25.060
So where does 20 fit in here?

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.851
Not here.

00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:26.350
Not here.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.951
It fits here.

00:09:26.951 --> 00:09:27.450
OK.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.110
Go down this tree.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.980
You find 20, that's it.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:37.410
So in general, you bring in a
key K, you look at this node,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.110
and you go through
all the values.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:43.590
So something I forgot to
mention, which should be clear.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.250
All the keys in a node, they're
sorted, one after the other.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.350
So your values go like this.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.140
So they're increasing
in this way.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.835
Make sense?

00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:56.440
So you bring in a key.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.900
Look at all the keys in
the node you're looking at,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.230
pick the place where K fits
in, unless it's already

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.730
in the node.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.438
Then you're done.

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:04.660
You've found it.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:08.850
Otherwise, let's say K fits
in between these two guys.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.250
So you go down this
child and continue.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.940
So searching with log
n, similar to BSTs.

00:10:20.294 --> 00:10:21.835
So searching is not
very interesting.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.225
So next is insertion.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.860
So insertion is a little more
interesting than searching.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.360
So what you do in
insertion is you--

00:10:48.360 --> 00:11:09.020
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.219
PROFESSOR: So before we resume,
does anyone have any questions

00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:13.510
about the structure of B-trees.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.860
We rushed through
that quite fast.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.655
About how B-trees
are structured,

00:11:18.655 --> 00:11:20.165
everyone good with that?

00:11:20.165 --> 00:11:25.294
OK, also any questions about
searching in a B-tree or a BST?

00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:25.794
Go ahead.

00:11:25.794 --> 00:11:27.770
AUDIENCE: Just a
random question.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.722
So the 38 there, it can
only have two children.

00:11:31.722 --> 00:11:33.210
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.270
So one value, two children.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:39.760
So you have some
node in the B-tree,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.420
and whatever is
below it is split

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.350
into parts by the elements.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.100
So if you have n
elements, it splits it up

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.275
into n plus 1 segments.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.087
AUDIENCE: You said that the root
didn't have to follow the root.

00:11:53.087 --> 00:11:53.670
PROFESSOR: No.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.589
AUDIENCE: Why is that?

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.130
PROFESSOR: Well, you'll see when
we do insertion and deletion

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.005
why that's necessary.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:02.350
But essentially you can
consider that it's an invariant.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.770
And all we have to do is
preserve that invariant.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.230
So the root, it has to
still have less than two--

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.140
it still has to have
the upper bound.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.569
But it doesn't need
to have a lower bound.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.490
AUDIENCE: How do you choose B?

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.120
PROFESSOR: Well, the whole
[INAUDIBLE] cache size,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.220
so something with that.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.850
So you probably want 2B to
be about your cache size

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.760
so you can get the
whole block in one go.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.050
I've never implemented
a B-tree, so I

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.150
don't know how it's
actually done in practice.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.399
But that is the reason, so
I'm assuming it's something

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.730
to do with the cache length.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.102
AUDIENCE: Is the 14, is it
a child of both 10 and 17?

00:12:38.102 --> 00:12:39.935
PROFESSOR: Well, it's
not a child of either.

00:12:39.935 --> 00:12:41.260
It's a child of this node.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.570
So this node has two
elements, so it's

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.380
being divided-- dividing the
interval up into three parts.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.800
So it's in between 10
and 17 is the point here.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.600
AUDIENCE: So then this
node has five children?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.857
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:12:55.857 --> 00:12:56.940
No, it has three children.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.010
So don't think of
every key as a node.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.000
Think of the whole
unit as a node.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.115
So it's not necessarily--
in a binary search tree,

00:13:06.115 --> 00:13:08.134
you have one element,
but here every node

00:13:08.134 --> 00:13:09.050
has multiple elements.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.624
That's the point of it.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:14.840
Anyone else?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.650
OK, let's start with searching.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.236
So let's leave this here.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.770
Well, you have the formulas
up there, so that's good.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.160
Insertion.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.030
Let's start with insertion.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.155
We already did searching.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.444
So insertion is you
bring in a new key K,

00:13:54.444 --> 00:13:56.110
and you want to insert
it into the tree.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.120
So what's the problem
that could happen?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.500
You can find the location where
you want to insert it, just

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.125
like searching.

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:03.390
You just go down the tree and
find where it should be placed.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.280
But once you do place
it, you have a problem.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.113
What is the problem?

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:10.570
The problem is that one of your
nodes will become overfull.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.070
Whatever.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.840
It'll overflow, and
that's not what you want.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.760
So you want some way
so you can manage this.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.940
How do you manage this?

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:25.190
So I have this lovely prop here,
which I hope to demonstrate.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.690
OK.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.770
So here we have B equal to 4.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:39.110
So let's first figure
out the number of keys.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.230
So what is the minimum number of
keys, anyone for B equal to 4?

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.959
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:14:42.959 --> 00:14:44.125
PROFESSOR: Three, precisely.

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:49.688
So what is the maximum
number of keys?

00:14:49.688 --> 00:14:51.556
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.770
PROFESSOR: 4 into
2 minus 3, yeah.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.000
Correct.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.170
3, 4.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.500
It's not seven, there's
a strictly less than sign

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.090
somewhere.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.070
Yes.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.198
And you'll see why it's
not seven in a minute.

00:15:05.198 --> 00:15:06.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.150
Oh.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.070
Hypocritical of me.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.140
All right.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.180
So as you can see,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.110
So some insertion happened.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.250
Is the writing clear?

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.580
Can everyone read the numbers?

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.750
49 looks a little skewed.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.160
Anyway, essentially
these are all sorted.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.290
This is the parent node.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.650
Doesn't matter what's over here.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.100
All that matters is 8, 56,
and whatever's in between.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.580
So what we do when we
have an overfull node

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.790
is something that's
called a split operation.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.729
So split.

00:15:45.729 --> 00:15:47.270
And there's something
which is called

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.670
a merge, which we'll
come to later when

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.680
we're doing deletion.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.720
But a split is--
very intuitively,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.486
it splits the node
into two parts.

00:15:55.486 --> 00:15:57.610
So what it does is when
you have an overfull node--

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.700
so the number of
elements here is what?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.220
2B minus 1, which is
just 1 over the max.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.210
So what do you do is you
take the middle element

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.115
and remove it.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:11.800
and now you split the
node into two parts.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.730
Observe that there are
three here and three here,

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.111
which is perfect.

00:16:16.111 --> 00:16:17.860
And now what you do
with the middle node--

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.774
so now you're
actually disrupting

00:16:19.774 --> 00:16:21.440
the structure of the
tree, because there

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.062
was one pointer going in.

00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:23.895
There was one child.

00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:25.660
And now you have two children.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.940
So somehow you need to
adjust the parent node,

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.090
because the parent node
had only one child.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.240
Well, at least there are other
children off to the side.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.900
But here it had only one child,
and now it's split apart.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.580
So you do something very simple.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.675
You just insert
this guy in here.

00:16:42.675 --> 00:16:44.300
And then you say,
oh, this points here,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.010
and this points here.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.610
Make sense?

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.810
I'm going to get
rid of these two.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.120
And you can even
convince yourself

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.910
that this preserves all
the nice properties.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.310
So your children have
nicely fallen back

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.589
into their interval.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.627
Your sequence is
completely correct,

00:17:13.627 --> 00:17:15.460
because this was the
middle element of this.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.329
So this divides this
interval properly.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.970
This is also between 8 and 56,
because this was in this node.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.259
So all the properties.

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:25.050
But there's one property
that is a problem.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.890
So you have just increased the
size of the parent node by 1.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.750
So now it's possible that the
parent node has overflowed.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.680
So what do you do?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.800
You split it again.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.950
And split it again.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.544
And if at any
point, you're fine,

00:17:39.544 --> 00:17:41.710
you look at the parent node
and go, OK, that's fine.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.250
That's in the range.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.280
But every time it overflows,
you can keep going.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.210
And how many times
can you do this?

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.180
You can do this all
the way up to the root.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.710
And when you reach the
root, either it's fine

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:52.930
or the root is too big.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.840
It's reached 2B minus 1.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.680
And then you split
the root, and you

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.720
get one single
[INAUDIBLE] up there.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.220
So that, in answer
to your question,

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.780
that is why you need that
property in some sense.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.750
Not a very convincing
argument, but sort of.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.720
So let's actually
do an insertion

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.540
in this tree we have here.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.600
So we are going to insert 16.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.130
So 16 comes in here.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.450
It's less than 30,
it goes to the left.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:28.390
It's between 10 and 17,
it goes in the middle.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.280
16.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.480
And it's greater than
14, so we add 16 here.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.920
All right.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.040
That seems good.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.570
All the properties fine.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.660
This still has two elements,
which is the maximum,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.810
but it's good.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.324
It doesn't overflow.

00:19:03.324 --> 00:19:04.490
Let's insert something else.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.830
Let's insert 2.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.860
So 2 goes to 30,
goes down, goes down.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.670
And we have a problem, because
2 has overflowed this node.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.590
So we split.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.367
And the way we split is we
take the middle element.

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:22.450
So we split the node here.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.680
And 3 goes up to the
parent, so 3 goes here.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.015
And all good, except for
the parent has overflowed.

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:39.390
So what do we do
with the parent?

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.895
We split the parent again.

00:19:40.895 --> 00:19:44.870
And this time, it's right down
the middle, the 10 goes up.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.520
So OK, let's get rid of this.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:53.090
So now that we split the
parent, the 10 goes up here.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.490
And you're good.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:58.510
It's a bit cluttered, so
let me reposition the 17.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.550
Did those two
operations make sense?

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.876
Questions?

00:20:12.876 --> 00:20:17.870
AUDIENCE: If your node size
[INAUDIBLE] number of--

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.040
PROFESSOR: So just pick
the-- first of all-- OK.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.387
If the way we're doing it--
when your node is overflowing,

00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:27.344
it's returning only one
thing at a time, right?

00:20:27.344 --> 00:20:28.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.749
PROFESSOR: So if your
node is overflowing,

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:32.587
it'll be 2t minus 1, which
is an odd number always.

00:20:32.587 --> 00:20:34.670
There might be a case where
you get an even number

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.753
if you do something weird.

00:20:35.753 --> 00:20:38.200
Maybe you have a-- there are
different ways to do B-trees.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.710
But if it does, you can probably
pick the one, either of them,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.240
and then [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.240
I'm not sure about that.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.400
I'll look into it.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.910
But in general, if you're doing
it this way, it's always odd.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.274
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:20:51.274 --> 00:20:53.908
Anything else?

00:20:53.908 --> 00:20:56.908
AUDIENCE: If we did reach
all the way to the root

00:20:56.908 --> 00:20:58.150
and then went one more up--

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.030
PROFESSOR: So what
you would do is--

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.446
AUDIENCE: That root would have--

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:03.070
PROFESSOR: That root would
have two children, one element

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.410
and two children, which is
fine because we didn't put

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.866
that restriction on the root.

00:21:06.866 --> 00:21:07.795
That's good.

00:21:07.795 --> 00:21:08.670
How we doing on time?

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.480
OK, we have some time.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.966
Let's jump into deletion, unless
anyone else has questions.

00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:16.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] any point?

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.120
PROFESSOR: So-- oh, yeah.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.520
That's a good-- thank you.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.850
So you are going
down to the leaves

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.015
at most-- at most
of the leaf ones,

00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:25.490
and you're going back up one.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.880
So it's like log n plus
log n, and you're good.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.710
Let's do deletion.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.210
So deletion is more complicated.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.520
So the reason, it'll be clear.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.790
So the problem in deletion
will be remove a node

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.490
and a node is now underfull.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.400
So it has less than B minus
1 keys in it suddenly.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.600
So let's turn this around.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.980
So again B equal to 4.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.900
This node is a problem.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.610
Only two things in it.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.930
So what do we do?

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.980
So before we go into that,
let's make this assumption

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.010
that-- there are two
steps to deletion.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.950
The first step is making
the deletion at a leaf.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.049
How do you do that?

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:28.340
So the way you make a deletion
at a leaf is, let's say,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.100
you have a key.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.470
You come down in your
B-tree, and you add a node.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.017
Oh, this key needs
to be deleted.

00:22:38.017 --> 00:22:38.850
But it's not a leaf.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.470
So what do you do?

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:46.230
So essentially what you do is
you look at these two subtrees.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.780
So it might have
only one subtree.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.530
If it's at the end,
it will have only one.

00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.360
Actually, no, that's not true.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:51.940
Ignore that.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.680
If it's not a leaf,
it has two subtrees.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.130
So either take the
rightmost element

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.625
in this subtree,
which is a leaf,

00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:00.250
because you can always
keep going down,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.333
right, right, right, right
till you get to a leaf,

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:04.810
or the leftmost element
in this subtree.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:09.310
So that is just the next
element after this guy.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.700
So you delete this, and
you bring this up to here.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.910
We'll do an example of
this, and it'll be clearer.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.650
So you take either the rightmost
element in the left subtree

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.550
or the leftmost element
in the right subtree

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.620
and bring it up here.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.860
So you sort of like move
the deletion to the leaf.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.310
And now it's easier
to deal with.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.310
So we will come to that.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.990
Also just note that this is not
what is done in the recitation.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.580
This algorithm for
deletion, I think,

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.880
is not done in the
recitation notes.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.546
This is a different thing, which
I'll send out a link for later.

00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:40.540
But I believe it
works, because I got it

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.500
from the [INAUDIBLE] reference.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:49.160
So once you move to the leaf--
so now let's look at this.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.510
So this is a node
that is underfull.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.050
And you want to fix it.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.040
So how do you fix it?

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.750
So what do is you
look at its siblings.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.280
So in this case,
it has one sibling.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.770
It can have up to two siblings.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.240
It can have left or right.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.390
So what you do is you
look at a sibling.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.360
And this sibling is
actually 1 over the minimum.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.460
And if it's 1 over the
minimum, then it's really easy.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.840
All you have to do is take
the leftmost thing here--

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.340
or if it's the
sibling on this side,

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.040
take the rightmost thing here.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.730
And look at its parent.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:30.330
So you bring the parent down,
and you move the sibling up.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.220
And there we go.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.950
So you basically are rotating
the thing into place.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.420
So you move the parent down
into the underfull node,

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:43.329
and you replace the parent
by the leftmost thing here.

00:24:43.329 --> 00:24:45.120
Everyone see why that
preserves everything?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.380
And the child is also shifted.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.490
Make sure you see that.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.190
So the child which was in this
subtree is now in this subtree.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.770
But then you can
have the situation

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.620
where you don't
have a nice sibling

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.410
to take care of your problems.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.490
So in this scenario, the
sibling is barely full.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.980
It has three things, and it
can't donate anything to you.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.440
So what do you do in that case?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.170
So then you do something which
is a parallel of the split

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:18.730
operation.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.570
You do a merge.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:21.430
So what do you have?

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:30.490
So here you have B minus 2,
and here you have B minus 1.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.555
And you get 2B minus 3.

00:25:33.555 --> 00:25:34.930
Well, you've got
another element.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.530
You also take the parent.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.040
So how do you do the merge.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.706
I just want to show
you the merge first.

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:41.891
So the way you do it is
you move the parent down,

00:25:41.891 --> 00:25:42.890
and you merge these two.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.380
Seems OK?

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.010
So you move the parent node
down and merge these two.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.995
And, well, now this
comes together,

00:25:53.995 --> 00:25:55.480
and this points
into the new node.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.530
Sort of clear what's going on?

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.112
Questions?

00:26:05.112 --> 00:26:06.088
Yes?

00:26:06.088 --> 00:26:09.815
AUDIENCE: So now the
parent is underfull?

00:26:09.815 --> 00:26:11.690
PROFESSOR: Well, so you
have-- yeah, exactly.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.990
So you have decreased
the size of the parent,

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.070
so it might be underfull.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.190
So you propagate.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.220
Anything else?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.630
AUDIENCE: So are these
all different techniques

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:21.774
for doing that?

00:26:21.774 --> 00:26:23.190
PROFESSOR: So there
are two cases.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.110
So either you have a sibling
which has extra nodes to donate

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.036
to you or you don't.

00:26:29.036 --> 00:26:30.660
If you don't, then
you have to do this.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.335
AUDIENCE: But what
about that case?

00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:34.720
Or is that just like--

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.875
PROFESSOR: No, that is
moving it down to the leaf.

00:26:36.875 --> 00:26:38.708
Once you move the
deletion down to the leaf,

00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:40.300
so here we have something now.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.100
And now you move it
all the way back up.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.720
So there are two cases.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.650
Let's do an example.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.850
That'll make it clearer.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.366
How are we doing on time?

00:26:50.366 --> 00:26:51.764
Five minutes, all right.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.435
So we are going to delete 38.

00:26:58.435 --> 00:27:00.840
38 is gone.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.840
But we want to move
it down to the leaf.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.580
So let's take an element.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.810
Let's say we take 41.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:13.560
So we take 41 and
move it up here.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.482
41 is the leftmost thing
in the right subtree.

00:27:17.482 --> 00:27:19.440
So this vacancy doesn't
really affect anything,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.381
because this node still has
the right number of things,

00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:24.630
because it's still got one
thing in it, which is good.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.920
So you're fine.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.080
This is now just 48.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.850
Let's say we now delete 41.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.540
So 41 is gone.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.480
So now that 41 is
gone, what do you

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.850
replace this blank spot with?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.390
Either this or this, right?

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.520
Doesn't matter.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.900
So let's just do this
one for consistency.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.420
So you have 48 here.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.230
And now you a problem
because you have a blank box.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:03.590
So can you rotate?

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.460
Yes, no?

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.870
No, right?

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.860
Because sibling is barely full.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.000
So what can you do?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.016
So you merge.

00:28:12.016 --> 00:28:12.890
And how do you merge?

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:17.067
You move the 48 down, and
you combine everything.

00:28:17.067 --> 00:28:18.650
So this is kind of
hard to understand,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.940
but this is like a
zero-element node.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.120
So when you merge, you
have 32, 48, and nothing,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.070
so it's just 32 and 48.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:38.770
So what you do is--
so this seems weird,

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.910
but this is just
another empty node.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.075
You just propagated
the emptiness upwards.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.860
Now you take this empty node,
and you look for its siblings.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.330
Again, its sibling is--
well, it's barely full.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.330
So what do you do now?

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.790
You bring the 30 down,
and you merge this.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:58.950
So let's do that.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.765
30 comes down, and there we go.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:14.245
Looks fine?

00:29:14.245 --> 00:29:15.940
Does that tree look good?

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.190
Questions about the operation?

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:27.050
I'm sure it was not
clear, but-- anything?

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.370
Make sense?

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.730
OK, let's do a deletion where
we can actually do a rotation.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.200
So let's go ahead and delete 20.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.205
So you do your searching,
go down the tree.

00:29:38.205 --> 00:29:40.910
You find the 20 under here.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.300
So now, OK.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.620
So you're left with just--
actually never mind.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.570
We'll do another one.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.770
So this doesn't do anything.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.020
You lost the 20, and you're
left with the 24 this time.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.359
So now you delete the 24.

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.900
So now that you've
got rid of the 24,

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.150
you have a blank box here now.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.310
But its sibling is
not barely full.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.750
It has something to donate.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.864
So anyone, which elements
are going to rotate?

00:30:06.864 --> 00:30:07.840
AUDIENCE: 17 and 16.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.403
PROFESSOR: 16 and 17, right.

00:30:09.403 --> 00:30:10.370
Cool.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:16.060
So 16 goes up, 17 goes down.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.260
And you're done.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.260
You're consistent again.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:21.880
So that was deletion.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.180
Those are the two
cases for deletion.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.752
Does that make sense?

00:30:26.752 --> 00:30:29.220
Anyone?

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.020
Any questions?

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:32.290
OK.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.420
So that's all the topics we
were supposed to cover today.

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.810
Any questions about
any of the operations,

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.520
any of the other topics,
lecture, anything?
