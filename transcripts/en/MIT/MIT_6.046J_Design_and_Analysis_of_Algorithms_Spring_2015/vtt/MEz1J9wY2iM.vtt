00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.900
PROFESSOR: Let's get started.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.170
Thanks for coming to lecture.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.830
Know there's a quiz coming up.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.500
There will be a tangible benefit
of attending this lecture.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.310
And it's not Frisbees.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.130
OK?

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.270
We'll figure it out soon.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
So, two lectures on
approximation algorithms.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.060
One today and one,
I guess a week

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.980
and two days from today on
Thursday after the break.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.420
Eric will give that one.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.310
So this is more of an
introductory lecture.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.740
Eric talked about NP complete
problems and NP hard problems.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.380
He talked about how you could
show that problems are NP

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.180
complete or NP hard.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.330
So what happens when you
discover that a problem is NP

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.040
complete or NP hard?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.850
Well, there's a
variety of strategies.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.990
You could just kind of give up,
and say this is intractable.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.210
I want a different job.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.840
You could say that
I'm just going

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
to do the best I can without
any theoretical guarantees.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010
I'm going to use a heuristic.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.830
I'm going to think of the
simplest, greedy heuristic.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.170
I'm going to code it up
and I'm going to move on.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.630
Or you could do
approximation algorithms.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.470
You could say, I'm going to
think up an interesting, greedy

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.760
heuristic.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.010
But I'm going to prove
that this greedy heuristic,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.040
in every conceivable situation
with respect to the inputs,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.651
is going to be within
some factor of optimal.

00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:52.150
Right?

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.900
And that's what we're
going to do today.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.030
We're going to take a bunch
of NP complete problems,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.590
and we're going to
essentially create

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.280
simple heuristics with these
problems, simple strategies

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.080
that are polynomial time, to
quote, "solve these problems."

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100
And what does it mean
to solve these problems?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.480
Well, you know that if
it's polynomial time,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.650
you're not guaranteed to get
the optimum answer every time.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.220
But you'll call it a solution--
an approximate solution--

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.170
because you're within
a factor of two

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.010
for every possible input.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.480
That's one example.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.110
Or, you have a more complicated
approximation factor

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.120
that we'll get to
in a second, where

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.780
it's not quite a factor of two.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.860
It might be a factor of two
for small size problems.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.290
Might be a factor of
10 for larger problems.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.800
And so on and so forth.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.870
And then the last
thing is, it'd be great

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.150
if you could spend more time
and get better solutions.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.410
And those are
approximation schemes.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.370
And we'll look at
approximation schemes as well.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.440
So, just dive in each
of these problems,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.800
depending on whether it's
decision or optimization

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.410
is NP complete or NP hard.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.300
I'll define these
problems as we go along.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.500
But basically, the name of the
game here is, grab a problem,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.760
define it, think of an
interesting heuristic,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.920
do a proof.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.420
OK?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.070
And that's essentially what
we're going to do three times.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.800
The good news is the
proofs aren't tortuous.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.810
They're not 30-minute proofs.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.810
And they should be
pretty intuitive.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.710
And we'll see if we can
extract them out of you.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.727
A painful extraction process.

00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:38.060
I went to the dentist yesterday.

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.280
Not for extraction.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.750
I should've said, I went
to the dentist yesterday

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.730
and I'm now going to take
it out on you, right?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.060
OK, so what's an
approximation algorithm?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.990
An algorithm, for
a problem of size

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.090
n, and so it's going
to be parameterized.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.830
And the approximation factor
may also be parameterized.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.190
It'd be nice if it weren't,
if it were a constant factor

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.260
approximation.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.411
But sometimes you can't do that.

00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:20.910
And in fact, sometimes
you can prove

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.660
that constant
factor approximation

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.610
algorithms don't exist.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.400
And if they do,
then p equals NP.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.900
All right?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.170
So it's gets very interesting.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.240
So, in this case, approximation
algorithms or schemes

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.140
exist for these
three problems, which

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.910
is why we are looking
at them today.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.780
But you got a problem of size n.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:56.510
And we're going to define an
approximation ratio, row of n,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.265
for any input-- if for
any input-- excuse me.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.740
The algorithm
produces a solution

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:25.140
with cost C that satisfies
this little property, which

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:32.040
says that the max of C
divided by Copt divided

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.420
by-- oh, sorry-- and Copt
divided by C is less than

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.430
or equal to row n.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.090
And the only reason you
have two terms in here

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.240
is because you haven't
said whether it's

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.950
a minimization problem or
a maximization problem.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.840
Right, so of it' a
minimization problem,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.982
you don't want to be too much
greater than the minimum.

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:54.440
If it's a maximization
problem, you

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.565
don't want to be too much
smaller than the maximum.

00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:58.610
And so you just stick
those two things in there.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.300
And you don't worry
about whether it's

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.200
min or max in terms of
the objective function,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.580
and you want it to be
a particular ratio.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.610
OK?

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.550
Now I did say row of n there.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.300
So this could be a constant or
it could be a function of no.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.570
If it's a function
of n, it's going

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.682
to be an increasing
function of n.

00:06:17.682 --> 00:06:18.614
OK?

00:06:18.614 --> 00:06:20.030
Otherwise you could
just bound it,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.980
and have a constant, obviously.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.280
So, you might have
something like-- and we'll

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.830
see one of these-- log n
approximation scheme, which

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.470
says that you're going
to be within logarithmic

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.210
of the answer-- the
minimum or maximum.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.300
But if it's a million, then
if you do log of base two,

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.330
then you're within a factor
of 20, which isn't that great.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.125
But let's just say if
you're happy with it,

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.500
and if it goes to
a billion, it's

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.920
a factor 30, and
so on and so forth.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.910
Actually, it could grow.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.070
So that's an algorithm.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.820
If these terms are
used interchangeably,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.200
we'll try and differentiate.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.610
But we do have something that
we call an approximation scheme.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.660
And the big difference
between approximation

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.810
algorithms an
approximation schemes

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.880
is that I'm going to have a
little knob in an approximation

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.400
scheme that's going
to let me do more work

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.070
to get something better.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.690
OK?

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.520
And that's essentially
what a scheme

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.890
is, where we're going to take
an input-- an additional input--

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.050
epsilon, strictly
greater than zero.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:42.410
And for any fixed
epsilon, the scheme--

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.670
it's an approximation scheme
as opposed to an algorithm--

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:51.330
is a 1 plus epsilon
approximation algorithm.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.840
And so here we just say that
this is a row n approximation

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.270
algorithm if it
satisfies this property.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.480
And here we have a
family of algorithms

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.810
that are parameterized by
n in terms of run time,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.960
as well as epsilon.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.970
And so you might
have a situation

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.400
where you have
order n raised to q

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:36.669
divided by epsilon running time
for an approximation algorithm.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:41.669
And what this means is that if
you're within 10% of optimal,

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.180
then you're going to
put 0.1 down here.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.390
And this is going to be an
n raised to 20 algorithm.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.350
Polynomial time!

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.060
Wonderful!

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.880
Solve the world's problems.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.720
Not really.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.460
I mean, n raised to
20 is pretty bad.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.921
But it's not exponential.

00:08:57.921 --> 00:08:58.420
Right?

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.890
So you see that there
is a growth here

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.800
of polynomial degree
with respect to epsilon.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.860
And it's a pretty fast growth.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.860
If you want to go to
epsilon equals 0.01, I mean,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.230
even n raised to 20
is probably untenable.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.350
But certainly n raised to
200 is completely untenable.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.020
Right?

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:33.800
So this is what's called a PTAS,
which is probabilistic time

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.120
approximation scheme.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.610
And don't worry too much
about the probabilistic.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.651
It's a function of epsilon.

00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:45.400
That's the way you
want to think about it.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.820
The run time.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.920
And we'll look at a particular
scheme later in the lecture.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.150
But clearly this is
polynomial in n, OK?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.870
But it's not
polynomial in epsilon.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.370
All right?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:06.450
So a PTAS is going to
be poly in n, but not

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:14.150
necessarily in epsilon.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.110
And I say not necessarily
because we still

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.010
call it a PTAS.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.770
We just say, fully polynomial
time approximation scheme,

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:30.030
FPTAS, if it's polynomial in
both n and 1 over epsilon.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.530
Right?

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:41.790
So fully PTAS is poly
in n and 1 over epsilon.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.230
So a fully PTAS scheme
would be something like n

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.970
divided by epsilon square.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.130
OK?

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.830
So as epsilon shrinks,
obviously the run time

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.470
is going to grow because you've
got 1 over epsilon square.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.350
But it's not anywhere
as bad as the n

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:04.180
raised to 2 divided by epsilon
in terms of its growth rate.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.070
OK?

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.070
So there's lots of
NP complete problems

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.852
that have PTAS's and that some
of them have FPTAS's as well.

00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:11.810
And so on and so forth.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.480
Question?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.570
PROFESSOR: So we won't
get into that today.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:26.260
But you can think of
it as the probability

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.420
over the space of possible
solutions that you have.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.082
You can distribution of inputs.

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:37.540
The bottom line is
that we actually

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.360
won't cover that today.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.400
So let's shelve for
the next lecture, OK?

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:51.460
So just worry about the fact
that it's polynomial in n

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.640
and not in epsilon
for the first part.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.070
And it's polynomial in n and
epsilon for the second part.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.090
OK?

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.977
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:59.977 --> 00:12:00.810
PROFESSOR: Oh I see.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.100
So, it's a good point.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.570
So for the purposes of this
lecture, thank you so much.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.900
I'm glad I didn't
have to get into that.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.810
Polynomial time.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.310
Good.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.000
Better answer.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.400
Either way, we're not
going to cover that.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.350
All right?

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.850
Good.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.462
So, it's polynomial.

00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:19.420
I mean, you could have
probabilistic algorithms

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.040
that have this kind of
behavior, of course.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.980
But we're not going to cover
that in today's lecture.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.090
But thanks for
pointing that out Eric.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.400
So, that's our set up.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.020
We essentially have
a situation where

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.170
it'd be great if we could tackle
NP complete problems using

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.900
this hammer, right?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.800
Any questions so far?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.660
All right.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.380
Vertex cover.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.630
So let's dive right in.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:59.110
Let's talk about a particular
problem, very simple problem.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.125
What you have is an
undirected graph, G(V,E).

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.400
And all we want is
a set of vertices

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.145
that cover all of the edges.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:30.780
So a set of vertices
that cover all edges.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.170
What does it mean to cover?

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.200
It's the obvious thing.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.620
If I have something like this.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:45.310
As long as I have a vertex
in my set of vertices

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.430
that I'm calling a
cover that touches

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.290
one endpoint of an
edge, we're going

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.800
to call that edge covered, OK?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.360
So, in this case
it's pretty clear

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.570
that the vertex
cover is simply that.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:07.400
Because that vertex
touches all of the edges

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.455
at least at one
of the endpoints.

00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:12.580
A vertex is going to touch
one endpoint of an edge.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.280
But this vertex cover that
I've shaded touches every edge.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.180
So that's a vertex cover.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.890
If, in fact, I had
an extra edge here,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:30.050
then I now have to pick
one-- or this one of that one

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.080
in order to complete my cover.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.100
OK?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.210
That's it.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.030
That's vertex cover.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.810
Decision problem, NP
complete to figure out

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.470
if there's a certain number that
is below a certain value that

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.880
do the covering.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.600
You obviously have an
optimization problem

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.990
associated with that.

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.350
And so on and so forth.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.590
So that's our simple set up
for our first hard problem.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.090
All right?

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:08.050
And so, just to write that
out, find a subset V prime,

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:19.400
which is a subset of capital V,
such that if (U,V) is an edge

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:30.040
of G-- belongs to E-- then we
have either U belonging to V

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.981
prime, or V belonging
to V prime, or both.

00:15:34.981 --> 00:15:37.230
And it's quite possible that
your vertex cover is such

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:42.180
that, for a given edge, you have
two vertices that touch each

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.690
of the endpoints of the edge.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.940
And the optimization
problem, which

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:52.330
is what we'd like to do
here, is find a V prime

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.615
so the cardinality is minimum.

00:15:58.171 --> 00:15:58.670
OK?

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.920
So that's it.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.620
So, we don't know of a
polynomial time algorithm

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.260
to solve this problem.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.190
So we resort to heuristics.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:22.550
What is an intuitive
heuristic for this problem?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:28.540
Suppose I wanted to implement
a poly time, greedy algorithm

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.090
for this problem.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.830
What would be the first
thing that you'd think of?

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.902
Yeah, go ahead.

00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:37.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:37.159 --> 00:16:38.450
PROFESSOR: Find the max degree.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:40.290
I love that answer.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.470
It's the wrong answer
for this problem.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.086
But I love it because it
sets me up for-- ta-DA!

00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:53.660
All this work I did
before lecture, OK?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.040
All right.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:02.490
So, it turns out, that it's
not an incorrect answer.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.040
It's really not the
best answer in terms

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:13.420
of the heuristic you apply to
get an approximation algorithm.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:17.730
So we're still in the context of
an approximation algorithm, not

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.589
an approximation scheme.

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:24.970
And what we have here is a
perfectly fine heuristic that,

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:25.470
who knows?

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.450
It might actually work
better in practice

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.710
than this other
approximation algorithm

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.470
that I'm going to
talk about and prove.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.310
But the fact of the matter
is that this approximation

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.820
algorithm that has,
as a heuristic,

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.420
picking the maximum
degree continually.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.650
And completing your vertex cover
by picking the maximum degree

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:53.470
continually is a log n
approximation algorithm.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.050
And what that means is
that I can construct--

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:02.260
and that example is right
up there-- an example where,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.940
regardless of what n is,
this particular heuristic--

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.900
the maximum degree
heuristic-- might be log n off

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.410
from optimal.

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.370
OK?

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.080
Whereas, this other scheme
that we're going to talk about

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.000
is going to be within a
factor of two of optimal

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.580
regardless of the
input that you apply.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.110
Right?

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:26.699
So, you have a domination
here with respect to the two

00:18:26.699 --> 00:18:27.740
approximation algorithms.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.720
You've got one that is log n.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.300
Row n is log n, as I've
defined over there.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.560
And on the other side,
you've got two, right?

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.790
So if you're a theoretician, you
know what you're going to pick.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.236
You're going to pick two.

00:18:39.236 --> 00:18:40.860
It turns out, if
you're a practitioner,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.770
you might actually
pick this one, right?

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.880
But this is a theory course.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.480
So what is going on here?

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.650
Well, this is a
concocted example

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.280
that shows you that a maximum
degree heuristic could

00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:01.380
be as far off as log n, right?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:10.620
And so if you look at
what's going on here,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:20.770
you end up with something where
you have a bunch of vertices

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.080
up on top, OK?

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.600
And you end up with case k
factorial vertices up on top.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.900
So k equals three in this case.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.500
I have six vertices up there.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.470
I got two down here because
this is 6 divided by 3,

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.650
because k is 3.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.170
And then I got 6
divided by 3 here,

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.230
so that's 2 and 6
divided by 1 here.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.560
And so that's 6.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.140
OK?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.750
And so these edges are
set up in such a way

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.100
that it's a
pathological example.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.350
And I misspoke in terms of
the approximation algorithm.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.840
I will correct myself in just
a second, in terms of log n.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.110
It does grow with the
size of the graph.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.630
Well, I'll precisely tell
you what this approximation

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.620
algorithm is in terms of the
row n factor in just a minute.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.820
But let's just take a
look at this problem

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.240
here and see what happens when
you apply this maximum degree

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.460
heuristic, right?

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.760
And we have to take into
account the fact that,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.460
if you have ties, in
terms of maximum degree,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.770
you may end up doing
the wrong thing.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.990
Because you haven't defined
what the tiebreak is

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.710
when you have two nodes
that have the same degree.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.032
You could do the wrong
thing and pick the bad node

00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.490
for this particular
problem, right?

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.830
You have to do a
worst case analysis.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.650
So in the worst case, when
you create a vertex cover

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.380
using maximum degree, what
is the worst case in terms

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.570
of the number of
vertices that we picked

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.380
for this particular example?

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:51.880
Someone?

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.296
What is the worst case in terms
of the number of vertices?

00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:55.210
Yeah, back there.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.070
AUDIENCE: Eleven?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.550
PROFESSOR: Eleven.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.895
And where did you get that from?

00:20:57.895 --> 00:21:00.127
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:00.127 --> 00:21:02.210
PROFESSOR: You grab all
of the ones on the bottom.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.260
Fantastic.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.260
All right, there you go.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.480
Could you stand up?

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.790
Whoa.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.290
All right.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.130
It was the dentist yesterday.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.340
So, that's exactly right.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.660
That's exactly right.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.540
So what could happen
is you could pick this,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.710
because that's degree 3.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.220
Notice that the maximum
degree here is 3, of any node.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:30.910
Right?

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.620
So if I pick something of
degree three, I'm good.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.160
I'm in keeping
with my heuristic.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.250
I could pick all the
ones at the top, right?

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.190
And then I'm done, right?

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.400
That's a good-- that's
a good does solution.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.700
That's a good trajectory.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.057
But all I've said is, the
heuristic is maximum degree.

00:21:53.057 --> 00:21:55.390
So there's nothing that's
stopping me from picking this.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.720
And then once I pick that,
I could pick this one.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.850
And then I'm down to, once
I've taken away these two,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.760
remember that now the maximum
degree in the entire graph

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.140
is two.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:06.650
Right?

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.950
Because each of these things
is losing the degree--

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.489
losing one from its
degree-- as I go along.

00:22:14.489 --> 00:22:17.030
So then I could pick this one,
this one, this one, et cetera.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.760
And so I could end up with 11.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760
OK?

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.470
So if you go do the
math really quickly--

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.300
and this is where
I'll correct what

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:35.380
I said before-- the algo could
pick all the bottom vertices.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.730
And so the solution and the
top vertices are optimal.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.890
Top optimal.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.620
So that's k factorial, right?

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.120
According to my
parameterized graph.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.410
That's k factorial in terms
of the optimal solution

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.740
for this graph.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.510
But if I pick the ones
that are the bottom,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:04.410
then it's k factorial
divided by k, plus 1 over k

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.390
minus 1, plus da
da da da, plus 1.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.590
Which is our harmonic number.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:15.710
And that's approximately
k factorial log k, OK?

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.450
And this is where I misspoke.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.510
I kept saying log n, log n.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.620
But that's not
completely correct.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.750
Because if I think of n as
being the size of the input,

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.520
k factorial is n, right?

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.300
And so if you see that
I have log k here,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:40.120
then remember that this is log
k where k factorial equals n.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.960
So this is another log
factor, roughly speaking.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:43.460
Right?

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:48.810
So think of it approximately
as log log n approximation, OK?

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:49.820
Which is pretty good.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.110
But it does grow with n, right?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.260
The point is this
does grow with n.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.410
So it's not the best
approximation scheme

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.710
that you can think of.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.170
Because the approximation
factor grows

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.200
with the size of your problem.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.960
So it'd be great if you could
come up with a constant factor

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.210
approximation scheme that
would beat this one, certainly

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.110
from a theoretical
standpoint, right?

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:16.090
But this one, maximum
degree, chances

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.700
are, if you're a practitioner,
this is what you'd code.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.340
Not the one I'm
going to describe.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:20.910
OK?

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.170
But we're going to analyze
the one I've described.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:28.190
I've just shown you that
there is an example where

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.380
you have this log k factor.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.260
We haven't done a
proof of the fact

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.060
that there's no worse
example than this one.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.560
OK?

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.920
So I'm just claiming,
at this point,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:45.280
that this is at best, a log
k approximation algorithm.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.040
We haven't actually shown
that it is, in fact, a log k

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040
approximation algorithm.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.630
At best, it's that.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:51.417
OK?

00:24:51.417 --> 00:24:52.000
Any questions?

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.190
All right.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.230
So what's another heuristic?

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:04.170
What's another heuristic
for doing vertex cover?

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.440
We did this picking
the maximum degree.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.090
Nice and simple.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.460
But it didn't quite
work out for us.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.680
Any other ideas?

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.540
So, I picked vertices.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.660
What else could I pick?

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.270
I could pick edges, right?

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:33.700
So, I could pick random edges.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.000
It turns out that
actually works better

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.670
from a theoretical standpoint.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.700
So, what we're going
to do here is simply

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.430
set the cover to be null.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.850
Go ahead and set all of
the edges to be E prime.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.865
And then we're going to
iterate over these edges.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.800
I'm not even
specifying the way I'm

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.040
going to select these edges.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.460
And I still will be able to
do a proof of 2 approximation.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.960
OK?

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:31.550
Oh!

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.860
I forgot the best part.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.600
This is on your quiz.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.910
That was the tangible benefit
of attending the lecture.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.890
So copy that down.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.550
So this is very simple.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:01.850
It's not a complicated problem.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.510
This is not simple
heuristics that

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.630
are going to be
particularly complicated.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.870
You just do some
selections, and then you

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.050
iterate over the graph.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.160
And you take away
stuff from the graph.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.930
Typically, you take away
vertices as well as edges.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.560
And you keep going until
you got nothing left, right?

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.570
And then you look at
your cover, and you say,

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.865
what is the size of my cover?

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:38.650
And here we return C, all right?

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.330
So I won't spend
any time on that.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:42.250
You can read it.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:47.130
It's simple iterative
algorithm that fixed edges

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.790
randomly and keeps going.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.350
So, now comes the
fun part, which

00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:02.000
is we need to show that that
little algorithm is always

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.990
going to be within a
factor of 2 of optimal, OK?

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.495
And you can play around
with this example.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.340
In fact, in this case,
you have 6 and 11.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.550
So that's a factor
of 2, of course.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.210
So even this algorithm is
better than a factor of 2.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.180
But it won't be if I expanded
the graph and increased k.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.540
But that algorithm that I
have up there is always going

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.010
to be within a factor of 2.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.800
And we want to prove
that, all right?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.730
So how do we go
about proving that?

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:47.760
We want to prove, in particular,
that a prox vertex cover is a 2

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:53.750
approximation algorithm.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.687
So, any ideas?

00:29:02.687 --> 00:29:04.270
How would I prove
something like this?

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.457
Where do you think this
factor of 2 comes from?

00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:11.790
Someone who hasn't answered yet.

00:29:14.869 --> 00:29:17.160
You answered a lot of questions
in the past, all right?

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.540
No?

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.000
Someone?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.931
All right.

00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:26.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:26.935 --> 00:29:27.810
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.040
PROFESSOR: That's an
excellent observation.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.510
The observation is
that the edges we pick

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.160
do not intersect each other.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.740
So, I gave you a Frisbee
for the wrong answer.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.130
So for this correct one,
I won't give you one?

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.400
That's fair, right?

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.790
No.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.860
That's unfair.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.649
Right?

00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:51.190
There you go.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.690
Sorry.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.700
So, the key observation
was in this algorithm,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.640
I'm going to be picking edges.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.470
And the edges will not
share vertices, right?

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.151
Because I delete the vertices
once I've picked an edge,

00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:10.650
correct?

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.340
So there's no way that the
edges will share vertices.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.660
So what does that mean?

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.350
Well, that means
that, I'm getting--

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.320
let's say, I get A edges.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:30.550
So let A denote the
edges that are picked.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.470
So I'm going to get edges
that look like that.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.450
OK?

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.400
And I got continuality
of A edges.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.220
I know that in my vertex
cover, that, obviously, I

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.800
have to pick vertices
that cover all the edges.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.570
Now I'm picking edges,
and what's happening,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.420
of course, is that I'm
picking 2 A vertices.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.720
So my C-- and remember,
my cost was C.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.200
And I had Copt, that
corresponds to the optimum cost.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.360
And so the cost that
this algorithm produces

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.770
is 2 times A, right?

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:18.340
Make sense?

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.950
Because I'm picking vertices,
we are picking edges.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.470
There's no overlap.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.740
And therefore, the cost
is 2 times A, right?

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.500
So as long as I can now say
that Copt, which is the optimum,

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.250
is less than or
equal to A, right?

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.490
I have my factor of 2
approximation algorithm.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.590
So that's it.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.330
It's a simple
argument that says now

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:59.270
show that Copt is at least
A. Copt, I'm minimizing.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.527
Copt should be at
least A. Right?

00:32:02.527 --> 00:32:03.860
I hope I said that right before.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.290
But I wrote that
down here correctly.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.190
So if I say that
Copt is at least A,

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.770
then I got my proof
here of 2 approximation.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.690
Because I'm getting
2 A back, right?

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:18.100
So if you go look at C divided
by-- so this means, of course,

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:29.750
that C is less than or equal
to 2 Copt, if I can show--

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.140
make that statement.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:35.100
And it turns out that's
a fairly easy statement

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:42.070
to argue simply because of the
definition of vertex cover.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:49.510
Remember that I'm going to have
to cover every edge, correct?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:59.170
So I'm going to cover--
need to cover every edge,

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:09.070
including all edges in A.
A is a subset of edges.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.669
I have to cover all the edges.

00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:12.460
Clearly, I have to
cover the A edges, which

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.010
are a subset of all
of the edges, right?

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.670
How am I going to cover
all of the A edges that

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.320
happened to all be disjoint
in terms of their vertices?

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.420
I'm going to have to pick one
vertex for each of these edges,

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.100
right?

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.850
I mean, I could pick
this one or that one.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.190
But I have to pick one of them.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.790
I could pick this
one or that one.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.900
And so on and so forth, right?

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.830
So it is clear that, given
this disjoint collection

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.740
of edges corresponding
to A, that Copt is

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.440
greater than or equal to A, OK?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.980
And that's it.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.650
So I had to cover all.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:34:02.100
This requires, since no two
edges share an endpoint,

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:13.610
this means that I need to pick a
different vertex from each edge

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:26.150
in A. And that implies that Copt
is greater than or equal to A.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.350
All right?

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.630
Any questions about that?

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.510
We all good here?

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.400
Yup?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.550
Understood the proof?

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.590
So that's our first
approximation algorithm

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.760
where we actually had a proof.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.510
And so, this is kind of cool.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.770
It obviously a pretty
simple algorithm.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.389
You're guaranteed to be
within a factor of 2.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.889
It doesn't mean
that that's the best

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.679
heuristic you can come up with.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:55.739
It doesn't mean that
this is what you'd code.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.800
But this is the best
approximation algorithm

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.050
that you're going to cover
for vertex cover, OK?

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:10.370
So, what about other problems?

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:14.340
What's the state of the world
with respect to approximation?

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.550
There's lots of NP complete
and NP hard problems

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.030
for which we know
approximation schemes.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.910
And we like to move towards
approximation schemes slowly.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.960
But I'd like to look at
a problem that perhaps

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.020
is a little more compelling
than vertex cover

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.282
before we get to
approximation schemes.

00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:35.740
And that's what's
called set cover.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:52.810
So set cover tries to
cover a set with subsets.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:58.050
And it's very useful
in optimization

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:03.710
where you have overlapping
sets, maybe it's schedules,

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:08.630
it's tasks, it's people getting
invited to dinner, et cetera,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.400
and you want to make sure
everybody gets invited.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.550
You want to invite
families, and there's

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.840
overlapping families, because
people have relationships.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.680
And you want to
eventually minimize

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.010
the number of dinners you
actually have to have.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:28.330
And that's, I don't know,
hopefully a motivating example.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.410
If it wasn't, too bad.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.220
So you do have a family of
possibly overlapping subsets.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:46.460
S1, S2, Sm, subset
of equal to x.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.570
So that's that big
set that we have.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.740
Such that I want to cover
all of the elements.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:56.680
So that's what this little
equation corresponds to.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.580
The union of all the
selected SI's should equal x.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.720
I need to cover it all.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.115
And I do want to minimize.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:17.042
It's called a C. Find
C subset 1, 2, m.

00:37:17.042 --> 00:37:18.750
So I'm selecting a
bunch of these things.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:26.530
So C is simply-- capital C here
is some subset of the indices.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:31.300
And the only reason I do
that is to say that I want

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.430
to do this while minimizing.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:45.790
I wanted to I equals 1
through m while minimizing C.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:46.290
OK?

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.550
Let me get this right.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.550
So this is what I have.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:59.002
Find C, subset of these,
such that-- I'm sorry.

00:37:59.002 --> 00:37:59.710
There's one more.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:10.190
Union of I belonging
to C, SI equals x.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.690
OK?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.340
Sorry for the mess here.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.370
But this last line
there-- so this

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.390
is simply a specification
of the problem.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.290
I'm going to be given
x, and I'm going

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.160
to be given a large
collection of subsets, such

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:33.100
that the union of all of those
subsets are going to cover x.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.050
And now I'm saying,
I want to look inside

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:39.810
and I want to
select all of them.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.190
I want to select a
bunch of these things.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.100
You know, C, which is some
subset of these indices,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.090
so 1 may not be in it.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.240
2 may be in it.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.120
4 may be in it, et cetera.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:55.600
And such that those subsets
that are in this capital C

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.802
set add up to x.

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:59.270
OK?

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:07.740
So pictorially, may
make things clearer.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:16.410
You have, let's say, a grid
here corresponding to x.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.490
So each of these dots
that I'm drawing here

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.260
are elements that
need to be covered.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.930
So that's my x.

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:36.390
And I might have S1
corresponding to that.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:42.380
This is S3, right?

00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.940
And S2 is this
thing in the middle.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:52.600
That's S2.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:40:00.270
S5 is this one here.

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.990
And I got a little S4 over here.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:16.623
And finally, I got--
let's see-- S6, yup.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:25.170
Which is kind of this funky
thing that goes like that.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:32.680
So this thing here is S6.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.600
All right?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.100
OK.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.340
What's the optimum?

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.170
You got 30 seconds.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.890
What's the optimum cover?

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.170
Yeah, go ahead.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.192
You had your hand up.

00:40:49.192 --> 00:40:50.067
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:53.626 --> 00:40:54.250
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.125
That's exactly right.

00:40:55.125 --> 00:41:00.960
So the optimum S3, S4, S5.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:01.460
All right.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:07.437 --> 00:41:08.020
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:08.660
S3.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.840
Yeah, S4 is this one here.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.270
S6, S5, OK good.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.400
S3.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.380
And then-- oh!

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.420
You know what?

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.860
You're right.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.780
Let's make you right.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.781
Don't erase that.

00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:28.280
Here you go.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:35.430
So that's 3, right?

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:43.600
So C would be-- cardinality
of C would be 3.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.620
So it's a nontrivial problem.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.910
It's not clear how
you're going to do this.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.800
I've got to use a heuristic.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.640
Hard in terms of optimization.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.280
Optimal requires exponential
time, as far as we know.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.140
And we're just going to go
off and say, hey let's design

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.250
an approximation
algorithm, right?

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.590
So let's think of a heuristic.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.820
What's a good heuristic?

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.280
What's a good heuristic
for this problem?

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.420
I hope I haven't scared you.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:19.150
What's a good heuristic
for this problem?

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.180
What's the obvious heuristic?

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:20.680
Yeah?

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.881
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:21.881 --> 00:42:23.130
PROFESSOR: The largest subset.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.610
And in this
particular case, it's

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:29.900
actually the best also
in terms of theory.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:44.376
So, approximate set
cover-- at least the best

00:42:44.376 --> 00:42:46.200
that we're concerned
about in this lecture.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.000
And what is
approximates set cover?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.130
It's pick largest SI.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:18.190
Remove all elements in
SI from x, and other Sj.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.260
So you're constantly shrinking.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.710
And then keep doing that.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.120
So you'll have a new problem.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.520
And you're going to specify that
new problem on every iteration,

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.670
just like we did
for vertex cover

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.490
and we've done many a time.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:40.840
If you do that over here,
notice that what you end up with

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:46.830
is picking S1, because
S1 is the big boy here,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.610
in the sense that it's
got six elements in it.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.110
Right?

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.670
Up on top.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:59.460
And so you'd pick
approx or heuristic algo

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:07.660
would pick S1, S4, S5,
and S3 in that order.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.450
I won't go over it.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.060
It's not that important.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.790
The point is it doesn't get you
the optimum for this problem.

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:19.300
And in general, you could
always concoct examples

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.810
where any heuristic
fails, of course, right?

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.870
Because this problem is hard.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.580
But it's four as
opposed to three.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:31.780
And the big question, again, as
always, is, what's the bound?

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.980
What's the bound if you
applied this heuristic?

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.690
And what can you
show with respect

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:39.650
to the approximation algorithm?

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.430
What is row n here?

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.400
So that's what we
have to do here,

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.360
in terms of what the bound is.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.710
And we're actually going
to do an analysis here

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.990
that is pretty straightforward.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:53.160
It's got a little
bit of algebra in it.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.480
But if you go look
at that this, it's

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.150
covered in CLRS, the textbook.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:00.520
But the analysis in there
uses harmonic numbers,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.190
and is substantially
more complicated

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:08.430
for, in my mind, no reason.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.870
And so we have a
simpler analysis here

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:14.630
that is simply going to
be a matter of counting.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:23.550
We are picking the maximum
number of elements every time.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:24.520
The best we can do.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.020
It's a greedy heuristic.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:34.000
We're trying to shrink our
problem as much as possible.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.830
Initially we have x.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.260
And then we're going
to get a new problem,

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.540
let's call it x0 first,
for the initial problem.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.480
You're going to get
a new problem, x1.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:48.640
And we're maximally
shrinking x1 in relation

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:52.320
to x0, in the sense that
we're going to remove

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.030
as many elements as we can.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.740
Because that is
precisely our heuristic.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.864
So the big question is, as we
go from the biggest problem

00:46:01.864 --> 00:46:03.280
that we have, the
original problem

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.020
to smaller and smaller problems,
when do we end up with nothing?

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.880
When we end up with
nothing, that's

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.570
when the number
of iterations that

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:15.030
corresponds to the number
of SI's that we picked

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.440
is going to be the collection
of SI's in our solution.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.210
And the cardinality of
that is our cost, right?

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:27.230
So that's all pretty
straightforward, hopefully.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.980
So what we need to do, of
course, is show a proof.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.030
And the way we're
going to do this

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.560
is by a fairly straightforward
counting argument.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:46.260
Assume there's a cover Copt,
since that Copt equals t.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.760
OK?

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.010
So the cardinality
of Copt equals t.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:54.730
So I'm just assuming that this
t subset's in my optimum cover,

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.570
OK?

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:59.190
t subset's in my optimum cover.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:10.540
Now let x of k be the set
of elements in iteration k.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.070
And let's assume
that x0 equals x.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.870
So initially, I'm at 0.

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:20.610
And I want to subscript
this because I

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:25.090
want to point to
each of the problems

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.670
that I'm going to
have as I shrink

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:33.730
this set down to nothing.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:39.970
Now I know that for all
k, including of course x0,

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:46.610
xk can be covered by t sets.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.360
OK?

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.480
I mean, that's kind
of a vacuous statement

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:54.350
because I assumed that x0
could be covered by t sets.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.920
And x0 is only shrinking
to x1, to x2, et cetera.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.950
And I'm just saying,
all of these things

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.390
could be covered-- each of those
intermediate problems as well,

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:04.540
can be covered-- by t.

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.100
In fact, in the
solution that we have,

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:11.670
the optimal solution,
if these x0's are

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.210
coming from my heuristic.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.620
But if they were coming
from an optimum solution,

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.936
then x0 would be covered by t.

00:48:18.936 --> 00:48:21.840
x1 would be covered
by t minus 1.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.990
And t minus 2, and
so on and so forth.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:27.180
But I don't have an
optimum algorithm here.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.992
I just have my
heuristic algorithm.

00:48:28.992 --> 00:48:30.950
And I'm just making a
fairly vacuous statement,

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.290
as I said, based
on my definition,

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.420
that the original problem
can be covered using t.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.110
And therefore, a
smaller problem,

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.460
when I remove elements from it,
could also be covered using t.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.520
OK?

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.640
So far, so good?

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:57.680
So now, one of them covers what?

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.720
What can I say
about one of them?

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.580
What principle can I
use to make a claim

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.190
about the number of
elements that are

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:10.170
covered by one of these t sets?

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:18.010
Remember a principle
from way back?

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.700
6042?

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.150
My favorite principle?

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.650
Flapping.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:23.920
Think flapping.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.160
Pigeon hole.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.440
Pigeon hole principle, right?

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.600
See, you have to remember
all of the material

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.420
that you learned at MIT
for the rest of your life.

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:34.270
OK?

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.160
You never know when
it's going to be useful.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.090
OK, so here you go, pigeon hole.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.160
My favorite principle.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.110
It's such a trivial principle.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:53.369
So one of them covers at
least xk divided by t.

00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:54.910
I mean, why is this
even a principle?

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.790
Right?

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.290
Elements.

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:02.810
OK, so that's it, right?

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.730
That's the observation.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:12.100
And, now that implies that
an algorithm-- because it's

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.480
going to pick the
maximum of these, right?

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.020
The algorithm is going to
pick the maximum of these.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:28.320
So, it's going to pick
a set of current size

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.347
greater than or equal
to xk divided by t.

00:50:32.347 --> 00:50:34.180
Otherwise, the algorithm
would be incorrect.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.490
It's not doing what
you told it to do.

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:37.490
Right?

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.300
It's got to pick the maximum.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.650
So keep chugging here.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:49.255
And one real observation, and
then the rest of it is algebra.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:51:00.745
So, what I can say
is that for all k,

00:51:00.745 --> 00:51:04.610
xk plus 1, which is
shrinking, is less than

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:10.600
or equal to 1
minus 1 over t, xk.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.190
OK?

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.221
That's the way I'm shrinking.

00:51:13.221 --> 00:51:13.720
Right?

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.290
This is again, a fairly
conservative statement.

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.680
Because the fact
of the matter is

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.650
that I'm putting t in as
a constant here, right?

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:26.800
But t is actually, in effect,
changing, obviously, halfway

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.020
through the algorithm.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:33.790
I don't need t sets to cover the
x-- whatever it is-- xk over 2

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.162
or whatever it is that I have.

00:51:35.162 --> 00:51:37.090
I need the t for x0.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.380
Maybe I did a bad selection
with my heuristic,

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:45.306
and I still would need t, which
is optimum, remember, for x1.

00:51:45.306 --> 00:51:46.680
But halfway through
the algorithm

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.090
after I picked a bunch of sets,
I'm still saying I need t, OK?

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:53.137
Because I just need
that for my proof.

00:51:53.137 --> 00:51:54.470
That's all I need for the proof.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:57.430
In CLRS, this
actually varies and it

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.380
turns into a harmonic series.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.640
We won't go there.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.230
OK?

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:06.690
You can do the natural
logarithm of n plus 1, a proof,

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.070
just doing the simpler analysis.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:10.220
OK?

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.110
So you see what's
happening here.

00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.280
That's my shrinkage.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.610
That's the recurrence,
if you will,

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.970
that tells me how my
problem size is shrinking.

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.160
And when do I end?

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.260
What is my stopping point?

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.109
What's my stopping point?

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.734
Mathematically?

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.720
When do we end this lecture?

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.440
When you give me the answer.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.850
No, not quite.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:42.860
So I end when?

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.540
I got nothing to cover, right?

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:56.990
So when one of these things
gets down to xk equals 0, right?

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:59.020
When xk equals 0, I'm done.

00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.140
I'm constantly
taking stuff away.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.670
When xk equals 0,
I'm going to be done.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:08.490
OK?

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:11.650
And I'm going to
move a little bit

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.670
between discrete
and continuous here.

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:15.370
It's all going to be fine.

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:21.090
But what I have is, if I just
take that, I can turn this.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.470
This is a recurrence.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.470
I want to turn
that into a series.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:30.490
So I can say something like 1
minus 1 over t, raised to k,

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:32.060
times n.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.150
And this is the
cardinality of x,

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.930
which is the cardinality of x0.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.360
So that's what I have up there.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.860
And that's essentially
what happens.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.790
I constantly shrink
as I go along.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.330
And I have a constant
rate of shrinkage here.

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.910
Which is the
conservative part of it.

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:46.790
So keep that in mind.

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.920
But it doesn't matter from
an analysis standpoint.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.570
OK?

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:53.000
So if you look at that, and
you say, what happens here?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.583
Well, I can just say
that this is less

00:53:54.583 --> 00:53:56.640
than or equal to e
raised to minus--

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.140
you knew you were
going to get an e,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.370
because you saw a natural
algorithm here, right?

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.700
And so, that's what we got.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:10.090
And basically, that's it.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.150
You can do a little
bit of algebra.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.930
I'll just write
this out for you.

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:16.740
But I won't really explain it.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.460
You're going to
have Xk equals 0.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.530
You're done.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.570
The cost, of course, is k.

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:23.070
Right?

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:27.410
The cost is k, because
you've selected k subsets.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:29.470
All right, so that's
your cost, all right?

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:31.360
So, when you get to
the point, you're done.

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.760
And the cost is k.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.850
So what you need
is, you need to say

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.450
that e raised to
minus kt divided by n

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.930
is strictly less than 1.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:45.690
Because that is
effectively when you have

00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:47.150
strictly less than 1 element.

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.800
It's discrete.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.030
So that means you have zero
elements left to cover.

00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:51.980
That means you're done OK?

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:55.840
So that's your
condition for stopping.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.580
So this done means that e
raised to minus kt times n

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.750
is strictly less than 1.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.050
And if you go do
that, you'll get k

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:13.460
over t, just about greater
than natural logarithm of m(n).

00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:19.210
The algorithm terminates if we
just do a little manipulation.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:23.520
And that implies that
k over t less than

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:30.240
or equal to natural logarithm
of n plus 1 is valid.

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:30.740
Right?

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.910
k over t is going
to be less than

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:34.990
or equal to natural
logarithm of n plus 1.

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:37.530
Because the instant
it becomes greater,

00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.120
the algorithm terminates.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:39.620
Right?

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.770
And that's how you got
your proof over here.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.790
Because this is
exactly what we want.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:48.170
k is our C from way back where
it's the cost of our heuristic

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:50.250
or the cost of
our approximation.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.550
t is the optimum cost.

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:54.040
That's what I defined it as.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.250
And this is a bound on k over t.

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:58.730
All right?

00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:59.790
Cool.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:00.730
Any questions on this?

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:07.000
OK.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.740
So this approximation ratio
gets worse for larger problems,

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.410
just like this other
approximation's algorithm

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:17.360
that we didn't actually prove
from the very first problem.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.580
That also got worse.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.520
We had a log k factor for that.

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.670
And as your problem
size increased,

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.970
obviously the approximation
factor increased.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:30.430
This is a little
clearer as to what

00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.550
the increase looks
like in relation

00:56:32.550 --> 00:56:35.650
to the original size of n.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.610
So it's just natural
logarithm of n plus 1.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.280
So, so far, we've done
approximation algorithms,

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.650
a couple of different varieties.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.660
We had a constant
factor one, and then we

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:50.450
had a row of n that actually
had a dependence on n.

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:54.700
Now let's move, and we'll do
one last example on partition,

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:59.560
which it turns out has a trivial
constant factor approximation

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.120
scheme.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.870
And this obvious
thing, and we'll

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:04.650
get to that in just a second.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.250
But what is nice about
partition is you can actually

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.280
get a PTAS, right?

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.740
Polynomial time approximation
scheme, and FPTAS,

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.640
fully polynomial time
approximation scheme,

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:22.420
that essentially give you with
higher and higher run times.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.310
They're going to
give you solutions

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.460
that are closer and
closer to optimal, right?

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:30.780
If you want to do the
FPTAS, we'll do the PTAS.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.860
So partition is a trivial
little problem to define.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:36.500
It's just you have
a set, and you

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:41.220
want to partition it into two
sets such that they're not

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.140
unbalanced.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:47.900
So your cost is the imbalance
between the two sets.

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.570
And you want to
minimize that cost.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:53.500
You'd love to have two sets that
are exactly the same weight.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:58.610
But if one of them is extremely
unbalanced with respect

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.190
to the other, then it's bad.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:02.376
Either way.

00:58:02.376 --> 00:58:03.625
So, here we go with partition.

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:26.700
Set S of n items with
weights S1 through Sn,

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:35.804
assume S1 greater than S2, Sn,
without loss of generality.

00:58:35.804 --> 00:58:37.220
So this is just
an ordering thing.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:38.803
I mean, obviously,
there's some order.

00:58:38.803 --> 00:58:40.960
I'm not even claiming
uniqueness here.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.430
I'm just saying just assume
that this is the order.

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:46.910
The analysis is much
better if you do this--

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.230
if you make this assumption.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:57.950
And I want to
partition into A and B

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:10.840
to minimize max of
sigma I belongs to A. Si

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:15.650
sigma I belongs to B Si.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:25.140
And this is the weight of A.
And this is the weight of B.

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:29.800
And so there's only
so much you can do.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:38.430
If you have 2L equals sigma
I equals 1 through n Si--

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:42.210
so I'm just calling that 2L--
the sum of all the weights.

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:47.070
Then my optimum
solution is what?

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:50.900
What is the lower bound
on the optimum solution?

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.140
If it's 2L?

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.870
What's the trivial lower bound?

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:57.190
Just L, right?

00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:59.480
So I could have L
here and L there.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:06.459
And if I had 2L here
and 0 here, then oh!

01:00:06.459 --> 01:00:07.000
That's right.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.791
I want to minimize.

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.285
Remember, don't-- maybe
that's what threw you off.

01:00:10.285 --> 01:00:11.650
It threw me off right here.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.940
I see a max here, and
I got a little worried.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.450
But I want to minimize
the maximum of these two

01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:18.340
quantities, OK?

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:22.380
And so the best I could
do is to keep them equal.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.470
And if I get L for
both of them, that

01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:27.170
would minimize the maximum
of those two quantities.

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.160
If I had 2L and 0, then the
maximum of those two quantities

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.320
is 2L, and obviously I
haven't done any minimization.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:42.710
So now you see why there's
a trivial optimum solution

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.270
is greater than or
equal to L. Right?

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.070
And now you see why there's
a trivial two approximation

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.440
algorithm.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.680
Because the worst I
could do is 2L, right?

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.610
I could dump all of them
on one side, constant time,

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.380
and the other one is 0.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.440
And my cost is 2L.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.820
So I'm within a factor of 2
in this problem trivially.

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:10.000
So, unfortunately that's not
the end of the lecture, OK?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.100
So, we've got to do better.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.680
I mean, clearly,
there's more here.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.590
You'd like to get much closer.

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.180
This is a different
kind of problem.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:19.820
And it would be wonderful if
we could get within epsilon.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.320
Right?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.040
I'm within 1%.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.400
How long does it take me?

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.420
I'm within 0.01%, guaranteed.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.490
How long does it take me?

01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.990
Right?

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:28.470
That's what an approximation
scheme is, as opposed

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.000
to just a plain algorithm.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.070
So if you're actually going
to talk about epsilon here,

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.380
and we're just doing a PTAS.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:42.820
So we're going to see something
that is not polynomial in 1

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.890
over epsilon.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.680
It's polynomial in n.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.480
But not polynomial
in 1 over epsilon.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.970
But there's an FPTAS
with this problem

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:53.740
that you're not responsible for.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.130
So this is going to be an
interesting algorithm simply

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:06.390
because we now have to do
something with epsilon.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.920
It's going to have
an extra input.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.740
It's not going to be the
simple heuristic, where

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.239
I'm going to do maximum degree
or maximum number of elements

01:02:12.239 --> 01:02:14.020
or anything like that.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.671
I want to take this epsilon and
actually do something with it.

01:02:16.671 --> 01:02:17.170
All right?

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:19.100
So how does this work?

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:25.430
Well, basically what happens in
PTAS's, or in a bunch of them,

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:30.390
is that you essentially do
an exponential amount of work

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:36.100
given a particular epsilon to
get a partial optimum solution.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:43.610
So you can think of epsilon
as essentially being 1 divided

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:47.200
by m plus 1, where
m is some quantity.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.540
And as m grows, the
complexity of your algorithm

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.840
is going to grow.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.980
But obviously, as
m grows, you're

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:57.650
getting a tighter
and tighter epsilon.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:01.840
You're getting guaranteed closer
and closer to your optimum.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.470
And so we're going
to have two phases

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:08.230
here in this particular
approximation scheme.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:19.730
The first phase is find an
optimal partition, A prime, B

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:26.030
prime, of S1 through Sm.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:30.640
And we're just going to assume
that this exhaustive search,

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.930
which looks at all possible
subsets, and picks the best

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:34.890
one.

01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.640
OK?

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:40.690
And how many subsets are
there for a set of size m?

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.310
It's 2 raised to m.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.690
So this is going to be
an exponential order, 2

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.950
raised to m algorithm.

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:47.500
OK?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.060
I'm just going to find
the optimum partition

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:52.780
through exhaustive search for m.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:54.930
Right? m is less than n.

01:03:59.577 --> 01:04:01.660
So I'm picking something
that's a smaller problem.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.785
I'm going to seed this.

01:04:02.785 --> 01:04:04.160
So, the way this
scheme works is,

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.760
I'm seeding my
actual algorithm--

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.390
my actual heuristic-- with
an initial partial solution.

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:19.615
And depending on how much
work I do to create the seed,

01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:22.280
I'm going to end up
having higher complexity.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:27.990
And obviously that's a function
of small m, or 1 over epsilon.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:35.460
And so this takes-- this optimal
takes order to raise to m time.

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.940
And you can think
of that as order

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:42.420
2 raised to 1 over epsilon.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.710
And so that's why it's a
PTAS, and not an FPTAS.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:48.450
OK?

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:49.510
So this is PTAS.

01:04:56.756 --> 01:04:57.880
What else do we need to do?

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.080
Well, I don't actually
have a solution yet.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.520
Because if m is really
small-- and by the way,

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.690
m can be 0 as well.

01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:06.680
Right?

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.460
Epsilon would then be
at 2 approximation,

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.970
1 divided by-- this
would be one half.

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.710
And so 1 over epsilon is 2.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:17.120
So then you've got
your trivial algorithm

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.270
that we had, the 2
approximation scheme.

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.890
So that makes sense?

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:24.910
So the second phase
is you're going

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:31.460
to start with your seed
corresponding to A and B.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:34.190
You're going to set them
to A prime and B prime.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:42.310
And what I'm going to do is,
for I equals m plus 1 to n,

01:05:42.310 --> 01:05:52.670
if w(a) less than
or equal to w(b),

01:05:52.670 --> 01:06:02.540
A equals A union I--
running out of room-- else

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:10.750
B equals B union I. OK?

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.350
So it's not that hard
to see, hopefully.

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:18.130
All I'm doing here is, I'm just
going in a very greedy way.

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:21.370
I got my initial A
prime and B prime.

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:23.420
I set them to A and
B. And I say, oh, I

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:24.710
got this element here.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:25.829
Which one is bigger?

01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:26.620
This one is bigger?

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.334
I'm going to put the
element over here.

01:06:28.334 --> 01:06:29.500
And then I look at it again.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.550
I got another element.

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:31.530
Which one is bigger?

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.060
And I go this way, that way.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.760
That's pretty much it.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.200
So, again, all of
these algorithms

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.740
are really straightforward.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:42.660
The interesting part's--
the fun part's-- in showing

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.530
the approximation guarantee.

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.610
So we're good here?

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.550
Yup?

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:51.120
All right.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.090
So back to analysis.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:54.790
One last time.

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:01.450
So, let's see.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:13.030
We want to show that
a prox partition-- ah,

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.670
you know how to spell
partition-- is PTAS.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.950
I guess I don't, but you do.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:27.930
Let's assume that w(a)
is greater than or equal

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.790
to w(b) to end with.

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:32.290
Right?

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.030
So I'm just saying,
at the end here,

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.540
I'm just marking the one
that was larger that came out

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.610
of the max as A. Right?

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.054
Without loss of generality.

01:07:40.054 --> 01:07:41.720
Just to make things
easier, I don't want

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.740
to keep interchanging things.

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:53.180
So our approximation ratio
is w(a) divided by L, right?

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:58.220
w(a) could at best be L if I got
a perfect partition, perfectly

01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.220
balanced.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.690
But it could be a
little bit more.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:03.660
And that's my
approximation ratio, OK?

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:08.250
So I need to now figure
out how the approximation

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:13.960
ratio reflects on the run
time, and is related to m

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.010
and, therefore, epsilon.

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.710
All right?

01:08:17.710 --> 01:08:19.470
So what I'm going
to do here is, I'm

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:31.149
going to look at a point in
time where I have A and B--

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:34.149
and remember that
w(a) is defined

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:35.830
to be greater than w(b).

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.880
But here, I'm
looking at some point

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.140
in time, which is not
necessarily at the very end

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.859
here.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:47.569
It could be.

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:49.350
But you can think
of this as being,

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:55.000
I'm just going to say
B or intermediate B.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.310
And this won't matter too much.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:09:02.189
But I'm just being a little
bit of a stickler here.

01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:05.560
I'll explain why I said
that in just a minute.

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.260
But the point is, I
have a situation where

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.230
I know that w(a) is
greater than w(b)

01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:14.479
or greater than or equal to
w(b) because I assumed it.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:15.939
That's how I marked it.

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:32.450
And I'm going to look at k is
the last element added to A.

01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:34.439
It's been added.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:43.859
Now this could have been
added in the first phase

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.120
or the second phase.

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.560
It's quite possible
that for a given m,

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:57.080
that if it's large, for example,
that A prime that you end up

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.640
with is your A to
begin with here,

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.280
and that you never
execute this statement OK?

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.900
It's quite possible, right?

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:12.764
You got your initial seed
and never added to it.

01:10:12.764 --> 01:10:13.430
And that was it.

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:16.940
Because your m was large,
for example, right?

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.090
So what I'm saying here
is, k is the last element

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:22.854
added to A. OK?

01:10:22.854 --> 01:10:24.270
So there's clearly
a last element.

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.100
I'm just marking that.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:29.136
And we know that A is
greater than or equal to B.

01:10:29.136 --> 01:10:32.360
Now it may be true that if
I'm looking at the snapshot

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.590
when just after I add
the k-th element to A,

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:40.200
I may not be done yet, in terms
of I still have a few elements.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.910
And I may be adding
elements to B.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:45.550
But regardless,
given my definition,

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:49.200
I know that the rate of B
is less than the rate of A.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.870
Because even though the
last element overall

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:58.490
may be added to B,
w(b) is less than w(a),

01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:03.220
and I'm only looking at the
last element added to A here.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.570
OK?

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:10.090
So why all of this skulduggery?

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:16.300
Well, there's a method
here to the madness.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.590
We're going to analyze
what possibly happens

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.680
in the first phase
and the second phase,

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:28.768
and get our approximation ratio.

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:29.768
Shouldn't take too long.

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.150
So there's two cases here
that we need to analyze.

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:43.370
The first one is easy.

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:45.250
The second one is a
little more involved.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:50.240
I'm going to now assume
that k was the last element

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.620
and was added in
the first phase, OK?

01:11:53.620 --> 01:12:07.840
If k is added to
A, what can I say?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.426
If k was added in
the first phase to A,

01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:17.440
and that's the last element
added throughout the algorithm,

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.212
by the time you get a
partition, what can you say?

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.220
What can you say
about the solution?

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.960
What strong statement can
you make about the solution?

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.290
What's the only interesting
strong statement

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:35.770
that you can make
about a solution?

01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:39.540
So I got to A. Remember
what the first phase is.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.240
What's the first phase?

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.810
Well, it's optimal, right?

01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:49.120
So, after that,
what happened to A?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.830
Well it didn't change.

01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:51.630
Right?

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:54.237
So, what you got is optimum.

01:12:54.237 --> 01:12:54.737
Right?

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:57.950
Because w(a) was defined to be
greater than or equal to w(b).

01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:01.460
w(a) was optimum for the
smaller problem, whatever m was.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.475
You never added
anything else to it.

01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:04.100
So you're done.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:04.990
It's optimum.

01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:07.245
So in this case, your
approximation ratio

01:13:07.245 --> 01:13:11.140
is 1 because you got the
optimum solution, right?

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.310
So if k is added to
A in the first place,

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:19.560
this means A equals A prime.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:24.875
We have an optimal partition.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:43.650
Since we can't do
better than w(a) prime

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:51.590
when we have n
greater than m items.

01:13:51.590 --> 01:14:00.395
And we know w(a) prime is
optimal for the m items.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.540
OK?

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.000
So that's cool.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.700
That's good.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.640
So we got an approximation
ratio of 1 there.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.090
And remember that, this is not
taking overall exponential time

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:18.480
necessarily.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.080
It's just a case where I've
picked some arbitrary m,

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.140
and it happens to be the
case that A equals A prime

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.740
at the end of the algorithm.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:34.200
So I am taking exponential
time in m-- m as in Mary--

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:38.030
but I'm not taking
exponential time in n-- right?

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:41.290
n as in Nancy.

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:47.050
So the second part is where the
approximation ratio comes in.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:55.105
k is added to A in
the second phase.

01:15:01.092 --> 01:15:02.550
So here, what we're
going to do is,

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:09.390
we're going to say we know
w(a) minus Sk is less than

01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:12.060
or equal to w(b).

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.640
This is the second phase
we're talking about here.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.180
The only reason
Sk was added to A

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:24.060
was because you decided that A
was the side that was smaller,

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.590
right, or perhaps equal.

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.880
So that's the reason
you added into it.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.620
So you know that w(a) minus
Sk is less than or equal

01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:33.410
to w(b) at that time.

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:36.783
So think of A and B here
as being variables that

01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:40.200
are obviously changing, right?

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.350
But what I'm saying
here is, even

01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:46.920
if you look-- this is the
algorithm where A and B,

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.600
you constantly look at them
and decide which way to go.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.360
But if you look
at the last step,

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.830
then you look at
the final values.

01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:58.370
Then you could certainly
make the statement

01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:01.520
for those final values,
that the w(a), which

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.970
is the resultant value, minus
Sk, should have been less than

01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.500
or equal to w(b).

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.560
And you had a smaller
w(a) to begin with.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.300
And you added Sk to it.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.500
And that happened
in the second phase.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.540
OK?

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:18.710
So this is why k was added.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:27.750
This is why k was added to A.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.280
I want to be a
little careful here

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.420
given that we're overloading
A and B without trying

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.480
to point out what each of these
statements actually means.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:40.770
And ask questions
if you're confused.

01:16:40.770 --> 01:16:45.670
I know that w(a)
minus Sk is less than

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:48.956
or equal to 2L minus w(a).

01:16:48.956 --> 01:16:50.720
That's just a substitution.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.670
Because w(a) plus
w(b) equals 2L.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:05.290
And then, last little
trick, again it's algebra.

01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:07.280
Nothing profound here.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.330
We have our assumption that
we ordered these things.

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:14.390
So you had S1 through--
Sn, excuse me.

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.040
The whole thing was ordered.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:27.750
And so we can say that
S1, S2, all the way to Sm,

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:30.690
is greater than or equal to Sk.

01:17:30.690 --> 01:17:32.740
We are actually
doing this in order.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:34.440
We are taking the
bigger elements

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.150
and then deciding where they go.

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:38.460
So we sorted those
things initially.

01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.830
And so what we end up
with when we look at Sk,

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:45.250
we have taken care
of values prior to Sk

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.490
that are all greater
than or equal to Sk.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:47.990
Right?

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:52.080
That's, again, using
our initial assumption.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.340
So what that means
is 2L is greater

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:05.950
than or equal to m plus 1 Sk
since k is greater than m.

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:08.650
Again, this is not
particularly tight.

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.289
Because m could be really
pretty small in relation to n.

01:18:12.289 --> 01:18:14.080
But I do know that I
can make the statement

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.980
that since the values
are decreasing,

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:21.450
that 2L, which is the sum of
all of those, is greater than

01:18:21.450 --> 01:18:25.510
or equal to m plus 1 times
Sk, regardless of what m is.

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:26.580
Right?

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.250
And so, that's pretty much it.

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:34.640
Once you do that, you have
your approximation ratio.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.670
Let's leave that up there
because that's the algorithm.

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:42.664
Finish this off with
a little algebra.

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:59.440
So w(a) divided by L is less
than or equal to L plus Sk

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.990
divided by 2, divided by L.
I'm basically substituting.

01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:05.900
I have this and I have that.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.900
And I'm playing around with it.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:16.930
And I got 1 plus
Sk divided by-- 1

01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:23.890
plus Sk divided by 2L, which
is-- now this I could say

01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.720
is equal.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.270
That's simply equal.

01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:29.140
This, I have a less
than or equal to.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.430
And then I can go less
than or equal to 1

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:37.830
plus Sk divided by m plus 1 Sk.

01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:44.340
And then I got 1 plus
1 divided by m plus 1,

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:49.180
which is, of course,
1 plus epsilon.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:52.470
So all I did here
was use this fact

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:55.800
and essentially relate 2L to Sk.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.250
And once I could
relate 2L to Sk,

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:07.880
substituting for Sk in here, I
ended up with the approximation

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:12.490
ratio that I want, w(a) over
L, is L plus Sk divided by 2.

01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:15.190
That simply comes from here.

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:19.060
And plug that in,
divided by L. And then

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.370
I have Sk divided by 2L.

01:20:21.370 --> 01:20:23.850
And then this part
here, 2L is going

01:20:23.850 --> 01:20:29.580
to get substituted by
m plus 1 Sk and voila.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.780
I'm over here.

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.640
OK?

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:37.870
So the story behind
this particular problem

01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:39.840
was it was in the quiz.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.185
And Eric, I guess took the quiz.

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:44.010
Did you actually take the quiz?

01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:45.430
Or edit the quiz?

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:49.330
And he says, this
problem is impossible.

01:20:49.330 --> 01:20:50.400
It was a problem.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.100
He said, this problem
is impossible.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.090
I had to Google it to
find out the answer.

01:20:55.090 --> 01:20:56.250
Or something like that.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.100
And I said, well, I'm going
to give the answer in lecture,

01:20:59.100 --> 01:20:59.600
right?

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.840
So there you go.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:01.710
So remember this.

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:02.520
Write it down.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.690
Four points for coming
to lecture today.

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.790
See you guys next time.
