00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.800
PROFESSOR: All right. Good morning, everyone.
Let's get started. So we're going to start

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.000
6.046 in earnest today. We're going to start
with our first module on divide and conquer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.149
You've all seen divide and conquer algorithms
before. Merge sort is a classic divide and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.469
conquer algorithm. I'm going to spend just
a couple minutes talking about the paradigm,

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.680
give you a slightly more general setting than
merge sort. And then we'll get into two really

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:04.059
cool divide and conquer problems in the sense
that these are problems for which divide and

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.149
conquer works very well-- mainly, convex hall
and median finding.

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:16.340
So before I get started on the material, let
me remind you that you should be signing up

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.779
for a recitation section on Stellar. And please
do that even if you don't plan on attending

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:30.139
sections. Because we need that so we can assign
your problem sets to be graded, OK?

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:36.310
So that's our way of partitioning problem
sets as well. And then the other thing is

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.259
problem set one is going to go out today.
And that it's a one week problem set.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.479
All problem sets are going to be a week in
duration. Please read these problem sets the

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.158
day that they come out. Spend 5, 10 minutes
reading them.

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:59.700
Some things are going to look like they're
magic, that they're-- how could I possibly

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.959
prove this? If you think about it for a bit,
it'll become obvious. We promise you that.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.459
But get started early. Don't get started at
7:00 PM when we have 11:59 PM deadline on

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.110
Thursday, all right? That four hours or five
hours of time may not be enough to go from

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.150
magical to obvious, OK?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:31.930
So let's get started with the paradigm associated
with divide and conquer. It's just a beautiful

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.159
notion that you can break up the problem into
smaller parts and somehow compose the solutions

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:47.689
to the smaller parts. And of course, the details
are going to be what's important when we take

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.650
a particular problem instance.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.900
But let's say we're given a problem of size
n. We're going to divide it into a sub problems--

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:13.459
I'll put that in quotes so you know it's a
symbol-- a sub problems of size n over b.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.319
And here, a is an integer.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.609
And a is going to be greater than or equal
to 1. It could be two. It could be three.

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:23.569
It could be four.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:32.549
This is the generalization I alluded to. And
b does not have to be two or even an integer.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.400
But it has to be strictly greater than one.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.519
Otherwise, there's no notion of divide and
conquer. You're not breaking things up into

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.549
smaller problems. So b should be strictly
greater than one. So that's the general setting.

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:58.379
And then you'll solve each sub problem recursively.
And the idea here is that once the sub problems

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:06.249
become really small, they become constant
size, it's relatively easy to solve them.

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:08.829
You can just do exhaustive search.

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:16.738
If you have 10 elements and you're doing effectively
a cubic search, well, 10 cubed is 1,000. That's

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:22.449
a constant. You're in great shape as long
as the constants are small enough.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.849
And so you're going to recurse until these
problems get small. And then typically-- this

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:35.590
is not true for all divide and conquer approaches.
But for most of them, and certainly the ones

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.370
we're going to cover today, the smarts is
going to be in the combination step-- when

00:04:42.370 --> 00:05:01.960
you combine these problems, the solutions
of these sub problems, into the overall solution.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.310
And so that's the story.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:12.530
Typically, what happens in terms of efficiency
is that you can write a recurrence that's

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:22.849
associated with this divide and conquer algorithm.
And you say t of n, which is a running time,

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:32.879
for a problem of size n is going to be a times
tfn over b-- and this is a recurrence-- plus

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:41.729
the work that you need to do for the merge
operational or the combine. This is the same

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.639
as merge.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:53.129
And so you get a recurrence. And you're not
quite done yet in terms of the analysis. Because

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.159
once you have the recurrence, you do have
to solve the recurrence. And it's usually

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.430
not that hard and certainly it's not going
to be particularly difficult for the divide

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.360
and conquer examples that we're going to look,
at least today.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.270
But we also have this theorem that's called
the master theorem that is essentially something

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:21.659
where you can fairly mechanically plug in
the a's and the b's and whatever you have

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.199
there-- maybe it's theta n, maybe it's theta
n square-- and get the solution to the recurrence.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:34.419
I'm actually not going to do that today. But
you'll hear once again about the massive theorem

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:42.379
tomorrow in section. And it's a fairly straightforward
template that you can use for most of the

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:48.280
divide and conquer examples we're going to
look at in 046 with one exception that we'll

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.949
look at in median finding today that will
simply give you the solution to the recurrence,

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:53.919
OK?

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.520
So you've see most of these things before.
That's a little bit of setup. And so let's

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:11.080
dive right in into convex hull, which is my
favorite problem when it comes to using divide

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.620
and conquer.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:19.509
So convex hull, I got a little prop here which
will save me from writing on the board and

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:28.330
hopefully be more understandable. But the
idea here is that in this case, we have a

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:35.830
two dimensional problem with a bunch of points
in a two dimensional plane. You can certainly

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:43.460
do convex hull for three dimensions, many
dimensions. And convexity is something that

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.280
is a fundamental notion in optimization.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:52.400
And maybe we'll get to that in 6046 in advanced
topics, maybe not. But in the context of today's

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.729
lecture, what we're interested in doing is
essentially finding an envelope or a hull

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:05.490
associated with a collection of points on
a two dimensional plane. And this hull obviously

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:14.849
is going to be something, as you can guess,
that encloses all of these points, OK?

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:23.250
So what I have here, if I make this string
taut enough-- this is not working so well,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:35.159
but I think you get the picture. All right,
so that's not a convex hull. This is not a

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.419
convex hull for the reason that I have a bunch
of points outside of the hull.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:53.120
All right, so let me just-- that is a convex
hull. And now if I start stretching like that

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.940
or like this or like that, that's still a
convex hull, OK? So that's the game.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:08.400
We have to find an algorithm. And we look
at a couple of different ones that will find

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.390
all of these segments that are associated
with this convex hull, OK? So this is a segment

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:15.790
that's part of the convex hull.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:23.570
That's a segment that's part of the convex
hull. If, in fact, I had something like this--

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.710
and this was stretched out-- because I have
those two points outside the convex hull,

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:35.970
this may still be a segment that's part of
the electronics hall but this one is not,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:41.480
right? So that's-- the game here is to find
these segments. So if you're going to working

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:51.340
with segments or tangents-- they're going
to be used synonymously-- all of the tangents

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.080
or segments associated with the entirety of
the convex hull and we have to discover them.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.780
And only input that we have is the set of
pointx-- xiy coordinates.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:08.200
And there's just a variety of algorithms that
you can use to do this. The one that I wish

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.330
I had time to explain but I'll just mention
is what's called a gift wrapping algorithm.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:22.070
You might not have done this, but I guarantee
you I said you probably have taken a misshapen

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.200
gift, right, and tried to wrap it in gift
wrapping paper.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.250
And when you're doing that, you're essentially--
if you're doing it right you're essentially

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.090
trying to find the convex hull of this three
dimensional structure. You're trying to tighten

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.750
it up. You're trying to find the minimum amount
of gift wrapping paper.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.730
I'm not sure if you've ever thought about
minimizing gift wrapping paper, but you should

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:50.030
have. And that's the convex hull of this three
dimensional shape. But we'll stick to two

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:56.710
dimensions because we'll have to draw things
on the board. So let me just spec this out

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:57.990
a bit.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:12.910
I've been given endpoints in a plane. And
those set of points are s, xi, yi such that

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:21.200
i equals 1, 2 to n. And we're just going to
assume here, just to make things easy because

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.610
we don't want to have segments that are null
or segments that are a little bit different

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:37.270
because they're discontinuous. But we're going
to assume that no two have the same x-coordinate.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:56.020
This is just a matter of convenience. And
no two have the same y-coordinate.
And then finally, no three in a line.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.840
Because we want to be able to look at pairs
of points and find these segments. And it

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.070
just gets kind of inconvenient. You have to
do special cases if there of them are on a

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:29.700
line. And so the convex hull itself is the
smallest polygon containing all points in

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:36.810
s. And we're going to call that ch of s--
convex hull of s.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.440
STUDENT: Smallest convex polygon.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:55.520
PROFESSOR: The smallest convex polygon--
thank you. And so just as an example on the

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:02.660
board, when you have something like this,
you're going to have your convex hull being

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:07.690
that. This one is inside of it.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:13.490
These two points are inside of it. And all
the other ones form the hull. And so we might

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:25.750
have p, q, r, s, t, u. And v and x are inside
of the hull. They're not part of the specification

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.000
of ch of s, which I haven't quite told you
how we're going to specify that.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.290
But the way you're going to specify that is
simply by representing it as a sequence of

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:54.390
points that are on the boundary on the hull
in clockwise order. And you can think of this

00:13:54.390 --> 00:14:00.160
as being a doubly linked list in terms of
the data structure that you'd use if you coded

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:11.080
this up. So in this case, it would be p to
q to r to s.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:18.800
You're going to start with t in this case.
It's a doubly linked list. So you could conceivably

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:26.120
start with anything. But that's the representation
of the convex hull.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:33.890
And we're going to use clockwise just because
we want to be clear on as to what order we're

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.180
enumerating these points. It's going to become
important when we do the divide and conquer

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:46.170
algorithm. So let's say that we didn't care
about divide and conquer just for the heck

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:57.610
of it and I gave you a bunch of points over
here.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:07.510
Can you think of a simple-- forget efficiency
for just a couple of minutes. Can you think

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:18.720
of a simple algorithm that would generate
the segments of the convex hull? For example,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.940
I do not want to generate this segment vx.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:27.890
If I think of a segment as being something
that is defined by two points, then I don't

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.480
want to generate the segment vx because clearly
the segment is not part of the convex hull.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.820
But whereas the segment pq, qr, rs, et cetera,
they're all part of the convex hull, right?

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:46.360
So what is the obvious brute force algorithm,
forgetting efficiency, that given this set

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:53.670
of points will generate one by one the segments
of the convex hull?

00:15:53.670 --> 00:16:01.550
Anybody? Did you have your head up? No? Go
ahead. Yep.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:06.380
STUDENT: Draw the line and check how many other lines intersect with it.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.860
PROFESSOR: Draw the line and check how many
lines it intersects with.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.120
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.180
PROFESSOR: Is there-- I think you got-- you
draw the line. That's good, right?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.460
STUDENT: [LAUGHS]
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.670
PROFESSOR: Well-- but you want to do a little
more. Yeah, go ahead.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.110
STUDENT: For every pair of points you see, make a half-plane and see where they complete

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.260
all of their other points. [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.320
PROFESSOR: Ah, so that's good. That's good.
That's good.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:41.420
All right, so the first person who breaks
the ice here always gets a Frisbee. Sorry

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.180
man. At least I only hit the lecturer-- no
liability considerations here. OK, now I'm

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.240
getting scared.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:55.250
Right, so I think there's a certain amount
of when I throw this, am I going to choke

00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:01.450
or not, right? But it's going to get higher
when one of you guys in the back answers a

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.860
question. So you're exactly right.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:10.128
And you draw a line. And then you just look
at it. And you look at the half plane.

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:17.869
And if all the points are to one side, it
is a segment of the convex hull. If they're

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:23.029
not, it's not a segment-- beautiful. All right,
are we done? Can we go and enjoy the good

00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:24.159
weather outside?

00:17:24.159 --> 00:17:31.110
No, we've got ways to go here. So this is
not the segment whereas one-- let me draw

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.039
that. I should draw these in a dotted way.

00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:41.480
This is not a segment. This is not a segment.
This is a segment.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.850
And I violated my rule of these three not
being in a straight line. So I'll move this

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:51.640
over here. And then that's a segment and so
on and so forth, OK? Right?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.900
STUDENT: It's no longer a side with the ones below it.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.700
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.580
STUDENT: It would have to go directly to the bottom one from the left one.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.120
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right. That's a good
point. That's an excellent point.

00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:08.340
SO what happened here was when I moved that
out-- exactly right. Thank you. This is good.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:16.700
So when I moved this out here, what happened
was-- and I drew this-- well, this one here,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:23.230
my convex hull, changed. The problem specification
changed on me. It was my fault. But then what

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:28.080
would happen, of course, is as I move this,
that would become the segment that was part

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.389
of the convex hull, OK?

00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:36.240
So sorry to confuse people. But what we have
here in terms of an algorithm, if I leave

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:43.679
the points the same, works perfectly well.
So let me just leave the points the same and

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:48.029
just quickly recap, which is, I'm going to
take a pair of points.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:54.200
And I'm going to draw-- and let me just draw
this in a dotted fashion first. And I'm going

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.240
to say that's the segment. And I'm going to
take a look at that line and say this breaks

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:04.779
up the plane into two half planes. Are all
about points on one side?

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:09.799
And if the answer is yes, I'm going to go
ahead and, boom, say that is a segment of

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:16.110
my convex hull. If the answers is no, like
in this case, I'm going to drop that segment,

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.950
OK? So now let's talk about complexity.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:29.990
Let's say that there are n points here. And
how many segments do I have? I have O n square

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.860
theta n square segments.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.399
And what is the complexity of the test? What
is the complexity of the test that's associated

00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:43.149
with, once I've drawn the segments, deciding
whether the segment is going to be a tangent

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:45.490
which is part of the convex hull or not? What
is the complexity?

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:46.360
STUDENT: O n.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:59.680
PROFESSOR: O n-- exactly right. So on test
complexity-- and so we got over theta n cubed

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.059
complexity, OK? So it makes sense to do divide
and conquer if you can do better than this.

00:20:05.059 --> 00:20:10.230
Because this is a really simple algorithm.
The good news is we will be able to do better

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:18.990
than that. And now that we have a particular
algorithm-- I'm not quite ready to show you

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.700
that yet.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:26.590
Now that we have a particular algorithm, we
can think about how we can improve things.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:34.210
And of course we're going to use divide and
conquer. So let's go ahead and do that. And

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:40.909
so generally, the divide and conquer, as I
mentioned before, in most cases, the division

00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:44.240
is pretty straightforward.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.629
And that's the case here as well. All the
fun is going to be in the merge step. Right,

00:20:50.629 --> 00:20:54.460
so what we're going to do, as you can imagine,
is we're going to take these points.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.690
And we're going to break them up. And the
way we're going to break them up is by dividing

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.409
them into half lengths. We're going to just
draw a line.

00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:07.980
And we're going to say everything to the left
of the line is one sub problem, everything

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:14.440
to the right of the line is another sub problem,
go off and find the convex hull for each of

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.509
the sub problems. If you have two points,
you're done, obviously. It's trivial.

00:21:20.509 --> 00:21:24.899
And at some point, you can say I'm just going
to deal with brute force. If we can go down

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:30.789
to order n cubed, if n is small, I can just
apply that algorithm. So it doesn't even have

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:36.059
to be the base case of n equals 1 or n equals
2. That's a perfectly fine thing to do.

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:39.749
But you could certainly go with n equals 10,
as I mentioned before, and run this brute

00:21:39.749 --> 00:21:44.360
force algorithm. And so at that point, you
know that you can get down to small enough

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:50.779
size sub problems for which you can find the
convex hull efficiently. And then you've got

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:57.539
these two convex hulls which are clearly on
two different half planes because that's the

00:21:57.539 --> 00:21:59.019
way you defined them.

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:04.820
And now you've got to merge them. And that's
where all the fun is, OK? So let's just write

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.460
this out again.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:17.850
You're going to sort the points by x-coordinates.
And we're going to do this once and for all.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.299
We don't have to keep sorting here because
we're just going to be partitioning based

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:22.929
on x-coordinates.

00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:27.509
And we can keep splitting based on x-coordinates
because we want to generate these half-lengths,

00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:41.639
right? So if we can do those once and for
all-- and for the input set S, we're going

00:22:41.640 --> 00:23:00.200
to divide into the left half A and right half
B by the x-coordinates. And then we're going

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:08.700
to compute CH of A and CH of B recursively.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.399
And then we're going to combine. So the only
difference here from what we had before is

00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:18.909
the specification of the division. It looked
pretty generic.

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:23.769
It's similar to the paradigm that I wrote
before. But I've specified exactly how I'm

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:34.419
going to break this up. So let's start with
the merge operation. We're going to spend

00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:36.929
most of our time specing that.

00:23:36.929 --> 00:23:42.909
And again, there's many ways you could do
the merge. And we want the most efficient

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:56.139
way. That's obviously going to determine complexity.
So, big question-- how to merge.

00:23:56.139 --> 00:24:03.169
So what I have here, if I look at the merge
step, is I've created my two sub problems

00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:11.240
corresponding to these two half planes. And
what I have here is-- let's say I've generated,

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:18.820
at this point, a convex hull associated with
each of these sub problems. So what I have

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.129
here is a1, a2.

00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:30.249
I'm going to go clockwise to specify the convex
hull. And the other thing that I'm going to

00:24:30.249 --> 00:24:39.350
do is in the sub problem case, my starting
point is going to be for the left sub problem,

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:47.159
the coordinate that has the highest x value,
OK? So that's a1 in this case-- the highest

00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:50.470
x value going over. x is increasing to the
right.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:58.999
And for the right half of the problem, it's
going to be the coordinate that has the lowest

00:24:58.999 --> 00:25:07.009
x value. And I'm going to go clockwise in
both of these cases. So when you see an ordering

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:14.970
associated with the subscripts for these points,
start with a1 or b1 and then go clockwise.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:20.159
And that's how we number this-- so just notational,
nothing profound here.

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:26.519
So I got these two convex hulls-- these sub
hulls, if you will. And what I need to do

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:32.850
now is merge them together. And you can obviously
look at this and it's kind of obvious what

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.210
the overall convex hull is, right?

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:46.779
But the key thing is, I'm going to have to
look at each of the pairs of points that are

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:56.490
associated with this and that and try to generate
the tangents, the new tangents, that are not

00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:04.169
part of the sub hulls, but they're part of
the overall hull, right? So in this case,

00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:11.600
you can imagine an algorithm that is going
to kind of do what this brute force algorithm

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:20.879
does except that it's looking at a point from
here and a point from here.

00:26:20.879 --> 00:26:28.529
So you could imagine that I'm going to do
a pairwise generation of segments. And then

00:26:28.529 --> 00:26:32.240
I'm going to check to see whether these segments
are actually tangents that are part of the

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.240
overall convex hull or not. So what I would
do here is I'd look at this.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:45.820
And is that going to be part of the overall
hull? No, and precisely why not? Someone tell

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:53.620
me why this segment a1 b1 is not part of the
overall hull? Yeah, go ahead.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.940
STUDENT: If we were to draw a line through the whole thing there would be one on both sides.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:03.700
PROFESSOR: Exactly right-- that's exactly
right. So here you go. So that's not part

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:10.249
of it. Now, if I look at this-- well, same
reason that's not part of it.

00:27:10.249 --> 00:27:14.499
In this case-- and this is a fairly obvious
example. I'm going to do something that's

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:19.509
slightly less obvious in case you get your
hopes up that we have this trivial algorithm,

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:27.820
OK? This is looking good, right? That's supposed
to be a straight line, by the way.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:33.220
So a4 b2-- I mean, that's looking good, right?
Because all the points are on one side. So

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:41.669
a4 b2 is our upper tangent. Right, so our
upper tangent is something that we're going

00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:49.249
to define as-- if I look at each of these
things, I'm going to say they have a yij.

00:27:49.249 --> 00:27:59.669
OK, what is yij? yij is the y-coordinate.
of the segment that I'm looking at, the ij

00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:00.129
segment.

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:09.970
So this yij is for ai and bj. So what I have
here is y42 out here. And this is-- for the

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:16.399
upper tangent, yij is going to be maximum,
right? Because that's essentially something

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:20.850
which would ensure me that there are no points
higher than that, right?

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:26.759
So if I go up all the way and I find this
that has the maximum yij, that is going to

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:32.580
be my upper tangent. Because only for that
will I have no points ahead of that, OK? So

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.409
yij is upper tangent.

00:28:34.409 --> 00:28:41.799
This is going to be maximum. And I'm not going
to write this down, but it makes sense that

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:50.479
the lower tangent is going to have the lowest
yij. Are we all good here? Yeah, question.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.660
STUDENT: So I am just wondering, I couldn't hear
what she said why we moved out a1 b1.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:02.379
PROFESSOR: OK, so good. Let me-- that reason
we moved out a1 b1 is because if I just drew

00:29:02.379 --> 00:29:09.450
a1 b1 like this-- and I'm extrapolating this.
This is again supposed to be a straight line.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:14.039
Then you clearly see that there are points
on either side of the a1 b1 segment when you

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:20.860
look at the overall problem, correct? You
see that on a1 b1, b2 is on this side, b3

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:25.450
is on this side if I just extend this line
all the way to infinity in both directions.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:32.059
And that violates the requirement that the
segment be part of the overall hull, OK?

00:29:32.059 --> 00:29:36.639
That make sense? Good. So, everybody with
me?

00:29:36.639 --> 00:29:45.580
So clearly, there's a trivial merge algorithm
here. And the trivial merge algorithm is to

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:55.039
look at not every pair of points-- every ab
pair, right? Every aibj pair.

00:29:55.039 --> 00:30:04.259
And so what is the complexity of doing that?
If I have n total points, the complexity would

00:30:04.259 --> 00:30:10.769
be-- would be in square, right? Because maybe
I'd have half here and half here, ignore constants.

00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:16.110
And you could say, well, it's going to be
n squared divided by 4, but that's theta n

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:30.190
squared. So there's an obvious merge algorithm
that is theta n square looking at all pairs

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:38.759
of points. And when I mean all pairs of points,
I mean like an a and a b.

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:44.720
Because I want to pick a pair when I go left
of that dividing line and then right of the

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.259
dividing line. But either way, it's theta
n square, OK? So now you look at that and

00:30:49.259 --> 00:30:53.879
you go, huh. Can I do a better?

00:30:53.879 --> 00:31:02.179
What if I just went for the highest a point
and the highest b point and I just, no, that's

00:31:02.179 --> 00:31:08.600
it? I'm done-- constant time. Wouldn't that
be wonderful? Yeah, wonderful, but incorrect,

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.409
OK?

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:14.559
Right, so what is an example. And so
this is something that I spent a little bit

00:31:14.559 --> 00:31:21.659
of time last night concocting. So I'm like
you guys too. I do my problem set the night

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:22.950
before.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:35.539
Well, don't do as I do. Do as I say. But I've
done this before. So that's the difference.

00:31:35.539 --> 00:31:42.359
But this particular example is new. So what
I have here is I'm going to show you why there's

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:54.809
not a trivial algorithm, OK, that-- I got
to get these angles right-- that you can't

00:31:54.809 --> 00:32:00.759
just pick the highest points and keep going,
right?

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:06.470
And then that would be constant time. So that's
my a over here. And let's assume that I have

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.109
my dividing line like that. And then what
I'm going to do here-- and I hope I get this

00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:17.960
right-- is I'm going to have something like
this, like that.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:30.409
And then I'm going to have b1 here clockwise--
so b2, b3, and b4. So as you can see here,

00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:49.389
if I look at a4-- a little adjustment necessary.
OK, so if I look at that, a4 to b1 versus--

00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:50.710
I mean, just eyeball it.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:58.669
A3 to b1-- right, is a4 to b1 going to be
the upper tangent? No, right? So now a3 is

00:32:58.669 --> 00:33:01.859
lower than a4. You guys see that?

00:33:01.859 --> 00:33:08.320
And b1 is lower than b2, right? So it's clear
that if I just took a4 to b2 that it will

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.489
not be an upper tangent. Everybody see that?

00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:19.590
Yep, all right, good. So we can't have a constant
time algorithm. We have theta and square in

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:24.289
the back. So it is there something-- maybe
theta n?

00:33:24.289 --> 00:33:34.429
How would we do this merge and find the upper
tangent by being a little smarter about searching

00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:43.570
for pairs of points that give us this maximum
yij? I mean, the goal here is simple. At some

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.220
level, if you looked at the brute force, I
would generate each of these things.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:53.340
I would find the yj intercepts associated
with this line. And I just pick the maximum.

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.070
And the constant time algorithm doesn't work.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:01.730
The theta n squared algorithm definitely works.
But we don't like it. So there has to be something

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:05.990
in between. So, any ideas? Yeah, back there.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:14.000
STUDENT: So... I had a question. [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.139
PROFESSOR: No, you're just finding-- no, you're
maximizing the yij. So for once you have this

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:25.929
segment-- so the question was, isn't the obvious
merge algorithm theta n cubed, right? And

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:31.668
my answer is no, because the theta n extra
factor came from the fact that you had to

00:34:31.668 --> 00:34:36.739
check every point, every endpoint, to see
on which side of the plane it was. Whereas

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:41.070
here, what I'm doing is I've got this one
line here that is basically y equals 0, if

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:47.909
you like, or y equals some-- I'm sorry, x
equals 0 or x equals some value.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:55.270
And I just need to, once I have the equation
for the line associated with a4 b1 or a4 b2,

00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:00.500
I just have to find the intercept of it, which
is constant time, right? And then once I find

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:06.750
the intercept of it, I just maximize that
intercept to get my yij. So I'm good, OK?

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:15.230
So it's only theta n squared, right? Good
question. So this is actually quite-- very,

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.620
very, very clever.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:22.370
This particular algorithm is called the two
finger algorithm. And I do have multiple fingers,

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:27.790
but it's going to work a lot better if I borrow
Eric's finger. And we're going to demonstrate

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:36.300
to you the two finger algorithm for merging
these two convex hulls. And then we'll talk

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.160
about the complexity of it.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.470
And my innovation again last night was to
turn this from a two-finger algorithm. Not

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:48.660
only did I have the bright idea of using Eric--
I decided it was going to become the two finger

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.720
an string algorithm. So this is wild.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:36:04.420
This is my contribution to 046 lore-- come
on. So the way the two finger algorithm works--

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:10.220
this pseudo code should be incomprehensible.
If you just look at it and you go, what, right?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:15.100
But this demo is going to clear everything
up. Right so here's what you do. So now we're

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:22.150
going to do a demo of the merge algorithm
that is a clever merge algorithm than the

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:29.070
one that uses order n square time. And it's
correct. It's going to get you the correct

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:37.290
upper tangent and what we are starting at
here is with Erik’s left finger on A1, which

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:45.400
is defined to be the point that's closest
to the vertical line that you see here, the

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.580
one that has the highest x-coordinate. And
my finger is on B1, which is the point that

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:58.760
has the smallest X-coordinate on the right
hand side sub-hull. And what we do is we compute,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:06.460
for the segment A1 B1, we compute by Yij,
in this case Y11, which is the intercept on

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:13.730
the vertical line that you see here that Erik
just marked with a red dot. And you can look

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:19.960
at the pseudocode over on, to my right if
I face the board. And what happens now is

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:26.730
I'm going to move clockwise, and I'm going
to go from B1 to B4. And what happened here?

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:34.010
Did the Yij increase or decrease? Well, as
you can see it decreased. And so I'm going

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:40.930
to go back to B1. And we're not quite done
with this step here. Erik’s going to go

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:47.360
counterclockwise over to A4. And we're going
to check again, yeah, keep the string taught,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:53.440
check again whether Yij increased or decreased
and as is clear from here Yij increased. So

00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:00.700
now we move to this point. And as of this
moment we think that A4 B1 has the highest

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.220
Yij. But we have a while loop. We’re going
to have to continue with this while loop,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:13.370
and now what happens is, I’m going to go
from B1 clockwise again to B4. And when this

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:19.570
happens, did Yij increase or decrease? Well
it decreased. So I'm going to go back to B1

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:32.430
and Erik now is going to go counterclockwise
to A3. And as you can see Y31 increased a

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:39.350
little bit, so we're going to now stop this
iteration of the algorithm and we're at A3

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:46.860
B1, which we think at this point is our upper
tangent, but let's check that. Start over

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:54.750
again on my side B1 to B4, what happened?
Well Yij decreased. So I'm going to go back

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:59.350
to B1. And then Erik’s going to try. He’s
going conterclockwise, he's going to go A3

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:08.760
to A2 and, well, big decrease in Yij. Now
Erik goes back to A3. At this point we've

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:17.040
tried both moves, my clockwise move and Erik’s
counterclockwise move. My move from B1 to

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.890
B4 and Erik’s move from A3 to A2. So we've
converged, we're out of the while loop, A3

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:34.010
B1 for this example is our upper tangent.
All right. You can have your finger back Erik.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:42.810
So the reason this works is because we have
a convex hull here and a convex hull here.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:51.100
We are starting with the points that are closest
to each other in terms of A1 being the closest

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:58.240
to this vertical line, B1 being the closest
to this vertical line, and we are moving upward

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.570
in both directions because I went clockwise
and Erik went counterclockwise. And that's

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:09.000
the intuition of why this algorithm works.
We're not going to do a formal proof of this

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.490
algorithm, but the monotonicity property corresponding
to the convexity of this subhull and the convexity

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:24.100
of the subhull essentially can give you a
formal proof of correctness of this algorithm,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:31.010
but as I said we won't cover that in 046.
So all that remains now is to look at our

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:37.850
pseudocode which matches the execution that
you just saw and talk about the complexity

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.310
of the pseudocode.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:46.300
So what is the complexity of this algorithm?
It's order n, right? So what has happening

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:51.970
here, if you look at this while loop, is that
while I have two counters, I'm essentially

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:56.490
looking at two operations per loop.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:03.860
And either one of those counters is guaranteed
to increment through the loop. And so since

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:11.750
I have in this case p points, in one case
p plus q equals n-- so let's say I had p points

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:19.500
here and I have q points here. And got p plus
q equals n.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:29.250
And I got a theta n merge simply because I'm
going to be running through and incrementing--

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:35.430
as long as I'm in the loop, I'm going to be
incrementing either the i or the j. And the

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:41.830
maximum they can go to are p and q before
I bounce out of the loop or before they rotate

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.850
around.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:50.780
And so that's why this is theta n. And so
you put it all together in terms of what the

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:57.190
merge corresponds to in terms of complexity
and put that together with the overall divide

00:41:57.190 --> 00:42:06.270
and conquer. We have a case where this is
looking like a recurrence that you've seen

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.460
many a time t of n.

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:17.890
I've broken it up into two sub problems. So
I have 2. And I could certainly choose this

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:27.750
l over here that's my line l to be such that
I have a good partition between the two sets

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:28.400
of points.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.210
Now, if I choose l to be all the way on the
right hand side, then I have this large sub

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:38.360
problem-- makes no sense whatsoever. So what
I can do-- there's nothing that's stopping

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:46.610
me when I've sorted these points by the x-coordinates
to do the division such that there's exactly

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:52.140
the same number, assuming an even number of
points n, exactly the same number on the left

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.340
hand side or the right hand side. But I can
get that right roughly certainly within one

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.000
very easily.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.510
So that's where the n over 2 comes from, OK?
In the next problem that we'll look at, the

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:09.540
median finding problem, we'll find that trying
to get the sub problems to be of roughly equal

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.620
size is actually a little difficult, OK? But
I want to point out that in this particular

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:20.970
case, it's easy to get sub problems that are
half the size because you've done the sorting.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:26.970
And then you just choose the line, the vertical
line such that you've got a bunch of points

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:33.320
that are on either side. And then in terms
of the merge operation, we have 2t n over

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:41.310
2 plus theta n. People recognize this recurrence?
It's the old merge sort recurrence.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:45.920
So we did all of this in-- well, it's not
merge sort. Clearly the algorithm is not merge

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.340
sort. We got the same recurrence.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:56.960
And so this is theta n log n-- so a lot better
than theta nq. And there's no convex hull

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.850
algorithm that's in the general case better
than this. Even the gift wrapping algorithm

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:07.720
that I mentioned to you, with the right data
structures, it gets down to that in terms

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.010
of theta n log n, but no better.

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:17.890
OK, so good. That's pretty much what I had
here. Again, like I said, happy to answer

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:25.750
questions about the correctness of this loop
algorithm for merge later. Any other questions

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.570
associated with this?

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:28.560
STUDENT: Question.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.760
Yeah, back there.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.940
STUDENT: If the input is recorded by x coordinates, can you do better than [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:41.100
PROFESSOR: No, you can't, because-- I mean,
the n log n for the pre-sorting, I mean, there's

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:48.120
another theta n log n for the sorting at the
top level. And we didn't actually use that,

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:54.010
right? So the question was, can we do better
if the input was pre sorted?

00:44:54.010 --> 00:45:00.920
And I actually did not even use the complexity
of the sort. We just matched it in this case.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.220
So theta n log n-- and then you can imagine
maybe that you could do a theta n sort if

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.860
these points were small enough and you rounded
them up and you could use a bucket sort or

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.130
a counting sort and lower that.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:17.720
So this theta n log n is kind of fundamental
to the divide and conquer algorithm. The only

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:23.530
way you can improve that is by making a merge
process that's even faster. And we obviously

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:29.470
tried to cook up a theta one merge process.
But that didn't work out, OK?

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:33.720
STUDENT: But are there algorithms that [INAUDIBLE] ?

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.920
PROFESSOR: First-- if you assume certain things
about the input, you're absolutely, right?

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:45.540
So one thing you'll discover in algorithms
in 6046 as well is that we're never satisfied.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:49.630
OK, so I just said, oh, you can't do better
than theta n log n.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:54.620
But that's in the general case. And I think
I mentioned that. You're on the right track.

00:45:54.620 --> 00:46:00.440
If the input is pre sorted, you can take that
away-- no, it doesn't help in that particular

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:09.110
instance if you have general settings. But
if you-- the two dimensional case-- if the

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:17.140
hull, all the segments have a certain characteristic--
not quite planar, but something that's a little

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.430
more stringent than that-- you could imagine
that you can do improvements. I don't know

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:27.750
if any compelling special case input for convex
hull from which you can do better than theta

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:28.540
n log n.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:34.520
But that's a fine exercise for you, which
is in what cases, given some structure on

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.690
the points, can I do better than theta n log
n? So that's something that keeps coming up

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:45.890
in the algorithm literature, if you can use
that, OK? Yeah, back there-- question.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.710
STUDENT: Where's your [INAUDIBLE] step?

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:53.000
You also have to figure out which lines to remove from each of your two...

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.560
PROFESSOR: Ah, good point. And you're exactly,
absolutely right. And I just realized that

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.060
I skipped that step, right?

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:05.360
Thank you so much. So the question was, how
do I remove the lines? And it's actually fairly

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.090
straightforward.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:13.720
Let's keep this up here. And we don't need
this incomprehensible pseudo code, right?

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.800
So let's erase that.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:24.060
And thank you for asking that question. So
it's a little simple cut and paste approach

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:39.440
where let's say that I find the upper tangent
ai bj. And I find the lower tangent.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:51.430
Let's call it ak bm. And in this particular
instance, what do I have? I have a1, a2, a3,

00:47:51.430 --> 00:48:00.850
a4 as being one of my sub hulls. And then
I have b1, b2, b3, b4 as the other one.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:10.830
Now, what did we determine to be the upper
tangent? Was it a3 b1? Right, a3 b1?

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:27.370
So a3 b1 was my upper tangent. And I guess
it was a1-- a1 b4? A1 b4 was my lower tangent.

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:34.580
So the big question is, now that I've found
these two, how do I generate the collect representation

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:40.990
of the overall convex hull? And so it turns
out that you have to do this-- and then the

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:46.660
complexity of this is important as well. And
you need to do what's called a cut and paste

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.350
that's associated with this where we're going
to just look at this and that.

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.740
So if we're going to have these two things,
then we've got to generate a list of points.

00:48:54.740 --> 00:49:00.200
Now, clearly a4 is not going to be part of
that, right? A4 is not going to be part of

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.490
the overall hull.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:11.880
What is it that we want? We want something
like a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, b4, right? But

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.210
there's a point that we have to discard here.
Agree?

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:22.780
And so the way we do this is very mechanical.
That's the good news here. I mean, you don't

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.230
have to look at it pictorially.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:30.840
I just made that up looking at-- eyeballing
it. Clearly, a computer doesn't have eyeballs,

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:37.430
right? And so what we're going to do is we're
going to say the first link-- in general,

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.960
the first link is ai to bj.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:49.940
Because that's my upper tangent, OK? And in
this case, it's going to be a3 d1, OK? And

00:49:49.940 --> 00:50:08.820
then I'm going to go down the b list until
you see bm, which is the lower tangent.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.640
You're on the b list. So you're looking for
the lower tangent point. And then you're going

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:20.240
to jump until you see bm. You link it to ak,
OK?

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:34.310
You link it to ak and continue until you return
to ai. And then you have your circular

00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:42.910
list, OK? So what you see here is you have
a3 here. So I'm going to go ahead and write

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:47.980
out the execution of what I just wrote here.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:54.500
So I have a3. And I'm going to go jump over
to b1. So I'm going to write down b1. Then

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:58.340
I'm going to along the b's until I get to
b4.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:05.440
In this case, I'm going to include all of
the b's. So I got b1, b2, b3, b4. And then

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:13.810
I'm going to jump from b4 to a1 because that's
part of my lower tangent.

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:25.250
And I got a1 here, a2. And then I'm back to
a3, which is great. Because then I'm done,

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.290
OK?

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:32.050
And so exactly what I said happened, thank
goodness, which is we dropped a4 but we kept

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:38.300
all the other points. Does that answer your
question? Good.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:44.520
What is the complexity of cut and paste? It's
order n. I'm just walking through these lists.

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:50.730
So there's no hidden complexity here, OK?
Good, good-- thank you. You definitely deserve

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:51.440
a Frisbee.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:59.400
In fact, you deserve two, right? Where are
you? I-- oh, could you stand up?

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:09.570
Yeah, right-- two colors. All right. Oh, so
he-- well, you can give it to him if you like.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.380
So good, thank you.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:20.760
So are we done? Are we done with convex hull?
OK, good. So let's go on and do median finding.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:25.960
Very different-- very different set of issues
here.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:37.960
Still on divide and conquer, but a very different
set of issues. The specification here is,

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:44.210
of course, straightforward. You can think
of it as I just want a better algorithm than

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:51.480
sorting and looking for the median at the
particular position-- in over two position,

00:52:51.480 --> 00:53:01.680
for example. Let's say n is odd. And it's
floor of n over 2. You can find that median.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:10.300
Right, so it's pretty easy if you can do sorting.
But we're never satisfied with using a standard

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:14.970
algorithm. If we think that we can do better
than that. So the whole game here is going

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.970
to be I'm going to find the median.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:32.910
And I want to do it in better than theta n
log n time. OK, so that's what median finding

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:37.070
is all about. You're going to use divide and
conquer for this.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:53.880
And so in general, we're going to define,
given a set of n numbers, define rank of x

00:53:53.880 --> 00:54:06.510
as the numbers in the set that are greater
than-- I'm sorry, less than or equal to x.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.270
I mean, you could have defined it differently.
We're going to go with less than or equal

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.750
to.

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:18.570
So in general, the rank, of course, is something
that could be used very easily to find the

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:28.930
median. So if you want to find the element
of rank n plus 1 divided by 2 floor, that's

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:38.650
what we call the lower median. And n plus
1 divided by 2 ceiling is the upper median.

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:43.730
And they may be the same if n is odd.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:48.210
But that's what we want. So you can think
of it as it's not median finding, but finding

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:55.200
elements with a certain rank. And we want
to do this in linear time, OK?

00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:05.400
So we're going to apply divide and conquer
here. And as always, the template can be instantiated.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:11.780
And the devil is in the details of either
division or merge.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:19.460
And we had most of our fun with convex hull
on the merge operation. It turns out most

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:32.770
of the fun here with respect to median finding
is in the divide, OK? So what I want is the

00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:38.780
definition of a select routine that takes
a set of numbers s.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:49.340
And this is the rank. So I want a rank i.
And that i might be n over 2-- well, floor

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:52.560
of n plus 1 over 2, whatever?

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.500
And so what does the divide and conquer look
like? Well, the first thing you need to do

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:04.920
is divide. And as of now, we're just going
to say you're going to pick some element x

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:06.240
belonging to s.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:10.230
And this choice is going to be crucial. But
at this point, I'm not ready to specify this

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:15.640
choice yet, OK? So we're going to have to
do this cleverly. And then what we're going

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:30.220
to do is we're going to compute on k, which
is the rank of x, and generate two sub arrays

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.680
such that I want to find the fifth highest
element. I want to find the median element.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:40.910
I want to find the 10th highest element. So
I have to keep track of what happens in the

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:46.990
sub problems. Because the sub problems are
going to determine, depending on how many

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:52.700
elements are inside those sub problems, which
I can only determine after I've solved those

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:56.740
sub problems. I'm going to have to collect
that information and put it together in the

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.080
merge operation.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:05.700
So if I want to find the 10th highest element
and I've broken it up relatively arbitrarily,

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:10.240
it's quite possible that the 10th highest
element is going to be discovered in the left

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.150
one or the right one. And I have to show that
it's the 10th highest. And it might be that

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:24.090
there's four elements in the left and five
on the right that are-- let's see.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:29.010
If I defined the rank as less than or equal
to x, there's four on the left and five on

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:34.680
the right that are smaller. And that's why
this is the 10th highest element. And that's

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:44.330
essentially what we have to look at. So b
and c are going to correspond to the sub arrays

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:49.600
that you can clearly eliminate one of them.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:55.350
You can count the number of elements in b,
count the number of elements in c. And you

00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:03.810
can eliminate one of them in this recursion
as you're discovering this element with the

00:58:03.810 --> 00:58:09.320
correct rank-- in this case, i. So let me
write the rest of this out and make sure we're

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.710
all on the same page.

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:23.570
What I have here pictorially is I've generated
b here and c. So this is all of b and that's

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:30.970
all of c. I have k minus 1 elements here in
b.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:44.170
And let's say I have n minus k elements in
c. And I'm going to do-- essentially take--

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:49.080
once I've selected a particular element, I'm
going to look at all of the elements that

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.510
are less than it and put it into the array
b. I'm going to look at all the elements that

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:53.560
are better than it.

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:58.830
Let's assume all elements are unique. I'm
going to put all of them into c. And I'm going

00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:06.030
to recur on b and c. Those two are my sub
problems.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:17.120
But what I have to do is once I recur and
I discover the ranks of the sub problems,

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:23.300
I have to put them together. So what I have
here is if k equals i-- so I computed the

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:32.430
rank and I realized that if k equals-- equals
i, I should say-- if k equals i, then I'm

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.360
going to just return x. I'm done at this point.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:42.610
I got lucky. I picked an element x and it
magically ended up having the correct rank,

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:53.030
OK? Not always going to happen. And so in
other case, if k is greater than i, then going

00:59:53.030 --> 01:00:01.540
to return select bi.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:07.670
So what I've done here is if k is greater
than i, then I'm going to say, oh, so now

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:11.540
I'm going to have to find the element in b.
I know that it's going to be in b because

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.740
k is greater than i. And I've got to find
the exact position depending on what i is

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:23.530
over here. But it's going to be somewhere
between 1 and k minus 1.

01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:34.350
And then the last case is if k is less than
i, then this is a little more tricky. I'm

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:47.080
going to turn on c of i minus k, OK? So what
happens here is that my k is-- the rank for

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.520
the x that I looked at over here is less than
i.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:57.110
So I know that I'm going to find this element
that I'm looking for in c. But if I just look

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:05.050
at c, I don't want to look at c and look for
an element of rank i within c, right? That

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:09.880
doesn't make sense because I'm looking for
an element of rank i in the overall array

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.300
that was given to me.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:18.730
So I have to subtract out the k elements that
correspond to x and all of the k minus 1 elements

01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:25.450
that are in b to go figure out exactly what
position or rank I'm looking for in the sub

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:31.830
array corresponding to c, OK? So, people buy
that. So that's just a small, little thing

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:34.660
that you have to keep in mind as you do this.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:41.480
So that's pretty straightforward, looking
pretty good. And you say, well, am I done

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:49.750
here? And as you can imagine, the answer is
no, because we haven't specified this value.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:59.070
Now, can someone tell me, at least from an
efficiency standpoint, what might happen,

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:04.790
what we're looking for here? As you can imagine,
we want to improve on theta n log n. And so

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:10.070
you could you say, well, I'm happy with theta
n. That theta n complexity algorithm is better

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:13.770
than a theta n log n complexity algorithm,
which is kind of in the bag.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:18.340
Because we know how to sort and we know how
to index. So we want a theta n algorithm.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:28.880
Now, if you take this and if I just picked,
let's say, the biggest element-- I kept picking

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.560
x to be n or n minus 1 or just picked a constant
value. I picked x to be in the middle.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.130
I picked the index. I can always pick an element
based on its index. I can always go for the

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:43.680
middle one.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:51.340
So what is the worst case complexity of this
algorithm? If I don't specify or I give you

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.170
this arbitrary selection corresponding to
x belonging to s, what is the worst case complexity

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.300
of this algorithm? Yeah, go ahead.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.160
STUDENT: N squared.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.400
PROFESSOR: N squared-- why is that?

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.360
STUDENT: Because if you [INAUDIBLE] take like the least element.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.100
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:08.820
STUDENT: How do you compare like N o against the other analysis?

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:12.560
PROFESSOR: Exactly right. That's exactly right.
So what happens is that you're doing a bunch

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.430
of work here with this theta n work.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:21.650
Right here, this is theta n work, OK? So given
that you're doing theta n work here, you have

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:27.930
to be really careful as to how you pick the
x element. So what might happen is that you

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:30.160
end up picking the x over here.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.740
And given the particular rank you're looking
for, you have to now-- you're left with a

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:40.160
large array that has n minus 1 elements in
the worst case. You started with n. You did

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.460
not go to n over 2 and n over 2, which is
what divide and conquer is all about-- even

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.180
n over b, OK?

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:52.200
You went to n minus 1. And then you go to
n minus 2. And you go to n minus 3 because

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.140
you're constantly picking-- this is worst
case analysis. You're constantly picking these

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.990
sub arrays to be extremely unbalanced.

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:05.440
So when the sub arrays are extremely unbalanced,
you end up doing theta n work in each

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:10.980
level of the recursion. And those theta n's,
because you're going down all the way from

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:18.600
n to one, are going to be theta n square when
you keep doing that, OK? So thanks for that

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.010
analysis.

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:32.170
And so this is theta n squared if you have
a batch selection. So we won't talk about

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:38.520
randomized algorithms, but the problem with
randomized algorithms is that the analysis

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:45.140
will be given a probability distribution.
And it'll be expected time.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:51.890
What we want here is a deterministic algorithm
that is guaranteed to run in worst case theta

01:04:51.890 --> 01:05:00.740
n. So we want a deterministic way of picking
x belonging to s such that all of this works

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:05.320
out and when we get our recurrence and we
solve it, somehow magically we're getting

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:12.860
fully balanced partitions-- firmly balanced
sub problems in the sense that it's not n

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:17.540
minus 1 and 1. It's something like-- it could
even be n over 10 and 9n over 10.

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:22.320
But as long as you guarantee that, you're
shaking things down geometrically. And the

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:28.320
asymptotics is going to work out. but the
determinism is what we need.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:42.190
And so we're going to pick x cleverly. And
we don't want the rank x to be extreme.

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:49.000
So this is not the only way you could do it,
but this is really very clever.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:57.880
There's a deterministic way. And you're going
to see some arbitrary constants here. And

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.910
we'll talk about them once I've described
it. But what we're going to do is we're going

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:08.270
to arrange s into columns of size 5, right?

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:12.130
We're going to take this single array. And
we're going to make it a two dimensional array

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:20.040
where the number of rows is five and the number
of columns that you have is n over 5-- the

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:35.570
ceiling in this case. And then we're going
to sort it each column, big elements on top.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.180
And we're going to do this in linear time.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:44.460
And you might say, how did that happen? Well,
there's only five elements. So it's linear.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.360
You could do whatever you wanted. You could
do n raised to four.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:55.230
But it's five raised to four and it's constants.
Don't you love theory? So then we're going

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:59.630
to find what we're going to call the median
of medians.

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:04.380
So I'm going to explain this. This works for
arbitrary rank, but it's a little easier to

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.790
focus in on the median to just explain the
particular example. Because as you can see,

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:18.090
there's an intricacy here associated with
the break up.

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:23.890
And so here we go. I'm going to draw out a
picture. And we're going to try and argue

01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:32.560
that this deterministic strategy that I'll
specify gives you fairly balanced partitions

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.730
in all cases, OK?

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:47.270
So what we see here is we see-- pictorially,
you see columns of length five. Each of these

01:07:47.270 --> 01:08:00.640
dots corresponds to a number. This one dimensional
array got turned into a two dimensional right.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:08.010
So I got four full columns. And it's suddenly
possible, given n, that my fifth column is

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:16.299
not full, right? So that's certainly possible.
So that's why I have that up here. It so what

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:19.420
I've here is I'm going to lay them out this
way.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:31.889
And I'm going to look at that. I'm going to
look at the middle elements of each of these

01:08:31.889 --> 01:08:41.549
n over five columns. That's exactly what I'm
going to look at. Now, if I look at what I

01:08:41.549 --> 01:08:48.179
want, what I want over here is this x. If
I want to find--

01:08:48.179 --> 01:08:59.109
I'm going to find the median of medians. So
is x. Now, it is true the first that

01:08:59.109 --> 01:09:03.269
these columns-- I'm just putting that up here
imagining that that's x.

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:12.568
That's not guaranteed to be x because the
columns themselves aren't-- well, these columns

01:09:12.568 --> 01:09:18.849
are sorted. And what I'm going to have to
guarantee, of course, is that when I go find

01:09:18.849 --> 01:09:25.749
this median of medians is that it ends up
being something that gives me balanced partitions.

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:32.749
So maybe say a little bit more before I explain
what's going on.

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:38.960
Each of these columns is sorted. And s is
arranged into columns of size 5 like I just

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:51.259
said here. These are the medians, OK? If I
look at determining the medians and I say

01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:57.449
that once I've determined this x, which I've
discovered that it's the median, then this

01:09:57.449 --> 01:10:00.710
is right there in the middle. There's going
to be a bunch of columns to the left of it,

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:04.239
a bunch of elements to the left of it, and
a bunch of elements to the right of it.

01:10:04.239 --> 01:10:08.909
And in this case, I have five columns. I could
have had more. It happens to be the third

01:10:08.909 --> 01:10:09.880
one.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:15.909
So the idea is that once I find this median
of medians, which corresponds to this x number,

01:10:15.909 --> 01:10:23.999
I can say that all of the columns-- these
all correspond to columns that have their

01:10:23.999 --> 01:10:29.070
median element greater than x. These correspond
to columns that have their median element

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:39.159
less than x, OK? So what I have here in this
picture is that these elements here are going

01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:42.199
to be greater than x.

01:10:42.199 --> 01:10:56.440
And these elements here are going to be less
than x. So let me clear. What's happened here

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:07.659
is we've not only sorted all of the columns
such that you have large elements up here.

01:11:07.659 --> 01:11:12.360
Each of these five columns have been sorted
that way. On top of that, I've discovered

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:19.929
the particular column that corresponds to
the medians of medians. And this is my x over

01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:20.989
here.

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:25.199
And it may be the case that these columns
aren't sorted. This one may be larger than

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:29.030
that or vice versa-- same thing over there.
I have no idea.

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:36.119
But it's guaranteed that once I find this
median that I do know all of the columns that

01:11:36.119 --> 01:11:44.550
have elements in this position that are less
than this x. And I know columns that in this

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.450
position have elements that are greater than
x, OK? Yep.

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:56.200
STUDENT: Shouldn't the two elements below x also be computed [INAUDIBLE] less than x.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:04.579
PROFESSOR: You're exactly right. I would have
probably been able to get the same asymptotic

01:12:04.579 --> 01:12:09.440
complexity if I dropped those because I had
a constant number. But you're absolutely exactly

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.199
right.

01:12:10.199 --> 01:12:15.429
So the point that-- the question was-- I just
redrew it. These two are clearly less than

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:21.610
x as well because they're part of the sorting.
And that's essentially I have here.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:26.679
Now, my goal here-- and you can kind of see
from here as to where we're headed. What I've

01:12:26.679 --> 01:12:31.780
down here by this process of sorting each
column and finding the median of medians is

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:37.760
that I found this median of medians such that
there's a bunch of columns on the left. And

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:41.530
roughly half of those elements in those columns
are less than x.

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:47.739
And there are a bunch of columns on the right.
And roughly half of those columns have elements

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:54.030
that are greater than x. So what I now have
to do is to do a little bit of math to show

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:58.079
you exactly what the recurrence is. And let
me do that over here.

01:12:58.079 --> 01:13:03.550
So that's the last thing that we have to do.
I probably won't solve the recurrence, but

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:10.469
that can wait until tomorrow. The recurrence
will be something that's not particularly

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:23.670
difficult to solve. So I want to now make
a more quantitative argument that the variable

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:33.300
being n as to how many elements are guaranteed
to be greater than x.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:38.519
And essentially what I'm saying, which is
I'm writing out what I have on that picture

01:13:38.519 --> 01:14:02.030
there, half of the n over 5 groups contribute
at least three elements greater than x except

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:10.559
for one group with possibly less than five
elements, which is the one that I have all

01:14:10.559 --> 01:14:27.550
the way to the right, and one group that contains
x.
So for all the other columns, I'm going to

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:35.619
get three elements that are greater than x.
And so if you write that out, this says there

01:14:35.619 --> 01:14:47.199
are at least three n over 10, because I have
half of all of those groups, minus 2.

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:53.239
And I'm not counting perfectly accurately
here, but I have an at least. So this should

01:14:53.239 --> 01:15:02.219
all be fine. 3n over 1d-- 3 times n over 10
minus 2 elements are strictly greater than

01:15:02.219 --> 01:15:06.179
x. And that comes from that picture.

01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:14.639
I'm going to be able to say the same thing
for less than x as well. I can't count the

01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:20.960
one. Depending on how things go, maybe I could
have played around and subtracted 1 instead

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.440
of a 2 in the latter case.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:28.829
But I'm just being conservative here. It is
clear that I'm going to have a bunch of columns

01:15:28.829 --> 01:15:34.789
that are full columns, that are going to be
contributing three elements that are greater

01:15:34.789 --> 01:15:39.249
than x. And in this case, I have, well, two
of them here for the less than x.

01:15:39.249 --> 01:15:44.550
And I got one for the greater than x. So that's
all that I'm seeing over here with respect

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:49.800
to the balance of the partitions. And it turns
out that's enough.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:57.949
It turns out all I have to do with this observation
is to go off and run the recurrence. And we're

01:15:57.949 --> 01:16:04.160
going to get an efficient algorithm. Yep.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.059
STUDENT: Should it not be like greater than or equal to, because there's... [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:08.059 --> 01:16:11.240
PROFESSOR: No, there's nothing that's equal.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.580
STUDENT: So you are saying, that's all you need.

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah. Yeah, I assume that-- so,
convenience, yeah. There's always a little

01:16:16.849 --> 01:16:19.030
bit of convenience thrown in here.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:27.989
We will assume that the a has unique elements.
So there's nothing that's x, OK? Good.

01:16:27.989 --> 01:16:38.190
So the recurrence, once you do that, is t
of n equals-- we're going to just say it's

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:48.510
order one for n less than or equal to 140.
Where did that come from? Well, like 140.

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:53.630
It's just a large number. It came from the
fact that you're going to see 10 minus 3,

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:57.119
which is 7. And then you want to multiply
that by 2.

01:16:57.119 --> 01:17:01.619
So some reasonably large number-- we're going
to go off and we're going to assume that's

01:17:01.619 --> 01:17:08.400
a constant. So you could sort those 140 numbers
and find the median or whatever rank. It's

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.739
all constant time once you get down to the
base case.

01:17:10.739 --> 01:17:14.659
So you just want it to be large enough such
that you could break it up and you have something

01:17:14.659 --> 01:17:19.679
interesting going on with respect to the number
of columns. So don't worry much about that

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:24.230
number. The key thing here is the recurrence,
all right?

01:17:24.230 --> 01:17:31.980
And this is what we have spent the rest of
our time on. And I'll just write this out

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:47.179
and explain where these numbers came from.
So that's our recurrence for n less than or

01:17:47.179 --> 01:17:48.650
equal to 140.

01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:54.590
And else, you're going to do this. So what
is going on here? What are all of these components

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:58.110
corresponding to this recurrence?

01:17:58.110 --> 01:18:05.300
Really quickly, this is simply something that
says I'm finding the median of medians. I'm

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:11.170
finding some element that has a certain rank.
So this median of medians is going to be running

01:18:11.170 --> 01:18:17.579
on n over 5 columns. So I've got this-- there
are n over 5 columns here.

01:18:17.579 --> 01:18:24.150
And I'm going to be calling this algorithm
recursively, the median finding algorithm,

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:35.260
to do that-- finding the median of medians.
This thing over here is-- I'm going to be

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:43.039
discarding at least regardless of what I do.
Because I have these two statements here,

01:18:43.039 --> 01:18:47.760
I take the overall n. And I'm going to discard.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.849
In my paradigm over here, I'm either going
to go with b or I'm either going to go with

01:18:51.849 --> 01:18:57.889
c depending on what I'm looking for. And given
that b and c are not completely unbalanced,

01:18:57.889 --> 01:19:06.349
I'm going to be discarding 3n over 10 minus
6 elements, which simply corresponds to me

01:19:06.349 --> 01:19:12.150
ignoring the ceiling here and multiplying
the 3 out. So that's 3n over 10 minus 6.

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:18.999
So then I have 7n over 10 plus 6. That's the
maximum size partition that I'm going to recur

01:19:18.999 --> 01:19:22.579
on. It's only going to be exactly one of them,
as you can see from that.

01:19:22.579 --> 01:19:26.570
It's either else. It's not recurring on both
of them. It's recurring on one of them. So

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:32.099
that's where the 7n over 10 plus 6 comes from.
And then you ask where does this theta n come

01:19:32.099 --> 01:19:32.749
from.

01:19:32.749 --> 01:19:38.780
Well, the theta n comes from the fact that
I do have to do some sorting. It's constant

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:44.079
time sorting for every column, OK? Because
it's only five elements.

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:49.099
So I'm going to do constant time sorting.
But there's order n columns. Because it's--

01:19:49.099 --> 01:19:50.909
then it's n over 5 columns.

01:19:50.909 --> 01:20:00.679
So this is the sorting of all of the columns,
all right? So that's it. And I'll just leave

01:20:00.679 --> 01:20:08.659
you with-- you cannot apply the master theorem
for solving this particular recurrence. But

01:20:08.659 --> 01:20:11.699
if you make the observation-- and you'll see
this in section.

01:20:11.699 --> 01:20:19.409
You make the observation that n over 5 plus
7n over 10 is actually less than n. So you

01:20:19.409 --> 01:20:23.610
get 0.2n here and 0.7n there. That's actually
less than n.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:28.070
This thing runs in linear time. And you'll
see that in section tomorrow. So this whole

01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:33.250
thing is theta n time. See you next time.
