00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.140
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.930
So we have a singleton lecture
today on linear programming,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.000
which is general purpose
optimization technique that you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.830
can use to solve a
whole bunch of problems,

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:41.350
including ones that we've seen
in 6.046 and previously in 006.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.780
And most recently, we
looked at max flow.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.520
We wouldn't have had
to go through all

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.920
of that pain we went through
to derive a max flow algorithm

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.690
if you had a linear
programming package handy

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.330
and all you wanted to do was
find the optimum solution.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.550
You could have just
run the linear program

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
with an appropriate
input, of course, that is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780
derived from the flow network.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.030
And you'd get your
optimal solution.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.840
And we'll spend a couple
of minutes on that

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.380
as we look at the power of
linear programming in today's

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.390
lecture.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.770
But it's not just max flow.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.470
You could do shortest paths.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.180
You could do multi
commodity max flow,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.250
which is more complicated
than max flow and a variety

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.410
of other problems.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.380
So that's that good news.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.110
The bad news is
that the algorithms

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.080
for linear programming are a
heck of a lot more complicated

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.709
than max flow.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.250
And you can imagine that that
would be the case, because it's

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.450
a more general purpose and
more powerful technique.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.630
The history really is that
it was an open problem.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.650
Up until 1979, people did not
know if linear programming was

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.060
polynomial-time solvable
until Khachiyan came up

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.800
with this ellipsoid
method, and then there's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.390
been progress sense.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.220
But the algorithm we're going
to describe today and execute

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.539
on a example input is
a simplex algorithm--

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.490
the simplex algorithm--
that runs in worst case

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.450
exponential time.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.410
But it's a very
efficient in practice.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.220
And it's held its ground,
even with the advent

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.800
of more efficient, from
a theoretical sense,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.520
polynomial-time algorithms,
namely the ellipsoid method,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.480
which actually is not
that efficient in practice

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.130
and new interior point methods.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.950
So a little bit
of context, let's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.950
just dive into an
example of optimization

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.620
in the context of
politics and see

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.210
how you could formulate
this particular problem

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.470
as a linear program.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.950
So how does politics work?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.510
You buy elections, right?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.120
So you don't want to
spend a lot of money,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.050
so you want to minimize
the amount of money that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.870
is required to buy an election.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.920
And the way you buy an
election is, well, campaign,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.820
but you advertise.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.990
And it doesn't matter
facts that are relevant.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.450
As long as you get to the right
demographic with the right

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.280
message, let's
assume that you're

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.570
going to win the election.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.360
So that's our mathematical
abstraction pf campaigning

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.850
and politics all in 30 seconds.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:47.880
So how to campaign
to win an election.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.370
And as I said, we're
going to advertise.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.390
But you do have a little
bit of work to do here.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.580
That's why you need
your campaign manager.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:08.920
And this manager is
going to estimate votes

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.735
obtained per dollar spent.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:29.120
But that dollar is spent
advertising in support

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.410
of a particular case,
or a particular issue.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.730
And contradictions are allowed.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.000
As long as you're sending
different messages

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.340
to different demographics,
you're all good, right?

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:51.500
You're assuming
that people don't

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.180
watch more than one channel.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.000
So you're a Fox News guy
or you're a MSNB guy.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.870
You don't do both.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.560
So now, we get at this estimate.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.690
And it turns into a table.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.955
And so you have your policy,
and you've got your demographic.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:30.670
So you got urban, now
think Detroit, suburban,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.530
I guess, you could
Lexington where you live,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.540
and rural-- I really don't
have any idea what that means.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.880
But presumably, there's places.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.370
And here's our policy.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.210
You want to build
roads-- kind of boring,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.750
but some people are interested
in roads-- gun control,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.730
of very sensitive,
farm subsidies--

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.690
you know who's interested
in that-- and gasoline tax--

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.870
kind of more, this
hits your pocket,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.380
so more or less everybody's
interested in that.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.970
So you tell the urban guys
you want to build roads,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.060
and they don't like you.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.240
So you get a minus 2 there.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.720
So this can go, you
advertise, and it hurts you.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.730
You lose votes.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.180
Tell the suburban
people-- well, typically,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.300
it's a situation where
you have these nice cars,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.080
and you don't like
potholes, so you like roads

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.070
if you live in suburbia.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.720
Rural people have 4-by-4's.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.040
They don't particularly care.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.700
They don't care as much.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.670
Gun control-- well, you can
imagine that urban people

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.940
like that.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.040
Suburban people
are, hm, OK, meh.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.950
And the rural people
hate it, right?

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.630
You do not want to advertise on
gun control in the rural areas.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.350
Farm subsidies-- so like,
don't want to deal with that.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.015
What is a farm?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.150
And the rural people
love it, right?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.690
And then gasoline tax, well,
urban people are commuting.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.770
And, well, they typically
don't have a lot of money.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.270
So there you go.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.660
And those are the numbers.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.420
I'm not going to justify
every number here.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.610
But you could put whatever
numbers you what, I mean.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.230
So let's move on.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:42.700
This is just a table.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.020
It could have positive numbers.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.750
It could have negative numbers.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.360
And you still want
to win this election.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.360
Regardless of how
crazy the demographics

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.042
are, how crazy
your electorate is,

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:54.250
you want to win the election.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.400
So as long as you
have a great campaign

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.880
manager, who can
get you this table,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.250
it's all mathematical
here on out.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.570
You've just got
to figure out how

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.220
you're going to win a majority.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:19.542
And you could argue that all
you want is to win the election.

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:21.750
We're going to do something
slightly different, which

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:28.470
is something that's obviously
going to guarantee victory.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.429
But you want to win a
majority in every demographic.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:39.070
As the tables may be off by
little, you want to be careful.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.090
So the last thing,
of course, in order

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:48.030
to estimate how much money you
need is the population here.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:58.640
So that's votes obtained
per dollar spent.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.030
So you're getting-- it's
$10 a vote, it's $5 a vote,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.110
et cetera.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.690
And so we need to
translate that to votes,

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.170
because that's the dollars.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.510
And you got your population
here corresponding

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.445
to each of these areas.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.050
And that's what you got here.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:25.960
Majority, we'll assume you
win in the case of ties,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.300
just to keep these numbers easy,
so that's just divided by 2.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.050
So that's what you got so far.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:44.675
And you want to win by spending
the minimum amount of money.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.490
So that's our
optimization problem.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.700
So we can take this,
and we can convert it

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.392
to a set of linear equations.

00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:02.350
And that's going to create
our linear program--

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.480
our first linear program.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.540
And this is our algebraic setup.

00:10:16.062 --> 00:10:18.870
And so let-- we need
some variables here,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:29.170
so let x1, x2, x3, x4 denote
the dollars spent per issue.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.199
So you got those
four issues up there.

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.240
So let me write that out.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.630
It's important to
make sure you know

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.240
what I'm talking about with
respect to a particular issue.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.090
So those are our four issues.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.110
And those are our
four variables.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.870
So this linear program
has four variables.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.490
You're trying to discover
the values of these variables

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.950
to optimize, minimize
your cost function.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.980
The second thing that
a linear program has--

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.060
and pretty much the only other
thing a linear program has--

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.340
are constraints.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.700
And these constraints
are also linear.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.140
It gets much more complicated if
you have quadratic constraints,

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.050
and we won't go there.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.020
These constraints that I'm
going to write correspond

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.530
to this statement here that
says you want to majority

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.860
in each demographic.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.620
So you can imagine that because
you have three demographics,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.244
you're going to have
three constraints.

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:29.910
You could have written
this differently.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.580
There's just any number
of variants here.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.120
And you'll get the sense of
that as we go to other examples.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.700
But we'll just stick
to one variant here.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.615
So now, I want to
translate everything

00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:46.860
that I've written in English
over there into algebra.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:55.870
And so I got my minimization
criterion-- minimize x1 plus x2

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:09.690
plus x3 plus x4-- subject to
minus 2x1 plus 8x2 plus 0x3

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.890
plus 10x4 greater than
or equal to 50,000.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.960
And this represents
the requirement

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.960
that I want a majority in
the first demographic, namely

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.130
the urban demographic.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.560
And so I want at least
50,000 votes there.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.650
And I need to spend
the money corresponding

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.520
to the values of x1
through x4 in such a way

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.946
that I get those 50,000 votes.

00:12:33.946 --> 00:12:35.570
And that represents
that, and it's just

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:42.210
reading off the minus 2, 8, 0,
and 10 from the urban column.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.210
So those numbers that you see
here correspond to the column,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.350
because I'm talking about
the urban demographic.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.550
And you can imagine
that the next constraint

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.610
is going to correspond to the
middle column, and the third

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.180
to the third.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.870
So I'll just write that out.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.120
I will call this constraint
the constraint number

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:08.162
1-- I might refer to it
later-- 5x1, plus 2x2 plus 0x3,

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:13.340
plus 0x4 greater than
or equal to 100,000.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.610
Call this number two.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:22.620
And then finally, 3x1
minus 5x2 plus 10x3.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:35.310
And that's our set
of constraints,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.290
but there's one
more little issue

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.700
that we have to be careful
about, if you're being precise,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:50.890
and that is that there's no
notion of un-advertising.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:56.940
And so you're going to
spend positive dollars.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:01.260
And so x1 through x4 is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.720
So that's our first
linear program.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.220
And it came from this
particular problem.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.210
It'd be wonderful--
and that's exactly what

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.860
we're going to do for
the rest of the lecture--

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.710
if we could solve
this linear program

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:20.010
and any possible linear
program in an efficient way.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.550
And so the number of
variables is small n.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.710
And you can imagine that the
number of constraints here,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.586
just talking about these
constraints, are m constraints.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:47.440
And you certainly want at run
time that is polynomial in n.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.740
That's our goal here.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.170
And as I mentioned
early on, it was unclear

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.889
for the longest time-- well,
at least not until 1979,

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:57.430
but people had been
thinking about it

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.320
for a long time before
that-- as to whether there

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.320
was a general algorithm that
would solve any linear program

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.266
in time-polynomial in n.

00:15:06.266 --> 00:15:09.820
And that was resolved
in '79 by Khachiyan.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.760
We'll look at a algorithm as
simplex that in the worst case

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.300
runs exponentially in n
but is simpler to describe

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.470
and is very efficient
in practice.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:29.616
So in our particular problem,
this one, it turns out you--

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:31.990
and I'm actually going to come
back to this in a second--

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:39.420
but I will just tell
you that the optimum

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.950
for this particular
linear program

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:49.170
with these particular numbers
correspond to these numbers

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:49.840
here.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:56.602
So you want to spend something
of the order of $20,000

00:15:56.602 --> 00:16:01.780
for-- so there's 100
here, so take away the two

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.530
0's-- so spend something of the
order of $20,000 for the first

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.040
issue, building roads, spend
a bit of money for the second

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.020
issue, ignore the third
corresponding to farm

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:23.500
subsidies, and spend a bit
of money for the gasoline tax

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.700
issue.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.870
And these numbers aren't
important, other than the fact

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.190
that they happen to be optimum.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:40.070
So if you add up these numbers,
then x1 plus x2 plus x3 plus x4

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:45.110
is something of the
order of $21,000--

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.310
$27,000, excuse me,
though I'm writing it out

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.890
as this fraction.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:57.580
So important consideration
here is that these values xi

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.330
are real numbers.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.640
That's it.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.224
It's not that they
have to be integral.

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:07.640
Clearly, there
were fractions here

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.710
for the optimum,
some of them anyway.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.640
But in general,
linear programming

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.440
says the variable
values are real.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.609
There's also integer
linear programming,

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.829
which is NP complete, which
adds the additional constraint

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:26.180
that the xi values are integral.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.620
So it turns into
a harder problem.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.700
You got polynomial-time
solvable if the xi are real.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.520
You got NP complete,
which Eric is

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:40.570
going to talk about on
Thursday, if the values are

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:41.690
forced to be integral.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.560
So this extra constraint makes
things worse from a complexity

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.700
standpoint.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.730
We won't talk about ILP anymore
for the rest of this lecture.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.430
So I will come back to this.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.160
And I'll talk about
how we can show

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.460
that this is optimum
without actually going

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.370
into a deep algorithmic dive.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.090
But what I want to
do just before that

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.500
is to give you the
general formulation

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.130
of a linear program.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:16.290
It's called the standard
form in CLRS, also called

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.220
the general form.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:30.380
In some cases, we'll look
at the standard form for LP.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.770
And I want to pop up a
level about this example

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.850
and give you the
general setting.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.580
And we'll focus in on the
general setting for the most

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.930
part.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.160
But what I have here is
I can either minimize

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.620
or maximize-- we
had a minimization

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:56.480
problem-- for the
political problem,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.390
minimize the linear
objective function

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:12.395
subject to linear
inequalities or equations.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:24.260
And the variables,
think of x as a vector,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.400
it's a column vector, or
x1, x2, all the way to xn.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:55.980
And the objective function is
c times x, so that's c1x1 dot,

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.760
dot, dot, cnxn.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.860
And we just had all the
coefficients being a 1

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.950
over there.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:12.260
And the inequalities,
they're the fun part,

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.580
you can represent
them as a matrix A,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:20.090
so A times x less
than or equal to b.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.590
And notice that this
is the standard form

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.660
that I'm talking about.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.805
And now, I have
diverged from what

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:28.180
I had here, because
I had greater

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.140
than or equal to over here.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.520
So it turns out, you'll
see linear programs

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.880
in different settings.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.380
Sometimes, you'll
have minimization.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.340
Sometimes, you'll
have maximization.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.364
Sometimes, you'll have
less than constraints,

00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:41.780
less than or equal
to constraints.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.970
Sometimes, you'll have greater
than or equal to constraints.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.940
Sometimes, you'll have
equality constraints.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.730
We'll spend a little
bit of time talking

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.000
about how you can transform
any given linear program

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.860
into a standard form.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:01.040
So our standard form is going
to be something that maximizes

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.100
the objective function.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.530
So these are our
inequalities, and they're

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.900
represented as less
than or equal to.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.880
That's the standard form.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:19.330
And you want to maximize
c times x-- again,

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:25.960
max for standard-- such that
these set of inequalities

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:33.160
told Ax less than or equal
to b and x greater than

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.510
or equal to 0.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:40.320
So for each of the values that
correspond to the variables,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.160
you want these variables
to be non-negative

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.900
in the standard form.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.410
And you want less than
or equal to corresponding

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.280
to each of the
inequalities-- not equal to,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:52.700
not greater than or equal to,
but less than or equal to.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.690
And you have this
linear cost function,

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.070
where you could have
arbitrary coefficients,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.950
but you're maximizing it.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.030
So that's it.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.136
So it's all about polarities,
not much more than that.

00:22:04.136 --> 00:22:05.260
It's just about polarities.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:11.030
And if you get a linear program,
a specific linear program that

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.120
doesn't conform to this-- we'll
spend a few minutes talking

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.730
about conversions--
and it's going

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.780
to be fairly straightforward.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.530
May not be immediately
obvious, but we'll get to that.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.420
Any questions so far?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:34.460
So I want to go
back to this claim

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.380
here, where I said
this is optimum.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:44.520
Now without actually
describing an algorithm to you,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.850
I'm going to be able
to show you, convince

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.690
you, that this value
here corresponding

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.510
to whatever it is, 3
million, 3.1 million,

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.470
is in fact optimum.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.840
And this is
something I could do,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:06.780
because linear programming
has this powerful notion

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.080
of duality.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.450
So what is that?

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:16.010
Well, let's just first look
at our specific example here.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.370
And I'll give you a very
specific observation.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.170
I'm going to give
you what you can

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:26.555
think of as a certificate
of optimality.

00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.470
I'm going to give you a
certificate of optimality

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.840
for that set of numbers.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.860
And here's how I'm
going to do it.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.800
So is there a short certificate?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.570
I can imagine giving
you a long proof

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.660
that a particular linear
programming algorithm always

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.370
gives you the minimum
answer, the optimum answer,

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.020
walk through that,
executive that algorithm

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.210
on this particular
example, and then you're

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:07.480
convinced, of course,
that the solution is

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.590
going to be optimum.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.110
But for this specific example, I
want to give you a certificate.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.450
This certificate isn't going
to work for other examples.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.520
It's going to short, because it
only works with this example.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.010
But it won't work
for other ones.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.231
And so how do I do that?

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.250
So the answer is,
in fact, there is

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:33.990
a certificate that shows that
the LP solution is optimal.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:49.230
And consider that I compute this
particular algebraic quantity,

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:59.960
where all I've done is I've
taken these three equations

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:06.620
and I've multiplied them
by these magical constants.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.970
And so I'm not going
to tell you how we get

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.940
this certificate of optimality.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.900
But I'm going to give
you the certificate.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.400
And it's going to
be clear that it's

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.150
a certificate of optimality.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.030
And if I take these three
equations here, 1, 2, and 3--

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:25.880
actually, I refer to 1, 2, and
3, they refer to the equations.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.850
These are equations
or constraints.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:30.890
And so I take that.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.600
And obviously, if I have
a bunch of equations

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.430
and I multiply them out, I
can certainly add them up,

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.040
and I get another
equation at the end of it.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.600
And it's all going to be linear.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.220
And if I do that,
I get x1 plus x2

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:53.110
plus 140 divided by
222 times x3 plus x4.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.550
So that's what happens
to the left hand side.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.830
And the right hand
side is-- you'll

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:07.760
recognize this quantity--
five 0's divided by 111.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.010
That's what you get.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.590
So now, can someone tell me
why in the last step, why

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.940
this is a certificate
of optimality--

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.690
the fact that obviously, this
is all algebra, once I've

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:23.330
discovered the coefficients--
so now that I've done this,

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:29.690
why have I just shown you that
3.1 million divided by 111

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:30.869
is, in fact, optimum?

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:31.910
Can someone tell me this?

00:26:35.007 --> 00:26:36.840
Look at what you have
on the left hand side.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.340
No?

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.840
Yeah.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.090
AUDIENCE: Any other
solution would cost more

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.840
than the amount put in spent.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.480
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Any other solution,

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.500
but I want you to relate
that to-- what am I spending?

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.860
AUDIENCE: You're
spending 3,100,000--

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.270
like, it's the same thing.

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.140
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah, but
I mean, this was a claim.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.500
This was a claim-- and at
this point, an unproven claim.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:12.025
It was an unproven claim.

00:27:12.025 --> 00:27:12.650
Yeah, go ahead.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.191
AUDIENCE: You know that the left
hand side of that inequality

00:27:15.191 --> 00:27:18.227
is less than or equal to
x1 plus x2 plus x3 plus x4.

00:27:18.227 --> 00:27:19.310
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Correct.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.160
And what is x1 plus x2 plus
x3 plus x4, to be clear?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.770
AUDIENCE: The thing
you're trying to minimize?

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.650
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah,
exactly, the thing

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:26.900
you're trying to minimize.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.630
Exactly.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.530
You're almost there.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:37.550
but the key observation here is
that x1 plus x2 plus x3 plus x4

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.460
is greater than or equal to x1
plus x2-- because all of these

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.140
are positive quantities,
remember-- 140 divided by 222,

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.940
that's less than 1,
x3 plus x4, correct?

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:56.770
So given that, I can say that
this is greater than our equal

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:02.550
to 3,100,000 111.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.820
It's because of this
observation that it's

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.760
a certificate of optimality.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.955
She has her head down, OK.

00:28:14.955 --> 00:28:16.600
Great.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:22.420
So that's pretty cool.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.070
Just cooked up these
coefficients from somewhere,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.110
pulled them out of
a hat, you're all

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.920
convinced now that the
value we got was optimum.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.090
Did not run an algorithm.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.800
Maybe I ran an
algorithm-- of course,

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.260
you ran an algorithm to get
those coefficients, right?

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.340
Well, how did those
coefficients appear?

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.700
So we're not going to spend
a whole lot of time on this.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:51.340
You'll see this
likely in a problem

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.160
set or perhaps in section.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.050
But in general, I won't
worry too much about duality,

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:01.980
other than knowing the concept.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.640
And this notion of LP
duality essentially

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.970
says that what just happened
wasn't a coincidence.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.130
You can do this all the time.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.060
There will always be,
for a linear program,

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.500
a short certificate
of optimality

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.280
that corresponds to
some set of coefficients

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.160
that you can do this
particular math with by taking

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.150
these linear constraints,
multiplying them out, adding

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:32.030
them up together, and showing
that you have a lower bound

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:39.410
on-- in the case of this
problem-- you can't get lower

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.470
than this.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.740
And therefore, for a
minimization problem,

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.580
when you reach that, you
clearly found the optimum.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:49.280
And that's the
notion of LP duality.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:54.800
And the basic theorem-- and
this is really more as an FYI,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.570
we won't prove this
theorem-- is that if you

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:01.160
had the standard form for the
LP, which I'm just writing down

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:09.090
again here, where you had
Ax less than b, x vector

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.250
greater than or equal to 0.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:14.710
So that's identically what
I had up here, or done here,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.310
corresponding to the
standard LP form.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.110
Well, there's a dual-- this is
what's called the primal form.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:28.280
Usually, if you
don't say it, you

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.610
think of it as the primal form.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.050
And if it's dual,
you call it a dual.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.210
And this is primal form of LP.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.890
This is a dual form
of LP, or dual LP.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.920
And the dual LP
flips everything.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.000
And it's not just
negation, but transposed,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.230
and the actual variables
also swap functionalities.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.680
So it's really pretty cool.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.970
So your max turns into a min.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.650
The c gets replaced by the
b, which is on the right hand

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.400
side of the inequalities.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.870
And your constraints
are A transpose,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.290
y greater than or equal to c.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.210
So there's a flip there as well.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:13.290
And y is greater
than or equal to 0.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:16.790
So there's a bunch of
things that's going on here.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:23.700
And these two problems
end up being equivalent--

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.990
the primal and the dual,
you can always do this.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.910
And essentially, what
is happening here

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:39.422
is that you're solving these
two problems simultaneously.

00:31:39.422 --> 00:31:40.880
And there's lots
of algorithms that

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.520
keep flipping between these
two forms for efficiency.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.890
But ultimately, what
ends up happening is

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:52.190
you see that the actual
constraints that you had here

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:56.610
corresponding to the b
constraints turn into-- the b

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.400
ends up in the
cost function here.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.400
And that's essentially
what's happening out here

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.460
with respect to multiplying
these equations out

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.800
with particular coefficients.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.830
So as I said, this is
really more as an FYI.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.220
This is an obviously interesting
and an interesting proof

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.950
of optimality, which is
a different kind of proof

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.260
from proving an
algorithm correct

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.649
and applying that proof
to a particular instance.

00:32:25.649 --> 00:32:27.190
That's the kind of
thing that happens

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.880
in LP, especially when you flip
from primal and dual forms.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:35.490
So I'll leave it at that.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.230
What I'd like to do
is give you a sense

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:44.470
of how we can convert
to standard form,

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:50.760
so you can apply an algorithm
that-- for example, you

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.060
have a program and it only
requires standard form.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.767
It runs on standard form.

00:32:54.767 --> 00:32:56.100
Let's go over it really quickly.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.160
This is not going to take
very long-- a translation

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.450
from different kinds of LPs--
and we had a slightly different

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:08.940
here for our political problem
that had a minimization--

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.660
and how would we convert
that to standard form.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:27.090
So it's probably just one
conversion here that's tricky.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:36.097
So suppose I want to
minimize minus 2x1 plus 3x2,

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:37.930
and I want to convert
it to standard formal.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.720
All I have is a
standard LP solver.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.290
What do I do?

00:33:43.846 --> 00:33:46.490
It should be easy.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.440
What do I do if I had a
solver that was maximizing,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.410
but I want to
minimize a quantity?

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.840
Just switch the signs, right?

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:04.710
So negate to 2x1 minus
3x2 and maximize.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.110
So that was easy.

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.370
This is a tricky one.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:29.050
Suppose xj does not have a
non-negativity constraint.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:32.620
So it just happens to be the
case that it's not dollars

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:37.620
but it's some other quantity
that can go negative.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.880
It might be profit or loss.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.820
So that quantity
represents profit and loss,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.300
so it could go
negative if it's loss.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.250
So I don't have this constraint
in my original problem

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.800
specification.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.980
But my standard form
and my LP solver

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:59.560
requires this entire
vector to be non-negative.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.380
So I got a problem here.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.020
I can't use my standard
solver, because

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.320
of this non-negativity
constraint.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.490
So how do I fix that?

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:14.840
How do I turn it into a problem
that allows the standard solver

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.655
to be used?

00:35:16.655 --> 00:35:17.280
Yeah, go ahead.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.710
AUDIENCE: You can break
it up into two variables,

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:25.542
like xj1 and xj2, so
xj1 minus xj2 equals xj,

00:35:25.542 --> 00:35:26.876
and both could have [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:26.876 --> 00:35:28.792
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Perfect,
great, that's good.

00:35:28.792 --> 00:35:29.350
Here you go.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:39.400
So what you do here is take
xj and replace it with,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.520
let's say, xj prime
minus xj double prime.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.660
And you have xj prime
greater than or equal to 0,

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.300
xj double prime greater
than or equal to 0.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.720
But depending on the
particular values

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.340
in whatever solution
you're exploring

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.340
are the final solution, you
may have an actual xj value

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.290
that's negative or positive.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:07.060
So you added an extra variable
here to your linear program.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:13.570
And a couple more
real quick, suppose

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:19.560
that I have an equality
constraint corresponding

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.150
to x1 plus x2 equals 7.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.980
What do I do with an
equality constraint

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.190
where I have x1
plus x2 equals 7?

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.860
Yeah, go ahead.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:35.770
AUDIENCE: You can say x1 plus x2
is greater than or equal to 7,

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.135
and x1 plus x2 is less
than or equal to 7.

00:36:38.135 --> 00:36:40.510
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: No, you
can't do less than or equal to.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.427
AUDIENCE: But then you
can flip the signs to--

00:36:42.427 --> 00:36:44.593
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Ah, then
you could flip the signs.

00:36:44.593 --> 00:36:46.350
So you have two
steps there, good.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.710
So your less than or equal
to needs another multiplier.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:55.410
So what you end up doing is
something like x1 plus x2

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:57.110
greater than or equal to 7.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:37:01.610
And then you need-- if you
do what the gentleman just

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:10.600
said-- and flip the sign,
you get minus x1 minus x2

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.995
greater than or
equal to minus 7.

00:37:17.077 --> 00:37:17.660
Is that right?

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.000
No?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.570
I messed up?

00:37:22.216 --> 00:37:23.590
Oh, I want less
than or equal to.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.830
You're right, you're right.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:28.380
So I need less than or equal
to-- that's right, of course,

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.820
thank you.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:32.570
So I need less than or
equal to in both places.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.750
So that's the standard form.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.210
I needed less than or equal to.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:42.710
Good.

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.920
What you've done is increased
the number of constraints

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.760
by one.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.453
Did I get this right
the second time?

00:37:51.453 --> 00:37:52.440
All right.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.572
So that's pretty much it.

00:37:53.572 --> 00:37:55.530
The last thing, which I
won't really write out,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.130
is, which we've done here
already, greater than

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:05.150
or equal to constraint
translated-- I won't give you

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.580
an example of this;
we have this already--

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:12.540
translates to less than or
equal to by minus 1 multiplied.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.060
So we have to
invoke that in order

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.670
to do the equality anyway.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.800
So you're in business.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.960
If you have a
standard LP solver,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.190
you can take pretty much any
optimization problem that

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.680
is linear in terms of
its objective function

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:34.340
and has linear constraints, and
you can transform it into LP.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.940
If you had non-linear
constraints,

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.900
there's lots of
work that goes on

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:43.240
in linearizing those constraints
and using LP solvers.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.990
It's a very practical
thing to do.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.210
It may be something you'll
end up doing, invoking

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.030
these powerful LP solvers--
typically, they're commercially

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.090
available; the best
ones are commercial--

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.600
and use it to solve
your particular problem.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:01.640
It turns your algorithm design
problem into a reduction.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.590
And so you'll spend really
the next couple of weeks

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.900
thinking about reductions.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.710
We'll start that
up right now, where

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.070
we'll take existing
combinatorial

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.810
problems, for which we
already know algorithms for,

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.550
and you're going to
reduce them to LP.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.910
Just to give you a sense
of what the power of LP

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:24.530
is, but this notion of
reduction is very powerful,

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.380
you can use it to do
complexity proofs.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.880
Here, we're just using it as a
convenience in today's lecture

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.640
to use our LP hammer.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:39.360
So let's say that I have
our favorite problem

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.670
of the week, namely max flow.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.590
And I want to
convert that to LP.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:51.970
So go back a week ago, and right
about this time a week ago,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.050
and we'd set up the
max flow problem.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.690
And let's assume that
we went back there.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.640
And we didn't talk
about augmenting paths,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.310
and we didn't talk about
residual capacities or min-cut

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:06.120
or anything like that,
but we knew LP already.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.950
And we just want to
solve max flow using LP.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:10.710
So let's do that.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.410
So this is maximum flow.

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:35.450
I'm not going to bother with
converting to standard form.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.640
We know how to do that,
given what we just

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.440
did here, over there.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.990
So I'll just do whatever I
want to keep things simple.

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.160
Max flow is obviously
a maximization problem.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:55.150
And using the same
notation we've used,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:58.100
it's not going to
look like Ax and b,

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:02.884
just because I want you to
recall what max flow is.

00:41:02.884 --> 00:41:04.300
And we're going
to translate that.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.758
And the values of
these variables--

00:41:05.758 --> 00:41:08.560
or the names of these variables,
whether they're x or f,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.070
it should really matter.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:14.020
We know how to do LP
at this point-- we

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.430
know how to formulate LP, I
should say, at this point.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.500
And we're assuming that
we have an LP solver.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.630
So what I want to do here
with the maximum flow problem

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.850
is maximizing the flow value.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:29.130
And it's simply,
you grab the source,

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:34.480
you have a variable associated
with the flow from the source

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.320
to every other vertex of v.
And you have to maximize that.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.000
So that was the
setup for max flow.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.240
I'm not changing that.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.960
What do you think the three
constraints, or whatever

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.730
set of constraints
that we have here,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.870
are going to
correspond to the LP?

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.650
You spent a week
on max flow, looked

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:55.410
at the problem set,
what constraints am I

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.660
going to have to put up there?

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.060
I'm going to have to put
up capacity constraints.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.240
That's an obvious one.

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.380
What is another one?

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.810
Conservation constraints.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:13.360
All flow entering a node that
is not the source or the sink

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.210
has to leave it.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.140
In the original
network, is there

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.920
a concept of negative flow?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.350
No, you will define it going
in the other direction.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.880
So we did talk about
negative numbers, et cetera,

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.260
but you're going to have
positive quantities, especially

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:39.000
if you look at net flow,
the version of the flow

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.340
that we zoomed in on in the
Tuesday lecture from last week.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.579
And you also have-- in
the general setting,

00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:51.120
you're going to have these skew
symmetry constraints as well.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.530
So the three things
that you need here

00:42:53.530 --> 00:43:03.125
are skew symmetry,
conservation, and capacity.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:18.332
So you have such that f u, v
equals minus f v, u for all u,

00:43:18.332 --> 00:43:21.040
v belonging to V.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.120
And depending on the kind
of network that you have,

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:27.270
if you constrain
it to a sudden type

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.960
that you don't have
these two-way edges,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.000
you could certainly
remove some, if not all,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.370
of these skew
symmetry constraints.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.730
Important ones are
conservation and capacity.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.780
And this should seem
pretty familiar to you.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.500
But the key-- the reason
I'm writing these all out

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.020
is primarily to ensure that you
understand that these are all

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.030
linear constraints.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.660
So that's pretty
much the only thing

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:55.132
that you need to observe here.

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.590
Obviously, these
constraints you've

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:01.530
seen many a time from the
two lectures last week.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.690
But notice that
they're all linear.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.900
And finally, this one is f u,
v less than or equal to c of u,

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:18.300
v for all u, v
belonging to cap V.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.050
So this is f.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.760
That's a variable that's
less than another constant,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.280
clearly linear.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.460
Doing a bunch of sums here.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.050
I could obviously have
multipliers, scalar

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:29.966
multipliers.

00:44:29.966 --> 00:44:31.340
In this case, for
conservation, I

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:35.240
don't have scalar multipliers,
but clearly linear.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.510
Skew symmetry, got
two variables in here.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.140
One of them is a negation of
the other, clearly linear,

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.820
so that's why this is an LP.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.480
And so you might say,
well, I know better,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.250
max flow is much more
efficient than any LP

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.550
solver that's out there.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:52.360
And you would be right.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:56.250
If you have a max flow
problem of this variety,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.560
it's difficult to
imagine that you

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.540
would get performance, empirical
performance from running an LP

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:03.500
solver.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:10.220
But this generalization
of max flow

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.000
that's a multi-commodity max
flow, where you just don't have

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.190
one commodity flowing through.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.680
You may be counting cars
and trucks on a road,

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.740
or there's two different
kinds of liquid

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:28.730
flowing through the same
pipe, whatever, gas or liquid.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.230
And so when you have
multiple commodities,

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:36.210
you may have a linear but
more complicated cost function

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.957
that's a function of the flow
of each of the commodities.

00:45:39.957 --> 00:45:42.290
And they may have a certain
weight associated with them.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:45.250
So there's a lot of
things that could

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:51.170
be more general-- there could
be more general settings

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:52.520
corresponding to max flow.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:57.550
And I'll just leave
you with the thought

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.210
that you could simply
have two commodities.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.010
And we'll just
call them 1 and 2.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.730
And so now, you have the f1's
and the c1's and the f2's and

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.750
the c2's.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:19.540
Each commodity has
to be conserved.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.277
But what about the capacity?

00:46:21.277 --> 00:46:23.110
What do you think happens
with the capacity?

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:27.170
Let's just assume these are
two different kinds of cars.

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.699
So what would the capacity
constraint look like?

00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:34.200
Yeah.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.829
AUDIENCE: You can
say either c1 or f1

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:43.022
plus f2 is-- for each edge,
you can add them together

00:46:43.022 --> 00:46:44.730
or you might take the
linear [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.396
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Exactly, that's right.

00:46:46.396 --> 00:46:47.890
So good point.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:51.790
It may be the case that I
have distinct capacities.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.720
And in fact, if you have
completely disjoint problems,

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.110
you're right in that you
can solve them separately.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.790
But actually, the
more interesting case

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:05.560
would be that you have
a single capacity c,

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.610
so you'll have-- let me
just write this out here.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.420
If in fact you had
two distinct things,

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.870
so if you had f1, c1,
f1, c2, the question

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:27.890
is, do you have two distinct,
disjoint optimizations,

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.920
in which case you just
use max flow twice.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.380
On other hand, what's
more interesting really--

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.140
and I should've used this
example for starters--

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.580
but here's a better one.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.930
You have two commodities
and a single capacity.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.870
So the road is a good example.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:48.650
Both the cars and the
trucks share the same road.

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:49.990
It has a certain capacity.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:52.480
And now, your
capacity constraint

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.390
is looking like f1
plus f2 over here.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:04.440
And that's the flow through
the particular edge uv.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.380
So you have something
like f1 u, v plus f2 u,

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:11.365
v is less than or equal to c
u, v for this total capacity.

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.560
And that's pretty much it.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.900
So that is linear.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.440
The nice thing is
that it's linear.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.350
You could put weights on it.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:28.280
If you wanted to claim
that a particular commodity

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.590
1 uses up-- because
it's a truck,

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:33.630
it uses up more
space on the road.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.530
And you can accommodate
fewer of them.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.120
You could put a
multiplier in there.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.160
Still say it's linear.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.740
So that's the power of
by having an LP engine.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.480
You could translate
problems that

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.670
are not exactly max flow,
that are multi-commodity flow.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.120
You may have additional linear
constraints that you could add,

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:54.650
and you could still
use your LP package.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:59.290
So that's the reason why this
is interesting and powerful.

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:04.530
So that is kind of an obvious,
corresponding to max flow.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:08.380
Let's look at something
that's a little less obvious.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.690
And it's going to be a little
tricky to convert the shortest

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:22.400
path problem to LP,
not a lot of work

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.624
but one little
observation that's

00:49:25.624 --> 00:49:28.040
going to be important to make
in order for the whole thing

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.472
to flow through or
actually work out.

00:49:32.472 --> 00:49:34.180
So we all know the
shortest path problem.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.684
We want to find-- let's just
call it the single source

00:49:41.684 --> 00:49:42.600
shortest path problem.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.050
You have a specific source.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.510
That's going to turn into
the point from which you're

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.210
going to start
computing the distance.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.900
That's what Dijkstra does,
and that's Bellman-Ford does.

00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:02.930
And so this is from vertex
x-- s, excuse me, s.

00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:07.320
And what I want to do here
is obviously set it up

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.440
as a set of linear constraints.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:23.980
If I have dv corresponding to
the distance from the source--

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.050
so dv represents the
distance from the source--

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.030
and eventually I want
dv to be the shortest

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.900
distance from the source.

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.260
That's our notation
for shortest paths.

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:40.510
dv represents an existing
path-- it may not

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.580
be the shortest path-- from
s to v, the value of that.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:51.800
But dv monotonically
decreases as you run through.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.160
It's initially
infinity in Dijkstra

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.690
going back to Dijkstra.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:59.740
And then we shrink it through
a process of relaxation.

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.650
Now I want to try and model
that-- I want to try and model

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:05.170
all of this as an LP.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:07.400
So it's not
immediately obvious--

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.820
the thing that the
flow networks had,

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.620
where we had these constraints.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:14.640
We have capacity constraints
and conservation constraints.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.680
And we could turn that
constraint into an inequality.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.600
And it was pretty smooth.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.030
It's pretty easy.

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:26.100
So what I need to do
here with shortest paths

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:30.630
is something that's
a little more subtle.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:36.070
So what basic constraint do
I have in a shortest path

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.770
algorithm?

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:41.970
What's an inequality--
you remember an inequality

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:45.070
from shortest paths that
we kept talking about?

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:46.980
The triangle inequality.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.890
So we're going to have to go
with the triangle inequality

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.870
and take the triangle inequality
and use that to create an LP

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.410
formulation of shortest paths.

00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.500
In particular, what
we have here is

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:05.180
that I could write
dv minus du is

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:13.660
less than or equal to w u, v
for all u, v belonging to E.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.810
And that's the
triangle inequality.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:23.094
And I'm going to
have d of s equals 0.

00:52:23.094 --> 00:52:24.760
That's the only thing
that I start with.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:30.020
And so what's happening
out here is simply

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.340
that there's different
ways of getting

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:37.820
to v. And my shortest path
is going to be the best

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.760
way of getting to
v. So in particular,

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.252
the way you want to think about
this is that if I have a v

00:52:44.252 --> 00:52:51.380
and I can get to it from,
let's just say, u1 and u2.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.360
And maybe the
source is over here.

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.300
And these are the only two
edges that can get to v.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.270
So I'm just looking at a
fairly limited setting.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:03.030
u1 and u2 are going to have
to be the two vertices.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.130
One of these two is
going to get me to v.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:12.530
And I got w u1, v here.

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:18.290
And I got w u2, v over here.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.340
And so what this
is saying is, I'm

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:23.770
going to have to write this
out for each of these edges.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:29.230
For each of these edges, I'm
going to have this constraint.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:33.050
And that's says that the dv
value, if I want the shortest

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:38.310
path, should obey both
of these constraints.

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:40.830
And if I want to obey both of
these constraints, one of them

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:43.030
is going to be my
limiting constraint.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:45.790
And I'm going to get
the min of those two.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.450
Correct?

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.260
So in effect what
this translates to

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.950
is that it's an AND, right?

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:57.550
So dv have minus du1 is
less than or equal to w u1,

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:06.920
v. dv minus du2 is less than
or equal to w u2, v. That's

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.760
an AND, because I'm putting both
of those constraints in here.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.140
And that essentially
means that dv

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:23.190
is going to be the min
of the two quantities--

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:27.500
the du1 quantity
plus the w u1, v,

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:33.460
and the du2 quantity plus
the w u2, v. That make sense?

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:37.577
Ask me questions
if this is unclear.

00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:39.160
So that simply
corresponds to the fact

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.630
that I'm doing an AND over here.

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:42.620
I'm adding all of these
constraints in there.

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:47.310
So I'm applying the triangle
inequality to every edge,

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:53.730
to every relationship
between a vertex that

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.880
has a path ending at it.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.780
And you're pushing it
forward to this vertex v,

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:01.880
all the different ways that
you can get to v. In this case,

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.510
there is two sets of ways--
one from u1 and one from u2.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:10.820
And the last step is
a minimization step.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.820
So you think you're
done or we're done,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.130
but we're not quite
done, because what's

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:20.167
missing here in terms
of my formulation of LP?

00:55:20.167 --> 00:55:21.458
What else do I have to do here?

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:30.154
Well, sure, non-negative--
let's do that.

00:55:30.154 --> 00:55:30.653
Sorry?

00:55:30.653 --> 00:55:31.486
AUDIENCE: Objective.

00:55:31.486 --> 00:55:35.390
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Objective,
who said objective?

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.930
You again?

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:42.210
So we are missing an
objective function.

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:46.310
Now shortest path is what
kind of problem again?

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:50.050
Short means minimum?

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:52.540
Minimum, height whatever.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:56.240
So do I put a-- what happens
if I put a minimum in here?

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.070
And let's say that I
do something like sigma

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:04.470
over V, cap V, dv, because
I want to minimize--

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.010
or I could pick
a particular one.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:10.010
I could pick a particular single
source, single destination,

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:14.340
and I put a minimum there.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.900
What happens?

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.230
Does this work?

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.730
What's the solution
to this problem,

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:23.510
if I minimize the distance?

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:28.170
0, because the zero
value is going to work.

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:31.990
So there's something-- I
haven't put in the constraint

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.810
that I do want a path.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:40.940
I do want a path from
s to v for any v that

00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:46.700
matches one of the
quantities in the min,

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:49.920
because the min says
I have equality.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.810
The big issue here is, this
is a less than or equal to,

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:57.620
and that's why the min doesn't
work in the objective function.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:59.060
It's a less than or equal to.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:02.410
But this min over here, which
is the definition of a shortest

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:06.660
path, is saying that it's
either equal to this quantity

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.390
or equal to that quantity.

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:12.610
There's an equality over here
that is missing from this side.

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:14.450
And that's the key observation.

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:16.810
Once you observe that,
that need equality

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:21.850
for one of these constituent
quantities of the min,

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.930
then you'll see that
what you have to do

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:28.396
is simply change
this min to a max.

00:57:30.834 --> 00:57:32.250
So you say, well,
how the heck did

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:34.240
a min get changed into a max?

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.125
And I'm not sure I'm going
to convince every on of you

00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:39.050
in the next minute or so.

00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:42.360
But the bottom line
is, it comes down

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:47.930
to I do have a min already
in my inequalities,

00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:50.520
because I'm ANDing each
of these inequalities,

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:53.220
and I'm putting down each of
those inequalities in there.

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.020
So each of them is going to
force me to find the best

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.220
solution, because they're
going to constrain me to not

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:03.790
go via u2 if u1 is better,
because the other constraint

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:06.857
corresponding to u1 is
going to force me down.

00:58:06.857 --> 00:58:08.440
So there's an
additional min in there,

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.170
because the ANDing of the
less than or equal tos.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:16.780
And then in order to actually
force the equality for one

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.715
of those, I need to push
up as hard as I can,

00:58:19.715 --> 00:58:21.830
or as high as I can.

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:23.360
So think about it.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.880
Play around with a
couple of examples.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.130
Choose a simple
example for starters.

00:58:30.130 --> 00:58:34.210
And you'll see that this
is the correct formulation.

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:39.470
So you can see that it's not
completely clear in some cases

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.580
how to transform problems to LP.

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.230
But even in those cases,
sometimes you can.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:48.110
So there's just a ton
of different problems,

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:53.340
a good skill to have
to be able to take

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.390
combinatorial
optimization engines,

00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:58.840
like LP or even max flow, and
be able to translate problems

00:58:58.840 --> 00:58:59.362
to them.

00:58:59.362 --> 00:59:00.820
It's something that
you'll probably

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:04.970
do if you stick to
algorithms in your careers

00:59:04.970 --> 00:59:11.830
or exploiting available
algorithm packages.

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:17.650
So the last thing I want to do
here for the rest of the time

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:24.920
is to give you some sense for
how an LP program is actually

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.550
optimized.

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:30.370
How can you possibly take
the standard LP formulation,

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:31.720
which is a general setting.

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.730
You know nothing
about shortest paths,

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:36.260
let's assume, nothing
about max flow.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:37.950
It's not about a
specific problem.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.360
It's about the general setting.

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:41.216
How can we solve
the general setting,

00:59:41.216 --> 00:59:42.840
because that was the
theme here anyway.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.650
You had this engine, and
you want to use this engine.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.780
But now, how do you
build this engine?

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:54.000
So what we're going to do is
look at a fairly simple example

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.520
of the simplex algorithm.

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:01.260
And this algorithm
is in the textbook.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.700
And it'll be in my notes.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.930
So I'll get as far as I can.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:07.840
It's not that complicated
to describe, especially

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.530
from an example standpoint.

01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:14.660
But I may not get
through all of the steps

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.580
to get you the optimum for
this particular example

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.260
given how much time we have.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:26.420
The most important
concept in simplex

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:31.020
is yet another form
of representation

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:36.350
for simplex, which says that
you can represent the LP, not

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:39.990
in standard form,
but in slack form.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.292
So I'm going to tell
you what slack form is.

01:00:42.292 --> 01:00:43.750
And then what we're
going to do is,

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:48.110
the flow of simplex,
algorithmic flow,

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:56.360
is to convert one slack
form into and equivalent.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:01.000
Obviously, you don't want to
do something that's incorrect,

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.770
but it has to be
an equivalent slack

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:22.715
form, whose objective value has
not decreased and has likely

01:01:22.715 --> 01:01:23.215
increased.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.890
So you're guaranteed that
the objective value has not

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.390
decreased.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.890
You're not guaranteed
that it's increased.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:43.510
And then we're going to keep
going till the optimal solution

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.030
becomes obvious.

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.994
And you might say,
how is this obvious?

01:01:49.994 --> 01:01:52.410
That's the reason why I talked
about the short certificate

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:53.730
of optimality.

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:58.750
It's definitely a relationship
between the termination

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:01.610
of simplex and the fact
that you can now say,

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:04.930
hey, I know I'm done
here, it's kind of obvious

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.590
that I can't do any better.

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.090
And hopefully, you'll see that
by the end of this lecture

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:11.790
in this simple example.

01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:12.490
So that's it.

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.040
It's an iterative algorithm.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.330
It's exponential,
unfortunately, because this

01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:24.460
takes m plus n, choose n
iterations in the worst case,

01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.280
where n is the
number of variables

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.080
and m is the number
of constraints.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.160
Most of the time, it
does a lot better,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.590
but that's the only bound
that you can actually

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.290
prove in the worst case.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:40.490
And so you're stuck with
an exponential algorithm

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.500
if you're using
simplex worst case.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.350
We won't actually do
much analysis on simplex.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.290
It's really out of scope for
046 in terms of the analysis.

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:53.390
The actual algorithm is
certainly within scope.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.550
So what I want to do is
give you some sense for what

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:58.002
the slack form looks like.

01:02:58.002 --> 01:02:59.960
And we'll do a couple of
iterations of simplex.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:04.786
And we'll get as far as we can
before the end the lecture.

01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:06.160
So we'll take a
different example

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:12.340
from our political example.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.430
It's similar in size.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:20.370
And I want to explain to
you what the slack form is

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.720
and why it's interesting.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:35.510
So what I want to do is maximize
3x1 plus x2 plus x3 subject

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:40.920
to the constraints that
x1 plus x2 plus 3x2

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.800
is less than or equal to
30, 2x1 plus 2x2 plus 5x3 is

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:55.250
less than or equal to 24,
4x1 plus x2 plus 2x3 less

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:59.900
than or equal to 36, and then
non-negativity constraints,

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.200
x1, x2, x3 greater
than or equal to 0.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.792
So that's our example problem.

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:06.750
I'll leave it up there.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:12.070
You're going to convert
this to slack form.

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:13.960
And so what is the slack form?

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:19.130
We're going to introduce an
additional number of variables

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:22.230
that correspond to the number
of equations that we have.

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:25.040
So we're going to introduce,
in this case, three new labels,

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.640
because I have three equations.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:33.300
And the slack for this
problem looks like this.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:39.480
I'm going to have z
equals 3x1 plus x2

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.470
plus x3, same as before.

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:44.920
And then I'm going
to have variables

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.000
that represent-- these are
called basic variables.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.520
And the original variables are
called non-basic variables.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:55.090
So I'm going to add three
basic labels, x4, x5,

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:58.350
and x6, corresponding to
these three constraints.

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:01.470
And they're going to
represent slack in the sense

01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:04.880
that they're going to
correspond to how much slack you

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.290
have in the
inequalities that you

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.400
have in the original problem.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:17.220
So if x4 happens to be
0, then you're jammed up.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:22.450
You have no slack, because x1
plus x2 plus 3x3 equals 30.

01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:26.790
And increasing any one of them
will violate the constraint.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.130
So that's just simply
the notion of slack.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:32.310
It's how much room do you have.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:42.220
x5 is 24 minus 2x1
minus 2x2 minus 5x3.

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:47.460
And the last one
is 36 minus 4x1.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.230
This is very mechanical
up to this point.

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.880
And so I'll call this set
of equations, equation I.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.650
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:05.980
to now work on a space that
corresponds to x1, x2, x3, x4,

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:08.370
x5, x6.

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.790
So I'm going to have
these solutions that

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:13.516
now have six values
associated with them,

01:06:13.516 --> 01:06:15.390
as opposed to just three
values, because I've

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:20.530
added three variables, the basic
variables, to my non-basic set.

01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:26.390
So the original
variables are non-basic,

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.630
just to differentiate.

01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:32.280
So so far it's just
set up its definitions.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:39.260
We can think about up running
through iterations of simplex.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:41.430
It takes about three
iterations here

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:47.630
in order to get to the point
where the optimum is obvious.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.320
So you're going to convert
through three slack forms.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.680
And then finally, when you
get to this fourth slack form,

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.100
you see that you have
an optimal solution.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.740
And how does that work?

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:04.660
You're going to have the notion
of a basic solution, where

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:11.985
we set all non-basic
variables to 0.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.830
So in this case, what
we're going to have--

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:26.105
and then we're going to compute
values of the basic variables.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.900
So our objective function
here is going to be 3 times

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:41.755
0 plus 1 times 0 plus 2 times
0, which is obviously 0.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:53.430
And the values x4,
of course, is going

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:56.590
to be-- because all of these
are 0-- is going to be 30.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.140
x5 is going to be 24.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.920
And x6 is going to be 36.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.450
So this is kind of a
trivial starting point.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:05.660
So you can think
of this as 0, 0, 0,

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:13.360
the solution that you're
looking at, 30 24, and 36.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.140
So that's our starting
point, which doesn't really

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.290
tell you much.

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:23.189
But now comes the
key step, where

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:26.010
we're going to do something
that's called pivoting.

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:29.830
And in pivoting,
you're going to swap

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:33.160
a basic able with a
non-basic variable.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.630
It is a step that requires
some intelligence.

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:41.609
But the basic step is a swap.

01:08:41.609 --> 01:08:43.410
So one of the basic
variables is going

01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:47.470
to become a non-basic
variable and vice versa.

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:51.359
And how do we select this?

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:54.500
Initially, you can kind of
do this in an arbitrary way.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.880
It gets a little more
subtle as you go along.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.840
You don't want to do
things in a random way.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:11.200
But let's just start with
what pivoting actually

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:16.260
does in a more generic setting.

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:24.550
The basic step is select a
non-basic variable-- let's

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:33.170
call it x sub e-- who's
coefficient in the objective

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:38.174
function is positive.

01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:45.930
You can always redefine things
if you can't find something

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:46.890
like that.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:48.523
But we won't go there.

01:09:48.523 --> 01:09:49.939
And then what we're
going to do is

01:09:49.939 --> 01:09:57.745
we're going to increase the
value of x as much as possible.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.330
And we always have
constraints, of course.

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:07.362
So we can do that
without violating

01:10:07.362 --> 01:10:08.320
any of the constraints.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:24.910
And then at this point,
variable xe becomes basic.

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:27.230
So it's going to turn
into the left hand side.

01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:28.230
It's going to move over.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:31.890
You're going to swap-- the x1
might be over here, over here,

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:35.290
and you got to rewrite these
equations so the x1 becomes

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:38.280
basic, for example, over
to the left hand side,

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.250
and the variable
that it replaced

01:10:41.250 --> 01:10:42.760
goes over to the
right hand side.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.640
So you can think of this
as Gaussian elimination,

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.700
except with inequalities.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:49.960
There's definitely
relationships there,

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.430
if you recall your
Gaussian elimination.

01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:55.280
If you don't, don't
worry about it.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:02.160
So xe becomes basic,
and some other variable

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.350
becomes non-basic.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:15.410
The values of other
basic variables

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:24.023
and the objective
function may change.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.530
So we'll do one
pivot step at least,

01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.920
so you get a sense for
the algebra involved.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:40.420
And it becomes a
little more concrete.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.080
To motivate you
further, you'll be

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.985
doing this in problem set
8 on a different example.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:54.830
So what did I do
here is we're going

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:59.720
to select a non-basic variable.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:02.970
So let's just select
x1, lexicographic order

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:09.600
or numeric order, let's
select x1 is selected.

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.940
That's the non-basic variable.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:19.680
And what I want to do is
increase the value of x1.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:23.080
So I want to increase it
without violating constraints.

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.850
Now, which of these
constraints do you think

01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:35.710
is going to cause trouble
first with respect

01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:37.730
to increasing the value of x1?

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:39.360
x1 is now 0.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.440
We're at ground level, we have
all 0, things are feasible.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.490
Now, as I start
increasing x1, remember,

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:51.860
you have non-negativity
constraints

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.240
associated with each of
the x4 values as well.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.840
That's what these basic
variables represent.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:02.080
So don't forget the fact that
the constraints are violated.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.860
You need all the xi's to be
greater than or equal to 0.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.760
That was true for the
non-basic variables.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.870
It's also true for
the basic variables.

01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:14.240
So a violation of a
constraint implies

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:19.780
that one of the currently
basic variables goes negative.

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.380
That's exactly equivalent
to the original inequality

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.400
not being satisfied.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.360
So which of these
constraints, do you think,

01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:29.240
is going to cause trouble here?

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:33.440
Just look at it, and should
be able to look at the three

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.020
equations and tell me, as
I increase the value of x1,

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.510
where am I going
to hit my limit?

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:42.567
x6, yes, absolutely correct.

01:13:42.567 --> 01:13:44.150
So that's because
of the minus 4 here.

01:13:44.150 --> 01:13:45.520
This is a big multiplier.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.720
I got a minus 1 here, a minus
2 here, and a minus 4 here.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.922
And if we just look at 4, the
magnitudes, 4 is bigger than 2

01:13:53.922 --> 01:13:55.380
and is bigger than
1, so it's going

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:57.090
to be that third constraint.

01:13:57.090 --> 01:14:02.310
So third constraint--
you can obviously

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:04.510
compute this numerically
or mechanically.

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:10.320
It was just easier to do this in
this example by eyeballing it.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.490
And so third constraint
is the tightest one.

01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:16.780
And it limits how much
we can increase x1.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.710
So I'm going to
do my second step

01:14:18.710 --> 01:14:22.610
up there, which
corresponds to rewriting

01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:26.860
x1 as these other variables.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:31.480
And now, I got x1 on the
left hand side and x6

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.100
on the right hand side.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:36.020
And now, it's just merely
a matter of substitution.

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:40.590
Once I've done this, I'm just
going to jam through and go in

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:58.130
and I'm going to rewrite
the other equations with x6

01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.955
on the right hand side.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:09.530
And that is, I'm
going to replace x1

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:12.785
with the eyeball equation.

01:15:12.785 --> 01:15:15.665
And that's really a
simple substitution.

01:15:15.665 --> 01:15:17.040
So at this point,
what's happened

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.170
is, because the third
constraint representing x6

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:23.420
was the one that was
chosen, what's happened

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:28.440
is that x1 and x6 are
going to interchange roles.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.810
x1 was non-basic, it's
going to become basic.

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:34.680
x6 was basic and is going
to become non-basic.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.910
And that's basically the essence
of the simplex algorithm.

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:41.850
The iteration and then the
convergence and all of that

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:48.400
is, as I mentioned, going to
require getting to a point

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.880
where the optimality
is obvious, but we

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.420
won't be doing any
proofs corresponding

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:57.900
to conversions for simplex
or any other specific LP

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.130
techniques in this class.

01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:02.540
Maybe some constraint
techniques,

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:06.010
I take back what I said, but
certainly not for simplex.

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:10.080
But I just want to give you
a sense for the flow here.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.840
And so let's just go through
this last thing here in terms

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.680
of finishing off the pivot xi's.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:25.240
And I want to show you what
the equations look like.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.670
And if you just keep doing that,
at some point, you'll converge.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.590
And so what happens
here is you have z

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:41.150
equals 27 plus x2 divided
by 4 plus x3 divided

01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:45.890
by 2 minus 3x6 divided by 4.

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:49.290
x1 equals-- so there's
a bunch of algebra

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:57.470
here that I'm obviously skipping
over, but it's simple algebra.

01:16:57.470 --> 01:17:02.950
And I have x4 over
here, 21 minus 3x2

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:09.372
divided by 4 minus 5x3 divided
by 2 plus x6 divided by 4,

01:17:09.372 --> 01:17:10.580
and then one last thing here.

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:29.870
So that's my pivot step,
that I've flipped x1 and x6.

01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:32.730
So now you ask,
what was the point?

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.150
What was the point of this?

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:39.120
Well, the point of this was
that you actually increased

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.150
the objective function value
and, in this particular case,

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:46.280
quite significantly, while
maintaining correctness.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:53.140
And so let me just make these
observations and conclude here,

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.760
because then that gets us to
the point where you've seen

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.130
the details of one pivot step.

01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:02.840
And you can imagine applying it
over and over to a convergence.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:09.590
And let's just look at the
original basic solution,

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:17.380
which as you recall was
0, 0, 0, 30, 24, and 36.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:20.370
And this is simply
x1 through x6.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:23.100
This original basic
solution suddenly

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:28.140
satisfies these
equations-- equations II,

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:30.250
if you just put them in there.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:35.800
And it makes sense that it will
have the objective value of 0,

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.030
given equivalents,
but you can verify

01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:41.410
that by saying
that you have 27--

01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:43.950
the original had the
objective value of 0,

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:47.230
because all the x
sub 1, x2, x3 were 0,

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:50.930
so that was an easy check in the
set of equations corresponding

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:53.360
to the first set, which
I've erased at this point.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.980
But no matter.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:03.140
And if you look at what I
have here, I have 36 equals 0.

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.580
So the objective
value here is 0.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.860
It matches what you had before.

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:16.670
But the basic
solution for II, I'm

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:19.360
going to set the
non-basic values.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:22.170
So what is a solution here?

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:27.350
The non-basic values are 0.

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:35.970
So the solution is going to
be 9, because 9 is non-basic.

01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:37.950
x1 is now non-basic.

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:40.610
x2 and x3 are still basic.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.840
And then I have 21 and 6.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.080
And x6 now has become basic.

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.040
So the way I get this solution
is simply by plugging in 0's

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.000
on this aside.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.040
And I get 9, 21, and 6,
because I just plugged

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.910
in 0's on the right hand side.

01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:59.080
So that's how I
got a new solution.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.400
And if you look at the
objective value for this,

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.670
the objective value, you can
look at this objective value

01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:13.200
simply by looking at
the original problem.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:20.670
And the original problem
had 3x1 plus x2 plus x3

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:22.477
as the objective value.

01:20:22.477 --> 01:20:24.810
And so if you go off and you
see, well, that you had 0's

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:29.590
for the other ones,
but you have 3 times 9,

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:33.230
so we have an
objective value of 27.

01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:37.250
So this flip of
our pivot basically

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.920
got you from an
objective value of 0,

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:45.190
while maintaining correctness,
to an objective value of 27.

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:49.440
And you can look at this
in the notes or in CLRS,

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.040
but you have to do two
more pivots corresponding

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.820
to two other variables--
the same grungy

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:59.100
stuff that I went through here,
substitution after selection.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.420
And the objective value
is going to increase.

01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.690
And you might ask, how
do I know that I'm done?

01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:07.190
And so that was the
last thing here,

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:13.700
which is increase the value
until it becomes obvious-- no,

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.330
this was pivoting, I'm sorry--
increase the value pivot

01:21:18.330 --> 01:21:23.240
until it becomes obvious
what the optimum is.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.420
And what ends up
happening is you end up

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.320
with an objective function.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.210
In this case, the objective
function mind you,

01:21:31.210 --> 01:21:34.100
this thing over here is
the objective function.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.790
And notice that it has
a negative coefficient

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:43.570
on the variable
that was actually

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.185
the part of the first pivot.

01:21:46.185 --> 01:21:48.850
So x1 and x6 were a
part of the first pivot.

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:51.307
And this got a
negative coefficient.

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:53.890
So what ends up happening here
is you end up getting something

01:21:53.890 --> 01:22:01.810
like 30 minus something
minus something

01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:06.930
minus something, where you
have xi values over here.

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:10.750
And when you set these to be
0, that's the best you can do,

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:13.870
because these are all
negative quantities.

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:16.530
So I'll just leave
you with that.

01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:19.270
Hopefully, you understood
how we do the pivoting--

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.120
sub through it three
times, and then

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.350
you get that objective function,
and the optimum value is 30.

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:26.115
See you next time.
