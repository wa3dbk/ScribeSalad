00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:21.440
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: All right.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.700
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.540
Welcome back from spring break.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.270
Hope you had a nice
time off and couldn't

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.230
wait to get back to 6.046.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.620
So exciting second half.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.230
Going to do flow networks
today on Thursday.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.890
Next week, it's
linear programming,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.880
on to complexity, distributed
algorithms, cryptography.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.730
Topics going to come
fast and furious.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.710
Hopefully, they'll
all be interesting.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.700
So there's a lot
of setup associated

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.220
with network flow, max flow.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.080
It's an optimization problem.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.980
And so I'm going to spend
like the first hour here--

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.820
and hopefully, it
won't be too boring--

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.819
setting up flow networks,
describing the max flow

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.700
problem.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.920
As you can see, this
outline is fairly involved,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.210
talking about cuts in a
network, residual networks.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.655
And we'll, more or less, end
the lecture with the statement,

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:22.600
though not the
proof-- we'll save

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.150
that for next time-- of the
mas-flow min-cut theorem, which

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.000
is really an iconic
theorem in the literature,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.340
and suddenly, the crucial
theorem for flow networks.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.680
And we'll take the
max-flow min-cut theorem

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.140
and use that to get to the first
ever max-flow algorithm, which

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.330
was due to Ford and Fulkerson.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.390
And that should be, pretty much,
at the end of today's lecture.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.990
And next time, we'll talk about
the proof of max-flow min-cut,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.820
talk about some of the
issues with Ford-Fulkerson,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.350
and then use max
flow as a hammer

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.650
to solve interesting problems
in bipartite matching, baseball

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.150
playoff elimination,
and things like that.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.730
So just like shortest
paths, can be used not just

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.370
to compute the shortest distance
from point A to point B,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.160
you can imagine that other
problems, for example,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.224
scheduling problems,
time problems,

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.390
could be solved using
Dijkstra-- and you've probably

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.900
seen examples of
that-- max flow is

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.360
another algorithmic hammer
that's being used to solve

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.150
a wide variety of problems.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.860
We won't really touch
on that aspect today,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.680
but we'll spend a bunch of time
on Thursday talking about that.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.800
So let's get started.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.070
We're going to
start with defining

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.660
what a flow network is.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.410
And at some level,
it's really simple.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.815
I mean, it's a graph.

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:02.380
A graph is going to
have vertices and edges.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.470
We're going to only
look at directed graphs.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.642
And we're going to have a
couple of constraints associated

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:11.350
with these directed
graphs that are going

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.390
to make the algorithms,
and the proofs,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.510
and the notation a lot simpler.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.660
I'll get to that
in a few minutes.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.590
And the key thing with
the flow networks-- I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.380
mean, just like you have
a source and a destination

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.760
for shortest paths,
in a flow network

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.450
as well, you're going
to have a source,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.300
and you're going to have a sink.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.612
So we're going to have
distinguished vertices, two

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:34.570
distinguished vertices.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.330
And we're going to call them
the source, s, and a sink, t.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.250
And so the basic idea here--
and just to sort of set things

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.310
up right up front--
is that there's

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.980
going to be some
flow coming out of s.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.750
And it's going to have to obey
some constraints associated

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.310
with capacities of the edges,
in order to make its way to t.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.030
And along the
way-- this is flow.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.850
This is water.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.670
You can think of it as water,
or cars, or what have you.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.150
It's a rate.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.970
You're not going to
allow accumulation

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.650
in the intermediate nodes.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.120
So you're going to have law
of conservation associated

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.250
with this commodity
that's flowing,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.670
be water, or cars, or people.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.960
And that essentially comes
down to, for any vertex, other

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.790
than s or t, everything
entering the vertex has

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.550
to leave the vertex.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.180
So that's like Kirchoff's
current law, for example.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.140
So there's a lot of analogies
here with respect to real life,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.510
or electricity in this case.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.240
And you'll see that, I think,
over and over as we go along.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.254
So let's take a look
at a flow network.

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:54.670
I'm not going to
draw it out here.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.560
I'm going to keep
this one example

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.200
all through the lecture.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.750
But just to go off and talk
about edges and capacities

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.190
before we actually
draw an example,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.840
we're going to have
edges, directed edges,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.490
u, v. So you have
an edge from u to v.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.680
And it's going to
belong to E, obviously.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.990
That's the reason the
edge is in the network.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.160
And this edge is going
to have a non-negative--

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.748
each edge is going to have a
non-negative capacity, C(u,v).

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:35.080
Right?

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.430
And if perchance theres'
no edge from, let's say,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.580
s1 to s2-- these are
different vertices

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.020
from the source or the
sink, just as an example,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.600
you can say it's between
a and b-- then, we can

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.560
assume that the capacity is 0.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:03.560
So if u, v does not belong to
E, then assume that C(u,v) is 0.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.370
So there's no way
of getting from u

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.350
to v. This rate, wall
water, cars-- you know,

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.400
there's no road that
gets you from u to v, OK?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.700
So let's draw an example
of a flow network.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.170
We'll talk a little bit
about what the flow is

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.760
and what the max flow is
in example-driven algorithm

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.880
design, if you will.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.010
So I've got a source, s.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.950
And I've got a sink, t.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.170
And then, I've got a bunch
of nodes in the middle.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.265
Just draw them out.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.630
I'm not going to bother
naming those nodes.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.800
Well, that might be a mistake.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.300
We'll see.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.308
So this is not like
it's an acyclic graph.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.430
You're allowed
cycles in this graph.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.910
But we will have a
couple of constraints

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.850
that are associated
with this graph

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.980
that I'll get to
in just a minute.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.970
So first, that's all we've got.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.510
You've got g,v,e,
directed graph.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.360
Can't have cycles in it.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.520
And I'm going to draw a
couple of numbers here.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:36.620
The numbers I'm putting up here
are the capacities associated

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.540
with each of these edges.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.270
So those are just
the capacities.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.690
Those are C(u,v).

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.295
And I said that, if u,v
does not belong to E,

00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:49.980
then you're going to
assume that C(u,v) is 0.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.800
So there's no edge, for
example, between this node

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.940
and that node.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.580
So there's no way
that you can directly

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.180
get from here to there.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.770
You can go like this,
like this, and like that,

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.860
and get from here to there.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.840
And you can obviously go
like so, and like this,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.550
and like that, to get from
the one on the top left

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.400
to the one on the
bottom right, OK?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.040
So that's essentially
the set up,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.690
except for the fact that we've
just talked about capacities.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.020
And this is sort of the
bandwidth, if you will.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.539
This is the amount of traffic
that can go through this road.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.039
And now, we have to talk
about the specific case

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.390
where we're actually
going to shove things

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.880
through the network.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.480
So we're going to
have another number.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.930
So typically, we're going to
have two numbers associated

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.360
with each edge.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.320
One of them is going
to be the capacity,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.910
and the other one is
going to be the flow that

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.952
goes through the edge.

00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:53.410
And as you can
imagine, we're going

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.020
to have this constraint that
says that the flow can never

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.370
exceed the capacity.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.800
And that's the local constraint
associated with each edge, OK?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.760
That doesn't mean
that there aren't

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.030
variations possible with
respect to the overall flow

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.800
of the network.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.720
Things can change.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.330
You obey the edge capacities.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.500
And there could be different
flow coming out of s

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.972
and going into t, et cetera.

00:09:22.972 --> 00:09:25.430
And so there is going to be an
optimization here associated

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.750
with the exact
numbers that all obey

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.290
these edge constraints, so these
edge capacity constraints, OK?

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.290
So let's take a
real simple example

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.670
of a flow in this network.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.110
And ah, I have some
colored chalk here.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:49.123
So I can put down
the flow over here.

00:09:49.123 --> 00:09:49.956
And so this is flow.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.750
Wow.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.470
That is an ugly color.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:01.690
But now, we're stuck for
the rest of this lecture.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.840
So I've got 2, 2, 1, colon, 3.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.590
So the first number is the
flow, and the second number

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.600
is the capacity.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000
Let me just write that out.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.100
This is-- and then,
this is 1, colon, 3.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.360
This is 1, colon, 2.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.960
So that meets the capacity.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.240
This is 2, colon, 3.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:39.020
And then 1, colon, 3, 2,
colon, 3, and 1, 2, right?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.780
So that's my first
example of a flow.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.880
And we want to make sure that
this flow makes sense, OK?

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.880
And we're going to write
this down a little more

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.690
precisely in just a minute,
but I've sort of given you

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.930
the intuition already.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:03.050
I've talked about it's OK to
have a flow from the source.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:07.790
It's the mountain
spewing water, or that's

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.180
the source of the river.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.030
And this is the
sea, for example.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.110
And the river flows into it.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:20.190
But along the way, you really
can't have accumulation, OK?

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.710
Because when you think
about it as a rate--

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.960
and so this is sort of gallons
per second-- then maybe

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.020
you'll have a little bit
of accumulation allowed.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:32.020
But over a huge
period of time, you

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.620
can't have infinite
accumulation.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.760
So that's where the conservation
law kicks in, which says,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.700
anything that goes into
a node that is not marked

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.370
s or t has to leave the node.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.810
So you look at this, and
you go, well, there's

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.960
two things coming in here.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.060
There's 1 and 1,
which adds up to 2.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.990
And there's two 2 leaving.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:56.310
So we're good there.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.040
OK?

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.150
And then pick another one.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.700
This one, for example.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.530
You've got 2 coming in, and
you've got 1 and 1 leaving.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.030
We're good there, right?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.280
For t, you've got 3
coming in, 2 plus 1.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.860
And another check to
do is, well, you've

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.310
got 2 coming out of
the source, right?

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.280
So hopefully, that
all will make sense.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.830
And ask questions
if you're confused.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.150
One other thing to look
at, which is interesting,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:33.210
is that you could have flows
that are essentially cyclic.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.790
You could have commodities that
are flowing in a little cycle.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:38.680
And can you see that?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.536
Can anyone see that over here?

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:45.000
Yep?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:45.786
Go ahead.

00:12:45.786 --> 00:12:48.814
STUDENT: The bottom-right
triangle [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:48.814 --> 00:12:50.480
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Bottom-right triangle?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.310
This thing over here?

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.760
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.700
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Like that?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.170
Good.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.420
Right?

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.503
So you see this one going
over this way, this way,

00:12:55.503 --> 00:12:56.380
and that way?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:04.100
And so there's nothing that's
stopping us from taking this

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.130
and-- I had 1 over here, so
I'm going to make that 0.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.450
I had 2 over here, and
I'm going to make that 1.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.335
And I had 2 over here, and
I'm going to make that 1.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.210
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.455
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:15.455 --> 00:13:16.330
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Oh.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.143
What is it?

00:13:17.143 --> 00:13:17.970
STUDENT: It was 1.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.142
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
It was 1 before?

00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:20.850
Oh, you're right.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.516
It was 1 before.

00:13:21.516 --> 00:13:23.260
So I should make that 0 then.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.450
Good.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.280
I wanted to subtract 1 from
what I had before, right?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.890
And I screwed that one
up, the simple thing.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.920
All right?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.300
Wow.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.080
No wonder I didn't
major in mathematics.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:39.140
OK.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.650
Computer Science is
this forgiving field.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.300
So you can go 0--
well, this is 0.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.460
So now, let's take a
look at what we have here

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.320
and check that nothing
went wrong, right?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.160
We want to check that
nothing went wrong.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.160
And so 2 coming in, 1
going out, 1 going out.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.290
And nothing coming in
here, so we're all good.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.610
And so on and so forth, OK?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.190
So there's interesting
things happening here

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:17.170
with respect to the conservation
laws and having to obey them.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.650
In general, you can imagine
that what we're interested in

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:27.340
is simply maximizing the
flow from the source,

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.240
and getting as much flow out
of the source as possible,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.030
and pushing it into the sink.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.710
OK?

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.150
Now, the flow here
into t, as you can see,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.810
is 2 plus 1, which is 3, OK?

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.360
Can anyone take this
particular flow network

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.410
and increase the flow?

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.340
I mean, it's easy to
decrease the flow.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.210
You can make everything 0,
and that'd be valid, right?

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.370
But can you increase the flow?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.530
Do you think that
this flow network

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.920
allows for a larger
flow than 3, given

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.086
that the capacities of
those edges are fixed

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:06.460
and I'm not going
to change them?

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.820
Let's see.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.060
I think all of you
have Frisbees, right?

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.890
Yeah.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.244
Yeah, back there.

00:15:17.244 --> 00:15:19.160
STUDENT: I don't think
you can, because you're

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.380
maximizing two edges, which
would have to be increased.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.485
Like, the bottom
one coming out of s

00:15:25.485 --> 00:15:26.610
would have to be increased.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.024
Or the one on the very
top would, too, also

00:15:31.024 --> 00:15:33.900
have to be increased.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.810
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
People agree with that?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.320
Over there?

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.820
Yep?

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.486
STUDENT: You can have
a path going along

00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:40.271
the top with a flow
of 2, so that s is

00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:42.660
the one on the top of it has 2.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.430
That, from that, to the
right, has 2, like it has now.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.810
From that node, the t has 2.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.268
And then, along
the bottom, we have

00:15:49.268 --> 00:15:51.972
another path that has 2, from
s to the 1 [? plot of it. ?]

00:15:51.972 --> 00:15:53.205
And then [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:54.080
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: OK.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.579
So--

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:55.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.970
That made perfect sense-- to me.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.100
[CHUCKLES] It did.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.350
So one of the
crucial observations

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:06.820
that [? Rajesh ?] made here--
and let me just focus in

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.390
on that-- is-- and that's why I
think the other gentleman said

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.300
no-- is that you can
actually decrease

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.130
the flow in particular edges.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:19.070
And that's going to
help you increase

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.820
the overall flow, right?

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.970
And that's why this
problem is challenging.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.550
That's why we need so much
of a setup, all right?

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:30.450
So one thing that I could do
is I could essentially say,

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.660
I'm going to take
this and make this 0.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.610
So when I do that,
essentially what I have is I

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:46.200
get to push more flow
out from here, right?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.850
So I get to push more flow.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.160
I can turn this into a 2.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.370
And I can turn this
into a 2, right?

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.590
Am I done?

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.460
STUDENT: No.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.190
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Not quite.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.731
I mean, I've got
one little bug here,

00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:00.310
but I can fix that, right?

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.400
I've got one little
bug here which says,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.810
I've got 2 coming out here.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.230
I made this 0, so I have
to push something more.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.599
But hey, I'm lucky.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.730
I've got a s here, which is
giving me as much as I want,

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:11.410
correct?

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.677
So I can just make this a 2.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.849
And so now we get
a flow of 4, right?

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.770
You both get Frisbees.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.381
Shall we do blue and purple?

00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:23.880
Here you go.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.764
Could you stand up?

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:28.240
Oh, OK.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.890
Over there.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.600
So that actually
kind of summarizes,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.070
at some level, our
task ahead, right?

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:44.550
So we have to find ways
of increasing the flow.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.190
And sometimes, we have to take
a step backwards in the sense

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:51.260
that we decrease the flow
on a particular edge, right?

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.370
So it's not this monotonic
increase that Dijkstra would do

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.500
or a greedy algorithm, like
MST that Eric talked about.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.210
There's going to be something
a little more interesting here.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.410
We eventually are
going to end up

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:10.960
doing things in a monotonic way,
in terms of the overall flow.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.080
So the max flow that
we're trying to get at

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.030
is going to start
with the current flow.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.850
And we're going to improve
the current flow constantly.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.750
But that doesn't
mean that the edges

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.210
are going to look
monotonic in terms

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.610
of the flows on a
particular edge in relation

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.360
to the capacity.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.030
You'll never exceed
the capacity.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.540
But as you saw in this
little example already,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.640
we increase from 3 to 4,
by taking that edge that

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.100
was vertical up there,
which says 0, colon, 3,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.310
and that was 1, and we
shrank the flow on it.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.850
And so how are we going
to discover these paths,

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.660
especially if we have a
5,000-node network and-- I

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.390
don't know-- 10,000 edges?

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.380
And so that's
essentially what we

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.870
have to do for the
rest of this lecture.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.180
Any questions so far?

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.140
OK.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.090
So we've done flow networks.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:08.160
I kind of defined what
the max flow problem is.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.964
And let me just write
that out more precisely.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:31.400
Given a flow network,
G, find the flow

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:46.769
with maximum value on G. And for
that, the max flow is 4, right?

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.560
So that's another thing
we haven't actually

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.560
done, which is obviously
important for us to do,

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.940
which is we have to show
that the 4, in this case,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.690
is the max flow, right?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.410
So now, of course,
I've given that away.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.120
And so I'm not going to ask you
can you push this over to 5.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.070
But you might think that
5 is a possibility, simply

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.770
because the capacities
of the edges that

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.130
are coming out of the source
are 3 plus 2, which is 5, right?

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.940
So it's certainly
possible that you

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.380
could push at least, if you
only look at those two edges,

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.200
that you could push 5
units from the source.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.950
But in this case,
in this example,

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.910
if you obey the laws
of conservation,

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.850
you cannot obey those laws and
get 5 units from the source

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.227
to the sink, t.

00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:37.310
But we have to prove that.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.180
And we have an
algorithm that says

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.370
this is the best that
you can possibly do.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.680
And the algorithm terminates
when that happens.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.320
And that's our Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm, right?

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.290
Good.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.430
So that's what we have so far.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.280
I want to talk about
flow network assumptions.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.544
And I can do that over here.

00:21:00.544 --> 00:21:02.127
This is going to
make our life easier.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.730
One of the things that's
a little bit confusing

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.000
sometimes is the circular
flow and the fact

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.940
that we're going
to potentially have

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:25.940
flows that correspond to edges
coming in and edges going out.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:31.940
So for example, if I had
something like s and u,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.730
for example-- and s could
be the source in this case,

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.690
or it could be
another node-- suppose

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.230
I had a little subnetwork
that looks like this.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.830
And I'm just giving you
what the capacities are.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.460
This is a bit
strange in the sense

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.790
that you could have a
situation where you essentially

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.700
have zero flow, really, because
you have one unit coming

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.950
in here and one unit leaving.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:02.480
All right?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.271
And you can think of
this-- let's just call

00:22:04.271 --> 00:22:07.720
this s1, to make it
clear that it doesn't

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.389
have to be the source, right?

00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:11.930
And so you could
have the circularity

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.390
that you saw over there.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.730
And now you're
talking about, well, I

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.430
might have 1, colon, 1
here, and 1, colon, 2 here,

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.480
which is fine for
this subnetwork.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.320
But if I have stuff going
out, what happens with that?

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.990
Well that's got to be a 0.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.360
I could have a 1 and a 2.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.530
And if I have a 2 here, then--
if I had a 1 and 2 here,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.460
then that doesn't
work, because maybe I

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.670
need something else coming in.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.240
So you can see that,
pretty quickly, it

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.470
gets kind of
confusing, if we end up

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:54.930
having these cycles that
are such simple cycles,

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.000
especially the ones where
you have Su and Us, OK?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.696
And so we're going to disallow
cycles of two kinds, right?

00:23:03.696 --> 00:23:05.320
The first cycle we're
going to disallow

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.930
is this simple one where
we say, if I have a, then

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.600
no self-loop edges allowed.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.110
So that would
involve accumulation

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.202
at a particular node.

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:26.160
And it's going to make
things really confusing.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.680
And CLRS disallows that.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.930
And most flow network algorithms
assume that you're just

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.000
going to discard these cycles.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.580
This particular transformation
that I'm going to describe here

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.060
is something that is
going to be forced on you.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:51.430
And this is for your benefit in
over 6 lectures and sections.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:56.270
But it's not actually
something that CLRS follows.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.640
And it's going to make
things simpler, though.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.410
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:06.210
going to take any
pair of vertices that

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.200
has this characteristic, where
you have s1, u, and u, s1,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.550
and they have
non-zero capacities.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.410
So s1, u has a capacity of 1.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.740
u, s1 has a capacity of 2.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.440
Both of these edges exist.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.940
And if these edges
exist, that means

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.580
they have non-zero
capacity, positive capacity.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.910
And we're going to transform
that, very simply, into-- this

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.760
is not changing the
generality of the algorithm,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.250
but all I'm going
to do is transform

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.120
it-- call this s1--
into something that

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.750
satisfies this restriction.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:52.330
So I could have 2
here, 1, and 1, OK?

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.092
So all I've done is
introduce u prime, right?

00:24:56.092 --> 00:24:57.550
Then I can always
do this-- if this

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:00.750
is trivial for any
pair of vertices,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.670
I can introduce
one other vertex.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.190
It all works out.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.180
Linear expansion, constant
factors, ignore them.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.060
Life is wonderful.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:15.430
So all I've done is
taken away the situation

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.310
where I have-- you can think of
it as two-way streets, right?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.310
Two-way streets are annoying.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.310
You don't quite know
what the rate of traffic

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.700
is from one end of
the street to another,

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.770
because cars are going
in both directions.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.520
And you have to do subtraction.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.060
Subtraction is painful,
so we don't want that.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.560
So we're just going to
assume that this is u prime.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.120
And now, you're all set.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:41.950
We allow this.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:45.040
So we have to allow
for generality reasons.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.230
As we saw in that very
first example there,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.070
we are going to have
cycles here, OK?

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:55.180
But we just don't want cycles
to be of length 1 or 2, OK?

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.630
So that's essentially what
we're going to disallow.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.560
All right?

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.800
The good news is
that, if you do this,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.890
then we'll only have a
single notion of flow.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.860
Whereas, if you go
read CLRS, you'll

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.820
see that there's two
notions of flow in CLRS.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.060
There's positive flow, which
is different from net flow.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.610
And the positive flow is
different from net flow

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.840
in graphs that have this
particular structure,

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.840
or have nodes with
these properties.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.280
But if you disallow them, then
you can just talk about flow,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.140
and it doesn't matter.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.540
Positive flow is the same
as net flow, all right?

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.010
So for the purposes
of [? 6 over 6, ?]

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.400
for this semester, we're going
to simply think about flow

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.910
and equate that to positive
flow, equate that to net flow.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.140
And it's all going
to work out, assuming

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.370
your graphs satisfy these
two properties of the cycle

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.350
lengths.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.350
All right?

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.621
Cool.

00:26:56.621 --> 00:26:57.120
Good.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.250
So let's keep going here.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.325
So we're up to finished
up on max flow.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:09.745
Let me just give you
some sense of notation.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.160
I've talked a lot
about constraints.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.090
But we've got to
write some stuff out,

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:28.660
because we're going to
be getting more precise

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.620
and proving things in
just a few minutes.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.800
So what is a flow?

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:44.230
Well, to be precise, it is going
to be a function that satisfies

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.770
the following properties.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.675
It satisfies the
capacity constraint.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:06.800
This is the obvious capacity
constraint, intuitive capacity

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.319
constraint.

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:08.860
And then we've got
flow conservation.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:22.940
And the important thing here is
that I don't have it for all V,

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.840
but I do have it for
vertices, V, that

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.760
are not the source or the sink.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:41.660
And I'm going to require
f(u,v) equals 0, right?

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.680
And the last one, which
I haven't talked about,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.070
but becomes easy to talk
about, given this constraint,

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.875
is skew symmetry.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:12.110
So if you take-- this doesn't
have to be an edge between u

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:17.370
and v. Now, I'm talking about
the flow, f, between u and v.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.300
And so the u could be
s, which is the source.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.770
v could be t, which is the sink.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.680
So in general, I'm not
talking about a flow.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:31.300
And there obviously has
to be a path from u to v,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.310
in order for there to be a
non-zero flow, f(u,v), right?

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:38.040
If there's no path, there's
no way of getting there.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.770
But having said that, the
definition of a flow here

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:47.570
in our network is the
straightforward definition,

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:52.380
which simply says, if
there's a flow from u to v,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:56.830
regardless of what u and v are,
then the value of that flow

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.570
is simply the
negation of the value

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:06.770
of the flow from v to u, which
makes perfect sense, right?

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:13.510
And this all works out under
the definition of net flow.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.380
And so this is essentially
what the definition of net flow

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.910
is in the textbook.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.430
But for our purposes
here, we don't

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.310
have to add that adjective.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.370
We just are going to
be talking about flows.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:30.350
Positive or net, they're
the same, all right?

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:31.080
All right.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.026
Good.

00:30:32.026 --> 00:30:41.580
So one of the things you
can do with this notation--

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:45.610
and we're going to use what's
called implicit summation

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:50.280
notation on top of this-- is to
prove some interesting things,

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.850
interesting theorems,
that give you

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:55.310
some intuition as to how
algorithms on flow networks

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.690
are going to work.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:07.160
And in particular, we're going
to use this notation when we

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.580
talk about the value of a flow.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:20.220
So the value of a
flow, f, is denoted--

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.860
you can think of it
as a cardinality of f.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:33.380
And f is v, belonging
to capital V, f(s,v).

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.410
And that is f(s,V), so
what I have written here.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:44.250
Well, given a flow network, I
want one particular quantity

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.610
that I want to maximize.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.920
And that particular
quantity is going

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:55.220
to be defined, based on how much
I can push from s, how much can

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.600
I push outward from s.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.130
That's the crucial quantity
that I want to maximize.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.260
That quantity is-- you
think about everything

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.230
that is going out of s, and
you add it all up together.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:17.380
So from s, you look at any other
vertex, every other vertex,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.050
and you say, what is f(s,v)?

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.840
And I'm not talking about just
the edges that come out of s.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.380
A vertex, v, small
v, can be any vertex.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:34.750
If I add up all of the flows
that come out of s, then

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:39.280
that is the flow that
responds to my flow network.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.360
That is everything that's
getting pushed out of s, OK?

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.280
Now, it may be the
case that-- remember,

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.840
I'm talking about
flow here-- so it

00:32:49.840 --> 00:33:00.470
may be the case that you have an
edge from s coming in from v4.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:06.310
And there may be a flow
associated with that.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:10.140
This is maybe something
like 1, colon, 2, all right?

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:20.020
So what this means is that
f(s,vr) is-- this is f,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:24.510
remember-- so this
is minus f(v4,s).

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:30.790
And in this particular
case, this is 1.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.980
So this is minus 1, OK?

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.040
So keep that in mind.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.930
When I talk about the
flow of the network,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.130
I'm going to be
looking at the source.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.370
And I'm going to be looking
at all of the flows that

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.520
are going outward.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.400
And I have to keep in mind the
skew symmetry relationship.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.690
I obviously have to obey
capacity constraints

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.920
and the conservation
laws, all right?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:03.880
So given that, let's use this
implicit summation notation

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.346
and show some simple
properties of flow.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:30.670
So let's look at--
one thing I want

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.860
to emphasize is
what I've done here

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:42.820
is use this implicit
summation notation,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.400
which simply says, if I
see a capital letter here,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.699
that's a set.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:52.080
And I'm going to
have to enumerate

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.570
all of the members of that set.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.790
And it's implicit summation.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.650
So as I enumerate
those members, I'm

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.855
going to add up all of
these quantities, right?

00:35:03.855 --> 00:35:05.230
So that's really
what this means.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:09.360
So the sigma here gets
embedded into this capital

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.270
V. So two things going on.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:12.860
The small v turned
into capital V,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.250
because I'm looking
at the entire set.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.410
And the sigma gets in there too.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.550
And that's why it's
implicit summation, not just

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.670
implicit set notation.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.140
So some simple properties.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:31.741
I can say, f(x,x) is 0,
where x is an arbitrary set.

00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:38.150
All that says is, let's say,
x has a single member in it,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.540
which is a.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.430
Then f(a,a) is always 0, because
if you don't allow self-loop

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:49.110
edges, and that's pretty
much all you need.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.630
If you have a pair of
vertices here, a and b,

00:35:53.630 --> 00:36:02.560
then what you're saying is
f(a,b) plus f(b,a) is 0.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.630
And that's true, because
of skew symmetry.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.130
Right?

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.470
We just wrote that out.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.520
So f(x,x) is 0.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.070
And in general, you can say,
even though X and Y are sets

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:20.240
of vertices, I'm going to
be able to use skew symmetry

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:27.180
to say that f(X,Y) is
minus of f(Y,X), all right?

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.040
Similar argument.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.930
And then, lastly-- there's
any number of these,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:40.820
we just do three of
them here-- X of f(XUY,

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:48.590
to Z) is f(X,Z) plus f(Y,Z)--
we've got to use these

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.590
properties to prove our first
theorem here on flow networks--

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:57.500
if X of X intersection
Y is null.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.940
So you don't want
to double-count.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.360
So that's all this is.

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.160
Make sure you're
not double-counting.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.660
You've got f(XUY),
and you want to look

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.180
at that entire set,
the union, and then

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.940
look at the flow from any member
in XUY to any member in Z.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.020
And you can do that
by breaking it up,

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.470
provided you're careful
about double-counting.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.940
And the fact that the
two sets, X and Y,

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.910
do not have an intersection, or
they have a null intersection,

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.610
implies that you're OK with
the [? write ?] inside.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.630
All right?

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:35.530
So you might be going,
why are we doing this?

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:43.390
Well, here's a good reason to
like implicit set notation.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:50.530
You can prove some interesting
theorems in a very elegant way,

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.890
using this notation.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.182
So let's do one example of that.

00:37:55.182 --> 00:37:56.765
You'll probably see
others in section.

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.980
So one of the things
that we'd like to do

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:09.090
is prove a pretty
important theorem,

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.030
which I think all
of you probably

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:17.350
can assume in your heads, given
all of the properties of flow

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:18.760
networks that we have.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.100
And it's a very simple
theorem that simply says,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.040
I have the law of
conservation that

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.440
is applied on all of these
intermediate vertices,

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.670
and I've got a bunch
of commodities,

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:36.750
I've got a flow going
out of s, right?

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.360
So where can this flow go?

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.580
Where does this flow end up?

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:48.430
It ends up at the
sink, at t, right?

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.770
So the point is that, if you
have all of these properties

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:57.480
that we have up here, you're
going to be able to show--

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.820
and you want to show this,
you want to prove this--

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:07.530
that the value of a flow, which
is defined as what gets pushed

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:14.000
out from the source, is exactly
what goes into the sink, right?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.800
If that's not the case,
there's been a violation

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.700
of some property, perhaps a
capacity constraint, perhaps,

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:26.500
more likely, a conservation
constraint, OK?

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.890
So the theorem that we'd like
to prove is simply that f is

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.900
f(v,t), right?

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.400
That's the theorem.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.360
And there's a lot going
on here, so it's worth

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.180
spending 30 seconds looking
at what exactly this means.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.820
What I have here is that,
if you just look at this

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.890
and that, I'm saying
that f is what gets

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.760
pushed out of the source, OK?

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.870
And now what I'm saying
here is that f, the value,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:04.120
is exactly what gets
pushed into the sink, OK?

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.140
So this is what I
have to prove, right?

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:09.920
And I should be able to prove
that, by invoking my laws.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.540
That's it.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.600
I mean, that's my
axiomatic system.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.880
I've got those laws.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:18.320
I've got a definition of a
flow that may not necessarily

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.340
be the max flow.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.505
It might be something much
less than the max flow,

00:40:21.505 --> 00:40:22.810
it might be the max flow.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.940
Regardless, what gets
out of the source

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.630
has to get into the sink, right?

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.110
So how are we going to do that?

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.464
And the implicit
summation notation

00:40:30.464 --> 00:40:31.880
is going to give
you, essentially,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.250
a three or four-line proof,
which is very intuitive, right?

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:36.270
So let's do that.

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.010
And maybe you can help me.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.410
So we're going to start
with what we know.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.110
So that's the proof.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:46.642
f equals f(s,V).

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:49.880
Right?

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.950
So that's what we've got.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.050
That's the definition
of cardinality

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.530
of f, or a value of f, OK?

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.540
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:08.080
to say this is the same as--
I'll give you the first step,

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.890
and then let's see
if you can help me

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:16.290
with the remaining-- is
the same as f of v minus s

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.960
capital V, right?

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:24.070
So if you're having trouble
differentiating between my cap

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.790
V's and small v's, holler.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.700
I'm trying to write
them as big as possible.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:28.960
Yeah?

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.050
STUDENT: Could you maybe put
little hats on the top of them?

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.800
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Put
little hats on them.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.317
Yes, I will put
little hats on them.

00:41:34.317 --> 00:41:36.150
I'd put little Frisbees
on them, if I could,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:41.990
but-- I like Frisbees
much better than hats.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.490
All right.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.180
That's good.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.000
That's good to do.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.210
So yeah.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.240
So I think, hopefully,
I'll keep doing this,

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.610
and it won't be confusing.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:56.370
So what I've done here
is invoke, essentially,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:01.280
this, except it's not
exactly that, in the sense

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.170
that it's written a
little bit differently.

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:06.180
But if you see what's going
on here, what I've done

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:15.420
is look at this s, and
I've said, think of this s

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:22.340
as being cap V minus s.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:22.840
Right?

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.920
So that gives you s.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.820
And those are clearly
disjoint, right?

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.430
Those are clearly disjoint sets.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.680
There is this one and this
one are disjoint sets.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:31.530
That's what I mean to say.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:32.946
I mean, these two
aren't disjoint,

00:42:32.946 --> 00:42:34.354
but this and that are disjoint.

00:42:34.354 --> 00:42:35.770
And that's what
you need, in order

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:40.220
to invoke the little
property that you have here.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.810
And so that all make sense?

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.020
You see why I did that?

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.960
OK?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.260
What can I say about either
of these two quantities?

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:52.660
Can I say something about
either of these two quantities?

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.286
Yeah?

00:42:57.286 --> 00:42:58.870
STUDENT: f(V,V) is 0.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:00.120
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: f(V,V) is 0.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.430
That's exactly right.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.510
f(V,V) is 0.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.905
There you go.

00:43:04.905 --> 00:43:05.405
Yep.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.910
So this is simply I'm
going to invert that.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:23.257
I'm going to write this
as f of V hat minus s, OK?

00:43:23.257 --> 00:43:24.090
I'll just flip this.

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.420
I had a negative sign here,
but I've flipped that.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.663
And skew symmetry tells
me I can do that, right?

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.080
All right.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.630
So I'm up to this point here.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:43.895
Now, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to do f(V,t).

00:43:43.895 --> 00:43:46.020
And the reason I want to
do this is because this is

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.400
where I want to get at, right?

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.608
Eventually, I want to show
something that corresponds

00:43:49.608 --> 00:43:54.710
to f(V,t), right?

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.440
And what I have here is V,t.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:06.120
But now, I could do
plus f(V,V minus-- cap--

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.460
minus s minus t) right?

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.860
So what I've done here
is taken V minus s

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:15.580
and pulled out t from it.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.630
Remember, t is
part of cap V. Cap

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:20.810
V contains all of the vertices.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.600
So I've pulled out t
from it, but that implies

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.750
that I have to do a V
minus s minus t over here.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:32.000
And again, they're
disjoint, so it's all good.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.150
What can I say about this?

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.040
Yeah?

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.270
STUDENT: It's 0 because
of flow conservation?

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:42.520
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: It's 0
because of flow conservation.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.810
That's exactly right.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.110
We didn't quite
write it that way.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.770
But if you look at what the
implicit summation notation

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.700
would mean for that, you
look at it and you say,

00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:00.400
maybe one more step would
be, let me think about this

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.150
as being, f(V,t).

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:08.720
It'll become more obvious
if I write it this way.

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.770
f(V-- I'm putting
a minus in here--

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:18.220
V minus s minus t and
cap V again, right?

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.510
So all I've done here
is flip these two.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.750
Skew symmetry allows
me to do that.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.340
And now look at
what I have here.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.280
I'm talking about a
flow that corresponds

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:34.330
to some-- for any
vertex, I pick--

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.540
and it's not an s vertex,
it's not a t vertex,

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.426
so it's an intermediate vertex.

00:45:38.426 --> 00:45:40.050
And if I look at an
intermediate vertex

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:45.720
and look at the flow that
goes out to all vertices,

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.720
conservation says that
has to be 0, right?

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.540
So that's exactly
what this says.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:58.810
For any u that's neither s nor
t but in V, the sum has to be 0.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:02.760
So this is zero, and we're done.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.997
All right.

00:46:04.997 --> 00:46:05.830
Oh, you-- a Frisbee?

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.100
Who is that?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:07.600
Ah.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:08.099
Here.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:15.720
So that's the power of
implicit summation notation.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.740
So we could invoke these
different properties.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.500
It was fairly straightforward.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.920
Your first example of this.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.550
You'll probably see a few more.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:25.560
All right?

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.538
Any questions so far?

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:30.950
OK.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:35.390
So as you can see, as I
promised, or threatened

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.870
at the beginning, but
followed through on my threat,

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.030
we have a lot of
notation, a lot of baggage

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.500
here before we
get to algorithms.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.500
But we're slowly getting there.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:50.070
The next major concept
is the concept of cuts.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.440
So a cut, you think
of a cut as being,

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.950
well, a cut through paper, a
cut through the air, whatever.

00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:59.860
It turns out that notion
of a cut in a network

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.770
is more general
than that, right?

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.220
A cut is basically a partition.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.490
A cut is a partition of nodes.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:08.700
And a partition means
that you can't have

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.550
a node in both sides, right?

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:15.470
So a cut is going to give
you two disjoint components

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.500
at the end of it.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.810
But the cut doesn't have
to be something contiguous.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.587
It doesn't have to be a
line through the network.

00:47:21.587 --> 00:47:23.170
And everything to
the left of the line

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.380
is in one half of the
cut, and everything

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.460
on the right of the line is in
a different half of the cut.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:33.980
I can just break up these
nodes into two disjoint parts.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.780
And the only constraint
that I'm going to ask for

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:43.080
is that s, which is the source,
is on one side of the cut,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:47.110
and t, which is the sink, is
another side of the cut, OK?

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.640
That's it.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.170
And given that, I'm going to
say interesting things, really

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:58.180
interesting things, about
the flow through a cut, OK?

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.870
And so let's do that.

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.005
Let's define a cut.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:41.850
So a cut is (S,T) of
a flow network, G,

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:53.640
is a partition of V, such
that small s belongs to cap S,

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:59.820
and small t belongs to
cap T. I don't know.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:01.355
Do you want hats on the T too?

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.550
I'll just write them large.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:23.930
If a flow on G-- if
f is a flow on G,

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:31.140
then the flow across
the cut is f(S,T).

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.440
OK?

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.770
So again, implicit
summation notation here.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:46.780
The flow across the cut
is as the sum of the flows

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.200
corresponding to each
pair of vertices,

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.360
such that the source vertex
is part of capital S.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.570
And the destination vertex is
part of capital T. All right?

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.550
That's it.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.430
I'm just going to
add them all up.

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.845
That's the flow across the cut.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.020
So what I can do now
is just talk about--

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.460
let's just go up
here back to this.

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:23.010
And I'm going to look at
exactly what I have here.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.530
Is that right?

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.050
Not exactly.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.370
I'm going to change
this a little bit,

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.920
because I want to
make sure I don't

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:37.730
have to add up numbers
and do that incorrectly.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.240
So I need a 1.

00:50:42.651 --> 00:50:43.150
Yup.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:48.030
That's all I need
to do is change it.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:49.820
So I'm going to change
our example here,

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:55.570
not the topology of the
example, but the actual numbers.

00:50:55.570 --> 00:51:01.420
And you'll need to verify that
what I have here satisfies

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.150
our flow network properties.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:08.033
And there's one more.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.910
OK?

00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:16.830
So I think I'm good.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.750
All right.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:22.990
So this is going to be
an example of a cut.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.280
I haven't defined the cut yet.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.510
Let's get rid of that.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.910
Holler if you think there's
something wrong with this flow.

00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:34.410
All right?

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:35.550
I think I got it right.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.610
It satisfies
capacity constraints.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:41.650
It satisfies flow
conservation constraints.

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:44.490
The flow that is
going into t is 4.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.180
This happens to be a max flow.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.440
Doesn't really matter.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.970
So what we're going to talk
about with respect to cuts,

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.730
it doesn't require the
flow to be maximum.

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.000
Keep that in mind.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.270
What do I mean by the flow
across a cut via an example?

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:12.090
I'm going to simply say that
the shaded nodes, two of them,

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.520
are part of capital S, OK?

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.150
So as you can see, I
just arbitrarily picked

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:31.560
a couple of nodes.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.880
And that not necessarily
something that can be easily

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.550
partitioned using an actual
cut line, a physical cut line.

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.620
I just picked that one over
there and the one over here

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.050
with S.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:53.150
And so, I can now look at this,
and I can compute numerically,

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:54.020
for this example.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.170
And it's worth doing
at least once what

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:59.220
the flow across
this particular cut

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:07.430
is, defined by the particular
choice of cap S and cap T, OK?

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.410
And that's what
we're going to do.

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:23.100
So f(S,T) is-- I'm going to
have to look at pairs of nodes,

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.530
such that I've got a shaded
node on the left-hand side

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.985
and non-shaded node on
the right-hand side.

00:53:29.985 --> 00:53:31.610
And I'm going to have
to go through all

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:35.090
of the combinations, right?

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:38.540
So if I look at
this, I can first

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:42.650
knock off this one, and
that one, and that one.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:50.740
Let me actually put in-- let's
call this a, b, and c here.

00:53:50.740 --> 00:53:53.680
And we can call that d.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.280
So we have s and d as
being part of the cut,

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:01.450
in terms of s, capital S. And
the other ones are in cap T.

00:54:01.450 --> 00:54:05.330
And so what I have is
I could do Sa and Sb.

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.170
So I've got 2 plus 2, all right?

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:12.230
And this would
correspond to Sa and Sb.

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.030
So those are going out, right?

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.620
So far, so good.

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:19.170
And then, I'm going to write
out a bunch of numbers here,

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:24.260
minus 2 plus 1 minus 1 plus 2.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:29.640
And the minus 2, where
would the minus 2 come from?

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.970
Well, an a,d, for example,
is a minus 2, right?

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:37.940
Because d is part
of-- it would be d, a.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:43.580
So a, d has a flow
of 2, correct?

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.560
And so d, a has a flow
of minus 2, right?

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.280
And d, a is part of
what I have here,

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.241
because d is part of capital
S, and A is part of capital T.

00:54:52.241 --> 00:54:52.990
You guys see that?

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:57.670
So this is not trivial,
so pay attention.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.270
So this would be, for
example, the minus 2

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:07.150
would correspond to d, a.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:08.470
That's what I need here.

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:12.270
And I could also have--
what do I have here?

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.560
I have something
is going into d.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.170
So a c, d is 1.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.990
So d, c is minus 1, right?

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:21.410
Make sense?

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:22.900
d, c is minus 1.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.615
What about the plus 1?

00:55:24.615 --> 00:55:25.823
Where do I get a plus 1 from?

00:55:29.064 --> 00:55:29.990
STUDENT: d, b.

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:32.130
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
d, b is going out.

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.530
That's exactly right, d, b.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:39.120
And the plus 2, it
would be d, T, right?

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:46.760
And so you have to
do the enumeration.

00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.520
It's worthwhile doing once.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.160
And then it gets kind of boring.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.300
We won't to do it again.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.930
But you have to realize that
you have to absolutely look

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:58.540
at every pair of vertices.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.190
And you have to
use skew symmetry

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.400
and ensure that, even
though there's actually

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.729
no edge going out, if
there's an edge coming in,

00:56:06.729 --> 00:56:07.770
you've got to count that.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:09.840
And that's going
to get a negative.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.212
Whatever is coming in,
you've got to subtract, OK?

00:56:12.212 --> 00:56:13.420
So it's not that complicated.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.400
Yeah, go ahead.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.797
STUDENT: Do we
not consider S, c?

00:56:15.797 --> 00:56:16.963
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: I'm sorry?

00:56:16.963 --> 00:56:19.220
STUDENT: Do we
not consider S, c?

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.110
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So
the beauty of this

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:28.760
is that, when you don't have
a particular edge from S to c,

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:32.420
you can use skew symmetry
to argue that S, c and c,

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.300
S cancel out each
other, all right?

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.680
So that's the good part, right?

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.360
And thanks for
asking the question.

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:39.730
That's a good question.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.230
All right.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.729
Here you go.

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.950
So you can do that by
just looking at the edges.

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:50.940
And you can add up the
numbers, all right?

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:53.970
And so I don't
think this is going

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.930
to be absolutely
crucial to understand

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:59.220
the rest of the lecture.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.630
Keep this in mind, that
there's a process by which you

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:07.310
define the value of a cut.

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.490
And we're going to
get back to this,

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:12.470
when we prove the max-flow
min-cut theorem next time.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.680
But at this point, I want
to say something actually

00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.710
much more straightforward,
which is going to be important

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.100
when we look at
residual networks, which

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.790
is the last concept that
we need to get at before we

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:27.090
get to an algorithm.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:35.580
And that is simply that
the capacity of a cut

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.760
and the relationship between
the capacity of the cut

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:42.650
and the flow of a cut.

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:44.640
So the capacity of
a cut is c(S,T).

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.690
Oops.

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.140
I didn't draw that properly.

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.190
Open brackets,
capital S, capital T.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.480
And we can do it exactly
the same way, except this

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:03.150
is a lot simpler, because
you only look at edges

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.550
and you only have
positive quantities.

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.490
So in this case,
you'll simply say

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:12.670
it's 3 plus 2, corresponding
to-- what did I have here?

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:18.310
I had d, a-- S, a and S, d.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:23.580
And then, the
capacity is you only

00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:27.610
need to look at the edges
that go from a node in S

00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:34.900
to a node in capital T.
And so those are 1 plus 3.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:41.190
And this simply would
be the 1 would be d, b.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:46.490
And the 3 is d, t.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:49.190
So you don't care
about the other flows.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:51.800
This is not about flows, this
is simply about capacity.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:58.820
So this adds up to 9, OK?

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:05.840
And so we have, at
this point, we have

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.480
defined the flow through a cut.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.440
And we know the
capacity of a cut, OK?

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:17.730
It's more or less obvious--
though you could certainly

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.930
prove a theorem which is going
to take a couple of lines--

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:35.430
to say that the
value of any flow

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:46.580
is bounded by the
capacity of any cut.

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.410
And sorry, I lied.

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:52.710
It's not a trivial proof.

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:55.380
And that is actually something
profound going on here.

00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.150
And so I'll have to explain
exactly what this means.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.820
And then we'll take a look at
how we could prove something

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.970
like this.

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:09.070
So what's cool about
this is that you're

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:12.600
saying that it's the
value of any flow is

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.740
bounded by the capacity
of any cut, OK?

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.460
And so that's an upper-bound on
the maximum flow value, right?

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.880
So I'm saying there's
all these cuts that

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:27.090
are possible in the network.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:33.100
And I'm making a statement
about what the maximum flow can

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:39.510
be, based on the values
corresponding to the capacities

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.940
of any cut, right?

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.800
So why is that the case?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:50.490
Well, we're not going to be
able to prove that fully today.

01:00:50.490 --> 01:00:52.530
That's the max-flow
min-cut theorem.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:55.620
But you can certainly
get a sense of it,

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.860
by looking at a different
characterization of the flow

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.390
value.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:05.030
So I'm going to give you one
half of the proof, at least,

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.470
and intuition about
the other half.

01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:09.740
And we'll finish it next time.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:23.928
But here's another
characterization

01:01:23.928 --> 01:01:25.092
of the flow value.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:30.680
So our lemma here,
which is going

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:41.680
to lead us to this statement,
is that, for any flow, f,

01:01:41.680 --> 01:02:00.150
and any cut, (S, T), we have
a really powerful dilemma.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.930
Maybe you should
call it a theorem.

01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.520
But it essentially
says, look, it

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.520
doesn't matter what
cut you choose,

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.090
you've got a flow
on the network.

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:14.240
And when you look at
the flow on the network,

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.247
it's going to equal the
flow across the cut.

01:02:17.247 --> 01:02:18.830
And the only reason
for this is simply

01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:22.510
because you've got the source
on one side of the cut.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:25.030
And you've got the sink on
the other side of the cut.

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.040
That's it.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.140
That's the only thing
that you need, right?

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:31.050
You dump these vertices
these into two bins.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.780
You know, dump the
source on the left,

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.550
and dump the sink on the right.

01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.000
And you compute the flow
the way we've defined it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.080
That's the flow.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:42.310
It doesn't matter how you
partition these vertices,

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:44.960
as long as you've got the
source on the left and the sink

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.830
on the right, OK?

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:50.180
And so we can prove this using
implicit summation notation.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.660
We'll do that.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:59.470
And that'll give you a
really good sense of why

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:01.820
this statement is
true, because we

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:07.170
know that, for any given
cut, the flow that cut

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:10.120
is bounded by the capacity
of that cut, right?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.730
You know that.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:17.150
But to show this, here's
how we could show that, f(S,

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:30.170
T) is f(S, V) minus f(S, S), OK?

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:33.690
So I'm playing around,
just like I did before.

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:39.480
I had taken the cap T-- I know
that S union T is cap V, right?

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.590
This is a partition.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:42.540
So I know that S
union T is cap V.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.380
So I can put a V here
and an S here, right?

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.790
And that's a subtraction
over there, of course, right?

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:53.910
So put that up here and finish
this, a couple more lines.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.260
And what can I say
about either of these?

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.471
I could say something
about one of these terms.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:09.970
Yep?

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.845
STUDENT: The one on the
right is [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:11.845 --> 01:04:13.760
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: The
one on the right is 0.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.040
So call this f(S,V).

01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:20.020
Right?

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.440
And now, I'm going to break
it up again, make it small s,

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:33.730
big V, plus f(S minus s, cap V).

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:37.400
So broken this up into
small s, which is just

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.436
joined from cap S
minus s, clearly.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.930
And what can I say about this?

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:53.500
This is a little more
subtle than, perhaps,

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:55.200
the previous question.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.820
What can I say
about that quantity?

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:00.285
I mean, the answer is not
subtle, but-- yeah, go ahead.

01:05:00.285 --> 01:05:01.660
STUDENT: That that
is equal to 0.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.850
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: And why?

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:06.175
STUDENT: Because the
cap S doesn't contain t.

01:05:06.175 --> 01:05:07.050
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Ah.

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:07.550
Beautiful.

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.200
That's right.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.310
So that's what I wanted.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:11.063
So this does not contain t.

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.650
And so, now you can use
flow conservation, right?

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:19.750
And that's the important thing.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:24.000
You can use flow conservation,
because this does not

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.110
contain t.

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.010
And then, it clearly does not
contain small s, because I just

01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:30.180
took it out of it, right?

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.780
So that goes to 0.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.460
And voila.

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:40.560
That's simply f(S, V),
which we know is f.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:43.300
We proved that.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.960
Our first implicit
summation proof

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.640
was showing that-- well,
this is a definition.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.380
Excuse me.

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.460
So we did it for the sink.

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.250
But this is simply the
definition of the flow value,

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.750
right?

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.520
So this is beautiful.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.510
I mean, it's like
fantastic, right?

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.140
Why aren't people excited?

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.520
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.810
Because I put people to sleep
before, in the hour before.

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:12.670
But this is
absolutely fantastic,

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:19.410
because this says that I
have ways of figuring out

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:24.630
what the maximum flow
of the network would be,

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:28.480
by making arbitrary cuts
through this network

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.690
and looking for capacities
of these cuts, right?

01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:35.950
Because I know that the
capacity of any cut-- and now

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.110
you see why min cut
is interesting--

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.580
but you know that the
capacity of any cut

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:43.580
is going to bound the
flow of the network,

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.130
because the flow
through a cut is

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:46.710
the flow through the network.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:50.850
So if I go through and look
at the min cut corresponding

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:53.780
to the minimum capacity
associated with the flow

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.900
network, that's going to
point me to my max flow,

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.690
because that going to be
an upper bound on the max

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:00.670
flow, right?

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:03.690
And so now you see why the
min-- not the min flow,

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:08.590
sorry-- the min-cut max-flow
theorem is an interesting one.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:13.680
But it relates-- and this is the
beginning of that relationship,

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.780
we're not quite
done to prove it--

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.420
but the beginning
of the relationship

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:23.370
is that you can look at any cut,
and you can look at the flow

01:07:23.370 --> 01:07:25.730
through the cut as being the
flow through the network.

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.355
And then you use the
second part of it,

01:07:27.355 --> 01:07:29.830
which is the capacity
bounding-- of course, in a very

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.820
simple way, because of
edge capacities-- the flow

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.780
through the cut.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.790
And you can put those two
things together, all right?

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:41.240
We still don't quite know how
to find these cuts, right?

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.250
So we don't quite know
how to find these cuts.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:45.210
And that's the last
thing that we're

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.010
going to do today,
give you a sense of how

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:48.900
we're going to find
these min cuts,

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.780
so we can find the max flow.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.060
All right?

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.270
Cool.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:59.060
So the one last
notion that we have

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.780
here that is going to allow
us to go into the algorithm

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.350
domain, as opposed to the
analysis domain-- all we've

01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:08.550
done so far is analysis,
analysis, analysis--

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:12.250
is the notion of a
residual network.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:13.330
OK?

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:16.390
And a residual network,
as its name implies,

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.850
is something that has
residual capacities.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:22.550
It's the network that
points you to places

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:27.029
where you can increase the flow,
because there's capacity left.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:29.439
Your flow is less than
the edge capacity.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.990
It's a local notion, so
it's easy to compute.

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:36.010
There's a capacity of 3 on
this edge, there's a flow of 2.

01:08:36.010 --> 01:08:38.300
The residual
capacity is 1, right?

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.020
3 minus 2.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:55.370
And so the residual
network Gf (V, Ef), right?

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:57.891
So the actual
network is G(V, E).

01:08:57.891 --> 01:08:59.640
And the vertices are
going to be the same.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.170
The graph is
obviously different,

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.836
but the edges are
going to be different.

01:09:02.836 --> 01:09:05.430
There's going to be a
different set of edges

01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:08.870
in the residual network, as
opposed to the flow network,

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:10.430
OK?

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:17.920
And you have strictly positive.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.140
That means greater than
0, strictly greater

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.609
than 0, residual capacities.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:39.840
So Cf ) equals
c(u,v) minus f(u,v).

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.380
And that's strictly
greater than 0.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.740
I'm going to put an
edge in there, if there

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:45.819
is a residual capacity.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:49.420
0 doesn't mean there's
any residual capacity.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:10:00.144
Edges in Ef admit more flow, OK?

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.820
And one last thing.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:13.550
If (V, u) does not belong to
E-- so we are talking about

01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:17.270
the original network here, E
means the original network--

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:22.790
then we know c(V, u) equals 0.

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:24.070
That was our definition.

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:27.490
If you don't have that
edge, the capacity is 0.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:32.680
But we are talking
now about f, which

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.540
is a flow, which
doesn't necessarily

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.980
require that there be an edge.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:43.740
And we are simply going to use
our skew symmetry relationship.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:47.290
And you'll see that this may not
be completely clear as to why

01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:49.250
I wrote this at this moment.

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:51.180
But as I draw the
residual network,

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.210
you'll see why
that is important.

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.710
It's going to be
the case that we're

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:59.200
going to have extra edges
in the residual network that

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.430
don't exist in the
original network,

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:05.130
because of that last
line there, right?

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.980
So let me clear that up.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:11.600
So we're going to draw
a residual network

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.470
for-- I'm going to
change that yet again--

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:18.660
but we're going to draw
the residual network

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.870
for our example up there.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.760
Topology is going
to stay the same.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.530
Numbers are going
to change, because I

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:30.340
want something slightly
more interesting than what

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.800
we have there.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:40.940
So I'm going to take
this out-- 2, 1.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:46.630
1, 2-- go back to what
it was before, I think.

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:50.983
1-- all right.

01:11:50.983 --> 01:11:51.730
Good.

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:55.610
So I want a 1 over here.

01:11:55.610 --> 01:12:02.260
I want a 1 over
here, a 2 over here.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:07.720
And keep checking to make
sure I'm not messing up here,

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.800
in terms of flow constraints.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.284
But that's pretty
much all I got.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.850
OK?

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:22.530
So the flow here and the s and
t don't particularly matter.

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:24.090
The max flow is 4.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:26.560
The flow that you
see up there is 3.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.570
This is what we had right
at the beginning, all right?

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:32.110
So what I want to
do now is give you

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:35.840
what the residual network
is for this particular flow.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.820
Remember, the residual network
is defined, based on a flow.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:43.050
That's why you have
Gf, G subscript f.

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:43.682
f is a flow.

01:12:43.682 --> 01:12:45.890
So you're going to have a
different residual network,

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:47.090
if the flow is different.

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:48.834
So that original
example that I had

01:12:48.834 --> 01:12:50.500
would have a different
residual network.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.666
This one is going to have
the one I'm going to draw,

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:53.650
all right?

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:57.490
So the residual network has
the same set of vertices.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:01.080
So I can go ahead and
draw these vertices.

01:13:05.690 --> 01:13:08.200
I'll just mark T
and S over here.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.250
Those are exactly
the same as before.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.920
And this is Gf, OK?

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.400
That's a residual network.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.140
And the edges are
going to be different.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:19.100
All I have to do is
look up there and say,

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.850
look, I'm going to have a
residual capacity of 2--

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:27.920
let me use a different
color, since I have them--

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.520
corresponding to that
edge from S to a,

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.340
because I clearly
have a capacity of 3,

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.300
and I only have a
flow of 1, right?

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.080
So that's all there is to it.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.980
Now, the interesting thing
is that, because of this line

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:49.560
over here, I'm actually going
to define an edge in Ef, in Gf

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.300
or Ef, that corresponds to this
edge that didn't exist in E,

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:58.470
because I can shrink
the flow from 1 to 0.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:03.190
And that essentially says that
that shrinkage is represented

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:05.430
in the residual
network by an edge that

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:09.880
goes from this node, a,
up there, to s, right?

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.280
And that is going to have a
residual capacity of 1, right?

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.190
So that's it.

01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:19.450
That's the only
extra thing that you

01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.960
have to remember when you
draw the residual network.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.550
You not only can increase the
flow, you can also shrink it.

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:30.080
You have to represent
the shrinkage of the flow

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.230
by an edge in the
residual network.

01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:34.740
And you obviously represent
the increase of the flow

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.434
by an edge in the
residual network.

01:14:36.434 --> 01:14:38.600
And now you see why this
is all going to make sense.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:43.180
Remember, way back, eons
ago, only an hour ago,

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.650
but we had this
example where we had

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.020
to shrink the flow
in a particular edge,

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.460
in order to get the overall
flow to increase, right?

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.680
The residual network
is going to point us

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.200
in the direction of,
potentially, those edges whose

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.590
flow has to shrink.

01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:06.100
But they're going to be
represented, in effect,

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:09.360
as these reverse edges with
positive numbers associated

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:09.860
with them.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.140
So there's a 1 here.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.610
It's positive, because
it goes from this node,

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.530
call it a, back to s.

01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:21.370
And if I shrink
this from 1 to 0,

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:24.970
that is, in effect,
taking what I have up here

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.177
and making this 1 as 0, OK?

01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:29.010
That's the way you want
to think about this.

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:31.410
So that's pretty much it.

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.110
I could draw out
the rest of this,

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:36.360
and it should all make sense.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.600
I have an edge like that.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:48.620
So the edges that are
at capacity up there

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.510
aren't going to show up here.

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.090
The edges that are not at
capacity end up with two edges

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:57.690
down below, if they have a
flow that is non-zero, right?

01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:00.335
If you have a 0 flow
up there, you're

01:16:00.335 --> 01:16:01.460
only going to get one edge.

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.750
Obviously, you'll get one
edge, because the capacity is

01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:06.700
non-zero.

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:09.380
But the ones that are
not quite at capacity end

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.740
up to two edges, right?

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:13.030
Think of that as
being the simple rule.

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:15.220
And make sure that I'm
following this rule.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.952
Good exercise is to check
for bugs, lecture bugs.

01:16:19.952 --> 01:16:21.576
Best way of understanding
the material.

01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:35.920
OK?

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.350
So that's my residual network.

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:43.060
And let me just point--
I'll put in some numbers.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.850
Or maybe you can tell me what
some of these numbers are.

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:46.750
What is this number?

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:47.590
STUDENT: 2.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:49.200
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: 2.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:49.700
Right?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.620
Now, this is a
little more tricky.

01:16:51.620 --> 01:16:53.774
Take a look at the
number that goes up,

01:16:53.774 --> 01:16:55.190
versus the number
that comes down.

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:56.160
What is this number?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:56.680
Goes up.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.980
STUDENTS: 2.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.390
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: That's 2,
because I can go from 1 to 3.

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:01.431
And this number would be?

01:17:01.431 --> 01:17:02.150
STUDENTS: 1.

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.316
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Beautiful.

01:17:03.316 --> 01:17:04.740
All right, you guys got it.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.543
Did my job.

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.060
All right, so that's
our residual network

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:21.460
for this particular flow.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.430
So a mechanical way
of computing it.

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:27.690
And you should be
able to do that.

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:33.780
Now what exactly can we do
with this residual network?

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.780
It turns out that
the algorithm now

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:41.280
can be described in a
couple of sentences, right?

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.042
Essentially our
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm--

01:17:43.042 --> 01:17:44.750
I'm not going to bother
writing this out,

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:46.230
because I'm going
to have to prove

01:17:46.230 --> 01:17:48.300
the max-flow min-cut
theorem next time.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:50.770
And we're going to talk about
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:52.614
and issues with it next time.

01:17:52.614 --> 01:17:55.030
But I'm going to show you how
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:57.240
works on this
particular example.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.590
And it's only going to
have one step, all right?

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.560
So it's going to
converge in one step.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.570
So it's going to
be relatively easy.

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:07.670
But the bottom line is the
the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:18.050
is going to look for
augmenting paths in Gf.

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:22.940
Augmenting paths are defined
in the residual network.

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.290
What is an augmenting
path, you ask?

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:31.724
Well, an augmenting path is
simply a path from s in Gf

01:18:31.724 --> 01:18:34.810
to t in Gf, OK?

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.107
That's it.

01:18:36.107 --> 01:18:37.190
That's all there is to it.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:40.250
If you can find a path, you
could use depth-first search,

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.920
you could use
breadth-first search,

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.510
you could use
whatever you wanted.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:48.150
You find a path from s to t, OK?

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:52.270
If you find such a path,
if this path exists,

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:57.140
it means that the flow
is not maximum, OK?

01:18:57.140 --> 01:19:01.870
If no path exists, the flow
is maximum, and you're done.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.910
If such a path
exists, you will be

01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:07.470
able to increase the flow,
in this case, because we

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:11.180
have integral quantities,
by at least one, OK?

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.600
And you will be able to
increase the flow by one.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.080
And not only that,
the augmenting path

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:20.470
is going to tell you exactly
what to do with respect to what

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:23.850
edges to change,
sometimes subtract

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:26.585
the flow from, sometimes
increase, right?

01:19:26.585 --> 01:19:28.710
So the augmenting path is
going to take care of it.

01:19:28.710 --> 01:19:30.992
But you've flipped it, so
everything is positive.

01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:32.650
You know, life is great.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:34.090
Positive numbers.

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:39.570
Just look at s to t and
give me any path from s

01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:45.160
to t here in the
residual network.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:53.030
So let me just call
them a, b, d, and c.

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:54.780
And we don't care about
partitions or cuts

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:55.640
at this point.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.410
That's required for proofs.

01:19:57.410 --> 01:20:02.452
But give me a path from
s to t Yeah, go ahead.

01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:04.320
STUDENT: S to a, a to b--

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.910
All right a little
bit more slowly.

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:09.060
s a, OK.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:09.654
And then?

01:20:09.654 --> 01:20:10.320
STUDENT: a to b.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.880
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: a to b.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:12.932
Beautiful.

01:20:12.932 --> 01:20:14.170
STUDENT: b to c.

01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:15.493
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: b to c.

01:20:15.493 --> 01:20:16.582
STUDENT: c to t.

01:20:16.582 --> 01:20:17.790
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: And c to t.

01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:18.900
Wonderful.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:26.520
And I have a capacity, a
residual capacity, of 2 here.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:31.270
I have a residual capacity of
1 here, 1 here, and 1 here.

01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:38.790
And so the value of this
augmenting path is 1, right?

01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:43.330
It's not 2, because the
minimum value is what

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:45.850
I can push through the network.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:48.160
And I just need to
take the min of all

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.030
of the residual capacities
corresponding to the edges

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:53.160
that I traversed,
that correspond

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:54.320
to this particular path.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.180
And that min value of
2, 1, 1, 1, is 1, right?

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:02.240
So what this means is I've
discovered an augmenting path

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.670
of residual capacity, 1.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.840
Now I can go back to
this thing over here.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.760
And these edges are going
to point me, in some cases,

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:18.540
to complimentary edges, in some
cases to the direct edges that

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.200
are going to have to have their
flows changed, either increased

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:27.110
or decreased, to increase the
flow in the original network.

01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:29.520
So you're guaranteed
now that f, which

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.150
caused this residual network to
have an augmenting path in it

01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:34.750
was not maximum.

01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.860
You're guaranteed that, because
you found this path, OK?

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.760
So what happens here?

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.150
Well, you go back up
and you say, remember,

01:21:42.150 --> 01:21:44.170
I'm going to
increment by plus 1,

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:46.700
because that's the
residual capacity.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.050
So I'm going to go up
here, and I have s to a.

01:21:50.050 --> 01:21:51.890
You'll need to
help me out again.

01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:55.310
So I'm going to make
this 2, because I

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.800
needed to add a one to it.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.100
What happens here?

01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.652
This is the key step.

01:21:59.652 --> 01:22:00.644
STUDENT: Subtract.

01:22:00.644 --> 01:22:04.280
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Subtract
and make this a 0, right?

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.620
We're not quite done.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.775
What's next?

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:11.380
I have b to c, right?

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.609
Right?

01:22:12.609 --> 01:22:13.650
You're still on the hook.

01:22:13.650 --> 01:22:14.400
STUDENT: [LAUGHS].

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.000
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
b to c becomes?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:16.500
STUDENT: 3.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:17.150
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: 3.

01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:17.650
Right.

01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:24.101
And then, lastly,
this becomes 2.

01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:28.600
OK?

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.300
And at this point, if you
create a residual network

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.690
for this new flow,
you will not be

01:22:35.690 --> 01:22:39.630
able to find a path in that
residual network from s to t.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:41.310
And you know you're done, right?

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:43.790
So all of this works.

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:46.450
We haven't quite shown that
it works, because we haven't

01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:48.440
done enough of the proofs.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:50.237
But you have a sense
as to why this works.

01:22:50.237 --> 01:22:51.570
You could probably code this up.

01:22:51.570 --> 01:22:52.860
It would all work.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.600
A couple of issues
in applications.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.050
See you next time.
