00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.520
PROFESSOR: All right, welcome
to the final lecture of 6046.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.617
Today we continue our theme
of cache oblivious algorithms.

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:30.200
We're going to look
at two of the most

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.259
basic problems in
computer science--

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.080
searching and sorting,
a little bit of each.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.510
And then I'll tell you a
little bit about what class

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.450
you might take after this one.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.970
So brief recap of the model,
we introduced two models

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.430
of computation although one was
just a variation of the other.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.020
The base model is an
external memory model.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.820
This is a two-level
memory hierarchy.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.890
CPU and cache, we view as one.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.240
So there's instant
communication between them,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.760
which means what
you're computing on

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.469
can involve this cache of size
m-- total size of the cache

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.320
is m-- words.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.110
The cache is divided into
these blocks of size b each.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
So they're m over b blocks.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.710
And your problem doesn't
fit here, presumably,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.730
or the problem's not
very interesting.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.990
So your problem size n is
going to require storing

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.220
your information on disk.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.400
So the input is really
provided over here.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370
Disk is basically
infinite in size.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.170
It's also partitioned
into blocks.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.930
And you can't access
individual items here.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.480
You can only access
entire blocks.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.390
So the model is you say,
I want to read this block

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.670
and put it here.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.667
I want to write this
block out and put it here.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.250
That's what you're allowed to
do in the external memory model.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.609
And what we count is how many
block-memory transfers we do.

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:47.900
We call those memory transfers.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.520
So you want to minimize that.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.450
And usually you
don't worry too much

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.575
about what happens in here,
although you could also

00:01:53.575 --> 00:01:57.010
minimize regular running
time as we usually do.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.260
The cache oblivious variation
is that the algorithm is not

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.870
allowed to know the
cache parameters.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.150
It's not allowed to
know the block size.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.700
Sorry, it's also block
size b in the disk.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.509
So they match.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.150
And you're not allowed to
know the cache size, m.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.150
Because of that, all the
block reads and writes

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.160
are done automatically.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.190
So the model is, whenever
you access an item,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.650
you view the disk
as just written row

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.570
by row-- sequentially
block by block.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.610
So in linear eyes, it looks like
this, partitioned into blocks.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.780
And so whenever
you touch an item,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.330
the system automatically
loads that block.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.520
If it's not already in
cache, it loads it in.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.490
If it's already in
cache, it's free.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.042
When you load a block
in, you probably

00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:44.250
already have something there.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.570
So if the cache is
already full, you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.250
have to decide
which one to evict.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.800
And we had a couple
of strategies.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.130
But the one I defined was the
least-recently-used block.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.290
So whichever one in the
cache that's least recently

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.320
been used by the
CPU, that's the one

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.970
that gets written
out, back to disk

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.460
where it originally came from.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.062
And that's it.

00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:03.830
That's the model.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.970
OK, this is a pretty good
model of how real caches work.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.410
Although this last part is
not how all real caches work.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.280
It's close.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.560
And at the very end, I
mentioned this theorem

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.610
that Why LRU is good.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.830
And if you take
the number of block

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.930
evictions-- the
number of block reads,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.530
equivalently-- then LRU has
to do on a cache of size m.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.280
Then that's going to be,
at most, twice whatever

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.260
the best possible
thing you could do

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.370
is given a cache
of size m over 2.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.860
So we're restricting OPT.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.680
We're kind of tying OPT's hands
behind his back a little bit

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.100
by decreasing m
by a factor of 2.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.150
But then we get a factor of
2 approximation, basically.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150
So this was the
resource augmentation.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.380
And this is regular
approximation algorithms.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.880
In general, this is a world
called online algorithms, which

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360
is a whole field.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.430
I'm just going to
mention it briefly here.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.270
The distinction here
is LRU, or whatever

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.370
we implement in a
real system, has

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.360
to make a decision based only
on the past of what's happened.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.610
The system, we're assuming,
doesn't know the future.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.790
So in a compiler, maybe you
could try to predict the future

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.870
and do something.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.830
But on a CPU, it
doesn't know what

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.040
instruction's going to come
next, 10 steps in the future.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.220
So you just have to
make a decision now,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.220
sort of your best guess.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.490
And least recently used
is a good best guess.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.340
OPT, on the other hand,
we're giving a lot of power.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.245
This is what we call
an offline algorithm.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.880
It's like the Q in Star
Trek: Next Generation

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.920
or some other mythical being.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.640
It lives outside
of the timeline.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.910
It can see all of time and say,
I think I'll evict this block.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.830
This is like the waste
of Q's resources.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.340
But I'll evict this
block because I

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.880
know it's going to be used
for this in the future.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.060
LRU is evicting the thing that
was used farthest in the past.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.380
There's a difference there.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.350
And it could be
a big difference.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.620
But it turns out they're
related in this way.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.830
So this is what we call
an online algorithm,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.737
meaning you have to make
decisions as you go.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.570
The offline algorithm
gets to see the future

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.000
and optimize accordingly.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.813
Both are computable, but this
one's only computable if you

00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:29.170
know the future, which we don't.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.660
What I haven't done
is prove this theorem.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.015
It's actually really easy proof.

00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:37.640
So let's do it.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:51.612
I want to take the timeline
and divide it into phases.

00:05:51.612 --> 00:05:52.765
Phases sounds cool.

00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:13.770
So this is going
to be an analysis.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.340
And in an analysis,
we're allowed

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.631
to know the future because
we're trying to imagine what

00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.200
OPT could do relative to LRU.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.450
So we're fixing the algorithm.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.965
It's obviously not
using the future.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.340
When we analyze it, we're
assuming we do know the future.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.009
We know the entire timeline.

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.800
So all the algorithms
we covered last time,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.341
all the ones we covered today
you can think of as just making

00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.470
a sequence of accesses.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.010
They're making sequences
of accesses to elements.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.130
But if we assume
we know what b is,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.000
that's just a sequence
of accesses to blocks.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.590
OK so you can just
think of the timeline

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.010
as a sequence of block IDs.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.680
And if you access a block that's
currently stored in cache,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.400
it's free.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.380
Otherwise, you pay 1.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.970
All right, so I'm just going
to look at the timeline of all

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.530
these accesses and say, well,
take a prefix of the accesses

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.640
until I get to m over b
distinct blocks, block IDs.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.900
Keep going until,
if I went one more,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.230
I'd have m over b plus
1 distinct blocks.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.780
So it's a maximal prefix of
m over b distinct blocks.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.080
Cut there.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.940
And then repeat.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.960
So start over.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.810
Start counting at zero.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.400
Extend until I have m over
b distinct block accesses.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.580
And if I went one more, I'd
have m over b plus 1 and so on.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.160
So the timeline gets divided.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.660
Who knows?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.660
It could be totally irregular.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.120
If you access the same
blocks many times,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.150
you could get along for a
very long time and only access

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.220
m over b distinct blocks.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.790
Who knows?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.410
The algorithm
definitely doesn't know

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.930
because it doesn't know m or b.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.570
But from an analysis
perspective,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:47.920
we can just count these things.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:55.990
So each of these has exactly
m over b distinct accesses,

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.860
distinct block IDs.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:05.610
So I have two claims
about such a phase.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:17.940
First claim is that LRU with
a cache of size m on one phase

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.120
is, at most, what?

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.260
It's easy.

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:29.497
STUDENT: M over b.

00:08:29.497 --> 00:08:30.330
PROFESSOR: M over b.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.690
The claim is, at most,
m over b basically

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.070
because the LRU
is not brain dead.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:45.360
Well, you're accessing
these blocks.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.480
And they've all been
accessed more recently.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.044
I mean, let's look
at this phase.

00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:50.460
All the blocks
that you touch here

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.570
have been accessed more recently
than whatever came before.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.290
That's the definition
of this timeline.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.980
This is an order by time.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.980
So anything you
load in here, you

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.314
will keep preferentially
over the things that

00:09:00.314 --> 00:09:02.480
are not in the phase because
everything in the phase

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.190
has been accessed more recently.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.980
So maybe, eventually, you
load all m over b blocks

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.270
that are in the phase.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.480
Everything else you touch,
by definition of a phase,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.440
are the same blocks.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.400
So they will remain in cache.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.810
And that's all it
will cost, m over b

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.820
memory transfers per phase.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.351
So this is basically ignoring
any carry over from phase

00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:22.850
to phase.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.270
This is a conservative
upper bounds.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.237
But it's an upper bounds.

00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:30.320
And then the other question
is, what could OPT do?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.160
So OPT-- remember, we're tying
its hands behind its back.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.834
It only has a cache
of size m over 2.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.375
And then we're
evaluating on a phase.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.140
I want to claim that OPT is,
well, at least half of that

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.650
if I want to get a factor of 2.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.700
So I claim it's at
least 1/2 m over b.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.180
Why?

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.330
Now we have to think
about carry over.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.019
So OPT did something
in this phase.

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:13.560
And then we're wondering what
happens in the very next phase.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.520
So some of these blocks may
be shared with these blocks.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.150
We don't know.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.608
I mean, there's
some set of blocks.

00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:21.590
We know that this very first
block was not in the set,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.540
otherwise the phase
would have been longer.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.160
But maybe some
later block happens

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.105
to repeat some block
that's over there.

00:10:27.105 --> 00:10:27.980
We don't really know.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.060
There could be some carry over.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.930
So how lucky could OPT be?

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.770
At this moment in
time, at the beginning

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.970
of the phase we're
looking at, it

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:41.060
could be the entire cache
has things that we want,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.730
has blocks that
appear in this phase.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.800
That's the maximum carry
over, the entire cache.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:56.750
So sort of the best case for
OPT is that the entire cache

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:08.067
is useful, meaning it
contains blocks in the phase

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:10.150
that we're interested in--
the phase we're looking

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.340
at-- at the start of the phase.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:17.720
That's the best case.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.640
But because we gave up only m
over 2, that means, at most,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.120
one half m over b blocks.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.090
This was cache size.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.140
This is the number of
blocks in the cache.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.790
At most, this many
blocks will be free,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.460
won't cost anything for OPT.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.242
But by definition, the phase
has m over b distinct blocks.

00:11:43.242 --> 00:11:44.450
So half of them will be free.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.850
The other half, OPT is
going to have to load in.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.500
So it's a kind of
trivial analysis.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.040
It's amazing this
proof is so simple.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.520
It's all about setting
things up right.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.890
If you define phases
that are good for LRU,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.545
then they're also
bad for OPT when

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:03.730
it has cache at half the size.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.460
And so OPT has to pay
at least half what

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.560
LRU is definitely paying.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.060
Here we can forget
about carry over.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.940
Here we're bounding
the carry over just

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.920
by making the cache smaller.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.420
That's it.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.140
So this is a most twice that.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:19.230
And so we get the theorem.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.480
I mean, changing the cache
size could dramatically

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.010
change the number of cache
reads that you have to do

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.300
or disk reads it you
have to do into cache.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.360
But in all of the
algorithms we will cover,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.510
we're giving some
bound in terms of m.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.470
That bound will
always be, at most,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.850
some polynomial dependence in m.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.985
Usually it's like a 1 over
m, 1 over square root of m,

00:12:41.985 --> 00:12:45.090
1 over log m,
something like that.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.940
All of those bounds
will only be affected

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.610
by a constant factor when you
change m by a constant factor.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.065
So this is good enough for
cache oblivious algorithms.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.990
All right, so that's
sort of review of why

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.580
this model is reasonable.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.520
LRU is good.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.030
So now we're going to talk about
two basic problems-- searching

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:13.986
for stuff in array, sorting an
array in both of these models.

00:13:13.986 --> 00:13:15.610
We won't be able to
do everything cache

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.430
obliviously today.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.370
But they're are all possible.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.510
It just takes more
time than we have.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.150
We'll give you more of a flavor
of how these things work.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.141
Again, the theme is going to
be divide and conquer, my glass

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:28.640
class.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.590
So let's say we have n elements.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.007
Let's say, for simplicity,
we're in the comparison models.

00:13:43.007 --> 00:13:44.798
So all we can really
do with those elements

00:13:44.798 --> 00:13:47.020
is compare them-- less
than, greater than, equal.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.620
And let's say we
want to do search

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.601
in the comparison model, which
I'll think of as a predecessor

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:56.100
search.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.770
So given a new element
x, I want to find,

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.880
what is the previous element?

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.520
What's the largest element
smaller than x in my set?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.130
I'm thinking of these n
elements as static, let's say.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.990
You can generalize
everything I say to have

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.640
insertions and deletions.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.030
But let's not worry
about that for now.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.190
I just want to
store them somehow

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:26.210
in order to enable search.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.810
So any suggestions in external
memory model or cache oblivious

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:31.410
model?

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.950
How would you do this?

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.450
[STUDENT COUGHS]

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.020
This may sound
easy, but it's not.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.860
But that's OK.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.370
You know, I like easy
answers, simple answers.

00:14:48.156 --> 00:14:49.280
There's two simple answers.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.160
One is correct, one is wrong.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:55.240
But I like both, so I
want to analyze both.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:55.740
Yeah?

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.740
STUDENT: Store them
sorted in order?

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.940
PROFESSOR: Store them
sorted in order, good.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.620
That's how we'd normally
solve this problem.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.850
So let's see how it does.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.540
I thought I had
solution, too, here.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.180
But that's OK.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:25.960
Binary search in a sorted array,
sort the elements in order.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.810
And then to do a query,
binary search on it.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.610
So you remember binary search.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.050
You've got an array.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:33.690
You start in the middle.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.480
Then let's say the element
looking for is way over here.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.930
So then we'll go over this way
and go there, this way, there,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.870
this way, log n time.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.039
I mean, binary search
is, in a certain sense,

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:48.330
a divide and conquer algorithm.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.920
You only recurse on one side,
but it's divide and conquer.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.180
So divide and conquer is good.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.770
Surely binary search is good.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.190
If only it were that simple.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.290
So sort of orthogonal
to this picture--

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.620
maybe I'll just draw
it on one side--

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.105
there's a division into blocks.

00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:07.480
And in a cache
oblivious setting,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.120
we don't know where that falls.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.930
But the point is,
for the most part,

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.345
every one of these
accesses we do

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:21.420
as we go farther and farther to
the right-- almost all of them

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.860
will be in a different block.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.670
The middle one is very far
away from the 3/4 mark.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.800
It is very far away from
the 7/8 mark, and so on,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.397
up until the very end.

00:16:30.397 --> 00:16:31.980
Let's say we're
searching for the max.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.800
So this will hold
for all of them.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.425
At the end, once we're within
a problem of size order b,

00:16:38.425 --> 00:16:40.300
then there's only a
constant number of blocks

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.180
that we're touching.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.440
And so from then on, everything
will be free, basically.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.880
So if you think
about it carefully,

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.040
the obvious upper
bound-- this is

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:59.074
our usual recurrence for binary
search-- would be constant.

00:16:59.074 --> 00:17:01.490
And what we hope to gain here
is, basically, a better base

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.890
case.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.973
And I claim that all you
get in terms of base case

00:17:03.973 --> 00:17:08.349
here is t of b equals order 1.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.640
And, if you think
about it, this just

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.369
solves to log n
minus log b, which

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:22.089
is the same thing as
log n over b, which

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.557
is a small improvement
over just regular log n

00:17:25.557 --> 00:17:26.640
but not a big improvement.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.992
I claim we can do better.

00:17:29.992 --> 00:17:31.575
You've actually seen
how to do better.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.140
But maybe we didn't tell you.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.690
So it's a data structure you've
seen already-- b tree, yeah.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.750
So because we weren't thinking
about this memory hierarchy

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.300
business when we
said b tree, we meant

00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:00.520
like 2-4 trees or 5-10
trees or some constant bound

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.330
on the degree of each node.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:08.740
But if you make the degree of
the node b-- or some theta b,

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:12.560
b approximate-- so you allow
a big branching factor.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.340
It's got to be somewhere, let's
say, between b over 2 and b.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.430
Then we can store all of these
pointers and all of these keys

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.790
in a constant number of blocks.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.780
And so if we're doing just
search, as we navigate down

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.220
the b tree we'll spend
order 1 block reads

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:33.210
to load in this node and then
figure out which way to go.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.960
And then let's
say it's this way.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.320
And then we'll spend
order 1 memory transfers

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.782
to read this node then
figure out which way to go.

00:18:39.782 --> 00:18:41.990
So the cost is going to be
proportional to the height

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:48.050
of the tree, which is
just log base b of n

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.360
up to the constant
factors because we're

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.090
between b over 2 and b.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.150
But that will affect
this by a factor of 2.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.470
So we can do search in
a b tree in the log base

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.420
b of n memory transfers.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:19.310
OK, remember, log base b of
n is log n divided by log b.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.400
So this is a lot better.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.650
Here we had log n minus log b.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.910
Now we have log n
divided by log b.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.200
And this turns
out to be optimal.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.810
In the comparison model, this
is the best you can hope to do,

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.500
so good news.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.054
The bad news is we kind
of critically needed

00:19:36.054 --> 00:19:36.845
to know what b was.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.230
B trees really only make
sense if you what b is.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.310
You need to know the
branching factor.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.562
So this is not a cache
oblivious data structure.

00:19:50.562 --> 00:19:51.770
But it has other nice things.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:53.770
We can actually do inserts
and deletes, as well.

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.190
So I said static, but if
you want dynamic insert

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.850
and deleting elements, you
can also do those in log base

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:01.410
b of n memory transfers using
exactly the algorithms we've

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.400
seen with splits and merges.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.700
So all that's good.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.760
But I want to do it cache
obviously-- just the search

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.260
for now.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.890
And this is not obvious.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.580
But it's our good
friend van Emde Boas.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.360
So despite the name, this
is not a data structure

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.720
that van Emde Boas.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.150
But it's inspired by the data
structure that we covered.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.350
And it's actually a solution
by Harold [INAUDIBLE],

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.010
who did the m-edge
thesis on this work.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.909
In the conclusion, it's
like, oh, by the way,

00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:49.950
here's how you do search.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.030
It seems like the best
page of that thesis.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.330
And then I think we called
it van Emde Boas because we

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.870
thought it was reminiscent.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.960
So here's the idea.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.927
Take all the items
you want to store.

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:06.260
And you're really tempted to
store them in sorted order,

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.820
but I'm not going to do that.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.400
I'm going to use some other
divide and conquer order.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.650
First thing I'm going to
do is take those elements,

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.280
put them in a perfectly
balanced binary search tree.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.780
So this is a BSTT-- not a
b tree, just a binary tree

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.050
because I don't know what b is.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.380
So then maybe the
median's up here.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.200
And then there's two
children and so on.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.340
OK, the mean's over here.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.860
The max is over
here, a regular BST.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.360
Now we know how to
search in a tree.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.290
You just walk down.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.240
The big question
is, in what order

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.755
should I store these nodes?

00:21:40.755 --> 00:21:42.380
If I just store them
in a random order,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.790
this is going to be super
bad-- log n memory transfers.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.180
But I claim, if I
do a clever order,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.320
I can achieve log base b
of n, which is optimal.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:59.220
So van Emde Boas suggests
cutting this tree

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.331
in the middle.

00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.080
Why in the middle?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.730
This was n nodes over here.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.930
And we're breaking it up
into a square root of n nodes

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:14.530
at the top because the height
of this overall tree is log n.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.940
If we split it in half,
the height of the tree

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.010
is half log n.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.310
2 to the half log n is root n.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.850
I'm losing some
constant factors,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:24.710
but let's just call it root n.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.650
Then we've got, at the bottom,
everything looks the same.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.920
We're going to have a whole
bunch of trees of size

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.780
square root of n, hopefully.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:41.340
OK, that's what happens when
I cut in the middle level.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.560
Then I recurse.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.700
And what am I recursing?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.550
What am I doing?

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.060
This is a layout.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.020
Last time, we did a very
similar thing with matrices.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.210
We had an n by n matrix.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.350
We divided it into four n
over 2 by n over 2 matrices.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:23:00.530
We recursively laid out the
1/4, wrote those out in order

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.830
so it was consecutive.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.840
Then we laid out the next
quarter, next quarter,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.430
next quarter.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.240
The order of the
quarters didn't matter.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.239
What mattered is that
each quarter of the matrix

00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:11.900
was stored as a consecutive
unit so when recursed,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.150
good things happened.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.900
Same thing here, except now
I have roughly square root

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.720
of n plus 1.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.760
Chunks, little
triangles-- I'm going

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.185
to recursively lay them out.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.190
And then I'm going to
concatenate those layouts.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:38.880
So this one, I'm going
to recursively figure out

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.300
what order to store those
nodes and then put those all as

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.180
consecutive in the array.

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.750
And then this one goes here.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.380
This one goes here.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.100
Actually, the order
doesn't matter.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.260
But you might as well
preserve the order.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.260
So do the top one, then
the bottom ones in order.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.930
And so, recursively,
each of these ones

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.400
is going to get
cut in the middle.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.420
Recursively lay out the
top, then the next one.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.253
Let's do an example.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.510
Let's do an actual tree.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:20.350
This is actually my favorite
diagram to draw or something.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:27.580
My most frequently drawn
diagram, complete binary tree

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.410
on eight children, eight leaves.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.156
So this is 15 nodes.

00:24:33.156 --> 00:24:35.780
It happens to have a
height that's a power of 2,

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.640
so this algorithm
works especially well.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.800
So I'm going to
split it in half,

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.630
then recursively
lay out the top.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.720
To lay out the top, I'm
going to split it in half.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.260
Then I'm going to
recursively lay out the top.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.676
Well, single node-- it's pretty
clear what order to put it

00:24:47.676 --> 00:24:48.960
in with respect to itself.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.740
So that goes first,
then this, then this.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.740
Then I finish the
first recursion.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.800
Next, I'm going to
recursively lay out this thing

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.610
by cutting it in
half, laying out

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.540
the top, then the bottom parts.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.150
OK, then I'm going to
recursively layout this-- 7, 8,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:16.530
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.410
It gets even more exciting
the next level up.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.030
But it would take a
long time to draw this.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.840
But just imagine this repeated.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.920
So that would be just the
top half of some tree.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.450
Cut here, and then you
do the same thing here

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.200
and here and here.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.320
This is very different
from in-order traversal

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.200
or any other order
that we've seen.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.160
This is the van Emde Boas order.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.142
And this numbering is
supposed to be the order

00:25:39.142 --> 00:25:40.100
that I store the nodes.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.300
So when I write
this into memory,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.960
it's going to look like this--
just the nodes in order.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.757
And when I'm drawing
a circle-- wow,

00:25:48.757 --> 00:25:49.965
this is going to get tedious.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.732
And then there's pointers here.

00:25:54.732 --> 00:25:56.190
Every time I draw
a circle, there's

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.648
a left pointer and
a right pointer.

00:25:57.648 --> 00:26:00.380
So 1's going to
point to 2 and 3.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.857
2 is going to point to 4 and 7.

00:26:04.857 --> 00:26:06.690
So just take the regular
binary search tree,

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.940
but store it in this
really weird order.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:13.750
I claim this will work really
well, log base b of n search.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.690
Let's analyze it.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.220
Good first time, this is
a cache oblivious layout.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.330
I didn't use b at all.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.380
There's no b here.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.320
Start with a binary tree.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.140
And I just do this recursion.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.539
It gives me a linear
order to put the nodes in.

00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:32.330
I'm just going to store
them in that order.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.620
It's linear size, all that.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.260
Now in the analysis, again,
I'm allowed to know b.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:45.735
So let's say b is b.

00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:51.180
And let's consider the
level of recursion.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:02.610
Let's say the first
level of recursion,

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:09.030
where the triangles have less
than or equal to b nodes.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.330
So I'm thinking of this picture.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.290
I cut in the middle.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.755
Then I recursively cut in
the middle of all the pieces.

00:27:15.755 --> 00:27:17.940
Then I recursively
cut in the middle.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.320
I started out with a
height of log n and size n.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.170
I keep cutting, basically
square rooting the size.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.030
At some point, when I
cut, I get triangles

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.680
that are size, at
most, square root of b.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.832
So the tree now will
look-- actually,

00:27:37.832 --> 00:27:39.040
let me draw a bigger picture.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.390
Let's start down here.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.397
So I've got triangle less
than or equal to b, triangle

00:28:00.397 --> 00:28:01.430
less than or equal to b.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.230
This is some attempt
to draw a general tree.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.865
And first we cut in
the middle level.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.240
Then we cut in
the middle levels.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.480
And let's say, at that moment,
all of the leftover trees

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.960
have, at most, b nodes in them.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.860
It's going to happen
at some point.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:08.780
It's going to happen
after roughly log n minus

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.110
log b levels of recursion.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.580
The heights here will
be roughly log b.

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.800
We keep cutting in half,
still with height log b.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.330
Then we know the size of it's b.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.920
OK, so this is a picture
that exists in some sense.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.460
What we know is that
each of these triangles

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.900
is stored consecutively.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.440
By this recursive
layout, we guarantee

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.310
that, at any level of
recursion, each chunk

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.400
is stored consecutively.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:47.020
So, in particular, this
level-- level b-- is nice.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.900
So what that tells us is that
each triangle with, at most, b

00:29:51.900 --> 00:30:00.790
elements is
consecutive, which means

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:07.280
it occupies at most two blocks.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.410
If we're lucky, it's one.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.850
But if we're unlucky in
terms of-- here's memory.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.600
Here's how it's
split into blocks.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.260
Maybe it's consecutive, but
it crosses a block boundary.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.610
But the distance between
these two lines is b and b.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.210
And the length of
the blue thing is b.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.200
So you can only cross one line.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.720
So you fit in two blocks.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.810
Each of these triangles
fits in two blocks.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.480
Now, let's think about
search algorithm.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.100
We're going to do regular binary
search in a binary search tree.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.990
We start at the root.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.140
We compare to x.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.380
We go left to right.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.260
Then we go left to
right, left to right.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.070
Eventually we find the
predecessor or the successor

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.590
or, ideally, the element
we're actually searching for.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.110
And so what we're
doing is following

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:59.210
some root-to-node
path in the tree.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.094
Maybe we stop early.

00:31:00.094 --> 00:31:01.760
In the worst case,
we go down to a leaf.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.590
But it's a vertical path.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.500
You only go down.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.150
Over here, same thing.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.900
Let's say, because these
are the ones I drew,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.500
you go here somewhere.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.760
But in general, you're following
some root-to-node path.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.990
And you're visiting some
sequence of triangles.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.660
Each triangle fits in,
basically, one block.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.679
Let's assume, as usual,
m over b is at least two.

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:34.220
So you can store at
least two blocks,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.230
which means, once you
start touching a triangle,

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.519
all further touches are free.

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.310
The first one, you have
to pay the load in,

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.740
maybe these two blocks.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.300
Every subsequent touch as you
go down this path is free.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.960
Then you go to a new triangle.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.835
That could be somewhere
completely different.

00:31:47.835 --> 00:31:50.080
We don't really now, but
it's some other two blocks.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.250
And as long as you stay within
the triangle, it's free.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:57.110
So the cost is going to be,
at most, twice the number

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.650
of triangles that you visit.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:07.610
MTN is going to be, at
most, twice the number

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:16.350
of triangles visited
by a root-to-node path,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.530
a downward path in the
binary search tree.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.316
OK, now to figure
that out we need not

00:32:25.316 --> 00:32:27.690
only an upper bound on how
big the triangles are but also

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:28.810
a lower bound.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.830
I said the height of
the tree is about log b.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.610
It's close.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:35.620
Maybe you have
triangles of size b

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.900
plus 1, which is a
little bit too big.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.580
So let's think about that case.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.820
You have b plus 1 nodes.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.740
And then you end up cutting
in the middle level.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.400
So before, you had a height of
almost log b-- slightly more

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.574
than log b.

00:32:50.574 --> 00:32:52.490
Then, when you cut it
in half, the new heights

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.360
will be half log b.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.970
And then you'll have
only square root

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.360
of b items in the triangle.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.180
So that may seem problematic.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.790
These things are, at most, b.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.560
They're also at
least square root b.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:15.360
The height of a
triangle at this level

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:21.975
is somewhere between
half log b and log b.

00:33:25.055 --> 00:33:26.890
Basically, we're binary
searching on height.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.840
We're stopping when
we divide it by 2.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.360
And we get something less
than log B in height.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.490
Luckily, we only
care about heights.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.660
We don't care that there's
only root b items here.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.720
That may seem inefficient, but
because everything's in a log

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.360
here-- because we
only care about

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.150
log b in the running time, and
we're basically approximating

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.660
log b within a factor
of 2-- everything's

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.860
going to work up to
constant factors.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.880
In other words, if
you look at this path,

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.080
we know the length
of the path is log n.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.400
We know the height of
each of these triangles

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.890
is at least half log b.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.490
That means the number
of triangles you visit

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:12.040
is log n divided by half log b.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:33.030
And the length of
the path is log n.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:42.210
So the number of triangles on
the path is, at most, log n

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.150
divided by how much progress we
make for each triangle, which

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.960
is half log b-- also known
as 2 times log base b of n.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.739
And then we get the
number of memory transfers

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.490
is, at most, twice that.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.080
So the number of memory
transfers is going to be,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.600
at most, 4 times
log base b of n.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:12.520
And that's order log base
b of n, which is optimal.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.890
Now we don't need to know b.

00:35:18.354 --> 00:35:20.350
How's that for a cheat?

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.507
So we get optimal running time,
except for the constant factor.

00:35:24.507 --> 00:35:25.840
Admittedly, this is not perfect.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.670
B trees get basically 1
times log base b of n.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.270
This cache oblivious binary
search gives you 4 times

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.770
log base b of n.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.120
But this was a rough analysis.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.880
You can actually get that
down to like 1.4 times

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.720
log base b of n.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.644
And that's tight.

00:35:41.644 --> 00:35:43.310
So you can't do quite
as well with cache

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:48.850
oblivious as external
memory but close.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.830
And that's sort
of the story here.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.780
If you ignore constant
factors, all is good.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.670
In practice, where
you potentially

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.450
win is that, if you designed
a b tree for specific b,

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.950
you're going to do really great
for that level of the memory

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.410
hierarchy.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.909
But in reality, there's many
levels to the memory hierarchy.

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:05.150
They all matter.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:07.440
Cache oblivious is
going to win a lot

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.140
because it's optimal at
all levels simultaneously.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:11.940
It's really hard to
build a b tree that's

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.220
optimal for many values
of b simultaneously.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.490
OK so that is search.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.320
Any questions before
we go on to source?

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.160
[STUDENTS COUGHING]

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.190
One obvious question
is, what about dynamic?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.700
Again, I said static.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.650
Obviously the elements
aren't changing here.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.245
Just doing search
in log base b of n,

00:36:38.245 --> 00:36:43.140
it turns out you can do insert,
delete, and search in log base

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:49.120
b of n memory transfers
per operation.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.607
This was my first result
in cache oblivious land.

00:36:53.607 --> 00:36:55.440
It's when I met Charles
Leiserson, actually.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.210
But I'm not going to cover it.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.510
If you want to know how, you
should take 6851, Advanced Data

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.510
Structures, which talks about
all sorts of things like this

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.025
but dynamic.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:30.360
It turns out there's a lot more
to say about this universe.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.090
And I want to go in to sorting
instead of talking about how

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.310
to make that dynamic because,
oh, OK, search log base

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.366
b of n, that was optimal.

00:37:38.366 --> 00:37:40.740
I said, oh, you can also do
insert and delete in log base

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.239
b of n.

00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:43.440
It turns out that's not optimal.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.750
It's as good as b trees.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.350
But you can do better.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:49.560
B trees are not good at updates.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.180
And if you've ever worked with
a database, you may know this.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.800
If you have a lot of updates,
b trees are really slow.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.140
They're good for searches,
not good for updates.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.930
You can do a lot better.

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.820
And that will be
exhibited by sorting.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.570
So sorting-- I think
you know the problem.

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.316
You're given n elements in an
array in some arbitrary order.

00:38:07.316 --> 00:38:08.940
You want to put them
into sorted order.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.060
Or, equivalently, you want to
put them into a van Emde Boas

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:11.720
order.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.010
Once their sorted, it's
not too hard to transfer

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.810
into this order.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.020
So you can do search
fast or whatever.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.080
Sorting is a very basic
thing we like to do.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.300
And the obvious way
to sort when you have,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.950
basically, a-- let's pretend
we have this b tree data

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.549
structure, cache oblivious even.

00:38:29.549 --> 00:38:30.840
Or we just use regular b trees.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.022
Let's use regular b trees.

00:38:32.022 --> 00:38:33.230
Forget about cache oblivious.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.470
External memory, we
know how to do b trees.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.180
We know how to
insert into a b tree.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:46.700
So the obvious way to sort is to
do n inserts into, if you want,

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.050
a cache oblivious b tree
or just a regular b tree.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.990
How long does that take?

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.760
N times log base b of n.

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:06.520
It sounds OK.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.680
But it's not optimal.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.145
It's actually really slow
compared to what you can do.

00:39:12.145 --> 00:39:14.195
You can do, roughly,
a factor of b faster.

00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:20.900
But it's the best we
know how to do so far.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.310
So the goal is to do better.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.640
And, basically, what's going
on is we can do inserts.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.710
In this universe, we can
do inserts and deletes

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:32.570
faster than we can do searches,
which is a little weird.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.610
It will become clearer
as we go through.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.370
So what's another
natural way to sort?

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.300
What means to sorting
algorithm that we've

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.137
covered are optimal in
the comparison model?

00:39:44.137 --> 00:39:45.152
STUDENT: Merge sort.

00:39:45.152 --> 00:39:46.860
PROFESSOR: Merge sort,
that's a good one.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.410
We could do quick
sort, too, I guess.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.490
I'll stick to merge sort.

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:55.010
Merge sort's nice because
A, it's divide and conquer.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.340
And we like divide and conquer.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.570
It seems to work,
if we do it right.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.386
And it's also cache oblivious.

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:01.510
There's no b in merge sort.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.801
We didn't even know what b was.

00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:05.645
So great, merge sort
is divide and conquer

00:40:05.645 --> 00:40:06.570
and cache oblivious.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.650
So how much does it cost?

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.020
Well, let's think
about merge sort.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.630
You take an array.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.640
You divide it in half.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:16.570
That takes zero time.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:17.960
That's just a conceptual thing.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.760
You recursively sort this part.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.060
You recursively sort this part.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.560
That looks good because
those items are consecutive.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.810
So that recursion is going
to be an honest to goodness

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.920
recursion on an array.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.470
So we can write a recurrence.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.200
And then we have to
merge the two parts.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.710
So in merge, we take the
first element of each guy.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.280
We compare them,
output one of them,

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.650
advance that one, compare,
output one of them,

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.790
advance that guy.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.640
That's three parallel scans.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.120
We're scanning in this array.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.920
We're scanning in this array.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.960
We're always advancing
forward, which

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.505
means as long as we
store the first block

00:40:54.505 --> 00:40:57.385
of this guy and the first
block of this guy who

00:40:57.385 --> 00:40:59.130
knows how it's aligned--

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.470
But we'll read these
items one by one

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.870
until we finish that block.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.890
Then we'll just read the next
block, read those one by one.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.870
And similarly for
the output array,

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.380
we first start filling a block.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.660
Once it's filled, we
can kick that one out

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.700
and read the next one.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.360
As long as m over
b is at least 3,

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.199
we can afford this
three-parallel scan.

00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:24.240
It's not really parallel.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.540
It's more like inter-leaf scans.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.040
But we're basically
scanning in here

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.414
while we're also
scanning in here

00:41:29.414 --> 00:41:32.170
and scanning in
the output array.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.400
And we can merge
two sorted arrays

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:42.320
into a new sorted array in
scan time, n over be plus 1.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:48.710
So that means the number
of memory transfers

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.350
is 2 times the number of memory
transfers for half the size,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:58.960
like regular merge sort,
plus n over b plus 1.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.912
That's our recurrence.

00:42:00.912 --> 00:42:02.120
Now we just need to solve it.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.810
Well, before we solve
it, in this case

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.390
we always have to be
careful with the base case.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:12.434
Base case is MT of m.

00:42:12.434 --> 00:42:14.100
This is the best base
case we could use.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.260
Let's use it.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.860
When I reach an array of size
m, I read the whole thing.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.400
And then that's all I can pay.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.980
So I won't incur any
more cost as long

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.940
as I stay within that
region of size m.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.770
Maybe I should put
some constant times m

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:34.020
because this is not in
place algorithm, so maybe

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.460
1/3 m something.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:39.630
As long as I'm not too
close to the cache size,

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.680
I will only pay m over
b memory transfers.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.170
So far so good.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.550
Now we just solve
the recurrence.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.410
This is a nice recurrence,
very similar to

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.660
the old merge-sort recurrence.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.270
We just have a different
thing in the additive term.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.120
And we have a
different base case.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.360
The way I like to
solve nice recurrences

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.734
is with recursion trees.

00:43:09.734 --> 00:43:12.150
This is actually a trick I
learned by teaching this class.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.960
Before this, cache oblivious
was really painful to me

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.090
because I could never
solve the currencies.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.746
Then I thought the class and
was like, oh, this is easy.

00:43:19.746 --> 00:43:21.840
I hope the same
transformation happens to you.

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.660
You'll see how easy it is
once we do this example.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.377
OK, this is merge sort.

00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:31.960
Remember recursion
tree, in every node

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:37.220
you put the additive cost
so that, if you added up

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.810
the cost of all of
these nodes, you

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.060
would get the total
value of this expands

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.970
to because we're
basically making

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.501
two children of size n over 2.

00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:47.000
And then we're
putting, at the root,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.020
this cost, which means, if
you add up all of these nodes,

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.540
you're getting all
of these costs.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.830
And that's the total cost.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.440
So it's n over b at the top.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.230
Then it's going to be n over
2 divided by b and so on.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.290
I'm omitting the plus
1 just for cleanliness.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.480
You'd actually have to count.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.660
And this keeps going until
we hit the base case.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.590
This is where
things are a little

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:10.006
different from
regular merge sort,

00:44:10.006 --> 00:44:13.360
other than the divided by b.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.065
We stop when we reach
something at size m.

00:44:17.065 --> 00:44:18.690
So at the leaf level,
we have something

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.250
of size m, which
means we basically

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.355
have m over b in each leaf.

00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:26.730
And then we should think about
how many leaves there are.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.020
This is just n over
m leaves, I guess.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.650
There's lots of
ways to see that.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:41.090
One way to think about it
is we're conserving mass.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.610
We started with n items.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.370
Split it in half,
split it in half.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.740
So the number of items
is remaining fixed.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.020
Then at the bottom
we have m items.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.280
And so the number of leaves
has to be exactly n over m

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.150
because the total should be n.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:58.310
You can also think of it as
2 to the power log of that.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.130
We have, usually, log n levels.

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.060
But we're cutting off
a log m at the bottom.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.240
So it's log n minus
log m as the height.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.750
I'll actually need that.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:14.040
The height of this tree is
log n minus log m, also known

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.760
as log n/m.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.140
OK, so we've drawn this tree.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.730
Now, what we usually do
is add up level by level.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.290
That usually gives
a very clean answer.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.680
So we add up the top level.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.620
That's n over b.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.810
We add up the second level.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.660
That's n over b, by
conservation of mass

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.490
again and because this
was a linear function.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:41.604
So each level, in fact, is going
to be exactly n over b cost.

00:45:41.604 --> 00:45:43.520
We should be a little
careful about the bottom

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.850
because the base
case-- I mean, it

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.480
happens that the base
case matches this.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.938
But it's always good practice
to think about the leaf level

00:45:48.938 --> 00:45:50.260
separately.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.900
But the leaf level is just
m over b times n over m

00:45:53.900 --> 00:46:00.720
The m's cancel, so m
over b times n over m.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.100
This is n over b.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.632
So every level is n over b.

00:46:06.632 --> 00:46:10.915
The number of levels
is log of n over m.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:15.830
Cool.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.484
So the number of
memory transfers

00:46:18.484 --> 00:46:20.150
is just the product
of those two things.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:31.720
It's n over b times
that log, log n over m.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:32.690
Now let's compare.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.560
That's sorting.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.690
Over here, we had a running
time of n times log base b of n.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:51.620
So this is n log n
divided by log b.

00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.130
Log base b is the same
as dividing by log b.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.130
So n log n divided by log--
we had regular sorting time.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:58.820
And then we divided by log b.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.860
Over here, we have basically
regular sorting time.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.610
But now we're dividing by b.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:10.840
That's a huge improvement-- a
b divided by log b improvement.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.410
I mean, think of the b
being like a million.

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:18.570
So before we were dividing
by 20, which is OK.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.240
But now we're
dividing by a million.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.020
That's better.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:24.980
So this way of sorting
is so much better

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.510
than this way of sorting.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.830
It's still not optimal,
but we're getting better.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.320
We can actually get sort of the
best of both worlds-- divide

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:54.800
by b and divide
by log b, I claim.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.520
But we need a new algorithm.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.230
Any suggestions for
another algorithm?

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:13.650
STUDENT: Divide
into block size b.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:17.120
PROFESSOR: I want to
divide into block size b.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:18.955
So, you mean a merge sort?

00:48:18.955 --> 00:48:19.920
STUDENT: Yes.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.670
PROFESSOR: So merge
sort, I take my array.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:24.306
I divide it into
blocks the size b.

00:48:24.306 --> 00:48:28.590
I could sort each one
in one memory transfer.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.120
And then I need to merge them.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.680
So then I've got n divided
by b sorted arrays.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.890
I don't know how to merge them.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.640
It's going to be
hard, but very close.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.460
So the answer is
indeed merge sort.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.670
What we covered before
is binary merge sort.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.810
You split into two groups.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.530
What I want to do now is
split into some other number

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.050
of groups.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.370
So that was n over b groups.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.920
That's too many because merging
n over b arrays is hard.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.840
Merging two arrays was easy.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.580
Assuming m over
b was at least 3,

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.795
I could merge these guys
just by parallel scans.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.097
So you have the right bound?

00:49:15.097 --> 00:49:16.440
STUDENT: B way.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.586
PROFESSOR: B way, maybe.

00:49:21.586 --> 00:49:23.300
STUDENT: Square root of b.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.000
PROFESSOR: Square root of b?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.680
That's what I like
to call root beer.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.050
Nope.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.170
I do call it that.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.305
Yeah?

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:35.520
STUDENT: M over b?

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.350
PROFESSOR: M over b, that's
what I'm looking for!

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.068
Why m over b?

00:49:39.068 --> 00:49:41.068
STUDENT: I was just
thinking of the bottom layer

00:49:41.068 --> 00:49:44.865
of the [INAUDIBLE]
binary merge sort.

00:49:44.865 --> 00:49:46.490
PROFESSOR: Because
m over b is up here?

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.990
Nice.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.558
Not the right reason, but
you get a Frisbee anyway.

00:49:52.558 --> 00:49:55.970
All right, let's see
if I can do this.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.172
Would you like another one?

00:49:57.172 --> 00:49:58.130
Add to your collection.

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:02.330
All right, so m over b is the
right answer-- wrong reason,

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:05.080
but that's OK.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.220
It all comes down
to this merge step.

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:10.500
So m over b way means I
take my problem of size n.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.690
Let's draw it out.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.390
I divide into chunks.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.370
I want the number of
chunks that I divide into

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:25.830
to be m over b, meaning each of
these has size n over m over b.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:26.660
That's weird.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:29.470
This is natural because
this is how many blocks

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:32.310
I can have in cache.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.990
I care about that because, if
I want to do a multi-way merge,

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:36.680
you can mimic the
same binary merge.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.610
You look at the first item
of each of the sorted arrays.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.500
You compare them.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.000
In this model,
comparisons are free.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.250
Let's not even worry about it.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.760
In reality, use a priority
queue, but all right.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.840
So you find the
minimum of these.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840
Let's say it's this one.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.570
And you output that,
and then you advance.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:57.090
Same algorithm, that will merge
however many arrays you have.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.130
The issue is, for this to be
efficient like it was here,

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:03.510
we need to be able to store
the first block of each

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.100
of these arrays.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.970
How many blocks
we have room for?

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:07.740
M over b.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.300
This is maxing out merge sort.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.620
This is exactly the number
of blocks that we can store.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:15.110
And so if we do m over
b way merge sort, merge

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:18.080
remains cheap.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:26.790
An m over b way merge
costs n over b plus 1,

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:28.000
just like before.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.810
It's m over b parallel scans.

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:35.270
M over b is exactly the
number of scans we can handle.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:37.500
OK, technically we
have, with this picture,

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.070
m over b plus 1 scans.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.480
So I need to write
m over b minus 1.

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.995
But it won't make a difference.

00:51:44.995 --> 00:51:46.620
OK, so let's write
down the recurrence.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.680
It's pretty similar.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:50.460
Memory transfer's size m.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:58.710
We have m over b sub problems
of size n divided by m over b.

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.070
It's Still conservation of mass.

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.350
And then we have plus
the same thing as before,

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.200
n over b plus 1.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.120
So it's exactly the same
recurrence we had before.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.640
We're splitting
into more problems.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.960
But the sums are
going to be the same.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.720
It's still going to add up
to n over b at each step

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.020
because conservation of mass.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.700
And we didn't change this.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.750
So level by level
looks the same.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.920
The only thing that changes
is the number of levels.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.890
Now we're taking n.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.870
We're dividing by m
over b in each step.

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:28.922
So the height of
the tree, the number

00:52:28.922 --> 00:52:35.170
of levels of the
recursion tree now

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:40.400
is-- before it was log
base 2 of n over n.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:48.500
Now it's going to be log
base m over b of n over m.

00:52:51.394 --> 00:52:52.810
If you're careful,
I guess there's

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:55.105
a plus 1 for the leaf level.

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:57.210
I actually want to
mention this plus 1.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:58.862
Unlike the other
plus 1's, I've got

00:52:58.862 --> 00:53:02.290
to mention this one because
this is not how I usually

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:04.520
think of the number of levels.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.396
I'll show you why.

00:53:06.396 --> 00:53:07.770
If you just change
it by one, you

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.700
get a slightly cleaner formula.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.230
This has got m's
all over the place.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:18.420
So I just want to
rewrite n over m here.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.280
Then we'll see how good this is.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.150
This is just pedantics.

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:27.830
Log base m over b of n--
I really want n over b.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:32.690
To make this n over b, I need
to multiply by b, divide by m.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.010
OK, these are the same thing.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:37.460
M over m, b's cancel.

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.140
But I have a log of a product.

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.270
I can separate that out.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.000
Let's go over here.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.970
This is log base m over b of n
over b-- this is what I like--

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:59.342
and then, basically, minus
log base m over b of m over b.

00:53:59.342 --> 00:54:01.400
STUDENT: It's b over m.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.300
PROFESSOR: I put a
minus, so it's m over b.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.105
If I put a plus, it
would be b over m.

00:54:05.105 --> 00:54:06.480
But, in fact, m
is bigger than b.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.690
So I want it this way.

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.400
And now it's obvious this is 1.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.281
So these cancel.

00:54:13.281 --> 00:54:15.530
So that's why I wanted the
1, just to get rid of that.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.500
It doesn't really
matter, just a plus 1.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.080
But it's a cooler way to
see that, in some sense,

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.300
this is the right answer
of the height of the tree.

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.530
Now, we're paying n over
b at each recursive level.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:33.280
So the total cost is what's
called the sorting bound.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:40.900
This is optimal, n over b times
log base m over b of n over b.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.100
Oh my gosh, what a mouthful.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:44.330
But every person who does
external memory algorithms

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:47.240
and cache oblivious
algorithms knows this.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.440
It is the truth, it turns out.

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.800
There's a matching lower bound.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.620
It's a weird bound.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.040
But let's compare
it to what we know.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.780
So we started out with n
log n divided by log b.

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:01.420
Then we got n log
n divided by b.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.490
Let's ignore-- I mean,
this has almost no effect,

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:04.660
the part in here.

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:11.400
Now we have n log n divided by
b and divided by log m over b.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.310
It's not quite
dividing by log b.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.170
But it turns out it's
almost always the same.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.020
In some sense, this
could be better.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:21.460
If you're cache is big, now
you're dividing by log m,

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.270
roughly.

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:24.960
Before, you were only
dividing by log b.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.540
And it turns out this
is the best you can do.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:30.780
So this is going to be a little
bit better than merge sort.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:36.940
If your cache is 16 gigabytes,
like your RAM caching

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.985
your disk, then log
m is pretty big.

00:55:41.985 --> 00:55:48.635
It's going to be 32 or
something, 34 I guess log m.

00:55:48.635 --> 00:55:50.004
OK, I have to divide by b.

00:55:50.004 --> 00:55:50.920
So it's not that good.

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.295
But still, I'm getting an
improvement over regular binary

00:55:53.295 --> 00:55:54.250
merge sort.

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.810
And you would see
that improvement.

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:57.210
These are big factors.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.440
The big thing, of course,
is dividing it by b.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.330
But dividing by log of m over
b is also nice and the best you

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:04.790
can do.

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:08.460
OK, obviously I needed to
know what m and b were here.

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:14.290
So the natural question next
is cache oblivious sorting.

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:16.550
And that would take
another lecture to cover.

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.570
So I'm not going to do it here.

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:19.600
But it can be done.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.720
Cache obliviously, you can
achieve the same thing.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.760
And I'll give you the intuition.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:25.595
There's one catch.

00:56:25.595 --> 00:56:26.860
Let me mention the catch.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:53.435
So cache oblivious sorting--
to do optimal cache oblivious

00:56:53.435 --> 00:56:56.940
sorting like that
bound, it turns out you

00:56:56.940 --> 00:57:00.605
need an assumption called
the tall-cache assumption.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.540
Simple form of the
tall-cache assumption

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:19.810
is that m is at least b squared.

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:25.250
What that means is m
over b is at least b.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.662
In other words, the cache
is taller than it is wide,

00:57:28.662 --> 00:57:29.870
the way I've been drawing it.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.100
That's why it's called
the tall-cache assumption.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.006
And if you look at real caches,
this is usually the case.

00:57:36.006 --> 00:57:38.380
I don't know of a great reason
why it should be the case.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:41.402
But it usually is,
so all is well.

00:57:41.402 --> 00:57:42.860
You can do cache
oblivious sorting.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:44.860
It turns out, if you don't
have this assumption,

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:47.140
you cannot achieve this bound.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.080
We don't know what
bound you can achieve.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.060
But we just know this
one is not possible.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.200
You can get a contradiction
if you achieve that

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.530
without tall cache.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:55.660
So it's a little bit weird.

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:57.330
You have to make one
bonus assumption.

00:57:57.330 --> 00:57:59.130
You can make a somewhat
weaker form of it,

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:08.870
which is m is omega
b to the 1.000000001.

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:09.840
That will do.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:11.360
In general, 1 plus epsilon.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.070
Any epsilon will be fine.

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:15.540
We just mean that
the number of blocks

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.650
is at least some
b to the epsilon,

00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:21.867
where epsilon's a
constant bigger than zero.

00:58:21.867 --> 00:58:23.700
OK, then you can do
cache oblivious sorting.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:25.880
Let me tell you how.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.110
We want to do m over
b way merge sort.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.800
But we don't know how to do--
we don't know what m over b is.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.110
So instead, we're going
to do something like n

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.420
to the epsilon way merge sort.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.850
That's a so-so interpretation.

00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:47.030
This is back to
your idea roughly.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:52.130
We're dividing into
a lot of chunks.

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.130
And then we don't know
how to merge them anymore

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.590
because we can't do regular
merge with n to the epsilon

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.990
chunks it could be n to
the epsilon's too big.

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:01.980
So how do we do it?

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.770
We do a divide
and conquer merge.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:09.200
This is actually
called funnel sort

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.810
because the way you do a
divide and conquer merge looks

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:13.930
kind of like a funnel.

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.721
Actually, it looks a
lot like the triangles

00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:16.910
we were drawing earlier.

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.510
It's just a lot
messier to analyze.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.360
So I'm not going to do it here.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.570
It would take another
40 minutes or so.

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.070
But that's some intuition of
how you do cache oblivious

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:27.570
merge sort.

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.750
That's what I want to say
cache oblivious stuff.

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:35.600
Oh, one more thing!

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:41.580
One more cool thing you can
do-- I'm a data structures guy.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.720
So sorting is nice.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:46.160
But what I really like
are priority queues

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.400
because they're more
general than sorting.

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:50.940
We started out by
saying, hey, look.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.870
If you want to sort
and you use a b tree,

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:55.310
you get a really
bad running time.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:58.130
That's weird because
usually BST sort

00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.960
is good in a regular
comparison model.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.804
It's n log n.

01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:03.470
So b trees are clearly
not what we want.

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:04.886
Is there some other
thing we want?

01:00:04.886 --> 01:00:06.070
And it turns out, yes.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:12.020
You can build a
priority queue, which

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.070
supports insert and
delete min and a bunch

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.400
of other operations.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.945
Each of those operations costs
1 over b log base m over b of n

01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:34.170
over b amortized memory
transfers-- a bit of a mouthful

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:34.760
again.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.420
But if you compare this
bound with this bound,

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.390
it's exactly the same.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:47.220
But I divided by n, which means
if I insert with this cost n

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.140
times, I pay the sorting bound.

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.200
If I delete min with
this bound n times,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.570
I get the sorting bound.

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:56.310
So if I insert n times and
then delete all the items out,

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.790
I've sorted the items
in sorting bound time.

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:03.040
So this is the data
structure generalization

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.640
of that sorting algorithm.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.774
Now, this is even harder to do.

01:01:07.774 --> 01:01:09.440
Originally, it was
done external memory.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.000
It's called buffer trees.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.967
Then we did it
cache obliviously.

01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:14.800
It's called cache
oblivious priority queues.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.950
We weren't very creative.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:17.960
But it can be done.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.910
And, again, if you
want to learn more,

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:25.010
you should take 6851,
Advanced Data Structures,

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.130
which leads us into
the next topic, what

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:31.029
class you should take
next-- classes, that's

01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.820
what I mean to say.

01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:45.610
So a lot of bias here.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:48.280
And well I'm just going
to give a lot of classes.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.850
There's a lot of them.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:53.705
I believe this is in roughly
numerical order almost.

01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:57.890
It changed a little
bit-- so many classes.

01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:02.290
Are you OK with numbers,
or do you want titles?

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.300
The obvious follow-on
course to this class

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.810
is 6854, which is
Advanced Algorithms.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:13.330
It's the first graduate
algorithms class.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:16.500
This is the last undergraduate
class, roughly speaking,

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.830
with the exception of 6047.

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:20.420
But in terms of straight,
general algorithms,

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.180
this would be the natural class.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.630
It's only in the fall--
sadly, not next fall.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:26.410
But in general,
it's a cool class.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:31.310
It's a very broad overview of
algorithms but much more hard

01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:33.300
core, I guess.

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.090
It's an intense class but
covers a lot of fields,

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.412
a lot of areas of algorithms.

01:02:37.412 --> 01:02:39.120
Then all the other
ones I'm going to list

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.330
are more specialized.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.972
So 6047 is
Computational Biology.

01:02:42.972 --> 01:02:44.430
So if you're
interested in biology,

01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:46.327
you want algorithms
applied to biology.

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:47.160
That's a cool class.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.700
It's also an undergrad class.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.040
Everything else here-- I
mean, you know the story.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.960
You take grad
classes all the time,

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.020
or you will soon if you
want to do more algorithms.

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.270
So 6850 is
computational geometry.

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:04.059
I think it's called
Geometric Algorithms.

01:03:04.059 --> 01:03:05.600
So we've seen a
couple examples, like

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.016
the convex hull
divide-and-conquer

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:10.354
algorithm and the range trees.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.270
Those are two examples
of geometric algorithms

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.350
where you have points and
lines and stuff-- maybe

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.225
in two dimensions, maybe
in three dimensions,

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.296
maybe log n dimensions.

01:03:18.296 --> 01:03:19.712
If you like that
stuff, you should

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:21.956
take computational geometry.

01:03:21.956 --> 01:03:23.830
This is the devil that
lad me into algorithms

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:24.830
in the first place.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:26.640
Cool stuff.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.090
6849 is my class on
folding algorithms.

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:33.830
This is a special type
of geometric algorithms

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.710
where we think about paper
folding and robotic arm folding

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.346
and protein folding
and things like that.

01:03:40.346 --> 01:03:41.970
So that's a bit of
a specialized class.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:46.720
6851, I've mentioned three times
now-- Advanced Data Structures.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.660
Then we've got
6852, its neighbor.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.606
This is Nancy's Distributed
Algorithms class.

01:03:51.606 --> 01:03:53.730
So if you liked the week
of distributed algorithms,

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.970
there's a whole class on it.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:58.370
She wrote the textbook for it.

01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:01.660
Then there's 6853.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.570
This is Algorithmic Game Theory.

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:07.290
If you care about
algorithms involving

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.864
multiple players-- and the
players are each selfish.

01:04:09.864 --> 01:04:11.780
And they have no reason
to tell you the truth.

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.620
And still you want
to compute something

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:16.114
like minimum spanning tree,
or pick your favorite thing.

01:04:16.114 --> 01:04:17.780
Everyone's lying about
the edge weights.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.360
And still you want
to figure out how

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.560
to design a mechanism
like an auction

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.170
so that you actually end up
buying a minimum spanning tree.

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:26.260
You can do that.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:29.876
And if you want to know
how, you should take 6853.

01:04:29.876 --> 01:04:32.290
What else do we have?

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:35.860
6855 is Network Optimization.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.750
So this is like the natural
follow on of network flows.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.900
If you like network flows
and things like that,

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.760
there's a whole universe
called network optimization.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.140
It has lots of fancy,
basically, graph algorithms

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.140
where you're minimizing
or maximizing something.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.930
OK, this is
fortuitous alignment.

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:58.080
6856 is kind of
a friend of 6854.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.660
These are both taught
by David Carter.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.540
This is Randomized Algorithms.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:06.015
So this is a more
specialized approach.

01:05:06.015 --> 01:05:07.890
I don't think you need
one to take the other.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:09.920
But this is the
usual starting class.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.350
And this is specifically
about how randomization makes

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:15.180
algorithms faster or simpler.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.680
Usually they're
harder to analyze.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.680
But you get very simple
algorithms that run just

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.810
as well as their
deterministic versions.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.790
Sometimes you can
do even better than

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:24.900
the deterministic versions.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.750
Then there's the
security universe.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.606
This is a great
numerical coincidence--

01:05:30.606 --> 01:05:31.730
probably not a coincidence.

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.944
But there's 6857 and 6875.

01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.360
I have to remember
which is which.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.680
6857 is Applied Cryptography.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.720
6875 is Theoretical
Cryptography,

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.530
at least as I read it.

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:44.360
So they have similar topics.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.380
But this is more thinking
about how you really

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.560
achieve security and crypto
systems and things like that.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:52.504
And this one is more
algorithm based.

01:05:52.504 --> 01:05:54.170
And what kind of
theoretical assumptions

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:55.440
do you need to prove
certain things?

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.481
This is more proof based.

01:05:56.481 --> 01:06:03.840
And this is more connecting
to systems, both great topics.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:05.687
And I have one
more out of order,

01:06:05.687 --> 01:06:07.520
I guess just because
it's a recent addition.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.475
6816 is Multicore Programming.

01:06:11.475 --> 01:06:13.950
That has a lot of
algorithms, too.

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:17.974
And this is all about
parallel computation.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.890
When you have multiple
cores on your computer,

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:22.150
how can you compute
things like these things

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:24.340
faster than
everything we've done?

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.290
It's yet another universe
that we haven't even

01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:27.670
touched on in this class.

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:31.030
But it's cool stuff, and
you might consider it.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.890
Then we move on to
other theory classes.

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:37.100
That was algorithms.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.080
Some more obvious candidates,
if you like pure theory,

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.980
are 6045 6840.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.230
This is the undergrad version.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:43.800
This is the grad version.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.841
Although, by now the
classes are quite different.

01:06:45.841 --> 01:06:47.290
So they cover different things.

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:48.790
Some of you are
already taking 6045.

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:50.550
It's right before this lecture.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:55.190
These are general theory of
computation classes, atomita,

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:57.240
complexity, things like that.

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.230
If you like the brief
NP completeness lecture,

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.149
then you might like this stuff.

01:07:02.149 --> 01:07:04.690
There's so many more complexity
classes and other cool things

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.060
you can do.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.190
If you really like it, there's
advanced complexity theory.

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:12.280
There's, basically,
randomized complexity theory--

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.620
how randomness affects
just the complexity side,

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.950
not algorithms.

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:19.330
Then there's quantum
complexity theory

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.430
if you care about
quantum computers.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.800
As Scott says,
it's proving things

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.110
you can't do with
computers we don't have.

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.420
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.610
It's complexity.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.790
It's all about lower bounds.

01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:35.970
And then there's coding theory,
which is another universe.

01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:39.190
It's actually closely
related to-- it comes out

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:42.410
of signals and systems and
electrical engineering.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.350
But by now it's closely
related to complexity theory.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.670
You can use bounds on
codes to prove things

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:49.640
about complexity theory.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:54.220
Anyway, choose
your own adventure.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.179
Now I have one last topic,
which was not on the outline.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:07:58.345
This is a bit of a surprise.

01:08:01.042 --> 01:08:02.000
It's a boring surprise.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.345
I want to remind you to fill
out student evaluations.

01:08:05.345 --> 01:08:07.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:07.606 --> 01:08:09.480
Because, you know, we
want to know how we did

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.700
and how we can continue
to improve the class.

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:16.200
But really we want to know
who's the better teacher.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.160
But more importantly than
who is the better teacher,

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.330
I think we all have a dying
question, which is who

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.910
is the better Frisbee thrower?

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:30.710
So I want to invite Srini
Devadas, our co-lecturer here,

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:33.146
to a duel.

01:08:33.146 --> 01:08:35.090
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

01:08:38.978 --> 01:08:42.170
SRINI DEVADAS: I think
you mean, no contest.

PROFESSOR: Not so sure.

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.720
Maybe-- actually,
I'm pretty sure.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.460
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.040
I want to take you on, man.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.207
Blue or purple?

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:56.040
SRINI DEVADAS: Blue.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.460
PROFESSOR: Good choice.

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.084
SRINI DEVADAS: Blue's
better, remember?

01:08:58.084 --> 01:08:58.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.391
PROFESSOR: Purple's
better, remember?

01:09:00.391 --> 01:09:00.914
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.634
All right, so how are
we going to do this?

01:09:04.634 --> 01:09:08.063
SRINI DEVADAS: So, you
guys get to cheer and bet.

01:09:08.063 --> 01:09:09.880
PROFESSOR: Bet?

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.439
I don't think we can
condone them betting money.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:14.792
I think maybe they can
bet their Frisbees.

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:16.000
Anyone got a Frisbee on them?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.370
We can bet those.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.069
SRINI DEVADAS: Yeah, all right.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:20.490
PROFESSOR: All right, maybe not.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:23.874
SRINI DEVADAS: Put your
Frisbees on me here.

01:09:23.874 --> 01:09:25.189
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:28.600
SRINI DEVADAS: All right,
so some rules here--

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.850
we actually talked about this.

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.050
So the way this is
going to work-- I mean,

01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:36.542
it's going to be
algorithmic, obviously.

01:09:36.542 --> 01:09:38.250
And we get to choose
our algorithm, maybe

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.729
with a little game theory here.

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.109
We're going to toss the coin.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.359
And we're going to
decide who goes first.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.200
So won't spin the Frisbee.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.330
Remember what
happened with that?

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.452
So you get to call heads or
tails while it's spinning.

01:09:50.452 --> 01:09:51.910
PROFESSOR: Oh,
while it's spinning.

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:53.368
SRINI DEVADAS:
While it's spinning.

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:55.610
This is our Super Bowl.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:57.300
PROFESSOR: Heads!

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.330
Oh, a trick.

01:09:59.330 --> 01:09:59.890
Tails.

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:02.500
SRINI DEVADAS: Tails, all right.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.810
You're going to throw first.

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:05.000
PROFESSOR: OK,
that's your choice.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.990
SRINI DEVADAS: And I
don't know if you've heard

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:09.720
the legend of William Tell.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.510
How many of you have heard
the legend of William Tell?

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:13.470
All right.

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:17.070
So that was a 14th
century Swiss legend

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:22.680
where there was this archer
who was renowned for his skill.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.090
And he was forced by
this villainous king

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:29.662
to shoot an apple off the
top of his son's head.

01:10:29.662 --> 01:10:30.370
PROFESSOR: Yikes.

01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:33.260
SRINI DEVADAS: So we're
going to reenact that.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.165

bring your daughter?

[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:42.435
SRINI DEVADAS: I
was thinking TAs.

01:10:44.844 --> 01:10:45.760
PROFESSOR: Our "sons."

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.551
SRINI DEVADAS: But
there's a big difference

01:10:47.551 --> 01:10:50.020
between the 21st century
and the 14th century.

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.239
What is that?

01:10:51.239 --> 01:10:52.155
STUDENT: You get sued.

01:10:52.155 --> 01:10:52.610
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:54.006
PROFESSOR: You get sued, yeah.

01:10:54.006 --> 01:10:55.880
SRINI DEVADAS: Now
there's many more lawsuits

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.562
in the 21st century.

01:10:57.562 --> 01:10:58.770
So we want to avoid lawsuits.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.579
STUDENT: Genetically
modified apples.

01:11:00.579 --> 01:11:02.620
PROFESSOR: And genetically
modified apples, also.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.920
SRINI DEVADAS: Electronically
modified Apples,

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.520
yeah that's going to
be another difference.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.900
So we decided we'd just
throw Frisbees at each other.

01:11:10.406 --> 01:11:12.030
PROFESSOR: So I'm
going to throw to you

01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:13.800
and try to hit an
apple off of your head.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.000
SRINI DEVADAS:
Yeah, well you might

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.140
want to tell them what we
decided about the apple.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:19.860
PROFESSOR: Well, I brought
an easy-to-hit apple,

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:21.880
a nice big apple,
the cowboy hat.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.964
SRINI DEVADAS: Cowboy hat.

01:11:22.964 --> 01:11:24.713
PROFESSOR: That should
be a little easier.

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.290
SRINI DEVADAS: So I get to wear
that had first because you're

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.410
going to throw first.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:28.993
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.750
SRINI DEVADAS: And this
is really simple, guys.

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:39.000
Knock the hat off, I guess from
the furthest distance, and win.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.260
In your case, lose but yeah.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.510
PROFESSOR: Now for the PETA
people in the audience,

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:45.170
I want your assure
no humans will

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:48.125
be harmed during this

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.824

to grab purple.

SRINI DEVADAS: You get to pick.

01:12:02.679 --> 01:12:03.720
You can stand right here.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.100

what's good for you.

the way up there.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.810
And after you
knock this hat off,

01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:14.356
I'm going to have to match you.

01:12:14.356 --> 01:12:15.230
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:16.877

try from about here.

Ah!

I've got to look good here, man.

do it without looking.

to stand right here.

PROFESSOR: OK.

01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:37.003
SRINI DEVADAS: Look, I
know how well you throw.

01:12:37.003 --> 01:12:38.086
PROFESSOR: Are you scared?

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.660
That's embarrassing.

SRINI DEVADAS: Ah!

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.110
I can't deal with this.

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:51.340
I just have no confidence
in the way you throw.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.310
So I borrowed this.

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:55.142
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.400

it's going to cost you

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.060
a throw to wear this.

01:13:05.138 --> 01:13:06.420
Whatever, fair.

better about this.

I won't claim to
have a pretty face.

it is, just the way it is.

01:13:15.605 --> 01:13:16.480

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.410
Well, since we have a
little more protection,

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:19.780
maybe I'll start
from farther back.

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:20.821
SRINI DEVADAS: All right.

01:13:20.821 --> 01:13:22.697

up here like that.

PROFESSOR: OK.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.720
So I just have to hit
the hat off, right?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.015
Easy.

01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:25.806

going to get closer.

One step closer.

bigger than your steps.

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.780
I was right there.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.540
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.664
SRINI DEVADAS: Right there.

01:15:53.664 --> 01:15:55.600
PROFESSOR: All
right, right here.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.210
Can I hold onto the hat?

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:58.380
SRINI DEVADAS: No!

01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.710
You can hold on to your helmet!

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:01.470
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:03.927
SRINI DEVADAS: Wow.

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:04.510
PROFESSOR: Ah!

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.478
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.500
How many throws--

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.190
SRINI DEVADAS: Maybe I
should start from right here.

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:13.284
[GROANING]

01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:13.950
PROFESSOR: Phew.

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:15.075
That was close.

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.320
SRINI DEVADAS: Oh, I grazed it!

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.040
But it's supposed to fall off.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.200
PROFESSOR: What, my head?

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.076
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:26.076 --> 01:16:28.076
SRINI DEVADAS: Getting
kind of tight here, guys.

01:16:31.123 --> 01:16:31.623
Wow.

01:16:36.776 --> 01:16:38.752
[YELLING AND GROANING]

01:16:38.752 --> 01:16:40.230
Does that count?

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:40.730
STUDENT: No!

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:41.420
SRINI DEVADAS: It does count.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:41.987
STUDENT: No!

01:16:41.987 --> 01:16:43.070
SRINI DEVADAS: It's a tie.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:44.250
So far, it's a tie.

01:16:44.250 --> 01:16:45.890
So far, it's a tie!

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:47.690
All right, if I
knock it off, I win.

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.530

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.370

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.448
There you you.

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:53.364
PROFESSOR: Is that it?

01:16:53.364 --> 01:16:55.312
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:58.234 --> 01:17:00.400
SRINI DEVADAS: This
was fair and square.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.090
We want the world to
know that we did not

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:04.590
deflate these Frisbees.

01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:06.503

01:17:07.946 --> 01:17:09.870
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.210
So not only did we do a bad
job of throwing Frisbee to you

01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:22.420
guys, we didn't throw enough
Frisbees, as you can see,

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.280
through the term.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.730
So if you want a
Frisbee, pick one up.

01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:29.890
And if you're embarrassed
about throwing Frisbees

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:32.480
with this lettering on
it, I've got two words

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.500
for you-- paint remover.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.390
All right, have a good summer.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.430
And have fun on the final exam.
