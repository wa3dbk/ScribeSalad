00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.770
LING REN: So today,
we're going to analyze

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.000
two random algorithms we've
seen in the last lecture,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.720
randomized median and
randomized quick sort.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920
But before I go
into that, I'd like

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.990
to make a correction
in problem set two.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.490
I think you all got
feedback from that.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.770
So it's the second
problem, where you're

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.175
asked to combine B-trees.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.620
You have two B-trees, T1 and
T2 each with some children.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.050
And we're giving you
another element, k.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.050
And we ask you to combine them.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.110
So if the two trees are the
same height, how do you do that?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.130
Does anyone want to
share his or her answer?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.630
Go ahead.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.630
AUDIENCE: You put k in
the middle of T1 and T2.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.770
And then you can split.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.770
LING REN: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.780
So you put k here.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.190
And if this is too
full, you split.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.250
So why do I have to do this?

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.000
Can I simply just make k
my new root and do this?

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.840
Go ahead.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.440
AUDIENCE: Because
T1 and T2 don't

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.581
have to be valid like
internal [? modular ?] nodes.

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:43.580
LING REN: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.040
So for B-tree, the
requirement on the root

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.157
is slightly different
from the requirements

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:49.240
for the rest of the nodes.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.360
To this may have
too few children.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.050
It is not a valid node.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.560
It's not a valid internal node.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.770
But our solution actually made
a mistake in the second part.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.480
In the second part, we're
saying so T1 and T2,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.600
their heights are
different by 1.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.170
Our solution says put k
here and make a pointer.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.580
Exactly the same problem.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.350
Does everyone see that?

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.250
So this may not be a
valid internal node.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.240
So what's the correct solution?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.950
You put k here and combine
it with the last child of T1.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.540
And then you may have to
split and split again.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.389
OK.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.430
Everyone happy with that?

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.200
Now, today, we're going to look
into randomization specifically

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.905
we have seen two
algorithms in class.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.650
I'll just call them quick
find and quick sort.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.310
So quick find is a slightly
generalized version

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.570
of medium finding.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.060
In the very first
lecture and recitation,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.990
we have seen a non-randomized
version of quick sort.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.090
So we divide them
into groups of five.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.540
And we find a medium
of each group.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.650
And then find the
median of the median.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.860
Depending on whether you
are smaller or larger,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.070
we drew a funny
subproblem like this.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.470
Anyone remember that?

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.870
And we analyzed
this runtime, where

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.890
our recursion was one
fifth plus 7 over 10

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.080
or something like that.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.840
And we show it's the
worst case O of n.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.200
So that's a smart algorithm,
I'll give you that.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.010
But it's just complicated.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.340
You have to divide
them into groups

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.160
and do, well, several
recursive course.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.010
And also, let me
digress a little bit,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.210
there's a very interesting
point regarding this worst case

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.920
O of n algorithm.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.839
Has anyone wondered why
we use groups of five?

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:16.839
Why not groups of three?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.390
Algorithms should work
in the same way, right?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.070
If we take out this first
row and this last row,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.046
we can still find the
median, which is just

00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:33.670
a second element in
each group and find

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.800
the median of the median.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.390
We still have a subproblem
that looks like this.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.500
Exercise.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.300
And it turns out if we
use groups of three,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.280
when we solve the recursion,
it doesn't solve to O of n.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.700
It solves to something else.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.350
OK.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.770
Now, end of digression.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.180
Let's get back to the
randomized version.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.110
So how does the
randomized version work?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.440
It's that much simpler.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.130
We have an array.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.070
Let me call it Find in
array A, which is of size n.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.650
And we want to find i-th largest
or smallest element in it.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.560
So what we're going
to do is that we'll

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.530
pick a random element,
x, in this array.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:37.270
And then we'll put all the
smaller elements on this side

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.050
and all the larger
elements on that side.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.160
Now, because I'm
picking the random one,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.440
so this x can be anywhere.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:58.396
If it is the k-th smallest
element from the left, then

00:05:58.396 --> 00:05:59.145
what do I do next?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.210
My goal is to find out
the i-th smallest element

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:18.466
in this array, A.

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:23.330
AUDIENCE: If A is longer
than i then [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.484
LING REN: OK.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:34.220
If i is less than k, then my
element is on this side, right?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.971
So I should find--
OK, let me define

00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:39.220
this to be the left array,
this to be the right array.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.580
I should find in the left
array, what is its size?

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.190
It's k minus 1.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.730
Make sense?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.730
This is k minus 1.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.376
And that is n minus k plus
one element in the middle.

00:06:53.376 --> 00:07:03.628
And so what's the last argument
in that function called?

00:07:03.628 --> 00:07:05.480
It's i.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.250
So on the other hand,
if i is greater than k,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.100
then I should go
to my right half.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.670
Its problem size is n minus k.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.740
So what's the last argument?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.210
AUDIENCE: i minus k.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.630
LING REN: Agree?

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.770
i minus k.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.590
OK.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.462
So, of course, if i is equal
than k, then we just return x.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:49.710
Now, obviously, this algorithm's
runtime depends on our luck,

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.940
depends on this choice of k.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.120
If k is roughly in the middle,
then we reduce the problem size

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.640
by roughly half.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.970
However, if k is
0 or close to n,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.470
then we only reduce the
problem size by a little bit.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:10.610
So it's impossible to
give a definite runtime.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.340
So what we opt to do
in randomized algorithm

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.820
is that we analyze
expected runtime.

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:24.570
What does that mean?

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.680
So we can write the
recursion of this.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:39.320
It's T of n equals-- I
have two subproblems.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.409
One of them is T of k minus 1.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:47.286
The other is T of n minus k.

00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:49.160
So which one should I
put into the recursion?

00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:56.635
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:57.260
LING REN: Yeah.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.750
I don't know, right?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.940
I don't know whether my element
is on a left or on the right.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.570
So I'll be conservative and
take a max of these two.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.329
Let me write it
down a little bit.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.740
And I have some
amount of work to do

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.000
before I go to my subproblem.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:38.720
What's the complexity
of that work?

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.220
Go ahead.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.140
LING REN: It's all O of n.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.240
O of theta n.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.064
Why is that?

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:49.497
AUDIENCE: Because you
have to create the array.

00:09:49.497 --> 00:09:50.080
LING REN: Yes.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.130
Because you have to
scan the array once to

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.720
put the smaller elements on one
side and the larger elements

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.940
on the other side.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.950
Now, this recurrence
is impossible to solve,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.620
because I don't know what k is.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.735
So instead, we'll just
calculate its expectation.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.960
So the expectation of T
of n is taking average

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.410
over all the randomness,
which means the choice of k.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:39.290
So there is a probability
that my k is equal to j.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.380
If my k is equal
to j, then I should

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.760
take the maximum of-- sorry.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.690
If my k is equal
to j, then I should

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.120
take the expectation of the
maximum between those two.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.850
And according to the
definition of expectation,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.660
I should do a sum from j
equals 0-- no, not zero.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:35.796
I'm starting with 1 all
the way to n, right?

00:11:35.796 --> 00:11:36.670
Any questions so far?

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:53.470
Now, obviously, depending
on my choice of j,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.960
sometimes this one is larger.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.250
Sometimes that one is larger.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.580
I'll just write it
a little verbosely.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:10.790
So if my j is 1, then I
should take the right one.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.040
Plus, if j is 2, then I
should take m minus 2,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.250
so on and so forth, right?

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.800
I think everyone
gets this, right?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.850
So I'll just directly
jump to the next step.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.970
So when j is smaller
than half of n,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.640
I will take the right one.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.720
If j is larger than half
of n, I will take left one.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.910
And they happen to be symmetric.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:06.430
And what I have here
is-- everyone gets that?

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.020
Now, maybe I'm missing
the minus 1 here.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.560
OK, I shouldn't sum to there.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.060
Sorry.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.500
I have n minus 1, n, minus
2, n minus 3, all the way

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.982
to half of n.

00:13:29.982 --> 00:13:32.430
But from there, I
know longer go down.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.030
I go backwards, half of
n plus 1 plus 2 plus 3,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.925
all the way back to n minus 1.

00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:42.015
Any questions so far?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.076
Oh, we forgot our last
term, which is a theta n.

00:13:56.532 --> 00:13:57.960
Now, how do we solve this?

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.810
Any thoughts?

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:14.940
This is a recurrence on
the expectation of T.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.140
So for this type of
general recurrence,

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.480
we don't have a very good way.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.300
Instead, what we'll do is
just take a random guess,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.920
and then see if it is correct.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.730
So I don't really need
to guess in this case,

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.370
because I know it's O of n.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:40.650
So let's just assume
our expectation of Tn

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.492
is theta of n.

00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:45.575
What does that mean again?

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:59.240
It means I can find
some constant, such

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:07.770
that this expectation is
bounded by a constant times n.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.590
So far so good?

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.180
Now, we can use
induction, assume

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.280
that this holds for
everything up to n minus 1.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.764
And we're going to show
this also holds for n.

00:15:22.764 --> 00:15:23.722
Then we're done, right?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.160
Now, we'll just plug that in.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:38.840
The expectation of T n will
be less or equal than this sum

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.655
from half of n to n.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.020
Right?

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.680
Yeah, I just plugged that in.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.880
Of course, plus
our theta n term.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.650
Now, what's the sum of this guy?

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.470
Any guesses?

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.400
n square? n cube?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.510
or n?

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.010
OK.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.090
It's probably a messy.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.685
More cleanly, I can
pull this B out.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:31.850
It's just the sigma of
j if I change my sum,

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.500
decrease the range of sum by 1.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.900
What is the sigma some of j?

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.908
What order first?

00:16:45.908 --> 00:16:47.280
AUDIENCE: n square.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.224
LING REN: n square.

00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:50.040
OK.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.200
Yeah, definitely n square.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.500
But we need to be a little
bit more precise than that.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.740
So what's the coefficient
before the n square?

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.079
So I claim this
coefficient is 3 over 8.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.263
Can anyone see that?

00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:21.331
AUDIENCE: Why did you assume
that the expected value is

00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:22.520
theta n.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.319
LING REN: Oh,
that's just a guess.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.849
If it's wrong, we'll have to
assume something else, which

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.098
we'll see in the next example.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.450
But good question.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:34.850
OK.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.350
Yeah.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.750
Let me ask the question again.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.940
I claim this sum is
roughly 3 over 8 n square.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880
Can anyone see that?

00:17:51.261 --> 00:17:51.760
Any ideas?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.400
So I don't know how to
calculate this term.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.670
But I do know how to calculate
sigma from 1 to n, right?

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.250
This is easy.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.750
What's that?

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:17.170
It's half of n, n minus 1.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:23.910
So it's roughly
half of n squared.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.070
Now, this term is
the sum of this

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.050
minus the sum to half of n.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.390
So it's roughly half
of n squared minus one

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.200
half of one half n squared.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.280
Makes sense?

00:18:50.280 --> 00:19:00.075
So this is roughly 3 over
8 n squared plus an order n

00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:02.125
term or less, or constant.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.006
Any questions?

00:19:07.006 --> 00:19:07.950
Does that makes sense?

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.280
Then it's very easy if
we just plug this in.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.620
Sorry.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.000
There is a mistake.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.670
I just realized.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.645
Can anyone point that out?

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.515
So how many terms
do I have in total?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.720
One from n, I have [? a ?] term.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.970
So each term should
appear twice.

00:19:52.028 --> 00:19:53.840
Correct?

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.780
So I should have a two here.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.810
And so I somehow just throw
away this probability.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:09.797
But this probability
is 1 over n.

00:20:09.797 --> 00:20:11.380
Because I'm choosing
a random element,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.020
there is 1 over n probability
that is equal to 1,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.030
equal to 2, 3, 4.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.460
Every of this is 1 over n.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:27.830
Correct?

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.270
So I should have 2 over
n here, 2 over here.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:52.080
And if we plug this in, it's 3
over 8 n cubed plus a theta n.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:59.260
Our goal is to show this is
less than B times n, which

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.910
is clearly true.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:09.030
Because this is 3/4 of n, 3/4
of B times n, plus another term.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.120
We can say this is another
constant D times n.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.307
And if we choose B
accordingly, this can hold.

00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:17.890
Any questions?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.930
You look confused or too easy.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:40.430
OK.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.080
Our guess is the latter.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:46.085
Oh, it is not?

00:21:54.852 --> 00:21:55.860
OK?

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.040
So then we have solved this
expected runtime of quick find.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.850
Now, let's look at quick sort.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.080
Quick sort is very similar.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.294
The only difference
is that once I

00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:13.960
put all the smaller
elements on one side

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.270
and the larger elements
on the other side,

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.980
instead of going into one of
them, I have to sort of both.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:29.360
So the only change is that
instead of taking the max here,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.560
I need to add them.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.280
Correct?

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.300
So now the same thing here.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.770
Instead of taking the
max, I should add them up.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:56.050
Now when it propagates
here, so every term appears

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:05.489
twice all the way from j
equals 1 to j equals n.

00:23:05.489 --> 00:23:06.405
Is everyone following?

00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:18.372
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat that?

00:23:18.372 --> 00:23:19.080
LING REN: Hm-hmm?

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.360
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat that?

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:20.901
LING REN: OK.

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:21.850
Sure.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.880
Originally, we have a max here.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.370
So first, did everyone
get this part?

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.400
We have a plus
instead of a max here.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.830
We have to solve
both the problems.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.650
Now, if it's a max, then what
I have is n minus 1, n minus 2,

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.730
all the way to half of
n, and then half of n,

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.120
half of n plus 1, all the
way back to n minus 1, right?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.060
And if I have a sum, then what
I have is for j equals 1's case,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:56.970
I have T of 0 and
T of n and minus 1.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.130
This is j equals 1.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:05.520
If j equals 2, I have T
of 1 and T of n minus 2.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:09.540
As j increases, this
one goes from 0 to n.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.240
And this one goes
from n minus 1 to 0.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.044
I'm going to sum all of them up.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.064
Does that answer your question?

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:27.530
OK.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:31.600
So instead of from half of n to
n, we're summing from 1 to n.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:40.870
Now, we also have another
good question here.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.870
Why do I guess it's theta n?

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.180
Well, it's just a random guess.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.300
It could be wrong.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.340
For example, in this
case, it's just incorrect.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:49.840
Why?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:57.160
Because every sum, the
range becomes a 1 to n.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.120
Now what I have is no
longer 3 over 8 over n.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.730
What do I have again?

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.520
What do I have now
if it's 1 over n?

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:15.245
AUDIENCE: One half.

00:25:15.245 --> 00:25:15.870
LING REN: Yeah.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.036
It's one half of n.

00:25:18.036 --> 00:25:21.490
But if I change one
half here, what I get

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.530
is B times n plus D times n.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.930
I want to prove
that it's smaller

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:32.030
than B times n, which is
clearly impossible no matter

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:44.710
how you choose B.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.960
Did everyone get that?

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.220
If we the same assumption,
I make the hypothesis

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.100
and we plug them
in, we can no longer

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.350
prove the induction step.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:25:59.630
OK.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:01.319
So what we do?

00:26:01.319 --> 00:26:02.235
We make another guess.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.315
So let me rewrite our recursion.

00:26:21.328 --> 00:26:22.715
So what's the next guess?

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:32.650
Any guesses?

00:26:41.035 --> 00:26:42.410
How about we just
guess n square?

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.320
Anyone unhappy with that guess?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.540
So we can do the same thing.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.260
We can plug it in.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.030
And that will be a-- sorry,
I missed another term.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.570
This is 1 over 2 here.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.600
If we make that
guess, then what we

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:14.450
have is the sum
from 1 to n minus 1,

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.004
the sum of j square
plus a theta n.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:34.260
And the sum of j squared is
roughly n cubed divided by 3.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.251
Is that obvious to everyone?

00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:41.750
Maybe not.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.100
OK.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.590
Can anyone explain
this to us, why

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:55.710
can I claim the sum of square
term is n cubed over 3?

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:07.494
Go ahead.

00:28:07.494 --> 00:28:11.904
AUDIENCE: It's n times n
minus 1 times n minus 2 over

00:28:11.904 --> 00:28:12.404
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:14.945 --> 00:28:16.320
LING REN: I think
you're correct.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.550
There is a formula, which is--
yeah, I don't remember exactly,

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:25.150
but it's roughly this.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:27.310
If you know this, then
you definitely see that.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:32.010
If you don't, we can turn
this sum into an integral.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:41.830
And that is n cubed over 3.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.383
Make sense?

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.790
If we plug that in,
what do we have?

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:56.370
2 over n 3n cubed plus theta n.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.290
Of course there's a B here.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.625
And we want to show this is
less than B times n squared.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.566
Does it hold?

00:29:09.566 --> 00:29:10.065
Is it true?

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.270
It's clearly true, right?

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.597
So this-- no.

00:29:22.597 --> 00:29:23.180
This is cubed.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:26.940
Yeah.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.314
Sorry, I am making
many mistakes.

00:29:28.314 --> 00:29:32.820
But that's actually good
to catch your attention.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.280
But it actually worries me
that you didn't point this out.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.890
This is 2/3 n
squared times B. It's

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.010
clearly less than B n square.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.510
OK.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.321
So we claimed the
algorithm is n squared.

00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:50.820
Correct?

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.170
Go ahead.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:58.660
AUDIENCE: Does
that mean that you

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.517
claim that it's less
than n squared, being

00:30:00.517 --> 00:30:02.301
that it's n squared definitely?

00:30:02.301 --> 00:30:03.050
LING REN: Exactly.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:07.380
So what I've proved here is
that the algorithm is definitely

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.680
O of n square, but maybe less.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.590
And you can see we still
have a lot of room here.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.300
This inequality
is not very tight.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.050
So in fact, it's a
very good question,

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.570
how do we make that guess.

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:31.440
So you already know the
answer is n log n, right?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.460
So it's not interesting.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.100
But if you don't, then how
do we go about and do things?

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.870
We have to make these guesses.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.780
So how about we know this n
doesn't hold and 2 is too much.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.220
Next guess is n raised
to 1 plus epsilon.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.506
Then what will we have?

00:30:52.506 --> 00:30:57.420
If we carry out the
same integral argument,

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:05.630
we have 2 plus epsilon, n
raised to 2 plus epsilon

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.927
over 2 plus epsilon.

00:31:06.927 --> 00:31:08.270
Correct?

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:20.600
And if we plug that
in, we get this.

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:28.060
And we want to show
it's less than n raised

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.880
to 1 plus epsilon.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.670
Does this hold?

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.290
This term is less than 1.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.800
And that's n raised
to 1 plus epsilon.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.030
So this is true.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:49.320
So we can easily prove
it's, indeed, n raised to 1

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.080
plus epsilon for any epsilon.

00:31:53.695 --> 00:31:54.195
Questions?

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.750
But is it tight?

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.370
We still don't know.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:02.730
So then what do we do?

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.110
We just make another guess.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:13.328
And let's guess T of n
is [INAUDIBLE] n log n.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.370
Definitely, you may
run into two cases.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.110
You can either prove it or not.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.390
If this doesn't hold, you
just go to log n square.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.550
And gradually, you
will find the answer.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.150
Well, if you don't
know the answer,

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.480
probably this is
how you do things.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:41.110
Now, if we guess
this n log n, then I

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:47.350
have a little harder
equation here.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.850
Because it's now j log j.

00:33:04.634 --> 00:33:05.550
How do I compute that?

00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:19.340
Yeah.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:24.510
It's not the sum of natural
number or squares of numbers,

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:29.359
so you cannot use a
formula like this.

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:31.150
But we can still use
the integral argument.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.420
I'm not going to do
that, because that's

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.880
what you should have learned in
calculus or other math class.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.760
But it happens that
this integral of j log j

00:33:49.760 --> 00:34:04.760
is roughly half of n squared log
n minus some constant times log

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.260
n.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.830
I think you can
change this constant.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:11.389
But it's roughly
smaller than that.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:45.520
If you plug that in, you get
n over 2 one half times B

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.080
plus theta n.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.020
And we want it to be
smaller than B times n log

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.850
n, which will be true.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.060
This is exactly that, but
we are minus some term.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.162
And the term we
are extracting is

00:35:12.162 --> 00:35:13.370
larger than the theta n term.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.430
So we can prove this
algorithm is n log n.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.840
But you can ask
the same question,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.260
how do I know it's n log n?

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.530
Or if I don't know
it's n log n, maybe I

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.320
should go about
and try log log n.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:37.740
So you're welcome to try.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.120
And it's actually a
very good thought.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.099
Because I think is
very uninteresting

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:44.390
if you already know the answer.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.736
If you don't know,
you have to try that.

00:35:46.736 --> 00:35:49.120
But when do you stop?

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.490
At a reasonable
point, you can also

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.910
prove the other way
that it's runtime is

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.930
larger than something.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.580
Here, if we prove
this big O of n log n,

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.974
if you can show the other
way that it's omega n log n,

00:36:03.974 --> 00:36:06.950
then you know you have
arrived at a final answer.

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.720
That's the math part.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.065
Any questions about that?

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:24.030
Yeah.

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.113
Any questions about
everything I have said so far?

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.750
If not, so lastly, I
just have a few comments,

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:40.860
several terminology.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:49.920
Now, this recitation we
focused on expected runtime.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.300
You have already seen
amortized runtime.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.070
Or you may have heard
of average runtime.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.930
So to be honest,
expected and amortized

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:14.470
are just too fancier
ways of saying average.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:20.882
But in algorithm analysis, we do
mean slightly different things

00:37:20.882 --> 00:37:21.590
with these terms.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.310
So the difference is
that we are averaging

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.540
over different things.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.870
So if we say average
runtime, we usually

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.370
mean taking the
average over input.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.710
We can imagine a
quick sort of quick

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.760
find algorithm that doesn't use
randomness, where you'll always

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.380
select your first
element as your favorite.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.220
That's a reasonable algorithm.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:49.200
If your input is
random, then you

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.110
can carry out the same argument
and show that its complexity is

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.320
over n or n log n.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.490
But if your input is pre-sorted
or reverse sorted in some

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.230
special cases, you
cannot do that.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.510
So average runtime is
usually a very weak argument,

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:08.400
because you have to make
assumptions about your input.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.790
And expected runtime
is definitely better,

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.060
because we are taking average
over the randomness we

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.630
introduced.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:20.770
They are independent
of the input.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:25.090
So we're not making any
assumptions on the input.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.300
So of course, this
comes at a price.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.330
This randomness
doesn't come for free.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.360
So in fact, it's very hard
to generate high quantity

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.030
random numbers.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.460
Maybe at the end
of the class, you

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.030
will see that in
crypto, a lot of works

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.630
are just devoted to generate
high quantity random numbers.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.870
If you can do that
efficiently, you can actually

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:49.280
solve a lot of problems.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.322
So amortized runtime are
slightly, again, different

00:38:53.322 --> 00:38:55.280
from these two, because
they are taking average

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.740
over a number of operations.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.250
You're doing many, many
operations in a row.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.500
And some of them takes longer.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.540
Some of them take shorter.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.080
And you take average on those.

00:39:09.445 --> 00:39:10.420
OK.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.587
That's this recitation.

00:39:11.587 --> 00:39:12.170
Any questions?

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:22.090
OK.
