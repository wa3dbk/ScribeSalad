00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.740
LING REN: Everyone,
today we're going to look

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.260
at dynamic programming again.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
So I think I have
mentioned several times,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.590
so you should all
know it by heart now,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.420
the dynamic programming,
its main idea

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.460
is divide the problem
into subproblems and reuse

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.680
the results of the problems
you already solved.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.600
Right?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.010
And, of course, in 6.046 we
always care about the runtime.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.720
So those are the two big
themes for dynamic programming.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.070
Now, let's start with
a warm-up example.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.120
It's extremely simple.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.730
Let's say we have a grid, and
there's a robot from, say,

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.980
coordinate 1,1 and it wants
to go to coordinate m,n.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.980
So at every step, it can
only either take a step up,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.160
or take a step on the right.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.640
So how many distinct paths are
there for the robot to take?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.290
Is the question clear?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.870
So we have a robot
at coordinate 1,1.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.420
It wants to go to
coordinate m,n.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.410
And every step, it can
either take a step up,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.420
or take a step to the right.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.340
How many distinct
path are there that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.153
can take the robot
to its destination?

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.365
Any ideas how to solve that?

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:20.123
Go ahead.

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:23.616
AUDIENCE: So, we define
subproblems as the number

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:30.640
of distinct paths from
some point x,y to m,n.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.090
Then the number of distinct
paths from some point

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.990
is the number of paths if you go
up if you're allowed to go up,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.930
plus the number of
paths if you go right

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.400
if you're allowed to go right.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880
So if you were on the
edge, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.520
LING REN: Yup, yup.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520
Does everyone got that?

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.540
So, it's very simple.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.590
So, I know I have only one
way to get to these points.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.230
I need to go all the way right.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.340
And only one way to
get to these points.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.560
I need to go all the way up.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.720
So for all the
intermediate nodes,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.220
my number of choices are--
is this board moving?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.490
Are just the number of distinct
paths I can come from my left,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.060
plus the number of distinct
path I can come from bottom.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.200
And then I can go in.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.500
For every node, I'll just take
a sum between the two numbers

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.200
on my left and on my bottom.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.900
And go from there.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.495
OK.

00:03:26.495 --> 00:03:27.478
Is that clear?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.320
So this example is
very simple, but it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.125
does illustrate the point of
dynamic programming very well.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.210
You solve subproblems, and ask
how many distinct path can I

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.930
come here, and you reuse
the results of, for example,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.200
this subproblem because
you are using it to compute

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.400
this number and that number.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.440
If you don't do that, if
you don't memorize and reuse

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.055
the results, then your
runtime will be worse.

00:04:06.055 --> 00:04:07.305
So what's the runtime of that?

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.601
Speak up.

00:04:17.601 --> 00:04:19.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.100
LING REN: It's just m times n.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.600
Why?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.320
Because I have this many
unique sub problems.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.580
One at each point, and I'm just
taking the sum of two numbers

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.470
at each subproblem, so
it takes me constant time

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.490
to merge the results from my
subproblems to get my problem.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.220
So to analyze
runtime, usually we

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.010
ask the question how many
unique problems do I have.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.760
And what's the
amount of merge work

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.000
I have to do at every step?

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:05.500
That's the toy example.

00:05:09.685 --> 00:05:12.850
Now let's look at some
more complicated examples.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.545
Our first one is
called make change.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.320
As its name suggests, we
have a bunch of coins.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.710
s1, s2, all the way to, say, sm.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.600
So each coin has some values,
like 1 cent, 5 cent, 10 cent.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.500
We're going to make change
for a total of n cents,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.550
and ask what's the
minimum number of coins

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.715
do I need to make
change of n cents.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.540
So to guarantee that we can
always make this change,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.990
we'll set s1 to be 1.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.820
Otherwise, there's a chance
that the problem is unsolvable.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.860
Any ideas?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.418
Is the problem clear?

00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:12.834
STUDENT: How do
you find s1 again?

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:15.800
Or si?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.970
LING REN: What, these numbers?

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.690
They are inputs.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.870
They are also inputs.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.840
It could be 1 cent,
5 cent, 10 cent.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.670
Or 3 cent, 7 cent.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.170
Though the smallest
one is always 1.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.920
OK.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.461
I need to find a
combination of them.

00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:35.330
For each of them, I have
an infinite number of them.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.230
So I can find two of these,
three of that, five of that,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.960
such that their sum is n.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.918
Is the problem clear?

00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:48.865
OK.

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:50.031
Any ideas how to solve that?

00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:59.510
So let's just use a naive
or very straightforward

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.010
algorithms.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.190
Go ahead.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.640
AUDIENCE: You pick one, and
then you do mc of n minus that.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.000
LING REN: OK, great.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.460
Yeah, let's just do
exhaustive search.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.220
Let's pick si.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.770
If I pick this coin,
then my subproblem

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.220
becomes n minus the coin value.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.950
And of course, I
use the one coin.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.230
That's si.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:50.180
So then I think the min of this
for all the i's, and that's

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.940
the solution.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.060
So far so good?

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.140
OK.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.430
So what's the runtime
of this algorithm?

00:08:15.968 --> 00:08:19.640
If it's not immediately
obvious, then we

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.620
ask how many unique
subproblems are there.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.470
And how much work do I have to
do to go from my subproblems

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.140
to my original problem?

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.105
So how many
subproblem are there?

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.960
So to be clear, for
this one, we have

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.730
to call this
recursive call again.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.110
n minus si, probably minus sj.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.860
And if you cannot compute how
many subproblems are there,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.890
let's just give a bound.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.980
Any ideas?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.826
John, right?

00:09:32.826 --> 00:09:35.022
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure there would

00:09:35.022 --> 00:09:39.658
be more than n subproblems,
because the smallest

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:44.538
amount we can subtract
from the original is 1.

00:09:44.538 --> 00:09:46.978
And if we keep
subtracting 1 repeatedly,

00:09:46.978 --> 00:09:48.930
we get n subproblems,
and that will cover

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.870
everything-- that subproblem.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.870
LING REN: Yeah, correct.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.260
So this may not be
a very tight bound,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.570
but we know we cannot
have more than this number

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.830
of subproblems.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.300
Actually, I don't need to
even put the order there.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.410
I know we can have no
more than n subproblems.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.650
They're just make change of n, n
minus 1, n minus 2, all the way

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.010
to make change 1.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.960
And actually, this
bound is pretty

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.590
tight, because we set
our smallest coin is 1,

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.580
so we won't make a recursive
call to make change n minus 1,

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.320
right?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.470
If I pick the 1 coin,
the 1 cent coin first.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.710
And then from there, I will
pick a 1 cent coin again.

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.850
That gives me a
subproblem with n minus 2.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.580
So indeed, I will encounter
all the n subproblems.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.810
OK, so having realized
that, how much work

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.315
do I have to do to go
from here to there?

00:10:56.316 --> 00:10:58.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.870
LING REN: Correct.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:02.430
Because I'm taking the
min of how many terms?

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.264
m terms.

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.180
So that's our runtime.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.480
Any questions so far?

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.090
If not, let me
take a digression.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.710
So, make change, this problem.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.335
If you think about it, it's
very similar to knapsack.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.300
Has anyone not heard
of this problem?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.530
Knapsack means you
have a bunch of items.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.430
You want to pack
these into a bag,

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.880
and the bag has a certain size.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.520
So each item has
a certain value,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.050
and you want to pack the items
that have the largest combined

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.160
value into your bag.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.415
So, why are they similar?

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.070
So in some sense, n is our size.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.590
We want to pick a bunch of
coins to make the size n.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.720
And each coin here actually
has a negative value,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.350
because we want to
pick the min of it.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.344
If you do that, then this
problem is exactly knapsack.

00:12:20.344 --> 00:12:21.510
And knapsack is NP-complete.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.130
That means we don't know a
polynomial solution to it yet.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.630
However, we just found one.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.840
Our input is, m stuff and n.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.555
Our solution is polynomial
to m, and polynomial to n.

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:51.040
If this is true, then I have
found the polynomial solution

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.120
to one NP problem.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.320
So P equals NP.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.292
SO we should all be getting
Turing award for that.

00:12:58.292 --> 00:12:59.500
So clearly something's wrong.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.000
But there's no problem
with this solution.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.330
This covers all the cases.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.790
And our analysis is
definitely correct.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.885
So does anyone get
what I'm asking?

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.620
So what's the
contradiction here?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.490
I will probably
discuss this later,

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.390
in later lectures when we get
to complexity or reduction.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.500
But to give a short
answer, the problem

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:46.200
is that when we say the input
is n, its size is not n.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:54.680
So I only need log n this
to represent this input.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.090
Make sense?

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.040
Therefore, for log n length
input, my runtime is n.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.567
That means my runtime
is exponential.

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:04.400
It's not polynomial.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.824
OK.

00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:09.365
Now that's the end
of the digression.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.910
Now let's look at
another example.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.650
This one is called
rectangular blocks.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.130
So in this problem, we
have a bunch of blocks.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.530
Say 1, 2, all the way to n.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:54.310
And each of them has a
length, width, and height.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.890
So it's a
three-dimensional block.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.790
So I want to put blocks, stack
them on top of each other

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.070
to get the maximum height.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:10.230
But in order for j to
be put on top of i,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:18.530
I require the length of j to be
smaller then the length of i,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.800
and the width of j is also
smaller with width of i.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.190
So visually I just
meant this is a block.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.250
I can put another
block on there.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.176
They are smaller in
width and length.

00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:39.930
But I cannot put this guy on
top of it because one of its

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.190
dimension is larger than
the underlying block.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:48.910
And to make things simple,
that's not allowed, rotating.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.360
So OK, I can rotate.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.280
It still doesn't fit.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.730
But you see the complication.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.610
So you allow rotate, then
there's more possibility.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.560
Length and width are so
one of them is north-south,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.785
the other is east-west,
and you cannot change that.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:09.380
OK.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.580
Is the problem clear?

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.380
You want to stack one
on top of each other

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.970
to get the maximum height.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.140
Any ideas?

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.510
Again, let's start
from simple algorithm.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.950
Say, let's just
try everything out.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.430
OK, go ahead.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.005
AUDIENCE: If you try everything
else, you have n factorial.

00:16:51.005 --> 00:16:51.713
LING REN: Pardon?

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:53.797
AUDIENCE: It would
be O of n factorial?

00:16:53.797 --> 00:16:55.130
LING REN: You're going too fast.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.360
Let's write the algorithm first.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.220
So I want to solve my rectangle
block problem, say from 1 to n.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.220
What are my subproblems?

00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:11.669
AUDIENCE: Choose one block.

00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:12.210
LING REN: OK.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.168
Let's choose one block.

00:17:13.168 --> 00:17:17.036
AUDIENCE: And then you run RB
of everything except that block.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.599
LING REN: So I get its height,
and then I have a subproblem.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.630
What is the subproblem?

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.760
And then I'll take a max.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:41.920
So the difficulty here
is this subproblem.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.410
So Andrew, right?

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:51.320
So Andrew said it's just
everything except i.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.410
Is that the case?

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:53.910
Go ahead.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.410
AUDIENCE: It's
everything except i,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.305
and anything with
wider or longer than i.

00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:00.630
LING REN: Do you get that?

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.260
Not only do we
have to exclude i,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.770
we also have to exclude
everything longer or wider

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:08.880
than i.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.545
So that's actually
a messy problem.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:25.480
So let me define this subproblem
to be a compatible set of w i.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:34.090
And let me define that to
be the set of blocks where

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.140
the length is smaller
than the required length,

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:45.420
and their which is also smaller
than the required width.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.280
So this should remind you of
the weighted interval scheduling

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.650
problem, where we define
a compatible set once we

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:54.950
have chosen some block.

00:18:58.823 --> 00:18:59.323
Question?

00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:00.989
AUDIENCE: What are
we trying to do here?

00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:04.180
Are we trying to minimize h?

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.340
LING REN: Maximize h.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.940
We want to get as
high as possible.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.990
I choose a block,
I get its height,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.930
and then I find out the
competitive remaining blocks,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.750
and I want to stack
them on top of it.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.330
Everyone agrees this
solution is correct?

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.820
OK, then let's
analyze its runtime.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.360
So how do we analyze runtime?

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.374
So what's the first
question I always ask?

00:19:55.374 --> 00:19:57.596
AUDIENCE: How many subproblems?

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:58.220
LING REN: Yeah.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.470
I'm not sure who said
that, but how many

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.600
subproblems do we have?

00:20:19.841 --> 00:20:22.027
AUDIENCE: At most n?

00:20:22.027 --> 00:20:22.860
LING REN: At most n.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.460
Can you explain why
is that the case?

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.150
Or it's just a guess?

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:37.340
AUDIENCE: Because if n
is compatible-- nothing

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.555
in the compatible--
n will not be

00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:41.047
in the compatible
set of anything

00:20:41.047 --> 00:20:44.029
that is in the
compatible set of n.

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:45.780
LING REN: OK,
that's very tricky.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.650
I didn't get that.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.580
Can you say that again?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.130
AUDIENCE: Because
for example, if you

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.630
start with n, then
everything that's

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.140
in the compatible set of n.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:59.020
n won't be in the
compatible set of that.

00:21:01.624 --> 00:21:02.165
LING REN: OK.

00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:04.290
I think I got what you said.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.330
So, if we think there are only
n subproblems, what are they?

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:16.976
They have to be compatible
sets l1, w1, then l2, w2.

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:19.000
These are the n
unique subproblems

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.670
you are thinking about.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.540
Is there any chance that I
will get a compatible set

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.770
like something like l3 but w5?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.320
If I ever have this
subproblem then, well,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.845
my number of subproblems
are kind of exploding.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:49.210
Yeah, I see many of
you are saying no.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.210
Why not?

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.180
Because if we have a subproblem,
say, compatible set of l i

00:21:54.180 --> 00:22:05.160
and w i, and if we go from here,
and choose the next block, say

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:18.370
t, it's guaranteed that t
is shorter and narrower.

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:22.300
That means our new subproblem,
or new compatible set

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:30.040
becomes-- our new
subproblem needs to be

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.750
compatible with t instead of i.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.580
So, the only subproblems
I can get are these ones.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.330
I cannot have one of these.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.446
The number of subproblems are n.

00:22:48.446 --> 00:22:56.145
And how much work do I
have to do at each level?

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.200
AUDIENCE: n.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.540
LING REN: n, because
I'm just taking the max,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.860
and there are n potential
choices inside my max.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:14.760
So runtime n squared.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:32.810
OK, we're not fully done,
because there is an extra step

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.350
when we're trying to do this.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.280
We have to figure out
what each of these are.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.060
Because once I go
into this subproblem,

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:51.120
I need to take a max on all
the blocks that's in this set.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.420
I have to know what
blocks are in that set.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.530
Is that hard?

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.542
So how would you do that?

00:24:02.542 --> 00:24:06.999
AUDIENCE: You just check for
all of them, and that's O of n.

00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:07.540
LING REN: OK.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.950
So, I check all of them.

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:10.830
That's O of n.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.520
I'm pretty sure you
just meant scanning,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.970
scan the entire thing, and
pick out the compatible ones.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.140
But that's for this subproblem.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.130
We have to do it for every one.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.230
Or there may be a better way.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.240
So I think the previous
TA is telling me there's

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.020
a better way to do that.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.730
So in order to find the
entire compatible stuff,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.624
he claims he can do it in n log
n, but I haven't checked that,

00:24:39.624 --> 00:24:40.290
so I'm not sure.

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:45.230
This is a folklore legend here.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.880
Yeah, we'll double
check that offline.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.080
But assuming if I
don't have this, then

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.960
figure out all these subproblems
will also take n squared.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.910
Then my total runtime is
n squared plus n squared,

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.040
and still n squared.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:06.900
Question?

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.784
AUDIENCE: Is the
n log n solution

00:25:08.784 --> 00:25:11.139
giving us sorting
this by [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:14.014 --> 00:25:15.930
LING REN: Yeah, I think
it should be something

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.260
along those lines, but yeah, I
haven't figured out whether you

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.070
sort by length or by width.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.890
You can only sort
by one of them.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.150
So after sorting, say
let's sort by length.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.570
Then after sorting, I may
get something like this.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.600
And if I'm asking what's
the compatible set of width

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.885
this guy, I still have
to kick all of them out.

00:25:48.942 --> 00:25:52.130
Yeah, so it's not entirely
clear to me how to do it,

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:57.240
but I think you can potentially
consider having another,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.550
say, binary search tree
that's sorted by width,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.910
and you can go in and just
delete everything larger

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.280
than a certain width.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.640
So that's the, yeah.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.642
OK, go ahead.

00:26:09.642 --> 00:26:13.815
AUDIENCE: Can you convert into
a directed graph, where each

00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:17.615
pair of shapes that's
compatible, you do an edge.

00:26:17.615 --> 00:26:20.950
And then path find.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.100
LING REN: OK.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.510
OK.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.626
But constructing that graph
already takes O n squared,

00:26:29.626 --> 00:26:30.126
correct?

00:26:34.856 --> 00:26:36.470
Yeah, OK, let's move on.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.260
I don't have time
to figure this out.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:49.160
So, this problem is remotely
similar to interval scheduling,

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.180
weighted interval
scheduling, in a sense

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.630
that it has some compatible set.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:58.430
And in the very first
lecture and recitation,

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.400
we have two algorithm for
weighted interval scheduling,

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.617
and one of them is
better than the other.

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:06.450
And this one looks like
the naive algorithm.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.380
So, does anyone remember
what the better algorithm

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.925
is for weighted
interval scheduling?

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:55.530
But instead of checking every
one as my potential lowest one,

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.230
it really doesn't
make sense to do that.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.160
Because for the
very small ones, I

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.420
shouldn't put them
as my bottom one.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:09.440
I should try the larger ones
first as the very bottom one.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:09.940
Go ahead.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.908
Oh, you're not--

00:28:11.908 --> 00:28:15.380
AUDIENCE: You could create
a sorted list of length n

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.868
with the width.

00:28:16.868 --> 00:28:19.844
So you know that items
that are later in the list,

00:28:19.844 --> 00:28:24.330
they're not going to be in
the first level of the tower.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.030
LING REN: Yeah, correct.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.230
So, just in the
same line of thought

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.290
as weighted interval scheduling,
let's first sort them.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.405
But then, it's a little
tricky because do I

00:28:35.405 --> 00:28:37.700
sort by length or width?

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.120
So I'm not sure yet, so
let's just sort by length

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.835
and then width.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.790
So this means if they
have the same length,

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.180
then I'll sort them by width.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.810
So I can create a sorted list.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.920
Let me just assume that
it's in-place sort,

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.570
and now I have the sorted list.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:04.320
So once I have that,
the potential solutions

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.980
I should consider is
that whether or not

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.680
I put my first block
as the bottom one.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.470
It doesn't make sense for
me to put a later one down.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:25.175
So my original problem
becomes taking the max,

00:29:25.175 --> 00:29:29.540
and whether or not
I choose block one.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:35.470
If I do, then I get its
weight-- height, sorry.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:42.290
And my subproblem is the
ones compatible with it.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.770
If I do not choose it,
then my sub problem

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:57.280
is like what Andrew first
said, from 2 all the way to n.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.260
So why is this correct?

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:08.250
So I claim this
covers all the cases.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:13.800
Either h1 is chosen as the
first bottom one, or it's not.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.050
It's not chosen at all.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.990
It's impossible for h1 to
be somewhere in the middle,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.710
because it has the
longest, largest length.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:22.210
OK.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.970
So how many
subproblems do I have?

00:30:38.826 --> 00:30:40.320
Go ahead.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.330
Still n.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:49.780
So there are all of these
compatible set of l1 w1, l2 w2.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.140
But it looks like I do
have some new subproblems.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:02.060
These do not exist before.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.860
However, there are
only n of them.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.640
They're just a suffix
of the entire set.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.240
So I still have O
of n subproblems.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.050
And at each step, I'm doing
constant amount of work.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.510
There are just two items.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.925
So we found an order n solution.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.460
Are we done?

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.661
Is it really order n?

00:31:30.661 --> 00:31:31.160
OK, no.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.870
AUDIENCE: You still
have to find the c.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:33.495
LING REN: Yeah.

00:31:33.495 --> 00:31:35.980
I still have to
find all these c's.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.060
And first, I actually
have a sort step.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.050
That sort step is n log n.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.860
Yeah, then again, well,
if we do it naively,

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.990
then it's again n
squared, because I

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.720
have to find this compatible
set, each of them.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.940
But if there's an
n log n solution

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.840
to find these compatible sets,
then my final runtime is n

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.340
log n.

00:32:05.491 --> 00:32:05.990
Make sense?

00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:18.490
Any questions so far?

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.400
OK.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.490
So now we actually
have a choice.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:39.560
So we can either go
through another DP example,

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.835
I do have another one.

00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:44.150
But Nancy, one of the
lecturers suggested,

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.560
that it seems that many people
have some trouble understanding

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.850
yesterday's lecture on universal
hashing and perfect hashing.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.876
So we can also consider
going through that.

00:32:53.876 --> 00:32:55.250
Well, of course,
the third option

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.291
is to just call it a day.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.620
So, let me just take a poll.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.050
How many people before we
go over the hash stuff?

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.925
How many people prefer
another DP example?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:14.390
OK.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.400
Sorry guys.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.980
How many people
just want to leave?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.521
It's fine.

00:33:18.521 --> 00:33:19.020
OK.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.520
Great.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.024
That's it.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.940
OK.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.270
So, so much for DP.

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.470
We do have another example.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.940
We will release it
in recitation notes.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.510
For those of you
who are interested,

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.140
you can take a look.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.180
So, well, sure you
all know that we

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.120
haven't go into DP in
the main lectures yet.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.510
So this is really just
a warm up to prepare

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:45.690
you to go to the more
advanced DP concepts.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:50.270
And also, DP will be
covered in quiz 1.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.880
But the difficulty
will be strictly easier

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.432
than the examples
we covered here.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.860
OK?

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.510
Now let's review universal
and perfect hashing.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.960
So it's not like I have
a better way to teach it.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.010
Our advantage here is
that we have fewer people,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.460
so you can ask
questions you have.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.719
So let me start with
the motivating example.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.929
So why do we care about hash?

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:54.860
It's because we want to create
a hash table of, say, n.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.660
It has n bins.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:06.160
And we will receive input,
say, k0, k1, all the way to k n

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.340
minus 1.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.610
n keys.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.110
And we'll create a hash
function to each of them

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.580
to map them to one of the bins.

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:23.140
That the hope is that if n is
theta m, or in the other way,

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.040
m is theta n, then
each bin should contain

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.200
a constant number of keys.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.250
So to complete the
picture, all the keys are

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:40.060
drawn from a universe
that has size u.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.420
And this u is
usually pretty large.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.010
Let's say it's larger
than m squared.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.750
It's larger than the square
of my hash table size.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:36:05.090
But let me first start
with a negative result.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:18.580
So if my hash function
is deterministic,

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:23.630
then there always
exists a series of input

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.350
that all map to the same thing.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:32.880
We call that worst case.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.720
We don't like the worst case.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.330
Why?

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:42.538
Because in that case, the
hash is not doing anything.

00:36:42.538 --> 00:36:45.730
We still have all of the
items in the same list.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.220
Why is that lemma true?

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:03.050
Because by a very simple
pigeonhole argument,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:08.730
so imagine I insert all of
the keys in the universe

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.544
into my hash table.

00:37:09.544 --> 00:37:10.960
I would never do
that in practice.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.590
It's just a thought experiment.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.760
So by a simple
pigeonhole argument,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.670
if u is greater
than m squared, then

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:23.020
at least some bin will
contain more than m elements.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.910
Well, if it just so happens
that my inputs are these m keys,

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:30.180
then my hash will hash all
of them to the same bin.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.980
Make sense?

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.490
So this is the problem
we're trying to solve.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.490
We don't want this worst case.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.010
And it does say that
if h is deterministic,

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.580
we cannot avoid that.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.190
There always exist a worst case.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.390
So what's the solution?

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:52.696
Then the solution
is to randomize h.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.420
However, I can't
really randomize h.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:07.970
If h take some key,
if my hash function

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.740
maps a key into a
certain bin, well,

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.410
the next time I call
this hash function,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:13.990
it better give the same bin.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.900
Otherwise I cannot
find that item.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.850
So h needs to be deterministic.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:34.400
So now our only choice
is to pick a random h.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:38.840
Make sense?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.570
Every hash function
is deterministic,

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:46.150
but we will pick a
random one from a family

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.000
of hash functions.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.320
So in some sense,
this is cheating.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:53.950
Why?

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.210
Because all I'm saying is I
will not choose a hash function

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.030
beforehand.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:05.070
I will wait for the
user to insert inputs.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.221
If I have too many collisions,
I'll choose another one.

00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.470
If I have too many collisions.

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:10.470
I'll choose another one.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.600
OK.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.891
I think I forgot to mention
one thing that's important.

00:39:15.891 --> 00:39:17.550
So you may ask why do I care?

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.670
Why do I care about
that worst case?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.190
What's the chance of it
happening in practice?

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:27.750
It's very low, but in
algorithms, we really

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:30.641
don't like making
assumptions on inputs.

00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:31.140
Why?

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.300
Because if you imagine
you're running, say,

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.910
a website, a web server, and you
code has some has table in it.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:41.370
So if your competitor,
or someone who hates you,

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.250
wants to put you
out of business,

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.330
and if he knows
your hash function,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.090
he can create a
worst case input.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.100
That will make your
website infinitely slow.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.340
So what we are saying
here is I don't tell him

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.280
what hash function I'll use.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.780
I'll say I choose one.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.340
If he figures out the wrong
input, the worst case input,

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.311
I'm going to change my hash
function and use another one.

00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:06.810
Make sense?

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:33.050
Now the definition of
universal hash function

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:38.920
is that if I pick a random h
from my universal hash function

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:48.610
family, the probability that
any key i mapped to the same bin

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:54.380
as any key j should be
less or equal than 1

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.440
over m, where m
is my hash table.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.940
This is really the
best you can get.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.202
If the hash function is really
evenly distributing things,

00:41:01.202 --> 00:41:02.410
you should get this property.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:13.700
So we have seen one universal
hash function in the class.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.030
I'll just go over
the other example,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:27.470
which is ak plus b modulo
p, and then modulo m.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:33.760
So p is a prime number that is
greater than the universe size.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.760
We'll see why this is a
universal hash function.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.490
So to do that, we just need
to analyze the collision

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:45.690
probability.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:49.550
So if I have two key,
that k1 and k2 that

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:59.780
map to the same bin, that means
they must have this property.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.650
After taking the mod
m, their difference

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.600
should be a multiple of m.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.540
Because if this is true
after taking the modulo m,

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.410
they will map to the same bin.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.620
Make sense?

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:22.510
Now I can quickly write it as a
times the difference of the key

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:27.920
equals a multiple of m, mod p.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.620
Now, k1 and k2 are not
equal, so they are nonzero.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.820
And in this group, based
on some number theory,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.050
we have an inverse
element for it.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.670
So, if this happens,
we'll call it a bad a.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.220
How many bad a's do I have?

00:42:47.785 --> 00:42:52.510
One of a will make this
equation holds with i equals 1.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.090
Another a make the equation
holds with i equals 2.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.120
But how many such a's do I have?

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:04.950
At most, because this equation
can hold with m, 2m, 3m,

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:11.950
all the way to p
over m floored m.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.080
This is the total
number of possible ways

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.270
this equation can hold.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.790
So how many bad a's do I have?

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:25.920
I have p over m,
over the total number

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.610
of a's, which is p minus 1.

00:43:30.272 --> 00:43:31.730
Oh, yeah, I forgot
to mention that.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:39.510
So a is from 1 to p minus one.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:44.900
OK.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.800
So I can always choose my p
to be not a multiple of m.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:44:00.600
If I do that, this floor--
so, then p and p minus 1

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.070
do not cross the
boundary of modulo m.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:11.400
Then this is true, and
this is less than 1 over m.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.827
So this is a universal
hash function family.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.840
So what's the randomness here?

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.530
The randomness is a.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:27.440
I'll pick an a to get one of my
hash, and if it doesn't work,

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.205
I pick another a.

00:44:31.456 --> 00:44:32.854
AUDIENCE: What is b?

00:44:32.854 --> 00:44:33.790
What is b?

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:37.050
LING REN: p is a prime
number I choose--

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:38.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:38.570
LING REN: b?

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.424
LING REN: Oh, b.

00:44:41.424 --> 00:44:42.840
I think it's also
a random number.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.810
Yeah, so, actually it's
not needed, but I think

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.560
there's some deep
reason that they keep it

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.280
in the hash function.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.000
I'm not sure why.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.510
Now once we have that, once
we have universal hash,

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.990
people also want
perfect hashing,

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:18.550
which means I want
absolutely 0 collision.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.820
So how do I do that?

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:28.540
Let me first give a method 1.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:36.230
I'll just use any
universal hash function,

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.590
but I choose my m
to be n squared.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.020
I claim this is a
perfect hash function

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.090
with certain probability.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:48.660
Why?

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:52.100
Because I want to calculate
probability no collision.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.170
Yeah, 1 minus probability
I do have a collision.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.180
And I can use a union bound.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:20.215
That's the probability that
any pair has a collision.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:29.290
Any pair of hx equals hy.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:34.604
How many pairs do I have?

00:46:37.852 --> 00:46:39.244
AUDIENCE: N choose 2.

00:46:39.244 --> 00:46:43.560
LING REN: Yeah. n choose
2, which is this number.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.040
So if it's a universal
hash function,

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:53.040
then any collision,
any two colliding,

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.200
the probability is 1 over m.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.610
So I choose my m
to be n squared,

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.330
so this one is larger than 1/2.

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:08.970
So what I'm saying, to get
a perfect hash function,

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:10.640
I'll just use the simplest way.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.180
I select the universal
hash function with m

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.950
equals n squared.

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:18.130
I have a probability
more than 1/2 to succeed.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.820
Or if I don't succeed,
I'll choose another one

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.350
until I succeed.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.540
So this is a
randomized algorithm,

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.030
and we can make it a Monte
Carlo algorithm or Las Vegas

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.910
algorithm.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:38.830
So I can either say if I
choose alpha log n times,

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:41.580
then what's the chance
that none of my choice

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.970
satisfies perfect hashing?

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.980
My failure probability
is less than this.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:01.000
My each chance I have
a half success rate,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.600
and I try this
many times, what's

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.107
the chance of all
of them failing?

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.820
This is 1 over n
raised to alpha.

00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:19.260
Of course, I can also say, I'll
keep trying until I succeed.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.360
Then I have a 100
percent success rate,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.960
but my runtime could
potentially go unbounded.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.180
Make sense?

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:29.890
OK.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.700
This sounds like a
perfect solution.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.000
The only problem is that the
space complexity of this method

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.480
is n squared, because I
choose my m hash table

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.474
size to be n squared.

00:48:45.474 --> 00:48:46.890
So this is the
only thing we don't

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:50.140
want in this simple method.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:05.970
Our final goal, is to have
a perfect hash function that

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:15.910
has space O of n, and also
runtime some polynomial in n,

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:19.230
and failure probability
arbitrarily small.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:23.283
And the idea there is
this two-level hashing.

00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:37.470
So, I choose h1 first to
hash my keys into bins.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:41.170
And for each bin, say I get
l1 elements here, l2 elements

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.280
here, so on and so forth.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.825
I'll choose each
of the bins to be

00:49:46.825 --> 00:49:50.630
a second level perfect hashing.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:55.290
So we can use the method one
to choose this small one.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:59.580
If I choose m1, which is the
hash table size of this guy,

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.560
to be l1 squared, then I
know after alpha log n trial,

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.580
this one should be
a perfect hashing.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.090
After another alpha
log n trial, I

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.220
should resolve all
the conflicts in l2

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.206
to make it a perfect hashing.

00:50:15.206 --> 00:50:16.194
Make sense?

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:27.410
So after n log n trials, I
will resolve all the conflicts

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.780
in my second level hashing.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.280
Question?

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.200
AUDIENCE: It was
mentioned in the lecture

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.040
that this only works if there
are no inserts or deletes,

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.040
or something like that?

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.720
LING REN: Let me think
about that offline.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.719
I'm not sure about that.

00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:43.960
OK.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:47.150
So the only remaining
problem is we

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:50.270
need to figure out whether
we achieve this space O of n.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:53.210
What is this space
complexity of this algorithm?

00:50:53.210 --> 00:51:04.310
It's n plus l i squared, because
each table size is the square

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:06.330
of the elements in it.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:10.070
And finally, we have
that Markov inequality

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.040
or I think something
like that, to prove

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:21.240
this is the case with--
so my space is O of n,

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:25.650
also with the probability
of greater than 1/2.

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.150
I can keep going.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.960
I'll try alpha log n times on
my first level hash function,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.960
until my space is O of n.

00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.380
Once I get to that
point, I'll try

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:40.440
choosing universal hash
functions for my smaller

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.625
tables, until I succeed.

00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:44.125
OK?

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:54.536
That's it for hashing and DP.
