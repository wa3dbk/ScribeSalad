00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.770
PROFESSOR: So finally,
it's our last recitation.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.350
And finally, it's my favorite
topic-- cryptography--

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.990
because I work in this area.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.630
So I have probably
a little bit more

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.370
than what's required
to tell you.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:51.930
So this recitation is
access more primitives,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.350
so we'll introduce several
more primitives that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.710
may be useful to your
future work or study.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.330
And so the first one
is digital signature.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.150
So we have briefly
mentioned digital signatures

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.710
in the lecture, but mainly
as an application of Hatch,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.510
so now I'm going to introduce
it as a standalone primitive.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.220
So as you may have
already known,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.330
digital signature is used for
verifying message authenticity.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:47.840
And it's a pair of
function sign and verify.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.090
So sign takes a secret
key and the message.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:03.320
It outputs a signature,
which we refer to as sigma.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.570
And verify takes a public key,
a message, and a signature,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.460
and outputs on
either true or false.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.000
It either accepts the
signature or reject.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.430
So we use secret key to sign
and public key to verify.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.470
That means so if I want
to send the message,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.080
I should be the only one
who was able to sign it.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.510
And everyone can verify
that this message indeed

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.360
comes from me.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.590
So what properties do we
want from digital signatures?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.990
Any thoughts on that?

00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:55.798
Go ahead.

00:02:55.798 --> 00:03:00.632
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
given the signature

00:03:00.632 --> 00:03:02.590
in a message [INAUDIBLE]
to get the secret key.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.860
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
definitely one.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.380
I'll put a more
general description

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.400
of what you just said.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.930
Any other answers?

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:25.277
AUDIENCE: And only one
signature [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:29.210
like on any message coming out,
can you have one signature?

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.690
PROFESSOR: OK, so
what's your name?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.900
AUDIENCE: Hugo.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.100
PROFESSOR: Hugo says a message
should only have one signature.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.190
Let's think about
whether that's necessary.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.750
So if my algorithm
is a randomized one

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.700
that for the same
message I output

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.430
many possible signatures.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.720
So why is that bad?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.350
So for any of
them, they will all

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.420
verify if that's how
my algorithm works.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.040
I think that's fine.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.285
That's OK.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:04.160
It's not a bad thing.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.416
Actually, randomized signature
is considered more secure.

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:09.415
They are less efficient.

00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:20.079
Any other thoughts?

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:26.897
AUDIENCE: Do you care
about speed at all,

00:04:26.897 --> 00:04:29.820
like how long it takes
to sign and verify?

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.270
PROFESSOR: That's
definitely one,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.760
but we haven't got
any scheme yet,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.280
so we care about
functionality first.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.250
There are faster
signatures and slower ones.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.280
So the first one is
actually very trivial.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.337
We first want correctness.

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:51.170
What does that mean?

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.780
That means if this
sigma is indeed

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.870
generated by the
sign function that

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.020
verified that the output 1.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.610
Otherwise, they
should put output 0.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.901
That's actually the first
and the most basic property

00:05:08.901 --> 00:05:09.400
we want.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.590
I don't want to write it
because it's-- so the other one.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.990
So your answer is very
close that you don't

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.060
want to extract the secret key.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.010
But to make it more
general, what we really want

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.270
is unforgeability.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.390
That means if I have the
secret key and someone

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.430
else-- an adversary, who does
not have the secret key--

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.420
should not be able to sign the
message to pretend to be me.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:06:00.720
So they should not be able to
produce m star sigma star, such

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.030
that it verifies.

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.340
Make sense?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.650
So what you said is a
special case of this.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.050
So if they can extract, somehow
extract the secret key, then,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.890
of course they can
forge my signature

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.980
on any other messages.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.320
But we do want to also prevent
attack where they cannot

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.255
extract the secret key, but
they somehow can forge another

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.380
signature.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.420
But usually we want to
make the adversary more

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.040
powerful because then we
have higher confidence

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.960
that we won't be attacked.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.550
So adversary is totally
reasonable for it

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.860
to see a bunch of
messages from me.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.070
Because I am signing messages
and output it to the world.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.300
So an adversary may have seen
some of the message, signature

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.590
pairs, I generated.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.050
But still we do not want
to create a forgery.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.710
Now how is that defined?

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.440
Because see you can definitely
send one of these back.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.002
That's a valid message
signature pair.

00:07:24.002 --> 00:07:26.110
So our unforgeability
requirement

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.710
is defined to be--
he should not be

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.250
able to send such a
pair where m star is

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.130
different from any message
he has already seen.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.610
There is no way to
prevent the adversary

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.260
from sending one of
the message signature

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.870
pairs he has seen before.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.470
So far, pretty straightforward.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.040
Now, how can we get
digital signatures?

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.590
So in the early days,
researchers-- and it's

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.040
actually great
computer scientists--

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.720
they proposed a
digital signature can

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:32.880
be implemented as the inverse
of public key encryption.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:40.955
What does that mean?

00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:42.860
So I'll use RSA as the example.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:57.720
So RSA encryption
is m to the e mod n.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.810
The encryption is
c to the d mod n.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.110
So the first attempt
is we will just

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:22.140
use this as our sign
function and use

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.150
this as our verify function.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.130
So now the symbol is a
little bit confusing.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.740
So now I'm signing a
message [INAUDIBLE] c.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.290
Let me actually change it.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.520
This is RSA encryption.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.180
I'm going to transform
it into signature scheme

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.990
where sign signs a message,
and verify, raise the signature

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:57.190
sigma to the power of e,
and checks whether or not

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.285
I get back my message.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.340
So this actually
makes a lot of sense.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.970
Why?

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:12.890
Because think of
m as a ciphertext.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:18.500
Then if I decrypt it,
and then re-encrypt it,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.560
I should get back my ciphertext.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.550
So correctness-- we
have correctness.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.630
And why is it unforgeable?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.400
Because an attacker does
not have the secret key,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.370
so he should not be able
to decrypt this m here.

00:10:39.782 --> 00:10:40.990
He cannot run this algorithm.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.545
That's the reasoning behind it.

00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:49.170
So far so good?

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.850
But, unfortunately,
it is broken.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:05.350
And so I'll give you, say,
seven minutes to think about it.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:09.680
Can you come up with
an attack, a forgery?

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.080
You can see a bunch of messages
and then output a forgery

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.110
for a message you
haven't seen before.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.055
So is the algorithm clear?

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:37.860
PROFESSOR: Can you speak louder?

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.790
AUDIENCE: Is it just the
product of any messages?

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.000
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.990
So if an adversary had
seen a bunch of messages--

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:50.840
because RSA has this sometimes
good, sometimes nice, sometimes

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.680
bad property, that is
multiplicative, homomorphic,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.910
or to use a less fancy
word-- malleable.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.530
So if they, an adversary,
sees this message,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.640
it can set m star
to be m1 times m2

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:15.700
and sigma star to
sigma 1 times sigma 2.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.460
You can check.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.360
This is a valid signature,
message signature pair.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.980
You take this entire
thing raised to d.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.820
They are raised to d
individually and then

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.475
multiply together, and that's
exactly this message here.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.360
Attack one.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:38.860
OK.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.193
There's actually another attack.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.220
That's even simpler and
tells you this scheme

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.880
is even more broken.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.220
So all I want to do is
to come up with a sigma

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.690
when it's raised to
e, that's equal to m.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.670
So I'm going to
select the sigma,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:15.850
compute, m sigma
raised to e, because e

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.990
is my public key, mod m.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.830
I can do that.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.915
And then output sigma
m-- oh sorry, m sigma.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.990
I select the signature
first, and I raise it

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.490
to the power of e.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.990
I get a very strange message,
but it doesn't matter.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.740
That's my forgery.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.830
OK, so now you can see
this scheme is basically

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.340
totally broken.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.660
But they actually
come from our, well,

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.055
several renown scientists.

00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:52.730
But why is that a case?

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.820
Because actually that
definition didn't

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.932
exist when they were
trying to when they

00:14:57.932 --> 00:14:59.140
were working on this problem.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.670
And so that definition
looks obvious today,

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.120
but it's actually
not obvious at all.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:13.740
And I think this algorithm
came in the 70s, '78.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.880
And in '82,
Goldwasser and Micali,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.250
two professors from MIT,
proposed the definition

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.735
for signature encryption
and basically everything

00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:22.799
in cryptography.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:24.590
And they won another
Turing Award for that.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.520
OK, so let's try to fix it.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.280
Any ideas?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.150
We do not want to
change the framework.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:53.670
Let's still use RSA and combine
it with some other primitive

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.870
you have seen to try to fix it.

00:16:28.564 --> 00:16:29.480
What do we want to do?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.420
We want to break this
multiplicative property.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:42.340
And we want to break this, this
step, whatever it's called.

00:16:44.731 --> 00:16:45.230
Go ahead.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:50.600
AUDIENCE: Can we
change the n, maybe?

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.840
PROFESSOR: Change this n?

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.478
PROFESSOR: Right now,
just to remind you,

00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:57.642
it's a product of
two primes, OK, pq.

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:58.850
It's a product of two primes.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.330
It's how RSA works.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.170
What's your idea?

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.669
Go ahead.

00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:06.284
AUDIENCE: Before it
raised to the power,

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:08.119
we can get the hash
function of it.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.910
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.220
Let's just make a small change.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:21.619
So sign will be hash
of m, raised to d.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:30.130
And verify will be-- just
check whether hash of m

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.960
equals signature is to e.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.311
This indeed fixes these attacks.

00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:44.810
Why?

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.700
Because now you need-- well,
if you do this-- hash of m

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.250
and 1 times hash of m2 is not
going to be hash of m star

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.450
because hash is supposed
to be [INAUDIBLE] random.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.900
That's not going to work.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.920
And here, what
the attacker needs

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:11.360
to do is to find hash of m, such
that it's sigma raised to e.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.690
It can still do
this, but it does not

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.300
know what this message is
because of the one-wayness

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.740
of hash function.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.450
If we use a good
hash function there,

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.490
then it indeed fixes
both the attacks.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.070
But we have seen the lecture
that this hash function also

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.750
needs to be collision resistant.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.400
Remember that?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.300
A question?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.450
AUDIENCE: Isn't
the message public?

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
message-- oh, OK.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.205
Good point.

00:18:47.671 --> 00:18:51.070
Oh, no, but, OK, you are talking
about this attack, right?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.570
So the attacker needs to
find the public message,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.490
but all he can do is select
the sigma, and raise it to e.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.640
That's going to
be its hash of m.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.250
And then he cannot figure
out where this m is.

00:19:06.389 --> 00:19:07.597
But what about the other way?

00:19:07.597 --> 00:19:09.305
AUDIENCE: I mean, if
he has two messages,

00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:14.370
he can still get m star,
and then get hash of m star.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.030
PROFESSOR: OK, so he
then he gets, has of m1.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.590
He gets hash of m2.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.020
But you need to find the
m star, such that its hash

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.012
is the multiplication
of these two.

00:19:23.012 --> 00:19:25.220
And, yeah, he does not know
how to find that message.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:38.130
So if the hash is not
multiplicative, one-way,

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.410
and collision
resistant, then it seems

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.920
that we have fixed all
the attacks we know.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.680
However, how do we know
there are no other attacks?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.850
So actually, indeed,
this is a good idea.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.730
We have several
national standards

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.650
that just use this but
slightly differently.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.915
I can-- this is just
for your information.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:19.570
So there's a standard called
[? NC, ?] whatever-- X93.1.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:34.180
It uses RSA, this
word padding, so it

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.770
takes the hash of the message
and pad with this hex stream,

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.330
and prepended and append
another hex stream.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:45.749
Why do they do that?

00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:47.290
They don't know
either, but they just

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.686
think it's probably more
secure than only using a hash.

00:20:51.686 --> 00:20:53.060
There's another
standard that has

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.760
a different steam and a
difference stream here,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.860
and it doesn't matter.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.940
So that's indeed a weakness
of these types of approaches.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.240
So their security is
what we call ad hoc.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.769
We do not know
how to break them.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.060
But we do not know how to
prove they are secure either.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.920
Yet, that's what
people do in practice.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.255
So, unfortunately, that's
all I can tell you today,

00:21:24.255 --> 00:21:27.490
so how not to construct
the digital signature.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.210
I cannot tell you how to
construct the secure digital

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.180
signature because that's out
of the scope of this class.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.315
And it's a major
topic in cryptography.

00:21:44.691 --> 00:21:45.565
Any questions so far?

00:21:52.822 --> 00:21:53.818
Go ahead.

00:21:53.818 --> 00:21:57.820
AUDIENCE: The hash function
here is the one way, yeah?

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.092
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's one-way,
collision resistance, and--

00:22:01.092 --> 00:22:03.008
AUDIENCE: So what is the
use of using the RSA?

00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:05.630
Couldn't we just use the
only hash function then?

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.050
PROFESSOR: OK, good question.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.725
So, OK, let's be clear
what you're saying.

00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:16.430
AUDIENCE: OK, never mind.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.400
PROFESSOR: Can you
answer your own question?

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.876
AUDIENCE: So my
question was, well,

00:22:18.876 --> 00:22:20.352
why do we have to use the RSA?

00:22:20.352 --> 00:22:22.320
Why, when we have
the hatch function?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:30.684
You want me-- so [INAUDIBLE]
couldn't create the forgery.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:32.504
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:32.504 --> 00:22:34.170
PROFESSOR: How does
it create a forgery?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.420
Just answer your own question.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.540
Let everyone else know.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:39.770
Maybe they have
the same question.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.208
So answer your own question.

00:22:42.208 --> 00:22:46.200
AUDIENCE: So my answer is
so adversary can't just

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.700
choose random message and
hash it and [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.609
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:49.609 --> 00:22:50.400
What's the problem?

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.810
Problem is that a hash
function is a public function

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.240
that everybody can compute.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.880
So the attacker just chooses
a message, compute as hash,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.260
so using a hash is
not a signature.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:22:59.920
But good point.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.070
I'm actually coming to that.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:09.980
So far we have seen three
major primitives-- private key

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:18.030
encryption, public
key encryption,

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.080
and digital signature.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:29.310
So if we categorize
them a little bit--

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.940
so these two are asymmetric key.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.670
They are public
key and secret key.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.080
This one is symmetric key.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:45.085
And these two are for secrecy.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.510
They are trying to
hide the message.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:55.910
And this one is for integrity.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.180
Meaning, the message is
what the sender sends.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:08.240
So you can see we are
missing one primitive here.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.530
What if the two
parties, they do share

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.310
a secret key, and
one party wants

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.820
to verify the other party?

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.850
The other message indeed does
come from the other party.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.120
So indeed we do have
a primitive for that.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:29.640
It's called message
authentication code.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.930
So its definition is
basically exactly the same

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.370
as digital signature.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.630
I'm just going to
change it here.

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.145
Except that it has only one key.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.440
So the sign function
is replaced by a MAC.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.160
And there's no notion of
secret key and public key.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.430
We have only one key.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.710
And how do we verify?

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.160
OK, so verify function
basically just

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.110
becomes the other
guy also recomputes

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.340
the MAC of the
message and checks

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.645
whether that's the signature.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:28.700
So verifier just to recompute
and compare correctness--

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.270
we also want correctness.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.240
We also want unforgeability
And it's defined

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.530
in exactly the same way.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:43.810
Now, actually, I would have
asked this question here--

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.840
is hash a valid MAC?

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.190
The answer is still no because
MAC is a public function

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.290
that everyone can
compute, and it's trivial

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.047
come up with a forgery.

00:25:59.047 --> 00:26:00.630
So thank you for
asking that question.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.106
But the hash is
actually very close.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.880
How can we get a message
authentication code?

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.760
So several ideas.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:34.750
Can we just hash the key
concatenated with the message?

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.680
Then some other random attacker
who doesn't have the key

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.700
does not know how to
compute this thing.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.512
That's a reasonable idea.

00:26:44.512 --> 00:26:47.740
But, well, if we can do it
this way, how about we do

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.905
the message concatenated
with the key.

00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:53.510
Or if you want, you can do
key concatenated with message

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.968
and then concatenated
with the key.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.710
So it turns out
this doesn't work

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.590
for some very advanced reasons.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.240
And this one may or may not.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.510
For SHA1, it doesn't
work, unfortunately.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:21.950
And for SHA3-- that's the
replacement for SHA1 and SHA2--

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.290
it actually works.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.820
So the simplest
MAC we can imagine

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.190
is just to choose SHA3
as the hash function,

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:35.370
and input is the key
and then the message.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:38.060
Not the other way.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.160
It's also, just FYI, purpose.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.660
By the way, there's
another reasonable thought.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.010
That is, how about
we encrypt the hash?

00:27:52.104 --> 00:27:53.710
Now, everyone can
compute the hash,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.530
but they don't know
how to encrypt.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.850
If I use, say, a
secret key encryption,

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.140
this turns out to
be wrong as well.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.764
That's digital signature in MAC.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.140
But one caveat here,
our unforgeability

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.310
is defined this way.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.890
A little bit strange,
but it makes sense.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:30.240
But it indeed has some
weakness in some applications.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.710
So imagine, say, I send you a
message-- today's recitation

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.340
is canceled.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.890
And it has my signature on it.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.040
So you can verify it
indeed comes from me.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.820
But once I send that message,
every of you has that message.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.250
So next week, one of you
can send that message again,

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.550
saying, today's
recitation is canceled.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.840
Then you have no idea
whether it's indeed me

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.750
sending the message
again or someone

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.330
doing an April Fool's Day joke.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.670
So how do we prevent that?

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.350
Well, of course,
one thing I can do

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.860
is if I'm smart I'll say,
today, like in parenthesis, May

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.780
the 8th, recitation is canceled.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.940
Then you cannot
repeat that message.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.980
But we want to protect
human stability.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.360
That's the whole
point of cryptography.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.030
So one thing we
could do, let's see.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.095
Very simple modification.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:55.040
When I sign the
message, I'll sign 1,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.990
concatenated with my message.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.910
Next time I sign 2,
concatenated with my message.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.630
And then 3, 4, and just
have this counter that

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.570
keeps incrementing.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.660
It naturally fixes.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.971
So you can verify if you
receive the same message

00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:16.470
with the same
counter, then you know

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.150
it's someone else
who is resending it.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:25.060
So that's one
thing we need to do

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.840
for signature in practical use.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:36.910
Now, consider another totally
different application.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:41.640
So say I think everyone
uses Google Drive,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.180
Dropbox, something like that.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:52.540
You store a bunch of files
on this cloud server.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.230
Now you are here.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.486
You'll have a, say, cell phone,
and you can access your files.

00:31:03.486 --> 00:31:08.640
But how do you know
when you read a file,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.360
it is indeed your
file unmodified?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.320
How do, maybe Google
messes with you,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.330
or there's someone in the
middle who changes your file?

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.450
Usually, most people
do not care about that,

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.090
while in cryptography,
we do care about that.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:34.561
So in that case, MAC and
signatures do not help us.

00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:35.060
Why?

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:43.280
Because if you just store
a MAC alongside each file,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.090
what went wrong?

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.020
Go ahead.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.728
AUDIENCE: You need to
modify the MAC too.

00:31:52.656 --> 00:31:54.280
PROFESSOR: But if
they modify the file,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.280
they do not know how
to generate a MAC

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.320
for their version of the file.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.690
But what they can do
is you have this file

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.310
and then you come and write
it, and you generate a new MAC.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.600
When you read it, they
give you the old version.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.644
That has the valid
signature or MAC on it

00:32:15.644 --> 00:32:17.060
because you generated
that for it.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.980
You all see the problem?

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.188
You haven't seen the problem?

00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:27.760
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
they give you the old version?

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.301
PROFESSOR: OK, so
you have this file.

00:32:29.301 --> 00:32:33.160
You generate a MAC, but
you-- at some point,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.720
you want to update the file.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.430
You want to update this
file to this file prime,

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:40.900
and generate a new MAC.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.590
Maybe then file double
prime, MAC double prime.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.660
In this application,
we want freshness.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.990
When you read this file,
you want the latest version

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.740
of the file.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.162
So it should be what you
wrote there last time.

00:32:54.162 --> 00:32:55.870
But when you are trying
to read the file,

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.210
an attacker can
give you this pair.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.390
If you check the MAC,
it's going to match.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.018
This is also a valid
message MAC pair.

00:33:08.969 --> 00:33:10.260
Now, everyone sees the problem.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.090
OK, so what can we do?

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:24.870
Well, one thing we could do
is store all these MACs here

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:25.660
on your phone.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:31.960
MAC1, MAC2-- a MAC
for every single file.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.770
But if you do that, in fact,
we do not need MAC anymore.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.800
We can just use hash.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:49.370
So I'll say sigma-- I'll use
sigmas, but they mean hashes.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:58.710
This is probably good
enough in practice.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:05.190
I'll say these files
are x1, x2, x3, x4.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.000
Now you just create a
hash for each of them

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.360
and store them locally.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:14.400
And the model here is that an
attacker cannot modify files

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.102
on your own computer
or on your own phone.

00:34:17.102 --> 00:34:18.560
And then you can
download the file.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.860
Match-- compares it with the
latest version of the hash,

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.880
and then you're convinced
that it's the latest version.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.050
This is probably a
good enough solution.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:34.400
The only downside is that we do
have to store a lot of hashes

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.659
if you have a lot of files.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:43.590
Or in our algorithmic
terminology,

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:50.012
we say your space
complexity is o of n.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.355
Here, I mean your local space.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.330
So can we somehow reduce
the local space complexity?

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:11.270
Well, one thing we could do is
to concatenate all the files

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.275
together, generate a single
hash, and store that one hash.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.860
So hash everything in one try.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:36.020
Then we do have o of 1 space,
but there's a bigger problem.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.130
Can anyone tell me?

00:35:43.581 --> 00:35:45.553
AUDIENCE: You don't know
which file to modify?

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.610
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK,
I think you are

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.320
thinking in the right thing.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.860
So how do I verify?

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.290
I cannot verify a single file.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:04.990
I have to download all the files
and recompute a hash to verify.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:08.680
So the time
complexity is o of n.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.990
And, also, if I want
to update this file,

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:15.640
I have to recompute the hash.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:19.180
That involves, again,
downloading all the files

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.460
and feed them into that hash.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:31.120
And we do have a better solution
than both of them, which

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.332
is called a hash tree
or a Merkle tree,

00:36:34.332 --> 00:36:35.540
which was invented by Merkle.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.650
What we will do is so
first for every file,

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.880
we're going to create a hash.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.220
Let me, again, use sigma
because h is unclear

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:57.290
whether it's a hash
value or a hash function.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.206
Sigma 2, sigma 3, sigma 4.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.480
So I said a hash tree.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.613
And guess what's
the next step to do?

00:37:09.613 --> 00:37:11.134
AUDIENCE: Cross the hashes.

00:37:11.134 --> 00:37:11.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.485
Exactly.

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:21.820
We're going to create a sigma
5, which is the hash of sigma 1,

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.160
concatenated with sigma 2.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.541
So we do the same thing here.

00:37:31.351 --> 00:37:33.010
And so you all know
what it is, right?

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.840
I don't need to write it.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:39.915
And keep going until
we got a root hash.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:49.560
And now we're going to store
this thing locally on the side.

00:37:58.725 --> 00:38:00.350
So what's the local
storage complexity?

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:06.172
o of 1-- we're only
storing one hash locally.

00:38:06.172 --> 00:38:07.505
Now, what's the time complexity?

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.900
OK, so how do I verify?

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.260
Yeah.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.060
Log in-- how do I verify?

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.450
I need to, so, first verify
if this hash matches,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:26.540
and then read this
hash, and verify

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.030
whether this link matches,
and verify whether this one

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:32.600
matches, and then I'm done.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.640
If I want to update, I also
need to update this hash,

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640
then it causes
this hash to change

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.941
and then that hash to change.

00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.580
But it's always some
path in that tree.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.761
It doesn't affect
anything globally.

00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:46.260
Question.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.705
AUDIENCE: But you're not
storing like sigma 5?

00:38:48.705 --> 00:38:49.580
PROFESSOR: Say again.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.017
AUDIENCE: You're
not storing sigma 5.

00:38:52.017 --> 00:38:52.850
PROFESSOR: I am not.

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.124
I have to go ahead and read it.

00:38:55.124 --> 00:38:56.360
AUDIENCE: From where?

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.558
PROFESSOR: From Google
Drive or Dropbox.

00:39:00.558 --> 00:39:03.020
AUDIENCE: So are we sure
that that is secure?

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.970
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah, so
that's the next thing

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.280
we're going to do.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.580
Is this secure?

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.540
Or in other words,
can the adversary

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.090
change one of the
files, and somehow

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:18.010
maintain the same root hash?

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.174
That's your question then.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.210
Of course, we assume the
hash is collision resistant.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.930
Or I should say if the hash
is collision resistant,

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.560
then this hash tree is
collision resistant.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.210
Any intuition?

00:39:58.014 --> 00:39:59.180
Or anyone wants to prove it?

00:40:04.548 --> 00:40:05.048
Go ahead.

00:40:05.048 --> 00:40:09.449
AUDIENCE: So like if the root
eventually one of the leaves

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:11.405
will be different
because it changes.

00:40:11.405 --> 00:40:12.383
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:40:12.383 --> 00:40:14.341
AUDIENCE: Now, you want
the root to be the same

00:40:14.341 --> 00:40:17.273
than the other hash
has to be different,

00:40:17.273 --> 00:40:18.740
but there's no collisions.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.200
I mean, it's hard to
find the other hash.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.670
PROFESSOR: Correct, so I'll
just repeat what you said,

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:28.125
but I'll start with the leaf
because that's easier for me

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:28.750
to think about.

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:32.160
So say I change this
one, this block.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:35.800
Now, I claim this
hash here will change.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.090
If it doesn't, then I
have found the collision.

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:44.700
Because this x4 prime has the
same hash as the original x4.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.860
So if this sigma 4 changes,
then sigma 6 will change.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.960
Otherwise, I have
found the collision.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.720
Because this sigma 3
concatenate with the new sigma

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.780
4 is my collision.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.570
So same argument-- either
this one changes, or I

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.970
have found the collision.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:03.720
I repeat the argument
all the way to the root.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.775
Any question about that?

00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:17.735
AUDIENCE: What if like the
adversary changes like two hash

00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:21.695
options--for
example, x1 and x2--

00:41:21.695 --> 00:41:27.640
but sigma 1 and sigma 2 changes,
but sigma 5 stays the same?

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.310
PROFESSOR: OK, so
then we have found

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:33.910
the collision that is sigma
1 concatenated with sigma 2.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:36.625
That's a collision with the
new sigma 1 concatenated

00:41:36.625 --> 00:41:37.500
with the new sigma 2.

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:42.410
Make sense?

00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:52.475
AUDIENCE: If the concatenation
stayed the same, like sigma 1

00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:55.015
and sigma 2 concatenation.

00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:57.140
PROFESSOR: So if the
concatenation stayed the same,

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.100
that means both of
them are the same.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.431
AUDIENCE: They had to make
sure they are changed?

00:42:03.431 --> 00:42:05.680
PROFESSOR: So I'm not sure
I understand your question.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.180
So concatenation is
basically just a bunch

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.660
of bits then followed by
another bunch of bits.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.120
If this entire
thing is the same,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.360
that means this part is the
same and this part is the same.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:19.200
And if your sigma 1, new sigma
1 is the same as your old sigma

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.595
1, that means I have
found a collision here.

00:42:21.595 --> 00:42:23.803
Because we changed it, but
your sigma doesn't change.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.940
So lastly, I'm going to do a
quick review of the knapsack

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.447
problem because I think in the
lecture, we may run out of time

00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:56.780
and I didn't mention everything.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:14.110
So if you recall, the
knapsack cryptosystem,

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:18.170
it says you have a
knapsack problem.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.950
I'll call u1 to un.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.520
And then we're going
to transform it.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.860
OK, this is a super
increasing sequence.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:39.190
I'm going to transform into a
general one by multiplying n

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:43.125
and then mod m.

00:43:43.125 --> 00:43:46.860
So this is an easy problem,
and that is a hard problem.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.310
So how do I encrypt?

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:57.350
I'm going to take a subset
sum, which is mi, Wi, where mi

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:59.252
is the i-th bit in the message.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.880
So how do I decrypt?

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:12.880
I'll take this, transform this
s back to the super increasing

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:18.660
domain by multiplying
inverse of n.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:28.630
So that's going to be inverse
of n multiplied by this mi Wi.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.940
That's how I encrypt it.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:38.000
And then each Wi is n times ui.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.200
So far so good.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:50.140
So that gives me
mi times ui sigma.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.315
Of course, every
step is modulo m.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.260
So the first thing
I'm going to claim

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:08.040
is that m has to be
larger than sigma ui.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:13.950
If that's the case, then the t--
my t is just this subset sum.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.380
So if I solve this
knapsack problem,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.310
I get the same answer
as solving the original,

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:22.970
the general knapsack problem.

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:26.100
If my m is not that large,
if the m is too small,

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.340
then I have a problem.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.360
Because then my t
will be the subset sum

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.160
minus sum multiple of m.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:34.512
Then it's a different problem.

00:45:34.512 --> 00:45:35.970
I do not get the
same message back.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:47.060
OK, then we have a problem.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:58.775
So because we defined density
to be n over the log of max ui.

00:45:58.775 --> 00:46:00.150
Does everyone
remember this part?

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:10.560
So each ui is in the range
of 1 to m, or maybe 0 to m.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:15.377
If I have a bunch of them, then
this is not super rigorous.

00:46:15.377 --> 00:46:17.710
If I have a bunch of them,
chances are that some of them

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:21.960
are very close to m.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:25.700
Because it's unlikely that
all of them are small.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:32.260
So this thing is
roughly n over log of m.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:41.070
So then we have a dilemma.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:46.420
If we set m to be
a small number,

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.790
then my density
is fine, but that

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.950
means all of my ui's
needs to be small

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.730
because m needs to be
greater than the sum of them.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.140
If all the ui's
are small, then I

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.680
have a very limited
choices of them,

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.582
then actually an
attacker can just

00:47:01.582 --> 00:47:06.380
guess what ui I chose by a brute
force algorithm or something

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.210
like that.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.030
And if I choose m
to be large, or if I

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.550
choose all the ui's to
be large, to choose them

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.980
from large range, then my m
is going to be very large.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.740
And this density is low.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.510
And that's vulnerable to
the low density attacks.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.740
And so how low a density
is considered low?

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:32.430
So several people proposed
that based on heuristics,

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:37.410
that if this density
is less than 0.45,

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:39.440
then it's considered
low density,

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.320
and it can be attacked.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.520
And this threshold
had been improved.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.380
So but while most of the
knapsack cryptosystems

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.140
are broken, there
are few that have

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:57.280
so far stood the test of time.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.940
So they are still interesting
because knapsack problems,

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.400
knapsack cryptosystems will
be much faster than RSA

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.940
or any number theory
based, because we are just

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.220
adding numbers here.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.500
An RSA have this operation
where m is a 1,000 bit number,

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.620
and e is also 1,000 bit number.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:19.400
And take this exponentiation
is actually very slow.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.620
So knapsack cryptosystem
are still interesting.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.440
However, the original motivation
turned out to be unsuccessful.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.890
The original motivation
is to base cryptography

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.490
on the NP complete problem.

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:39.370
That's not going to work because
NP problems are hard, only

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.520
in the worst case.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:45.540
And we need cryptography to
be hard in the average case.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.550
Because if they are only
hard in the worst case,

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.133
that means there are
several instances

00:48:49.133 --> 00:48:51.160
of this problem that are hard.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:54.680
So either you pick
a secret key that

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.260
doesn't correspond
to a hard problem,

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:00.910
or you pick a secret key that's
corresponds to a hard problem.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.290
But everyone else picks
the same secret key

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.430
because everyone
wants to be secure.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:13.520
That's the reason why it's
unlikely to get cryptography

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520
from NP hard problems.

00:49:18.444 --> 00:49:19.860
That's all for
today's recitation.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.660
And thanks everyone for
the entire semester.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.510
Thank you for participation.
