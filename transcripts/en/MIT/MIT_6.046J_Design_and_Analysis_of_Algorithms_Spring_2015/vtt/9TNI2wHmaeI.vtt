SRINIVAS DEVADAS: All right.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.860
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.780
So more of the same in terms of
cryptography and cryptographic

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.750
techniques similar
to Tuesday's lecture.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.430
So if you liked it,
you'll like this one.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.180
If you didn't like
it, well, it's

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.020
going to be more of
the same, so sorry.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.340
But what we're
going to do today is

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.840
do a couple of things a
little bit differently.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.760
We're going to talk
about encryption.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.660
So we talked about
hashing, which, of course,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.150
you know about from the
use of dictionaries.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.770
We haven't really talked about
encryption in 046 or even

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.770
in 006 previously.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.940
But we look at two different
kinds of encryption algorithms.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.950
We spend a little bit of time
on symmetric key encryption,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.310
which is really something that
was used in encoding machines

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.180
including the enigma from World
War II that you probably saw

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.190
if you saw The Imitation Game.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.410
So there you have
a shared secret.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.560
And it's that single,
what's called,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.910
symmetric shared secret.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.320
Both parties know the secret.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.570
And very quickly, we'll
talk about what it means

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.620
to actually exchange a secret.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.360
So we'll talk
about key exchange.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.350
And then I'll move to
asymmetric key encryption, which

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.240
I alluded to a
little bit when we

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.520
talked about digital
signatures last time.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.860
I talked about public
keys and private keys.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.700
But we're going to
actually look at a couple

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.840
of different public key
encryption algorithms today.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.650
The classical algorithm, the
very first algorithm really

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.520
that stayed secure,
the RSA algorithm.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.270
It stands for Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.139
the initials of the
three inventors,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:14.990
invented at MIT in 1977
and still in use today.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.410
And the last part
of today's lecture

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.220
is going to be
looking at hardness.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.840
So in encryption, if you
don't know the secret key,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.830
it should be hard
for an adversary

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.040
to discover what the
message corresponds to.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.040
The adversary sees what's
called the cipher text, which

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.270
is the encrypted text.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.890
The adversary does not
know the secret key.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.990
If he or she knows the
secret key, game over.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.280
But assuming that adversary
does not know the secret key,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.810
it should be computational hard
to discover the message, right?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.340
That makes sense.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.510
So there's clearly
a relationship

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.840
between this hardness
and NP-complete problems,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.930
which are computationally hard.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.520
And it's not
surprising that people

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.230
have tried to build what are
called cryptosystems, which

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.830
are essentially cryptographic
techniques, based

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.540
on the hardness of
NP-complete problems,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.430
including graph
coloring and knapsack

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.810
and so on and so forth.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.260
But it turns out there's
a real subtle difference

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.520
between the kinds of problems
that have been useful in terms

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.490
of building secure
cryptosystems like RSA

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.320
and NP-complete problems.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.140
And we'll talk about that
at the end of lecture.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.960
We'll probably spend a
bunch of time on that.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.230
So let's get started with the
symmetric key encryption, which

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.130
is, at some level,
kind of boring

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.870
from a mathematical standpoint.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380
So we want to spend
a lot of time on it.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.520
It's definitely very useful.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.280
It essentially assumes that
there's a secret key k.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.760
And you can think of
this as a 128-bit number.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.280
Some people want it
to be larger, 256.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.670
But it's suddenly at 64.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.960
At this point, it's
probably not enough,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.380
even though 2 raised to 64 is
still a fairly large number.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.700
With parallelism and
with fast computers,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.250
it's a little worrisome
that the adversary only

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.820
requires 2 raised to
64 work to enumerate

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.160
all possible secret
keys of 64-bits right?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.910
So 122 raised to
128 is much better.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.830
And this is shared
between Alice and Bob.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.330
So we'll think about
the protagonists

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.420
here as being Alice and Bob.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.440
And they want to
exchange information.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.770
And typically, the adversary
is mal for malicious.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.565
But there's other ways you can
obviously name adversaries.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.120
So the basic equation here
is really straightforward.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.310
It's C, which is
the cipher text.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.880
So a little terminology
here, cipher text.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.175
m is the plain text
or the message.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.240
And plain text means
you can just read it.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.870
Cipher text means
it's scrambled.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.130
K is, of course, the
secret key that's up here.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.130
And the e is the
encryption function.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.680
Now, in symmetric
key cryptography,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.450
basically the
requirement is that you

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.390
have to be able to get back
the plain text from the cipher

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.690
text given a public decryption
function and knowledge

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.930
of the secret key.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.110
And this should be a
straightforward operation,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.780
right?

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.640
So by the way, e of k m, this
is a polytime computation.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.410
It's not constant time.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.140
It's typically linear time.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.980
And you don't really want it
to be quadratic time even,

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.340
because you want to do
this vary fast, streaming.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.000
You need to send
streams of messages,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.180
many gigabytes potentially,
that are all encrypted.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.560
And this is actually
what happens

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.700
when you get stuff
from your satellite

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.380
and you're downloading movies.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.350
That's exactly what happens.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.670
It's symmetric key
encryption of a lot of data.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.554
So backwards would be dk c.

00:06:36.554 --> 00:06:38.720
And the only difference
here is that everything else

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.960
stays the same.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.440
This is our decryption function.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.690
All right.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.630
So that's symmetric
encryption is.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.100
And there's a requirement
of reversibility here.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.590
So it's a lot different
from one way hashes

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.340
that we talked about last time.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:06.800
Because here, while you want
going from c to m to be hard,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.990
it's only hard if the
adversary doesn't know k.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.490
If anybody knows k,
it should be easy.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.030
In fact, that e and
d are going to be

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.770
virtually identical
in terms of complexity

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.850
and sometimes implementation.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.300
It's just you run it in
reverse, and you get back

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.040
what you encrypted.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.960
That's the way you
want to think about it.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:37.340
So really what happens is that
you need reversible operations

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:45.030
in order to build e or d,
which are the encryption

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.840
and the decryption functions.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.440
So permutation, for
example, is reversible.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.520
You can always take
something and permute it,

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.660
and you can go backwards.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.390
So you could do
something like that.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.530
And the permutation, the
reverse, looks like that.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.800
What is this supposed to be?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.350
It's the fact that
I have 3 bits here.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.300
And they turn into
3 bits over there.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.265
And obviously, if I
reverse the permutation

00:08:16.265 --> 00:08:19.220
and if I just add a simple
thing where it was abc

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.190
and I'm going to
convert it to cba,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.830
then cba can go
back to abc through

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.060
the reverse permutation.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.660
So clearly, this is a
reversible operation.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.330
But there are other operations
that are reversible as well.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.840
Plus can be reversed
by a negation.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.580
And exclusive OR is
simply exclusive OR.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:45.905
Because if you do A exclusive
OR B, then you get C.

00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:50.590
And imagine if you did B
again to that, you get A back.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.230
That's what I mean by reversal.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.240
Because you have, essentially,
A exclusive OR A cancels out.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.780
And so it's something like a
exclusive OR B exclusive OR B

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.330
again would give you A.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.110
So if you go look at AES, for
example, which is the Advanced

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.430
Encryption Standard, is really
only about four lines of code,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.380
maybe it's eight lines of code.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.520
But this is a well
used, it has been around

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.670
for a while, symmetric
key cipher that

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.020
runs in 128-bit mode as
well as 256-bit mode.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.410
And it's, like I said,
a few lines of code.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.370
And you'll see operations
like this, permutations.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.720
And you'll see hat symbols
if you see a C program, which

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.140
is exclusive OR.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.260
And you can see the
encryption and the decryption

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.840
are identical in implementation.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.500
You're just going to run it
one way, and you run it again.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.040
And you get back the result.
Because these permutations

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.060
are reversible.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.080
And the hats are reversible.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.880
And they're all signed
integers, so you're just

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.940
sort of adding them up.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.220
And it's just
complement arithmetic,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.140
so that looks the same as well.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.440
So I encourage you to
go take a look at AES.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.500
I'm not going to
spend more time on it.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.390
The key idea here is of
symmetry and reversibility.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.944
We're going to move
away from that.

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:12.360
Clearly, we didn't
talk about that

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.720
when we talked about one way
hash functions, et cetera.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.500
That was a different situation
where we had no secrecy.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.770
But here, we wanted symmetry.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.560
The big question
that you would ask

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.590
and you should ask yourself
when you see this, you say,

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.470
OK great.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.810
I can build symmetric key
encryption algorithms.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.790
They're actually, I would
say, somewhat easier

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.020
to do than to build
hash functions, which

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.560
have a whole lot of more
interesting properties

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.260
and hard to obtain properties
like collusion resistance.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.470
But the question really
is how do Alice and Bob

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.950
share the secret key, k?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.040
So you need that.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.770
You need this 128-bit
number in order

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.750
for there to be a channel,
a secure channel, that Alice

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.570
can communicate to Bob
with and vice verse.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.320
And so now you could say
Alice sends Bob a letter.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.000
But you know, mal could
intercept that letter.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.930
And even worse, what wants
to do is look at the letter,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.290
actually deliver
the letter, which

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:20.920
is the best thing for
him, and Alice and Bob

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.750
think that they have
a secure channel.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.360
That's sort of best case
scenario for mal, right?

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.320
So you could have mal
in the middle here.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.050
And you've got to worry
about stuff like that.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:39.050
So key exchange, let's move
on to talk about key exchange.

00:11:46.445 --> 00:12:00.060
And how does the secret
key k get shared?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.980
You can't put this out
on a website, right?

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.750
So it has to be
the case, sharing

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:12.200
is something that has to
be secure in the sense

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.730
that there can't be
any eavesdroppers.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:20.195
So here's my favorite example
of a puzzle that most of you

00:12:20.195 --> 00:12:23.170
have probably heard about.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.800
But those of you who haven't,
it's really pretty cool.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.700
And those of you who have, it's
still pretty cool and worth

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.790
recalling.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.300
And there's actually
something that you probably

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.250
haven't thought about
very much even if you've

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:39.450
heard about this puzzle.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.480
That's the mathematical
assumption made

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.080
in the solution of this puzzle.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.930
That will be interesting to you.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.980
But the puzzle is
a pirate puzzle.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.050
So you've got Alice and Bob.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.900
Let's call it the
Caribbean, because that's

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.740
my favorite ocean.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.896
And Alice and Bob are in
two different islands.

00:12:56.896 --> 00:12:59.020
And we all know there are
pirates in the Caribbean,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.600
right?

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.140
And so Alice and Bob want to
communicate with each other.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:12.090
And what Alice has are a bunch
of boxes and locks and keys.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.150
She's got the keys for
her locks and nothing else

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.980
and the same thing with Bob.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:30.460
So Bob has boxes, locks,
keys for his locks

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.360
that he can put on his boxes.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.690
And in this case, Alice wants
to send a message to Bob.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.110
And Alice wants to
exchange a key with Bob,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.770
so they can eventually
communicate in a secure way

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.050
regardless of the pirates or
whoever else is listening.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.852
So the problem here, of
course, is that if you just

00:13:49.852 --> 00:13:52.310
send a message on a boat-- so
the pirates are kind of nice,

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:58.260
in a way, that they
will deliver messages.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.730
But they are curious, right?

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.000
So they're very curious.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.654
And they will open up boxes.

00:14:04.654 --> 00:14:06.820
And so that's supposed to
be a boat, by the way, not

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.880
a box, a little mast there.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.150
So I'm not a sailor.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.830
But you have these boxes that
are going to get delivered.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.740
And the deal is this.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.376
If there's an open box, the
pirate's will open the box.

00:14:23.376 --> 00:14:25.584
And if there's any message
in it, they might read it,

00:14:25.584 --> 00:14:26.760
they might throw it away.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:32.550
So clearly, a secret
key can be exchanged

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.150
by just putting a box
with a message in it

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.350
if you don't lock it.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.220
They will not be able to
open, they'll not touch,

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.040
and they will
deliver a locked box.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.390
But if they ever see a
key, they'll keep it.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:53.435
If they ever see kind
of a key on the boat,

00:14:53.435 --> 00:14:54.810
they'll just grab
it and keep it.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.018
And then the next time
around, they see a locked box,

00:14:57.018 --> 00:15:00.140
they'll stick the key
in and try and open it.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.970
All right.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:06.340
So how do Alice and Bob
securely exchange a secret

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.600
where security is based
on this notion of piracy,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:16.980
I guess, with the pirates having
a certain amount of capability

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.610
in terms of storing keys,
and opening up the locks,

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.460
but they will not
touch a locked box?

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.635
All right.

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:25.510
So that's the puzzle.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.790
How many of you have heard
of this puzzle before?

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.090
So all of you keep quiet.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.350
Someone who hasn't heard
of this puzzle before,

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:39.770
think for a few seconds here and
see if a solution occurs to you

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.490
with respect to going back and
forth-- so that's the hint,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.980
going back and forth-- and
being able to securely exchange

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.660
a message, which could be a
128-bit secret key written

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.060
on a little note
between Alice and Bob.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:55.560
Yeah?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.578
Back there.

00:15:56.578 --> 00:16:00.780
AUDIENCE: Are they allowed
to pass locks such that--

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.530
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So
if you see it locked,

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:04.510
they'll throw away
the lock, too.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.370
If the lock is on
the box, then sure,

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.340
they will deliver that box.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.610
But if the key is
outside of that box,

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.960
then they'll keep the key.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.270
No-- this is a difficult puzzle.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.246
Yeah?

00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:29.107
AUDIENCE: Alice could lock
the box and send it to Bob.

00:16:29.107 --> 00:16:30.065
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah.

00:16:30.065 --> 00:16:34.572
AUDIENCE: And then Bob
could also lock the box.

00:16:34.572 --> 00:16:35.900
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.090
And then?

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.801
At that point-- no,
you're on the right track.

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.300
Keep going.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.740
Just push it a little more.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.492
Couple of more boat
rides and we're done.

00:16:46.492 --> 00:16:48.456
Yeah.

00:16:48.456 --> 00:16:52.501
AUDIENCE: And then
if Bob sends--

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.750
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So there's
now two locks on the box.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.562
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: And Bob
has two locks on the box.

00:16:58.562 --> 00:17:00.020
And so what's Bob
going to do next?

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.742
What's the logical thing
for Bob to do next?

00:17:03.742 --> 00:17:05.089
AUDIENCE: Send it back to Alice.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.630
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Send it back Alice.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.300
And now the key's inside.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.170
Alice now sees two
locks on the box.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.420
And one of the locks is Bobs.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.180
And other is?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.069
AUDIENCE: Hers.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.690
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Is hers.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.380
AUDIENCE: She can unlock it.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.046
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: She
can unlock the box

00:17:21.046 --> 00:17:23.540
and send it back to Bob.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:27.650
And all of this time, the only
thing that's gone in transit

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.750
is a locked box.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.050
No keys have gone
into in transit,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.400
whether they're inside
the box or wherever.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.720
But the only thing that's
moved is a locked box.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.410
So that's good.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.550
You're exactly right.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.110
So that gets you a Frisbee.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.930
Whoops, sorry.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.710
We need a secure exchange there.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.730
Yeah, that's good.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.250
So that is exactly right.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:18:05.610
So just to recap, Alice
locks box with KA,

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.980
and that's the key for
the lock, sends it to Bob.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:18.320
Bob locks box with
KB, sends it to Alice.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.220
And Alice unlocks--
oh, I should've said

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.100
that Alice puts message in box.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.630
And that message has the
secret key inside of it.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:45.840
Alice unlocks KA and
sends box to Bob.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:56.130
And then Bob unlocks
KB and reads message.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.470
So that's good.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.870
That's all good.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.480
Let's look at it a
little more deeply

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:08.170
and think about it from a
mathematical standpoint, not

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.330
a physical standpoint.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.990
You could think about it from
a physical standpoint as well.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:18.050
What is the relationship between
this locking, this sequence,

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.550
in this case a pair of
locks, that we require here

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.310
in order for this to
physically make sense?

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.810
s

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.435
I mean, there's
different ways that you

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.890
could add two locks to a box.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.120
There's many different ways.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.440
One way is to have a box that is
locked if I look it over here.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.630
And it doesn't open, because
the lid doesn't open.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.310
I've got suitcases like that.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.549
And then there could
be another spot here

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.465
that looks it as well.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.090
So that could be one way.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.800
Well, what's another
way of having two locks?

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.300
Yeah

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.680
AUDIENCE: Putting
a box within a box.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.860
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah,
putting a box within a box.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.090
That's great.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:02.270
So if you put a box within
a box, then does this work?

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.090
It doesn't work, right?

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.350
So nested locks
actually don't work.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:17.680
Because what happened here is
that KA was put first, then KB.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.730
And if, in fact, you had
KA, and then KB out there,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:35.729
then you can't remove
KA without removing KB.

00:20:35.729 --> 00:20:38.020
And this would be the case
where you have nested locks.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.860
So the mathematical
operation that we require

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.890
is commutativity
between the locks.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.010
And the locks need to commute.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.900
I want to put KA in first.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.320
Like I described, the
physical realization

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.440
could simply be a suitcase
with two different positions

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.250
for the two locks.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.760
And any one of those
positions locks the suitcase.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.820
So you put KA here, KB here.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.400
And then you can
take KA out, right?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.860
And it's still locked,
because you have KB.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:20.130
So this commutativity between
the locks and essentially

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:24.200
the keys is what's required.

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.930
And so now, let's
move away from pirates

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.930
and go into the
cryptography domain,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.670
pure mathematical
domain, and see

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.740
how this turns
into what's called

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.130
the Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
which is a key exchange

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:48.720
algorithm or a protocol that
under certain conditions

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.590
give you exactly
what you see here.

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.420
It gives you a
secure key exchange.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.410
And there's one issue
associated with it,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.020
and that'll be kind of clear
once we write it out here,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.720
that we'll get back to.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.430
But Diffie-Hellman key
exchange assumes that you

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.420
have commutative locks.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:09.930
And this is how it works.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:16.040
You'll see what commutes
when I give you the equations

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.760
associated with
Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:25.100
And this is also
described in the '70s.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.630
So what we're going to do is
we're going to work in a finite

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.120
field Fp*.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.450
And the finite field
means that we're

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:41.820
going to be doing mod
p, where p is prime.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.060
And the star means we're
going to be only looking

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.930
at invertible elements only.

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.449
So we drop the
nonvertible elements.

00:22:52.449 --> 00:22:54.240
These things aren't
particularly important.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.560
And so we'll drop 0.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.480
And we'll be looking
at 1, 2, to p minus 1.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.330
So all the numbers
that you see are going

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.690
to be 1 through p minus 1.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:14.440
Now, what is the analog
all this protocol

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:20.120
that Alice and Bob,
in our pirate puzzle,

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.070
operated on or ran?

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.070
What is the analog in
the mathematical domain

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.060
or in the finite field domain?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.100
Well, here's what happens.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:39.691
Alice is going to
select a random a.

00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:45.450
And we're going to
assume the g is public.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:51.880
So she just shouts
that out to-- Alice

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.950
can see Bob from her house.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.069
So she shouts out
g and shouts out p.

00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:58.860
They're all public.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.680
She doesn't care if the
pirates can hear this.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.440
And Alice is going to
select a, which is random,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.810
and compute g of a.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.470
And this is in the
finite field, capital G.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.310
So you're going to do your mods.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:23.550
And she's just going to send
over g of a over to Bob.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:37.540
Now, what Bob does is select
b and computes g raise to b

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.490
and sends that over.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.950
So g raised to a is
being sent over. g

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.600
raised to b is being sent
over, sent over to Alice.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.160
So Alice gets g raised to b.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.880
And the key realization
here is that Alice

00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:02.880
can compute g raised to b raised
to a, because she knows a.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.030
This is all going to be mod p.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.200
And we're going to call that
K. And thanks to the fact

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.210
that exponentiation
commutes, Bob

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:20.810
computes g raised to a
raised to b, because Bob

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.727
knows b, which is also
exactly K-- I should say mod

00:25:25.727 --> 00:25:28.827
p over here.

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:29.660
Everything is mod p.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:34.920
So that's it.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.040
That's Diffie-Hellman
key exchange.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.690
You have now created
a shared secret

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.110
based on the commutativity
of exponentiation.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.840
And the part that's
still missing here

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.032
with respect to the analogy
is the fact that g of a

00:25:55.032 --> 00:25:57.760
is essentially the locked box.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.690
So what g of a is hiding is a.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.160
Because you want a to be hidden
here and the same thing with g

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:05.660
of b.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.080
It needs to hide b.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.700
So the problem that the
pirates had was they

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.420
couldn't open up the box.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:19.170
The problem that the adversary,
let's call them mal, has

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:26.630
is that he has to invert g
of a in order to discover a.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.870
And in this particular
finite field,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.990
and many such finite fields,
you can think of this

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.370
as being what's called a
discrete logarithm problem.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.870
So if you don't
know how to computer

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.099
logarithms in that
continuous domain.

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:41.890
And there's tables.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.720
And it's pretty easy to do.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.740
But this is what's called
a discrete logarithm

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.400
problem, because we're
in a finite field.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.980
And we obviously want
integers. a is an integer.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.800
So we need to discover
what does that integer is.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.800
Because we're doing
the mod p, et cetera,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.490
and p is typically
on a large number,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.650
it's actually a hard
problem computationally

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.520
to do a discrete log.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.820
So when you see g of a,
you know g, you know p,

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.710
but trying to figure out
what produced that g of a

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.920
is a difficult problem.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.010
And people have looked
at this for 30, 40 years

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.929
and there's not great
algorithms to solve

00:27:21.929 --> 00:27:23.720
this problem, certainly
not anything that's

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.440
polynomial time solvable.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.550
They're all kind
of subexponential.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:32.070
And you can make the numbers
large enough such that g of a

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.270
is secure in the sense that it
doesn't give away what a is.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:43.260
So that's the insight here
that Diffie and Hellman had,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:55.020
which comes down to the
discrete log problem is hard.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.910
And what this simply
means is given g of a,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.160
the discrete log
problem is compute a.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.950
And the same thing
for b, of course.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:09.300
There's one other
thing that you want

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.400
to say to be precise
to sort of just

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.490
cover the spectrum with respect
to how this could break.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.340
And that is what's called
the Diffie-Hellman problem,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.470
for want of a better names and
since these are the folks who

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.770
first came up with it.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.960
And the Diffie-Hellman
problem is simply

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.680
that given g of a and g of b,
which is what the pirates see

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.610
and what the adversary
mal sees, we should not

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:43.400
be able to compute g
of a times b, which

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.790
is exactly what we get here.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.600
g of a raised to b
is g of a times b.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.680
So given those two
things, if there's

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.990
a way of computing
g of a times b,

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.800
even though you potentially
haven't discovered

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.340
a and b precisely,
g of a times b

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:02.060
is just the secret key that
Alice and Bob exchanged.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.620
So you're host.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.240
Alice and Bob are host
if mal can do this.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.410
So there's two
things going on here.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.540
You want the Diffie-Hellman
problem to be hard.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.500
And you want the discrete
log problem to be hard.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.500
OK So generally, this is
how cryptography works.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.880
You set up protocols.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:26.330
And there's some information
that's bound to be exposed.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.280
You want this information
to be hard to reverse

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.190
to get the crucial information.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.890
That requires the computational
hardness assumption

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.760
like the two that
we've made here.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.100
And then you're off and running.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.060
Your system will break if
your computational hardness

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.010
assumptions are incorrect.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.500
And they may be correct
for a particular time,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.910
for example, the 1970s
for particular parameters.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.120
But they may end up being
incorrect assumptions,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.180
at least for those parameters,
at a later point of time,

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:00.160
simply because
computers got faster.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.110
It's like 2 raised to 40
was this huge number when

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.320
I was your age.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.840
Now, it's like nothing.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.350
So that's basically
part of the game.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.670
But the good systems are those
that scale where you increase

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.470
the parameter size and the
system and the protocol

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.950
stays the same.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.510
And so you just increase p,
for example, in this case.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.300
And the discrete
long problem is still

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.400
hard for modern computers.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.600
So those are the good protocols
and the good cryptosystems that

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.950
stand the test of
time, not necessarily

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.850
the ones that have exactly
particular parameters.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:37.610
That's hard to do.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.650
Because as I said,
Moore's law and computers

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.740
have been getting really
exponentially faster.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.830
All right.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:51.350
So there's one main problem
with the Diffie-Hellman protocol

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:54.020
and the solution to
our pirate puzzle.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.167
And so can someone tell
me-- and it could be just

00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:59.250
for the sake of the
Diffie-Hellman problem or just

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.130
in the context of the
Diffie-Hellman problem,

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:05.290
but also in the context of the
pirate puzzle-- what assumption

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.690
are we making here
that's as yet unstated

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:14.560
with respect to this secure key
exchange being actually secure?

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.080
Someone.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.556
Yeah.

00:31:17.556 --> 00:31:21.500
AUDIENCE: If I were to intercept
a message from [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.990
something of their own back?

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.060
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
What does that mean?

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.820
The pirates see a locked box.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:29.650
So the first step of
the protocol, Alice

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.470
is sending a message
inside a locked box

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.740
with a single lock in it.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.120
You're kind of on
the right track.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.340
And what could the pirates do
in order to break this protocol?

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.250
We've kind of made
an assumption here.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.955
And I might have
said it explicitly.

00:31:47.955 --> 00:31:48.580
Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
throw the box away.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.230
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: They could
just throw the box away.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.396
But that doesn't break the
security of the protocol.

00:31:53.396 --> 00:31:56.565
That breaks the functionality
of the protocol, right?

00:31:56.565 --> 00:31:57.190
Yeah, go ahead.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.770
AUDIENCE: Put their old
lock on [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.561
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Ah,
that's exactly right,

00:32:00.561 --> 00:32:01.680
put their own lock on it.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.051
You know, if they had locks-- so
these pirates don't have locks,

00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:05.550
right?

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:06.758
We're making that assumption.

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.330
If they had their
own lock with a key,

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:10.940
if they just had
a lock that locks

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:12.440
and they didn't
have the key for it,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.898
they will wouldn't
be able to break

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:15.140
the security of the protocol.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.910
But if they had a lock
and a key for that lock,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:22.350
then they can pretend to
have delivered this to Bob.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.040
And there's no authenticity
here with respect to Alice

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.860
doesn't quite know whether she's
communicating with Bob or not.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.640
She's at the mercy of the
pirates to deliver these boxes.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:37.480
So if the pirates had a lock
and the key for the lock,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.760
then we're in a situation
where Alice may have exchanged

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.370
the key with the pirates.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.520
And she thinks she's
exchanged it with Bob.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.100
And she's, in fact,
communicating with the pirates.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:33:01.340
So there's a man in
the middle attack,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:10.190
which corresponds to the
pirates having their own locks

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.240
and keys.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.500
And it's even more trivial in
the case of our picture here.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.460
Because assuming the
pirates know mathematics,

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.020
they can generate a random
number-- and the number

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:27.020
could be c, for example-- and
just send back g raised to c.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.170
And for all you know,
they could actually

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.430
get Bob to send g
raised to b back,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:38.940
but they would intercept it and
replace it with g raised to c.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.767
And they know what c is.

00:33:40.767 --> 00:33:42.850
So what's happening now
is so you can [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.320
I won't to go through
all of the math here.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.130
But you can kind
of see it, I hope.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.950
You end up, if you're
Alice, exchanging

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:58.030
a secret key with the
pirates as opposed to Bob.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:03.280
And the way you can set this
up is the pirates actually

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.070
will get into a situation
where Alice and Bob think

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.980
that they're communicating with
each other in a secure fashion,

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.510
but the pirates can listen
to all of the messages.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.210
They can decrypt
all of the messages,

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.940
because they know what
they secret key, k, is.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.880
OK.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.730
And remember that
the secret key, k,

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.219
is something that
is probably going

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:25.239
to be used in a symmetric key
encryption scheme eventually

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:28.510
to send real messages.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.190
So you're going to have ciphered
text with that secret key,

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.179
capital K, over there.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:37.730
And if the pirates or mal get to
know what the secret key, k, is

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:41.000
through a man in the middle
attack, you've got problems.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.080
All right?

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.139
So the man in the middle
attack is something

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.730
that we have to worry about.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.440
What we're going
to talk about next

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.030
is something that
addresses this problem.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.739
And it may not seem
like it's directly

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.200
addressing the problem.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.300
But fundamentally,
what's going on here

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:04.290
is you need to have
authenticity in who you're

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.310
communicating with.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.080
Alice has to somehow
authenticate Bob.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.710
And Alice has to
know somehow that g

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.560
raised to b is something
that came from Bob.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.780
It's not g raised to c
that came from somebody

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.380
else is in the middle.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.110
And that's where asymmetric key
cryptography and public keys

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:26.700
come in, where you have a
certified public key associated

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.170
with yourself.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.230
And maybe you need
VeriSign or you

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.090
need the DMV, or the
Registry of Motor Vehicles,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.150
RMV, to do this for you.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.020
But you create a
certified public key,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.430
which is associated
with your identity.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.840
And it's public.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.100
You can put it on a website.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.590
And everyone can
access it using HTTPS,

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.300
so they know they're
going to the exact website

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.740
that you've put up.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:57.230
And that gives you a way
of identifying yourself.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.440
And if you can do
that, you can protect

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.560
against the man in the
middle attack using

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.140
asymmetric key cryptography.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.390
So that's kind of the final
part of this puzzle that's

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:15.470
associated with authentication
and secret key exchange and all

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.213
of that.

00:36:16.213 --> 00:36:18.337
Once we do that, you'll
know what the functionality

00:36:18.337 --> 00:36:19.789
is that we require.

00:36:19.789 --> 00:36:21.330
And then we'll have
to talk about how

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.975
we can build a subsystems.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:28.020
Cool.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.560
Any questions so far?

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.930
How we doing?

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.430
OK.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.880
So public key encryption, let
me just do a little set up.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.370
I said some of this last time.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.580
But to make sure we're on the
same page, what we have here

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.970
is we really want a
message plus a public key.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:37:02.680
And you want to obtain ciphered
text using this operation.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.920
And this plus is not
arithmetic addition.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.900
It's just that we're putting
these two things together

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.930
into an algorithm, a public
key encryption algorithm, that

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.500
produces ciphered text.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.290
All right.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:18.910
And this public key, just to
reiterate what I just said,

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:23.790
is going to be if Alice
is producing the message

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.460
and Bob is getting
the ciphered text,

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.650
this is going to be
Bob's public key.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.800
And the fact that
it's Bob's public key

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.420
is something that
Alice should be

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.370
able to authenticate
using VeriSign, using

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.574
the Register of Motor
Vehicles, what have you.

00:37:40.574 --> 00:37:42.490
That's what's going to
protect against the man

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:43.600
in the middle attack.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.690
OK.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.790
We're not going to
talk a lot about how

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:48.920
you can get a certificate.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.340
Your MIT certificate
is something which

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.310
corresponds to your MIT ID.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:57.330
It's got information, what year
you are, what your name is.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.470
And when you generate
that certificate,

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:03.886
you are getting a certificate of
authenticity that you are you.

00:38:03.886 --> 00:38:05.260
And of course,
you give that away

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.180
and you hand it to
someone else, someone

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.160
can pretend to be you as well.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.860
But that's what's happening
when we talk about public keys

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.500
and you owning public keys.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.390
We're not going to, as I said,
get into that very much more.

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.310
I'm more interested in
describing this algorithm

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.960
for public key encryption.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.410
We'll look at a couple that
produces a ciphered text given

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.440
a message and a public key.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.130
Now, of course,
what Bob needs to do

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:41.670
is to take the ciphered text.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.750
And this is what Bob's doing.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:53.360
And Bob has a private key that
is distinct from the public key

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.600
and needs to get back exactly
the message using a decryption

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.680
algorithm that corresponds to
the message that Alice sent.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.720
OK.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:10.010
And this whole thing is
going to work provided

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:15.010
knowing the public
key, let's call it PK,

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.060
and the private key.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.990
We can't call it PK
as well, obviously.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.960
So we call it SK.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:26.770
Knowing the PK does
not reveal anything

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:33.290
in a mathematical
sense about SK.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.740
But obviously, in order for
this whole thing to work,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:42.950
PK and SK have to have some
mathematical relationship.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.070
And the different
cryptosystems including RSA,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.330
and we look at a
knapsack cryptosystem,

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:53.310
all have different algorithms
for encryption and decryption.

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.780
And they have different
mathematical relationships

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.440
between PK and SK.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.320
And for each of
these relationships,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.260
you have to show that
the adversary has

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.580
to solve a computationally
hard problem in order

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:12.140
to discover SK given PK.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:14.870
And it turns out that for
most of these systems,

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:19.330
it's symmetric in the sense
that these algorithms,

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.120
at least for RSA, you
could use either one

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.690
of these interchangeably.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.390
And there's issues
associated with that.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.120
So we really won't go
too deep into that.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:35.660
But what I said you should
hold, which is you have one,

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.360
it shouldn't tell you
anything about the other.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.760
There has to be a
computationally hard problem

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.790
associated with
discovering one of these

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.350
only given the one other.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:50.410
And we'll talk about
what those hardness

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.580
assumptions are certainly
for RSA and also

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.730
for another
cryptosystem, a knapsack.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:00.270
So we're going to
present RSA, which

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.400
is this real magical algorithm.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.580
It's amazing it works.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.100
Every time I prepare
for this lecture,

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.130
I got to relearn somethings.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:17.370
And that's because there's
one subtle aspect of this.

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.580
It's all about number theory.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.190
Number theory can
get pretty subtle.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:26.850
But it's also intricate enough
that I forget the details.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.030
So let's get started on that.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:37.300
Basically, RSA is based on
primes and factoring numbers

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.760
into primes and
using number theory

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.820
to make sure that you
can actually accomplish

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.050
what this is trying to do.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.580
The functionality
of RSA should be

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.550
distinct from the
security of RSA.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.450
When we talk about the
functionality of RSA,

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:01.390
we are saying for
any message, if Alice

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.270
uses Bob's public
key to encrypt it,

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:07.780
the ciphered text
resulting from that

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.700
should be decryptable
into exactly the message

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.220
that Alice sent given
Bob's private key.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.240
That's the functional
requirement

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.120
of a public key
encryption algorithm

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.220
or a public key cryptosystem.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.690
The security requirement of
a public key cryptosystem

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.520
is what I wrote up there.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.540
It's the knowledge of
SK should be hidden even

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.790
given the knowledge of PK.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.190
And there's precise
computational hardness

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.460
assumptions that are associated
with each cryptosystem.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.745
So let's separate out
functionality from security.

00:42:41.745 --> 00:42:43.370
We're going to talk
about functionality

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.411
for the next few minutes.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:43:00.970
Alice is going to pick two
large secret primes, p and q.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.660
So what I'm going
to describe here

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.480
are Alice generating her
public key and her private key.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.960
She's going to then
publish her public key

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.360
and keep her private key secret.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.160
Bob does the same thing.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.760
And then after that,
they have to register.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.120
And this is not something
we'll spend time on beyond me

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.360
saying it one more time.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.820
They have to register their
public keys with the VeriSign

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.190
or the RMVs like I talked about.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.380
So everyone knows that Alice's
public key is this long number.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.500
But no one knows
Alice's private key.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.860
So Alice picks two
large secret primes.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.240
So these are actually
going to result

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.560
in the creation of
our private key.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:48.600
And then Alice
computes N equals pq.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.320
So she just
multiplies those out.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:44:00.660
She chooses an
encryption exponent,

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:07.600
e, which satisfies this
little equation, which

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.560
says that it's relatively
prime in relation

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.880
to p minus 1 times q minus 1.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.910
And she knows p and q.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:19.550
So she can compute p
minus 1 times q minus 1.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:24.010
So the gcd of e and p
minus 1, q minus 1 is 1.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.740
And you can certainly
accomplish this simply

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.890
by choosing e to be a prime.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:34.600
Because then a gcd of a prime
with anything else is 1.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.130
And it turns out that RSA uses--
this is all going to be public,

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.370
by the way.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.560
e is going to be public.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.080
So you can just fix that.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.470
And most RSA algorithms just
fix that to be a small number.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.430
The encryption exponent
is a small number.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:52.910
And the reason
it's a small number

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.160
is because you're worried
about performance.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.500
And we're going to
exponentiate using e.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.750
And the smaller it is,
the faster the encryption

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.910
is going to go.

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:04.530
So if you want to encrypt
fast and decrypt more slowly,

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.910
unfortunately, that's
the trade off here.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.127
You would pick a small e.

00:45:08.127 --> 00:45:10.710
And then we're going to compute
our decryption exponent, which

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:12.650
obviously is going to
have to be private.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:14.470
Because that's part
of our private key.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.810
But that's going to be
bigger if e is small.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.349
And that's just a trade off.

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:20.140
It's symmetric in the
sense that while it's

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.940
an asymmetric
algorithm, it's kind of

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.290
symmetric in the
mathematical sense

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:28.160
that the private keys and
the public key operations

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.910
are symmetric.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.015
So what is Alice's public key?

00:45:33.015 --> 00:45:39.540
Well, Alice's public key,
which she can then publish,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:42.130
is simply m, e.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:42.630
OK.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.920
Now, the fun starts.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.520
We have to figure out
what the private key is

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.070
going to correspond to.

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:02.220
And it turns out-- and
this is one of those things

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.110
where how did they
ever think of this?

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:09.020
And that's still
true 40 years later.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:15.155
You get the decryption exponent
using the extended Euclidean

00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:15.655
algorithm.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:30.490
And this is done by Alice
secretly, where what you want

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:35.110
is to have the relationship
that e times d is 1.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:41.230
And this is mod p
minus 1, q minus 1.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.540
And there's algorithms
out there that

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:50.150
would find the inverse
that corresponds to d for e

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:51.520
or vice versa.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.810
And they're polytime algorithms.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.149
As long as you know this number
here, mod p minus 1, q minus 1,

00:46:58.149 --> 00:46:59.940
and you know that Alice
knows that, you can

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.210
get your decryption exponent.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:06.880
And typically, if a is small, as
I said, d is going to be large.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.590
By the way, the
numbers here, p and q,

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.710
are going to be the
roughly 1,000 bits long.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.650
So that's essentially-- we're
talking about huge primes here.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:19.180
And so n would be 2048
bits in that case.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:27.010
So the private key,
Alice's private key,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:32.450
you can think of as d, p, q.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.255
So now, it's clear as to what's
public and what's private.

00:47:35.255 --> 00:47:37.040
n and e are public.

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.950
d, p, and q are private.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.030
So that's the set up for RSA.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:48.160
And it's not at all clear
that RSA accomplishes

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.700
either of the two things that
we need, the first of which

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.490
is functionality, the fact that
encrypting, and then decrypting

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:00.470
a message should get
you back that message.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.580
So that's the first
thing we need to look at.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.140
And the security part is
actually a little bit easier.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.190
Because you can see
we're going to have

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:11.460
to make assumptions
about factoring primes

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.050
and so on and so forth.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.690
Right here, you can just
see that immediately.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:18.590
The biggest
assumption made by RSA

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.840
from a computational
hardness standpoint

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.450
is simply that if
the adversary sees n,

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:28.660
that they should not be able
to factor it into p and q.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.860
Because if they can
do that, it's over.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.870
So that's actually easier than
the functionality argument.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.130
So why does this work?

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.080
And amazingly, we can actually
do this in about 10 minutes.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.350
I'm going to explain to you
why this works in 10 minutes.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:53.570
And the only theorem
that we'll require

00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:56.720
on top of this, which
I will not approve,

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.130
because Fermat proved
it centuries ago,

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:05.830
is Fermat's Little
Theorem that says

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:12.020
that when you have
p being a prime--

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.985
you can think of this
as a special case.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:27.290
You take m, and m is
an arbitrary number.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:34.760
And if p is a prime, then
this relationship holds.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.190
So you raise it to the p minus
1 power, and you get 1, mod p.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.980
So that's Fermat's
Little Theorem

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.160
that's going to be required.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.701
And that's pretty
much the only thing

00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:47.980
that you have to invoke beyond
sort of standard mod arithmetic

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:51.720
to show that RSA works.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.010
So what's going on here?

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:58.734
Let's call phi p minus
1 times q minus 1.

00:49:58.734 --> 00:50:00.650
Obviously, that's showed
up a couple of times.

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.190
And you may as well
represent it by using

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.830
a smaller, simpler symbol.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.530
So we'll call that phi.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:13.870
And we are going to
say that d equals 1.

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:16.280
Mod phi is given to us.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:28.490
And therefore, we can say
that ed equals 1 plus k phi.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.840
So that's it.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.510
All I'm saying is the remainder.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.790
Then you took to the mod
with respect to phi was 1.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.900
So the actual number
was 1 plus k times phi.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.300
k is some integer.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.390
Think of it as a
positive integer.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:50.570
Remember that we now have the
p and the q are over there.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.440
And p and q are primes.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.230
So p and q are primes.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.980
And given that that's
the case, we really

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:02.310
have two cases to analyze.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:03.210
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:14.530
I missed one crucial point,
which I should have told you,

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.360
which is I gave you this.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.050
But I didn't actually
tell you what is going on.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:23.040
I mentioned it in
passing, exponentiation.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.980
But I didn't tell you
exactly what the encryption

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.670
algorithm was and the
decryption algorithm was.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.250
And obviously, you
need that in order

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:31.270
to prove their correctness.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:32.853
I mean, it'd be
wonderful if you could

00:51:32.853 --> 00:51:33.990
prove correctness of this.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:38.440
There exists an
algorithm that is such

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:43.340
that RSA works or public
key encryption works.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.240
So it turns out it's
extremely straightforward.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:48.660
c equals m raised to e.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:51.210
And that's part
of the usefulness

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:56.315
and the power of RSA,
which is you take m

00:51:56.315 --> 00:51:58.860
and you exponentiate it.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:04.310
And you take c and
you exponentiate it.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.350
And the first is the encryption.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.480
You get the c
through encryption,

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.440
as you can see over
there, the ciphered text.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.970
And m is the plain text.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:13.500
And you get that back.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:24.650
So our goal here is to show that
you have essentially something

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:31.660
where when you exponentiate
m raised to ed,

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.060
it should give you m.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.080
For these choices that
we have, of e and d,

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:43.160
we've set up the d
in such a way that m

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.030
raised to ed-- because if
you just go do encryption

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.754
followed by decryption, you
are doubly exponentiating.

00:52:51.754 --> 00:52:52.420
That make sense?

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.510
Ask me questions if
this doesn't make sense.

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:55.600
This is important.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.930
m raised to ed should
give you back m.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.860
And if you can show that
for any m, you're done.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.920
That's the functionality of RSA.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.550
All right.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.770
So that's encryption
and decryption.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:13.140
And so now let's
go back to here.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.340
Now, ed equals 1 mod phi.

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:16.670
Because I've set that up.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:20.440
This is how I
discovered d given e.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440
So that's a given to me.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.100
That's part of what's called
the key generation phase of RSA.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.140
And that's the
mathematical relationship

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:31.830
that I keep harping on in
terms of the relationship

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:34.320
between the public
and the private key.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.755
So given that p and q are
primes, I have two cases.

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:50.050
The first case is
that gcd of m, p

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:54.620
is exactly 1, which
means that the message m.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.860
So what I'm comparing
here, the two cases,

00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.220
is I have the message.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.920
And I'm going to
break up the messages

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.010
into two different categories.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.057
That's it.

00:54:03.057 --> 00:54:05.140
There are all kinds of
messages that are possible.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.670
These are arbitrary numbers.

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:10.410
I'm going to break them up into
two categories, one of which

00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.860
where the message is relatively
prime in relation to the prime,

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.080
p.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.710
And it's not a multiple of p.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:19.460
That's the way you
want to think about it.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:24.100
Obviously, gcdmp would
be 2 if M were 2p.

00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.850
So the case I'm looking
at is gcd of mp equals 1.

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:32.330
And then the another case is
going to be trivial, actually,

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:38.060
which is gcd of mp equals p.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.110
Did I say 2 when I said
gcd of 2p, p equals 2?

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.100
Come on.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:45.635
Wake up.

00:54:45.635 --> 00:54:46.260
Wow, that's it.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:47.250
Perfect.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.230
Wake up.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.710
OK.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:53.551
So gcd of 2p and p is p.

00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:54.675
So those are the two cases.

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.060
All right.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:05.576
So by Fermat's
Little Theorem, this

00:55:05.576 --> 00:55:06.700
is really Fermat's theorem.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.920
And because he had a last
theorem, for some reason,

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.560
some people call this
the Little Theorem.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.960
But it's Fermat's theorem.

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.270
And we know what that is.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.500
I just wrote that out there.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.810
You can now write something
that says what I'm going to do

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:30.530
is I'm going to just take
m raised to p minus 1,

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.030
which is 1.

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:33.600
So this thing is 1.

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.254
And then I'm going to raise
it to k times q minus 1.

00:55:37.254 --> 00:55:39.170
And you'll see why I'm
doing this in a second.

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.270
Because I want to get the
1 plus k phi factor here.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.730
So I'm taking 1
and I'm raising it

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:47.570
to this power, which obviously
is going to give me 1 back.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:51.100
So all of that is
straightforward.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.460
And then I'm going to
multiply this by m.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.550
OK.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:56:02.310
And this is clearly
the same as m mod p.

00:56:02.310 --> 00:56:06.320
Because all I've done
is multiply it by 1.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:06.820
All right.

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.310
So why did I do this?

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:12.500
Well, I did this, because I
want to group together these two

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.570
exponents.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.990
And since I've run
out of room here,

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.750
let me just erase and
finish this properly.

00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:21.940
The other case is easy anyway.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:30.376
And so I can write this as 1
plus k p minus 1 q minus 1.

00:56:30.376 --> 00:56:36.450
And that, of course, is
exactly m raised to ed, right?

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:42.050
And so what I've done here is,
because 1 times m is clearly m,

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:45.910
but if I look at this,
this is m raised to ed.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:49.080
So that's clearly m.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.760
That's it.

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.160
Just figured out that
when I have k phi

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:58.680
here, that's going to
turn into 1, basically,

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:01.550
when you exponentiate it.

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:05.350
So that's the hard part,
actually, as it turns out,

00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:09.400
of proving RSA's
correctness, just

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.770
introducing this 1
raised to something.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:16.360
And then the easier
part is simply

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:20.560
the case where the m is
actually a multiple of p.

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:26.000
So you have a gcd
m, comma p equals p.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.940
And in this case, you know
that m mod p is actually 0.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.360
Because m is a multiple of p.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.530
So you're basically
exponentiating 0.

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:37.860
What do you do with 0?

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.220
You're going to get
0 on both sides.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.790
So you're sending a message
that's essentially 0 mod p

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:48.010
And when you decrypt it
on that side, you get 0.

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:54.800
But one last line here is
simply that m raised to ed

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:04.090
is m trivially all of this
mod p if m is 0, right?

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.784
So that was the easy case.

00:58:05.784 --> 00:58:07.450
So it was really
pretty straightforward.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:10.640
In one case, we took 1 and we
exponentiated it and showed

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:12.170
the result in a couple steps.

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:15.240
In the other case, you had
messages that were 0 mod p.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.370
So it's very pretty.

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:17.870
It works.

00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:20.890
And so what happened here?

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.740
I said that m raised
to ed equals m.

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.500
And what I did here, of
course, was I did everything.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.350
So it's not quite done,
a little slight of hand

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:35.120
here as I switched over
and talked about mod p.

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.410
So I had mod p over here.

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.340
And I said p and q were primes.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.770
And I looked at p first.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:45.690
But what I need to do,
just to finish this off,

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:47.880
let me do this over
here, is I have

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.541
to do the same argument for q.

00:58:50.541 --> 00:58:56.160
And I'm going to put
it together for n.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.530
And the reason for that is
simply that I have n over here.

00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.050
So remember n equals p times q.

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:06.460
The encryption and
that decryption

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:09.580
are going to be done mod o.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:13.210
Certainly, the encryption has
to be done mod n, because n

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:15.760
is only public
number that you have

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.670
that you can mod with, correct?

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:21.440
So what I've done here,
this analysis is for p,

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:26.550
can do the same for q.

00:59:26.550 --> 00:59:29.250
It's exactly the same,
because p is a prime

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.710
and q is also a prime.

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:34.910
But I have to just do one last
thing, which is put these two

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:39.130
things together and say
that n equals p times q,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.446
so the math is all
going to work out.

00:59:41.446 --> 00:59:42.570
Let me just write that out.

00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:45.740
It's not too
difficult to explain,

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.750
once I have this up here.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:52.100
So in both cases of p and
q, so when I say both cases,

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.330
I mean the pk's and qk's.

00:59:55.330 --> 01:00:02.070
I have m raised to
ed equals m mod p.

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:09.320
And m raised to ed is
the same as m mod q.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:19.810
And since p and q
are distinct primes,

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:27.690
we can say that m raised
to ed equals m mod N.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:31.410
And that essentially says c
raised to d, if you really

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:33.000
want to put it all
together, which

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:41.590
is m raised to e raised to
d, equals m mod N, which

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:45.530
of course is what we want here.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:51.000
And this thing was also mod N.
This is mod N, mod N, mod N.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.270
All right.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.090
So that's RSA.

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.400
That's your first
public key algorithm,

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.560
the first public key
algorithm, at least

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.075
that stood the test of
time, still in use today.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.430
From a standpoint
of computation,

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:09.670
this is the hardest part.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.900
You have to exponentiate, and
you have these large numbers.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:19.000
And as the years have rolled
by, RSA, as I've said,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.400
withstood the test of time.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.140
But the parameters
have increased.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:25.210
Way back then in
the '70s, they were

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.960
thinking about 512-bit primes.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.060
In fact, I can't recall
whether n was 512-bits or p

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.440
and q were 512-bits.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.940
But if p and q were 512-bits,
then n would be 1024.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:43.330
And now, NSA recommends
8192-bits for n.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.660
So there's been an increase.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.870
But the nice thing
is that it's not

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:52.040
like there's an exponential
increase in the computation.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.910
Because the computation
is polynomially related

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:57.570
to the number of bits.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:01.560
So if you double it, I
think, if I recall correctly,

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.430
decryption is going to
be the cube of that.

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:06.370
Or actually,
verifying signatures

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:07.820
is probably the cube of that.

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:11.470
But don't worry too
much about that.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:15.950
The bottom line is
that as you double

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.050
the size of the
exponent, you're going

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:22.530
to have a fairly small
increase in the time required

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:26.460
to decrypt or to verify
a signature, et cetera.

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:32.270
But it has grown from
512 or 1024 to 8192.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:35.160
And so hopefully,
you all understand

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.340
how RSA works to some extent.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.270
I just will leave it at the
hardness assumptions here

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:50.050
are, like in the case of
Diffie-Hellman, two-fold.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:56.170
And the first one is kind
of immediately obvious.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.550
Just like it was the
case with Diffie-Hellman,

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:01.390
where you had g raised
to a flying about

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:04.130
and obviously that
has to hide a,

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:08.130
here you got N, capital
N, being published.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:12.039
And if anybody could
take N and factor it,

01:03:12.039 --> 01:03:13.580
there may be multiple
factorizations.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:16.660
But you're going to get a
unique prime factorization.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.240
So that's what you want, that
unique prime factorization

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.250
of N.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:24.830
And if you get that, then
you've broken the System

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.180
because you know
what p and q are.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.960
And so this is all
public in the sense

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.120
that this algorithm is public.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.559
If you're using RSA, this
is what you're following.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:35.100
So the person is
trying to figure out

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.170
what the two primes are
that together get multiplied

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:42.030
to form capital N. And so
that's a factorization problem.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:52.300
And so RSA hardness
assumptions are given N,

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:59.230
hard to factor into p, comma q.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:00.315
And this is factoring.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.480
And then one other
thing, which is

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.320
given e-- so you're
not actually breaking

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.130
the entire cryptosystem.

01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:14.860
But you're breaking
the privacy associated

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.680
with a particular message.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.730
And so you could break
the privacy associated

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.820
with a particular message.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.370
You're given e,
because that's public.

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.830
And you don't know
what p and q are.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:34.260
But you know that e is
relatively prime with respect

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.680
to p minus 1, q minus 1,
because that's RSA algorithm.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.480
And that's a publicly known.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.030
And you also know c, which
is the ciphered text.

01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:47.520
And so what you're doing is
you're trying to discover m.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.780
So you're trying to break a
particular encryption that was

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.520
created by the RSA algorithm.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.910
And you haven't discovered
the private key here.

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:59.450
That's only discoverable
through the factoring problem.

01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:02.750
But you could break
security if you

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:13.440
can find m such that m
raised to e is c mod N.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.076
So you're doing the
searching for an m.

01:05:16.076 --> 01:05:17.450
So you're trying
to discover an m

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:19.500
that you can exponentiate
to get what you

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.790
have on the right-hand side.

01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:23.840
Because clearly, you can compute
what's on the right-hand side.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.890
So this is simply
called RSA problem.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.510
So those are the two
computational assumptions

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.620
that you need to make in
order for RSA to be secure.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.120
Cool.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:36.703
Any questions?

01:05:40.123 --> 01:05:43.477
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] center?

01:05:43.477 --> 01:05:45.060
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
So that's anonymity.

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:45.630
Yes.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.840
There's ring cryptography.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.980
And there's a whole
host of protocols.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:54.550
I actually did some of them
based on RSA, where you can,

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:59.170
by collecting a bunch of
private keys together,

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.130
essentially set it up
so it can be verified

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:06.850
that the message came from
a collection of people,

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:10.680
but you can't tell which
person the message came from.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.550
So there's just a
whole host of things.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.400
There's thousands
of papers written.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.740
There's a wonderful field.

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:19.850
I encourage you to look into
it if your interests are

01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:21.110
inclined this way.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.860
And it's just gone on and on.

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:25.870
It's become more important
with the internet.

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:29.970
RSA, the company, was probably
founded in the late '70s.

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.532
And they struggled for a while.

01:06:31.532 --> 01:06:32.990
And then eventually,
they were used

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.720
for Secure Sockets
Layer in Netscape,

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.060
which was their big break.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.510
And then, of course, Netscape
meant the internet was around.

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:44.140
And so really, the internet
made RSA what it is today.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.740
And so just a whole
host of wonderful

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.360
algorithms out
there, some of which

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.050
are based in RSA and
some that are broken.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.750
And so let's talk for
the last few minutes

01:06:53.750 --> 01:07:01.020
about all of the fits and starts
that occurred in cryptography.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:04.440
And precisely what
I'd like to focus on

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.640
for the time we have
left is hardness.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:11.010
So we spent a lot of time
talking about hard problems.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:17.600
And we talked about NP-complete
problems that are hard.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.760
But they're hard
in the worst case.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:30.250
So you have a situation where
you have NP-complete problems.

01:07:39.396 --> 01:07:40.770
And I'd like to
talk a little bit

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:44.030
about the relationship between
NP-completeness and crypto.

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.660
Because we've made these
assumptions about hardness.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:53.000
Now, what's interesting here
is that N composite is clearly

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:02.940
in NP, but unknown
if NP-complete.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:04.380
So this is very interesting.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:08.290
The tried and trusted algorithm
for public key encryption

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:10.450
relies on a
computational assumption

01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:12.660
where the problem associated
with that assumption

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.810
is not even known to be NPC.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:15.930
All right.

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:17.920
So that's kind of wild.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.430
So how does this work?

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.210
Or why does this work?

01:08:21.210 --> 01:08:25.854
Now, if you take other problems,
like, is a graph 3-colorable?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.790
And so what does that mean?

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.810
Well, you have three colors.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:41.580
And you're not allowed
to reuse the same color

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:45.189
on two ends of an edge.

01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:49.580
So if you put red over
here, you can put red here,

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.800
but you can't put
red here and there.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.890
And so that graph
is 3-colorable.

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:59.410
But if you had a click, then
this would not be 3-colorable.

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.439
Because you have
all these edges.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:02.899
You have three edges coming out.

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:05.700
And so clearly, the
degree from a vertex

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.420
is going to tell
you what you have.

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.270
So if you have a
4-click over there,

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.020
immediately it's
not 3-colorable.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.890
But checking whether a
graphic is 3-colorable is NPC.

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:25.800
You can use a three set
as a way of showing that.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.770
So you can say, oh, wow, maybe I
shouldn't be worried about RSA.

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:33.880
I should just be
building cryptosystems

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.210
based on 3-colorability.

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:38.380
Because it seems like a much
simpler problem than all

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:40.609
these grungy map that you
have out there-- actually,

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.490
beautiful map that
you have out there.

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:43.250
OK.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:47.550
So that's something that's a
perfectly reasonable question

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.560
to ask.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.370
And then we have Knapsack.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:55.850
Knapsack is simply you've
got a bunch of items

01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:59.290
and you just want to
figure out whether you

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:06.940
can get this particular sum
S. Knapsack is NPC as well.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.110
And you got a bunch of
weights given to you.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:17.350
And the BI are going
to have to be 0, 1.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:20.740
So you just want to discover
a particular assignment

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:24.770
of the BIs, such that you pick
the appropriate items to put

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:26.350
into the knapsack, right?

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:27.110
That's it.

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:29.830
That's a perfectly
reasonable problem

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:33.760
to potentially use as a basis
for computational hardness

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.060
to go build cryptosystems.

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.530
And people did that.

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:38.940
People did that for years.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.670
They tried and they tried.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.770
And they produced cryptosystems,
public key cryptosystems,

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:48.350
based on Knapsack
that look fantastic.

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:50.970
And they work from a
functionality standpoint

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:53.609
in the sense that you
would use this Knapsack--

01:10:53.609 --> 01:10:55.150
and I'll give you
a sense of how this

01:10:55.150 --> 01:11:01.390
is done in a minute--
problem to encrypt.

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:03.830
And then you'd use a different
kind of Knapsack problem

01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.260
to decrypt.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.240
And when you encrypt
it and decrypt it,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.100
you did get that
same message back,

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.720
except the whole world
knew what the message was.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.810
Because the problem
associated with the Knapsack

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.760
wasn't hard enough.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.540
So the computational
hardness was what

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.660
broke the Knapsack schemes.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.680
And then you come
down to asking why

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.820
is it that this problem
that's not an NPC

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.310
seems to have stood
the test of time,

01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:36.850
but all these other
problems, like Knapsack

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:39.790
and 3-colorability, which
is even worse than Knapsack,

01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:42.540
when people have built
cryptosystems based on this,

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:45.220
they've all been
broken very quickly?

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.210
And so why is that?

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:54.340
What do you think the reason
is, sort of at a high level?

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.600
What does NP-completenss say?

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.389
When we talk about complexity,
what are we worried about?

01:12:03.389 --> 01:12:04.930
Most of the time,
what are we talking

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:07.940
about when we talk about
complexity of an algorithm?

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:13.370
Or in this case, in the case
of a problem, what adjective

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:17.130
do we put in front of
runtime, for example,

01:12:17.130 --> 01:12:18.627
then we compute complexity?

01:12:18.627 --> 01:12:19.920
AUDIENCE: Worst [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.420
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
Worst case, right?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.080
Worst case.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.790
In the worst case,
you're going to be

01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:27.900
able to create
random graphs where

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.300
it takes exponential time
to discover whether they're

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.170
3-colorable or not.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:35.370
But in the average
case, all you do

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:38.010
is if you have a large
graph, if there's

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.440
one little 4-click in the
graph and you can find it,

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.500
instantly you know that
it's not 3-colorable, right?

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.360
So it turns out that's
3-colorability is

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.740
just the worst thing ever
when it comes to cryptography.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.770
Because the larger
the graph-- and you

01:12:51.770 --> 01:12:53.020
need this graph to be large.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.871
Because anything that's small,
is constant time, right?

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.370
Because so what if
it's exponential?

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:58.450
It's constant time.

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.620
So you need the
graph to be large.

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.340
When you have a random
graph that's large,

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.680
the chances you're going to
find a 4-click in a 2,000 vertex

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.120
graph is pretty high.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.770
And so if you just go scan
and look for a 4-click,

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:14.330
instantly you know that this
graph is not 3-colorable,

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.830
right?

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:19.640
So in the average case,
3-colorability is easy.

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.590
It's easy to solve
in the average case.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:26.540
And the wonderful
thing about factoring

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:29.390
is as long as the
numbers are large,

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.940
doesn't matter what
the numbers are,

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.822
it's hard to factor
in the average case.

01:13:33.822 --> 01:13:35.030
So that's the big difference.

01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.530
If you're going to take anything
away from the rest of this,

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.270
it's the difference
between problems

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:44.070
that cryptographics
systems are based on.

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:46.270
The systems that have
stood the test of time,

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:49.320
they're based on problems
that are hard on the average.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.720
And the NP-complete problems,
like the simple ones

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.600
here, are hard in
the worst case.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.290
And this is also
true for Knapsack.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:05.000
So that's the essence of it.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.450
I'll just give you a sense.

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.650
You can read the notes.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:14.140
There's a way of
generating secret keys

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:17.250
and public keys using
Knapsack that I think

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:20.800
is kind of interesting
that is worth looking at,

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.090
even though all of these
systems are broken.

01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:24.380
It's just kind of cool.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.980
You know, how would you get
encryption out of a knapsack?

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.200
I mean, you're putting
things in a knapsack

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.320
and taking things out.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.170
How can you set it up so you
get an asymmetric key system,

01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:35.657
a public key system,
through a Knapsack problem?

01:14:35.657 --> 01:14:37.240
So I'll just give
you a sense of that.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.090
And you can read.

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:39.150
I won't finish.

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:44.840
But I'd like to do what we
did here for RSA in the time

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.490
that I have left for Knapsack.

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:49.140
That is kind of cool.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:51.530
You get a sense of the variety
of different public key

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:54.760
cryptosystems that are out there
by looking at something that

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.180
is very different from RSA.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:12.140
So in the Knapsack problem,
the general Knapsack problem,

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.720
what's hard is NPC.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:24.250
There's a super increasing
Knapsack problem that's easy,

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:29.290
that can be solved
in linear time.

01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:31.960
What is a super
increasing knapsack?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.140
Well, a super
increasing knapsack

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:45.460
is something where I
Wj has this property.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:55.074
So an example of that
is 2, 3, 6, 13, 27, 52.

01:15:55.074 --> 01:15:56.490
So the rates are
super increasing.

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:58.100
2 plus 3 is less than 6.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:02.150
2 plus 3 plus 6 is less than
13 and so on and so forth.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:07.330
Do you see why super increasing
knapsack is easily solvable?

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.560
I mean, what is a knapsack?

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.960
I got a limit on
the amount of stuff

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.500
I can put into the knapsack.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:16.470
And I want to make to be able
to say yes or no in terms

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:19.120
of whether it fits
exactly or not, just

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.900
in terms of our definition.

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:25.650
So what I do here in
super increasing knapsack?

01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:26.893
Yep.

01:16:26.893 --> 01:16:29.258
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
from the biggest

01:16:29.258 --> 01:16:30.857
to the smallest [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:30.857 --> 01:16:31.940
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Exactly.

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.880
That means that there's a
linear time algorithm that

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.300
basically solves the problem.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.730
And you know that
you can do that,

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.850
and you would get
the correct answer.

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:42.840
So that's pretty
much what you've got.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.710
That'll give you
the highest weight.

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:49.100
If you have 13 exactly, you
know you can't put 52 and 27.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.170
You get 13.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:52.580
There's no point in
putting 2 and 3 and 6,

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.400
because that's not
going to give you 13.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.920
So that's clearly easy.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.827
So we've got an
interesting case here,

01:17:00.827 --> 01:17:02.410
assuming this is all
going to work out

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:05.670
from an adversarial standpoint,
which unfortunately it doesn't,

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:09.920
you can look and say, ah,
I want encryption to be

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.070
the super increasing knapsack.

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:14.730
Because that should
be easy to do.

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:21.630
And I want the decryption,
not knowing the private key,

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:23.580
to be as hard as knapsack.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.250
OK.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.999
So that's the kind of
thing that you could

01:17:25.999 --> 01:17:29.550
do if you built a cryptosystem.

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:31.550
And people did,
Merkle and Hellman.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:34.600
Hellman is the same guy, the
second name, in Diffie-Hellman.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.970
They proposed this particular
system that ended up

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.830
being broken soon after.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.410
But the idea is that you
create a private key.

01:17:46.150 --> 01:17:48.645
And the private key is a
super increasing knapsack.

01:17:54.980 --> 01:18:03.570
And then you use a
private transform in order

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:08.270
to get a-- and this is
really I put it in quotes,

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:14.725
because this was the bug--
"hard" Knapsack problem.

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:21.010
And this corresponded
to the public key.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.860
And so what you do
is you won't actually

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:32.459
have to solve Knapsack for
encryption, the hard problem.

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:34.000
The encryption would
just simply take

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.810
the public key, which
is completely public,

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:41.120
and you would create
the encryption

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.450
of a message using this
particular public key

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:49.680
in a polynomial time.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.830
But the inversion, not
knowing the private key,

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.820
you would force the
adversary to solve

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:00.050
what you think was hard
general Knapsack problem

01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:03.920
to actually break the scheme
or to get the decryption.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.210
And so let me show you
really quickly how this

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.230
works with numbers.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:11.850
And we won't have you worry
about symbols and things

01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:12.820
like that.

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.924
So just give me a couple
of extra minutes here.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.340
So let's say that
I had a message.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:26.960
Oh, before I do that, let
me look at-- let's say,

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.200
that we chose N equals
31 and M equals 105.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.750
This is actually the message.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.950
No, I'm sorry.

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:39.260
Capital M is not the message.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:43.150
These are public parameters.

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:47.900
And we're going to take--
this is a transform.

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:52.620
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:53.660
These are not public.

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:54.600
These are private.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.210
My bad.

01:19:57.210 --> 01:19:58.710
So what I'm going
to show you is I'm

01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:00.830
going to take a super
increasing Knapsack.

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.620
And that's exactly
what I have up there.

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.580
So that corresponds to
an easy Knapsack problem.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.540
I'm going to convert it using
these private parameters,

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.480
N equals 31 and M equals 105.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.310
And so our private key is our
super increasing knapsack,

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:23.720
which is 2, 3, 6,
13, 27, and 52.

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:29.920
And the public key,
what I'm going to do

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:37.310
is simply multiply each
of these, 2 times N.

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:42.950
And I'm going to take mod M.
So for each of those values,

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:46.560
I multiplied by N, which is
31, and take the mod of 105,

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:55.480
and I end up getting 62,
93, 81, 88, 102, and 37.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.250
So you can get a private
key and a public key

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:03.649
using this private transform.

01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:04.940
I'll let you look at the notes.

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.550
But basically what
happens is when

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:10.030
you take a particular
message M, what you end up

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:13.680
doing is you want to encrypt
it using the public key, which

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.690
is this quantity over here.

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:18.860
And the way you
encrypt that is simply

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:22.090
by taking a particular message.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:26.770
And let's say that the
message is written as 011000.

01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:30.880
Then all you do is
add up 93 and 81,

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.440
because those are those two.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:37.200
And you say this is going
to get encrypted by 174.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.500
So the message
encryption is simply

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:43.430
a simple operation where you
add up weights of the knapsack.

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:46.320
So you end up
getting 174 out here.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:52.250
And the hope is, of course,
that when adversary sees 174--

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:58.030
and this is the part where
things get a little iffy--

01:21:58.030 --> 01:22:00.990
that it's hard-- you have to
think about lots of numbers

01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:03.520
here, of course--
for the adversary

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:08.610
to figure out that that
174 is actually 93 plus 81.

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:10.490
OK.

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:14.470
So the diverse is not
necessarily an easy problem.

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.400
And that's exactly what
Knapsack is, right?

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.840
I tell you what the sum
is over there, which is S.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.710
And I tell you what
the weights are.

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:24.950
And it's hard for you to
figure out what the BIs are.

01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:28.550
So now you see why
this didn't work.

01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:31.650
So you have to have
a situation where

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:35.850
in the average case whatever you
produce for the ciphered text

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.685
here, you're sending out
the ciphered text according

01:22:38.685 --> 01:22:41.140
to this cryptosystem,
which is 174,

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:45.390
and you want to make sure that
the adversary can't figure out

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:47.830
that this is
actually 93 plus 81.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.480
Amazingly, people thought
they could build systems

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.770
using this assuming
these numbers were

01:22:52.770 --> 01:22:54.500
much larger than they are here.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.220
But that certainly
wasn't the case.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:59.450
Because in the average
case, you end up

01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:01.590
being able to break
these systems.

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.860
The last thing
is, of course, you

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.250
don't want to necessarily
solve the hard Knapsack

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.420
problem associated with this.

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:16.330
So what ends up happening is
you end up using N equals 31.

01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:19.470
So if you want to decrypt,
you have N equals 31

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:21.620
and M equals 105.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.240
And what you're going to do
is take this and multiply it

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:30.270
by N inverse mod M.

01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:37.200
So rather than doing times N
mod M, you divide by N mod M.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.720
And you can do this
operation relatively simply.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:46.810
And you can go back
from 174 to figuring out

01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:52.770
what the actual message was
by computing this quantity.

01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:54.280
So I'll stop there.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.720
I didn't quite get to everything
that I wanted to cover.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.460
But take a look at the notes.

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.950
Get a sense for why
the difference exists

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:04.500
between NP-complete
problems and problems that

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.260
were used in cryptosystems.

01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:10.100
And happy to stick around
and answer questions.
