00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.240
AMARTYA SHANKHA
BISWAS: Let's start.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.290
So today we're going to do
some NP hardness reductions.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.000
So let's just do a
quick recap of P and NP.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.920
So let's see.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:51.150
So P is-- so you have
a decision problem.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.010
So I have an input x and
you have some algorithm, A,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.710
and it spits out an answer,
which is either 0 or 1.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.950
So that's a decision problem.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.900
And if a problem isn't
P, this algorithm A

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.485
runs in polynomial time.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:07.410
So what about NP?

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.860
So NP is when the solution is
verifiable in polynomial time.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.952
So let's say you have an
input x and some oracle, which

00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.660
is [INAUDIBLE] run
exponential time or is

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.250
has infinite computation
time gives you an answer,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.830
so you get x and you get an
answer which is either 0 or 1.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.870
And you also get a certificate.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.250
So let's call that
a certificate.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.160
And given these
three values, you

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.270
can verify whether the
solution was correct or not

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.080
in polynomial time.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.690
Make sense?

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.400
So clearly if you're
going to compute

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.540
the answer in
polynomial time, you

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.998
can also verify in
polynomial time.

00:01:41.998 --> 00:01:44.260
So P is a subset of NP.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.490
And so that's it.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.580
So now, NP hard
problems are problems

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.620
that are at least as hard to
solve as any problem in NP.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.290
And so now today we're going
to be doing some reductions.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.400
So I think we did
some of them in class,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.150
Nintendo games or something.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.120
Is that what we did?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.140
So today we are going to do
some less interesting examples,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.960
but let's see.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.900
So how do we do reductions?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.130
So if we know that
we have a problem A,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.840
which is a hard
problem, and we want

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.550
to show that problem B is hard.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.144
So we want to draw
this implication.

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:28.810
So if we want to draw
this implication--

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.140
so this is equivalent to
saying that if B is easy,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.003
then A is easy.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:41.969
Sorry, other way.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.830
This is the counter positive.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.550
So assuming that B has a
polynomial time solution,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.310
A has a polynomial
time solution.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.080
And that statement is equivalent
to saying if A is hard,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.579
B is hard.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.510
So if you know that A
is an NP hard problem,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.870
we can say that B is
an NP hard problem.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.980
So if we want to show that
B is an NP hard problem,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.180
first we show that B
is an NP, and then we

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.850
show that B is hard.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.250
So the way do this step is--
so your A looks like this.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.120
You have your algorithm, and it
spits out an answer in 0 to 1.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.370
And B looks like this.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.523
Let's say you have an
input y and it spits out

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:32.870
an answer in 0 to 1.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.810
And you want to find a
function R which takes your x

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.980
and sends it to y.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.370
So basically, if you know how
to solve B very fast, then

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.190
you can take an input to A. So
you take x, you transform it,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.390
and then you apply
B. And the condition

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.760
is that A applied to x is the
same as B applied to R of x.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.450
So basically, what
you are doing is

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.380
you're showing that A is
easy by showing that you can

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.920
use-- so let's say B is easy.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.040
We can use B to compute
A, so then A must be easy.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.680
But since we know
that A is hard,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.500
that there's something wrong in
our logic, so B must be hard.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.765
Does that makes sense?

00:04:20.765 --> 00:04:22.250
Yes?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.030
Sort of?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.491
So let's move onto
an actual problem.

00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:33.240
So the first problem
we're going to reduce

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.710
is the Hamiltonian path.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.990
So a well-known NP hard problem
is the Hamiltonian cycle.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:52.931
So here our A is-- so
it's a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.181
So what's a Hamiltonian cycle?

00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:55.430
So what's a Hamiltonian cycle?

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.110
So a Hamiltonian cycle-- so
let's say you have a graph.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.660
So we have this graph.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.813
Let me draw this out.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.230
That's it.

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:12.860
So a Hamiltonian
cycle is a cycle

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.250
in the graph which
starts at some vertex,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.400
visits all the other
vertices, and comes back

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.090
to the starting vertex.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.820
So in this case, we could
do something like go here,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.970
and then take this vertex, take
this vertex, take this vertex,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.189
and come back here.

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:32.730
So that is a valid
Hamiltonian cycle.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.750
So this graph is a
Hamiltonian cycle.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.010
So the decision problem is
here that given the graph,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.905
does it have a
Hamiltonian cycle?

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:42.030
And that problem is NP-hard,
so you can [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.220
polynomial [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.320
So now the new
polynomial shows NP-hard,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.340
which is B is Hamiltonian path.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.340
So the Hamiltonian path
is a very similar problem.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.589
Instead of a cycle, you
remove the requirement

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:03.630
that you have to come back
to the starting point.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.290
You can just start anywhere and
[INAUDIBLE] all the vertices

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.080
and stop.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.840
So for example, if
you remove this edge,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.390
this graph no longer
has Hamiltonian cycle,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.737
but it has a Hamiltonian
path, which is just this line.

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:18.050
Simple.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.680
So this is a simple reduction
because the problems

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.060
are very similar.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.460
So the first step is,
of course, showing

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.060
that Hamiltonian path is an NP.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.280
So that should be pretty
clear because-- so what is

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.374
our certificate here?

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:37.790
So if someone says, OK, I have
solved the Hamiltonian path

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.157
and this is my Hamiltonian path.

00:06:40.157 --> 00:06:42.490
And he gives you a certificate
which is the actual path.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.440
So you can always look at the
certificate, check the path,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.070
and see if it's a valid path.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.636
And then you can verify the
answer in polynomial time.

00:06:49.636 --> 00:06:53.250
So that's the linear
time verification.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.130
So this is true.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.820
So now what we're going
to show is B is hard.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.540
So the way we do that
is we do a reduction.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.720
So the reduction is given an
input to the original problem,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.250
A. So let's say an input to
A is in the form of a graph.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.210
And now you have transformed
this graph somehow to G dash.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.800
And then you have to
argue that-- so this

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.450
is the transformation
R-- and you

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.409
have to argue that the
solution, the answer that this

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:41.200
will spit out, is the
same amount that this

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.201
would spit out.

00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:43.950
So let's look at the
transformation first.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.460
Anyone have any ideas?

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.690
So you have a graph
and you're using

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.890
that to solve the
Hamiltonian cycle problem.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.710
So how do you
transform it in a way

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.297
that lets you cast into
Hamiltonian path formulation?

00:07:58.159 --> 00:07:59.026
Yes.

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:00.067
AUDIENCE: Remove an edge?

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.680
AMARTYA SHANKHA
BISWAS: Not exactly.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.430
So which edge would you remove?

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.000
You can't find the
Hamiltonian cycle.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.480
OK, important point.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.990
So there's no point
doing this reduction

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.310
unless this reduction
is itself polynomial

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.900
because otherwise,
this whole strategy

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.170
of transforming and then using
B to find A doesn't work.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.680
Because if the reduction
is exponential time,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.820
that doesn't help you.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.460
So it--

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.876
AUDIENCE: Try
removing every edge.

00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:29.070
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: So
if you remove some edges,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.660
you'll see that there is
still a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:37.210
But you remove some
edges-- you can't tell.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.809
You don't know which
edge to remove.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.447
So a better way
to do it is this.

00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:43.280
So let's say this is
the rest of your graph.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.890
And you just look at one vertex.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.439
So look at one vertex,
V. And let's say

00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:48.480
this is a directed graph.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.430
If it's an undirected
graph, you can just

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.380
like add one edge there and
one edge back for everything.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.640
So now you add a
directed edge along this.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.140
I'm sorry.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.670
You look at all
the directed edges.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.100
So let's say you have
some edges coming in

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.540
and you have some
edges going out.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.317
So this is just a
vertex and you just

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:07.900
look at the rest of
the graph and look

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.191
at all the edges coming in
and all the edges going out.

00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:12.460
So this is in A. This
is the original problem.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:20.650
And you transform this into--
you split the vertex into two,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.340
so V dash and V
double-dash, let's say.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.940
And in one of them, you
keep all the incoming edges

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.041
and the other one contains
all the outgoing edges.

00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:35.040
Does that transformation
make sense intuitively?

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.640
So what do you have here?

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.190
So here you had-- let's say this
graph had a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.530
So this graph had
some cycle which

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.640
went up here, did something,
something, and came back.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.730
So it would go like this.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.230
It would do the
cycle and come back.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.470
So there was some cycle.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.550
And since the cycle, it contains
V, so now what you're doing

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.090
is you're splitting apart
V and disconnecting them.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.410
So you'll still have-- if you
look at the original path,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.460
it's still there, but it's
been split up into a path now.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.600
It's no longer a cycle.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.720
Make sense?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.350
So now let's argue
this more rigorously.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.540
So what we want to say
here is that let's say

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:20.955
there was a cycle here.

00:10:20.955 --> 00:10:25.400
If there was a cycle
here, then is it clear

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.060
that there is a path here?

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.012
Because just take the same
edges that you had before.

00:10:31.012 --> 00:10:32.720
If you take the same
edges, they will now

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.460
form a path instead of a cycle.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.440
So cycle implies path.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.480
Does that makes sense?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.570
So the other way is
a little more tricky.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.200
So let's say you have a path.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.050
So let's say you had a path.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:59.180
So that means that-- let's
redraw this so it's more clear.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.500
So you have this new graph where
you have two vertices, V dash

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.250
and V double-dash.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.366
This has a bunch
of incoming edges

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:10.130
and this is a bunch
of outgoing edges.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.402
So now let's say you have a
Hamiltonian path in this graph.

00:11:18.402 --> 00:11:19.360
So what does that mean?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.160
So where can the
Hamiltonian path start?

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.890
Can it start anywhere?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.420
Where can it start?

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.420
AUDIENCE: V double-dash.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.910
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: Right,
because V double point doesn't

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.780
have any incoming
edges, so it can't

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.988
be in the middle of the path.

00:11:29.988 --> 00:11:31.590
So it has a start here.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.660
So it starts.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.055
It does something in there.

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:34.930
And where can it end?

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.930
It can only end,
similarly, in V dash.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.240
Because V dash doesn't
have any outgoing edges,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.948
so it can't be in the
middle of the path.

00:11:39.948 --> 00:11:41.520
So it has to end in V dash.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.490
So now, if you have
a path like that,

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.185
and you go back to this graph--
so V dash and V double-dash

00:11:49.185 --> 00:11:50.310
are now on the same vertex.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.494
And just that path just
becomes a cycle now.

00:11:52.494 --> 00:11:53.410
So path implies cycle.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.000
So now what we have is
previously what we had, right?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.270
So now we know that A of G
here is equal to B of G dash.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.400
So G dash was transformation.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.359
Also notice that the
transformation was just

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:12.400
splitting apart a vertex.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.389
So depending on your
representation of your graph,

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:17.680
it'll take something, like
constant time or linear time

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.600
or something
polynomial, essentially.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.610
So you get a
polynomial-time reduction.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.871
After reduction, you
show that the answer

00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.870
to the reduced problem
is the same as the answer

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.230
to the original problem.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.360
And that means that this
is also an NP-hard problem

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.850
by the argument given here.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.090
Questions?

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.388
Does that make sense?

00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:38.888
Yes.

00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.098
AUDIENCE: So are you
creating two vertices

00:12:40.098 --> 00:12:41.310
for every vertex in the graph?

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.315
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS:
No, just this one.

00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:44.000
Just pick any vertex--
doesn't matter--

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.360
because you have a cycle.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.896
So if you take any vertex and
split it apart, you get a path.

00:12:48.896 --> 00:12:51.206
AUDIENCE: Oh, perfect.

00:12:51.206 --> 00:12:53.060
AMARTYA SHANKHA
BISWAS: Anything else?

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.000
OK, let's move on
to the next one.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.060
Grab a new board.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:30.700
So the next problem
is-- so given the graph,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.120
is there a k-clique?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.485
Do people know what a clique is?

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.060
So a clique is this.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.530
So a clique is a
set of vertices.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.770
So let's say C subset of
V for the set of vertices,

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.966
such that C is a complete graph.

00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:48.090
Let's just draw a diagonal.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.050
That's probably easier.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.820
OK.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.896
So in this example, so
you have this graph.

00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:09.790
This one.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.985
So look at this set of vertices.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.210
Every pair of them is
connected to each other.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.700
What that means is
that if you just

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.100
look at the graph
with these vertices,

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.430
it's a complete graph.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.850
That's what's called a clique.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.464
And in this case,
this is a 4-clique.

00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:28.380
So you have four vertices,
this is a 4-clique.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.210
So the position problem
is, given the graph,

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.247
does there exist a k-clique?

00:14:38.247 --> 00:14:40.330
So this is, again, known
to be an NP-hard problem.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:45.350
So now we will use this to show
that this problem is NP-hard.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.850
So this problem is
independent set.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.940
So again, so given the graph,
what is an independent set?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.320
Anyone want to explain?

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.900
So what an independent
set is this.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.358
So let's say you
have a graph which

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:16.310
looks like-- so kind
of complementary

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.000
to the definition of a clique.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.500
An independent set
is a set of vertices,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.710
such that no pair of them
has an edge between them.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.670
So in this case, if
you took this vertex,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.427
you took this vertex, this
vertex, and this vertex--

00:15:30.427 --> 00:15:32.010
so you can see, none
of these vertices

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.385
have an edge between them, so
that is an independent set.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:38.762
So in this case, you're
taking a set of vertices

00:15:38.762 --> 00:15:40.470
which is a complete
graph, so all of them

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.900
have edges between them.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.441
And in this case, you're taking
vertices which are completely

00:15:44.441 --> 00:15:45.560
disconnected.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.180
So now we're going to find a
reduction from this problem

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.510
to this problem.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.400
So first of all,
independent set is an NP.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.650
Is that clear?

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.120
How would you show that?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.250
So how would you create
a certificate which

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.370
would tell you that--
so how would someone

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.540
create a certificate
which would convince you,

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:08.210
in polynomial-time,
that this is correct?

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.070
So the certificate would be just
give you the independent set.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.800
And you can check if
something is independent set.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.700
So given I-- let's call the
independent set, I. So given

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.689
the set of vertices,
you can verify

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.730
that it is an independent
set in polynomial-time.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.557
So just look at
all pairs and check

00:16:25.557 --> 00:16:27.140
if there's an edge--
just an n squared

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.070
and Q whatever is polynomial.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.309
That's important.

00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:31.975
So now let's look at
our transformation.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.860
So again, as before, you have
A, which is given by a graph,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.060
and you want to
transform into something.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.630
So the important note here
is that in the clique,

00:16:47.630 --> 00:17:03.900
you have-- so for your clique
C, all the pairs of vertices

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.160
are connected.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.550
In I, no pair of
vertices are connected.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.109
So what should be a logical
transformation that would map

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.400
a clique to an independent set?

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.461
Anyone?

00:17:17.461 --> 00:17:19.294
What do you think you
should do to the graph

00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:20.730
so that the clique
becomes-- yeah.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.722
AUDIENCE: Invert the
existence of edges

00:17:22.722 --> 00:17:23.681
so they're [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:25.096
AMARTYA SHANKHA
BISWAS: Precisely.

00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:26.604
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:27.770
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: Yup.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.470
Exactly.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.970
Great.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.170
So all you have to
do is if you want

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.150
to turn a clique into
independent set, you

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:40.042
just-- what is it-- complement
the adjacency matrix.

00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:42.500
So every edge does not exist
now exists and every edge that

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.450
did exist is gone.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:50.080
So you create a graph, G dash,
with the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.750
vertices, except the edges
are now complemented.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.780
So the E bar just means
the edges that were not.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.440
So let's just draw an example.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:17.300
So let's say you had--
and what does this become?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.765
So let's draw the
vertices first.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.780
Let's go one by one.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.863
So let's take this vertex.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.770
Let's take this vertex.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.250
And what edges does it have?

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.079
So it goes here.

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:32.620
It goes here.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.040
It doesn't go here, so
we draw an edge here.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.030
It doesn't go there, so we
draw another edge there.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.582
And it doesn't go there, so
we draw another edge there.

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:42.940
Now, this vertex.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.460
It's connected to all of
these except this one.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.900
So that means that
there's an edge there.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.100
Let's take this vertex.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.455
It's connected to everything.

00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:53.160
Oh, it's connected
to everything.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.996
Let's take this one.

00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:55.870
It's connected to these
two and nothing else,

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.770
so we need to connect
it to this guy.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.120
And I think that's it.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.670
Yeah.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.380
Similarly proceeding,
this is connected

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.390
to everything except that,
so I guess this goes there.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.340
And I think that's it, right?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.920
Or is there more?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.780
Three.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.350
No, OK.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.340
So that is a complementary
graph I think.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.450
So you can probably verify that.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.660
So now let's look at the
clique in this graph.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.870
So this is the clique.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.491
This is the largest clique,
rather, but this is a clique.

00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:28.490
You could have other
cliques, like, for example,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.595
this these three things
are also a clique.

00:19:30.595 --> 00:19:32.220
So now look at what
this is mapping to.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.400
This is mapping to this vertex,
this vertex, this vertex,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.200
and this vertex.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.480
And you can see that's
an independent set.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.040
So does that
transformation make sense?

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.150
So now the proof should
be intuitively clear.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.500
So let's just go through
it moderately rigorously.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.105
So let's say you
have a clique here.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.470
So your clique here, for every
pair of vertices in the clique,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.620
there's an edge between them.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.990
And so if that maps to--
so let's say clique C maps

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:19.200
to-- let's say this maps to I.
So for all U, V element of C,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.980
you have U, V, element
of E. So if this

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.320
is a clique, for every
pair of vertices,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.240
that edge is in the
original graph, which

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:41.400
means that U, V is not an
element of E for all U, V

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.780
element of I.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.710
So for every U, V
element of I, we

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:53.520
have this, which means
that-- does that make sense?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.810
So that means that that's the
independent set criterion.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.020
So you reduced clique
to independent set.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.552
And that means that
independent set is now NP-hard.

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:03.599
OK.

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:04.640
How are we doing on time?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.710
OK.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.505
So now let's do a more
complicated example.

00:21:08.505 --> 00:21:09.630
Any questions on these two?

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.210
Make sense?

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.300
OK.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.098
So let's try this.

00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:22.066
So let's start by
erasing something.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.370
So this is the next problem.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.780
So as before, our A is k-clique.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.900
So it says there's
a clique-- rather,

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.210
let's add this in this way.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.739
Clique size greater
than or equal to k.

00:22:10.739 --> 00:22:12.030
So that's the decision problem.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.580
Is there a clique of size
greater than or equal to k?

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.460
And B is, it's called Max-2-SAT.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.570
So what that means is
that-- so it is somewhat

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:36.115
like normal 2-SAT, except
basically you have some clauses

00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:37.240
and you have some literals.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.400
So each of these literals
contain values 1 or 0.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:55.119
And each of these clauses
is something like xi or xj.

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:57.285
And actually, there can be
naughts in front of this,

00:22:57.285 --> 00:23:00.267
so let's say xi 0 xj.

00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:01.350
Or it can be other things.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:07.650
So it's xi 0 xj,
or 0 xi 0 xj, or xi

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.790
xj, and so on and so forth,
so just the normal 2-SAT.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.960
So now the decision
problem is to-- does

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:30.090
there exist an assignment, such
that greater than equal to k

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:41.000
clauses-- so that
the decision problem.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.150
So is there an assignment to
literals such that at least k

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.680
of these clauses are satisfied?

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.350
And so now we're going to
show that it is with k-clique.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.070
So again, is it an NP?

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.230
So what is the certificate?

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.460
How would someone convince you
their solution to this problem?

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.580
AUDIENCE: Give you the literals.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.790
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: Yeah,
so give you an assignment

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.782
of values to literals.

00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:10.240
And then you can go through
all the clauses and check them.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.490
So if they give you like x1
equal to 1, x2 equal to 2,

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:14.657
x equal to 0, x3 equal to
1, and so on and so forth,

00:24:14.657 --> 00:24:16.698
you can then go through
and check all the clauses

00:24:16.698 --> 00:24:18.460
and see if greater
than k are satisfied.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.280
So this is an NP.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.550
So now let's try the reduction.

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.600
So this is how the
reduction goes.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.180
Let's see.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.810
So naturally, we have
k-clique, or greater

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:29.101
than equal to k-clique, rather.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.529
So that means you have a
graph with a set of vertices

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:38.320
and a set of edges.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.240
So let's say you have a
clique, V dash, subset of V,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.570
and mod of V dash is
greater than equal to k.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.070
So now you have to
somehow construct

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.050
literals, construct
clauses, which

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.949
will reflect this behavior.

00:24:57.949 --> 00:24:59.990
So first of all, this may
not be clear right now,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.906
but let's say we take
some literals like this.

00:25:01.906 --> 00:25:07.412
So let's say we take xi
for all i element of V.

00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:11.120
So for every vertex in the
graph, we take a literal.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.760
So if the number
of vertices is n,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.900
we have n literals because it's
corresponding to each vertex.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.710
Also, we take a dummy literal.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.200
Let's call it Z.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.750
So now how do we
get our clauses?

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.680
So the general idea is that
if a vertex is in the clique,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.839
you will assign it 1.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:34.797
If it's not in the clique,
we will assign it 0.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.850
Everything outside
of the clique is 0.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:53.130
So this clause,
not xi or not xj--

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.630
so what is the value of
this clause normally?

00:25:55.630 --> 00:26:01.486
So let's say xi and xj are
both outside the clique.

00:26:01.486 --> 00:26:03.110
So i and j are both
outside the clique.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.249
That means that both of them
are 0 and so this is true.

00:26:06.249 --> 00:26:08.665
What if one of them is inside
the clique and the other one

00:26:08.665 --> 00:26:09.420
is outside?

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.510
It still is true because
one of these naughts is 1

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.370
and that is still true.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.940
Let's say both i and j
are inside the clique.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:24.110
So in that case, you have 0 of
xi is 0 and 0 of xj is also 0.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.260
That's the only case
that this is false.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.860
So the way we take
care of-- so we're

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:30.360
trying to maximize the number
of true clauses in some sense.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.240
It's like you had maybe
an explanation of why

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.730
you're using this clause.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.710
So what we do instead of
taking all the xi, xj pairs,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:42.420
is we just take xi,
xj, such that i,

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:49.532
j is not an element of E.

00:26:49.532 --> 00:26:50.490
So what does that mean?

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:59.170
So now if you had the graph
which looked like this, now

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.745
it looks like 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:27:02.745 --> 00:27:06.980
So you would take 0 x1 and 0 x4.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.980
You would take 0 x1 and 0 x3.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.380
But you would not
take 0 x2 and 0 x3.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.590
So what does that do?

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.040
That means that if you follow
the assignment according

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.130
to the clique rules-- so if i
and j are both in the clique,

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:22.884
this clause will
not be included.

00:27:22.884 --> 00:27:25.300
Does that make sense-- what
set of clauses you are taking?

00:27:28.266 --> 00:27:30.850
OK, so let's continue
and it will hopefully

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.390
be a little more clear.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:37.860
So the other sort of clause
we're going to take is xi or z.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.892
And the other one is xi or 0 z.

00:27:42.892 --> 00:27:44.350
So the reason we're
taking these is

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.020
that if you wanted to
Max-2-SAT on this alone,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.800
you can just set
everything to 0,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.350
and that would
give you a maximum.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.325
So sort of not do that--
so to sort of minimize

00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:56.700
the number of things to be
set to 0, you were doing this.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.260
So is this just some hand-wavy
argument why you're doing this.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.280
So let's actually try to
do some analysis on this.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.050
So let's say you do
this transformation.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:07.320
So do the clauses make sense?

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.080
Does the first clause sense?

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.080
So you have 0 xi, 0 xj for every
i, j which is not in the graph.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.970
So how does this work?

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:30.060
So let's say you have V dash
such that size of V dash

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.800
is greater than or equal to k.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:35.120
Actually, let's just make
size is V dash equal to k.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.720
So if you have a clique of size
greater than or equal to k,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.080
of course, you have a
clique of size equal to k.

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.270
You can just throw away
some of the vertices.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.320
So you take your V dash such
that this size is equal to k.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.140
And you set xi is equal to 1.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:59.424
So you set xi equal to 1 if
i is element of V dash 0,

00:28:59.424 --> 00:29:02.610
if i is not an
element of V dash.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.110
Make sense?

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.190
So you would set everything in
your clique to be 1, everything

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.340
outside to be 0.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.227
And let z equal to 1.

00:29:08.227 --> 00:29:09.810
So you're starting
with the assumption

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.519
that-- so you're
showing one direction.

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:13.810
You're showing that given
that there's a clique of size

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:15.270
greater than equal to k.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.690
And now you're are going
to construct a Max-2-SAT

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.028
instance which has the satisfied
number of clauses greater

00:29:21.028 --> 00:29:22.020
than equal to k.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.859
And then we'd show
the other direction.

00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:26.400
So now let's look
at how many clauses

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.400
we have to be satisfied.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:42.050
So the first type of clause
was 0 of xi or 0 of xj.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.810
So how many of these
clauses are being satisfied?

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.330
So first case, i and G
are both outside V dash.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.380
Is the clause
satisfied in that case?

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.760
Yes, because by definition,
if they're outside V dash,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.810
they're both 0, so their naughts
are both 1, so they're 1.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.090
So if the i and j are
outside V dash, you're good.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.490
So what about the case when
one of them is inside V dash?

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.490
Is the clause satisfied.

00:30:09.405 --> 00:30:13.712
Yeah, because one of them
is 0, which makes the 0 1,

00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:14.670
and the whole thing is.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.440
It's an [? arc, ?]
so it's satisfied.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.100
Let's say both of them
are inside V dash.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.040
Let's say both i and
j are inside V dash.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.130
Then this clause just doesn't
exist because of the condition

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.310
that i, j had 0 elements
of V. Because if it's

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.480
inside the clique, then
that edge obviously

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.910
exists, and therefore
this clause is not

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.790
in the set of
clauses we're using.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:36.017
So essentially, every clause
of this form will be satisfied.

00:30:36.017 --> 00:30:37.850
And how many clauses
of this form are there?

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.266
The number of
clauses of this form

00:30:39.266 --> 00:30:42.310
is just E bar, where E
is the complementary edge

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.650
set of that graph.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:45.365
That's E bar.

00:30:45.365 --> 00:30:46.240
Does that make sense?

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.100
Next clause is xi or z.

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.700
So since we have
considered z to be 1,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.220
this clause is always satisfied.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:05.290
So this just gives us
mod of V because this

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:08.630
is for every i-- I
should mention that.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.490
For i, this is also for all i.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.450
So for every i, so they all
have a number of xi's are

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.810
V, so that's it.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:23.400
So the third type of clause
is xi or 0 of v. So 0 of z,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.060
since z is 1, 0 of x is 0.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.820
So the only cases where this
clause is true is where?

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.720
Is when xi is 1.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.180
And xi is one only
inside V dash,

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.960
so the number of
clauses satisfied here

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.027
is mod of V dash.

00:31:37.027 --> 00:31:38.110
And mod of V dash is what?

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.315
It's just k.

00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:40.970
You see this?

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.110
All three clauses make sense?

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.770
Can you see why the first one
is it's the size of V bar?

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.180
Because all the
clauses are satisfied.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.950
The second one,
also all the clauses

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.400
are satisfied because z is 1.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.670
Every clause is just
the number of vertices.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.820
And the last one, it's only
satisfied for the cases

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.540
where xi is 1.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.420
And xi is 1 only
inside the clique,

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.150
so that gives you the
k things in the clique.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:17.020
So now we can finish
formulating our transformation.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.152
So our transformation
was you set--

00:32:23.152 --> 00:32:24.360
where was the transformation?

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:24.860
Yes.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.450
So these are our clauses and
now we're going to set the k.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.480
So the Max-2-SAT was
with the condition of k.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:40.930
So here you'll set it to be mod
of V bar plus mod of V plus k.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.090
So does that make sense?

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:51.170
So basically, our Max-2-SAT
problem-- so the reduction

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.060
to the Max-2-SAT problem--
so we specified the clauses.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.780
We specified the literals.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.060
Literals were xi for
all iV and the dummy z.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.100
We satisfied the clauses and
we specified the threshold

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.420
we are trying to achieve.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.450
So those three things completely
specify the Max-2-SAT problem.

00:33:13.056 --> 00:33:16.120
OK, proceeding.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.480
So we just showed one direction.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.730
We showed that if
there's a clique of size

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.480
greater than or equal
to k, we reduce this

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.040
to a size of exactly k.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.690
Then we did this
assignment and we

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:28.600
showed that the total number
of clauses being satisfied

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.460
is mod of V bar plus
mod of V plus k.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.792
And that is the first direction.

00:33:33.792 --> 00:33:36.000
So now we're showing that--
so if you have a solution

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.056
to clique, we have a
solution to k-SAT, Max-k-SAT.

00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:40.430
So now we do the
other direction.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.079
So let's say we have a
solution to Max-k-SAT.

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:46.370
Let me get this out of the way.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.930
Let's do this.

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:27.900
So let's say-- so this part
is a little more tricky.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.639
So we start with Max-k-SAT has
a number of satisfied clauses

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.380
which is greater than or equal
to mod of V bar plus V plus k.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.719
So we know that
max-SAT that accepts.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:40.291
So know that so we define.

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:41.330
We define a V dash.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:47.620
This V dash is in
the graph for clique

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:56.675
as the set of vertices i, such
that x of i is equal to 1.

00:34:56.675 --> 00:34:59.130
So if our Max-k-SAT
has that many things,

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.160
then there's some assignment
to xi which satisfies that.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.450
And we take that assignment.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.330
And for every
value that is 1, we

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.830
put that in a-- it's
not a clique yet,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.942
but it's, well, it's a
clique under construction.

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:12.650
So we make this clique
under construction

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.160
and we assign it values
of all the vertices

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.010
which are currently
labeled by 1.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.140
But we don't know that
it's a clique, right?

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.960
It could not be a clique.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.543
It could be something
like, let's say,

00:35:20.543 --> 00:35:22.610
so this is the current V dash.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.520
So V dash could be
something like you

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.720
have all these vertices
and let's say some of them

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.940
are connected.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.700
But then you have this dangling.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.270
So this is not connected.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.210
This is not connected.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.930
So it's not a clique.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:39.420
So let's say this is vertex
i and this is vertex j,

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.700
and this whole thing is V dash.

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.850
And let's say somehow
you have this anomaly.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:47.590
You have that this guy is not
connected to all the vertices.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:49.740
So let's take one such pair.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.666
And let's just say we remove xi.

00:35:54.666 --> 00:35:56.920
So we just take the xi
and remove it from V dash.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.590
What that equates to in the
Max-k-SAT is setting xi to 0.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.810
So we take the original
satisfying assignment

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.660
and change the value of xi.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:12.500
So let's see what that does.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:19.600
So we take and
set xi equal to 0.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.160
And xi was originally 1.

00:36:23.977 --> 00:36:25.185
Let's actually write it down.

00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:37.570
So xi, or rather, i, j
is not an element of E,

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:50.340
but-- so these i, j were in
the supposed to be clique,

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.370
but the i, j is not
in the edge set,

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.620
so it's not actually a clique.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.740
So the way we resolve
that is just we do this.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.240
We say, OK.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.610
Let's just forget
about this vertex.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.960
Let's say it's just
not in the clique.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.080
So we set our xi to 0.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.250
And what does that do?

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.610
Let's look at how that affects
the number of sat clauses.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:10.390
So the first one
is x [? over ?] z.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:14.410
So now here we had
not set z to be 1.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.260
This is something in thing.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.210
If z is equal to 0, we can
just replace z by 0 of z.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.600
So the clauses are
symmetrical with respect to z.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.055
So it's xi [? over ?]
z or xi 0 z.

00:37:24.055 --> 00:37:26.180
So it doesn't matter which
one is set to be 1 or 0.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.763
If one of them is
1, one of them is 0.

00:37:27.763 --> 00:37:31.170
So let's just say that z is
1 without loss of generality.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.020
So what that does is-- so
initially, this clause was 1

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.210
because z is 1.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.130
And now it goes to 1
and nothing changes.

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.600
OK, sounds good.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.790
What about the next one?

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:47.640
So now we have xi or 0 of z.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.370
So 0 of z is 0 and xi just
went from being 1 to being 0.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.630
So what happens here is that
initially, the clause value

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.490
was 1 and now it goes to 0.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.880
So that's not good
because now we

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.360
are no longer satisfying
Max-k-sat clause possibly

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.820
because we had some number
of satisfying clauses,

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.770
which was above our threshold.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.530
But now we lose a
clause and we could

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.190
be going below the threshold.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:14.390
But then we look at
the third clause.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:22.690
And what that does
is-- so let's say

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.250
we look at this specific
clause, the one which

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.450
said that xi and xj.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.732
Note that this clause
exists because xi,

00:38:30.732 --> 00:38:32.636
xj is not an edge you need.

00:38:32.636 --> 00:38:34.010
And therefore, by
that condition,

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.020
this clause exists in
the set of clauses.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.450
So what was the value of
this clause initially before?

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:43.040
In the initial assignment, what
was the value of this clause?

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:48.460
Note that i and j
are both in V dash.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:49.910
What was the value
of this clause

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.890
in the original assignment?

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.044
Before we set xi to 0?

00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:58.210
What was the value of xi
in the original assignment?

00:39:01.696 --> 00:39:03.072
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:39:03.072 --> 00:39:04.780
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS:
Yes, why is it 1?

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.700
AUDIENCE: Because
xi was in V dash.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.970
AMARTYA SHANKHA BISWAS: Yeah,
so xi was in V dash, so it's 1.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.960
xj was also in V
dash because that's

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.290
the anomaly we saw it, right?

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:15.350
There was not an
edge in the clique.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.650
So this was originally so
this was 1 and this was 1.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:18.990
So this was 9 and this was 0.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:22.390
And our R0, R0 is--
this used to be 0.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:23.850
So what happens now though?

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.130
Does it change?

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.540
It changes to 1
because xi goes to 0.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.840
Now this thing becomes 1
and so it changed to 1.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.620
So there will be
other clauses with xi,

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.990
but realize that 0 of xi-- so
if xi is changed to 0, 0 of xi

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.040
is changing to 1.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.990
So whatever happens
here, it will only

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.740
increase the number of clauses
that are being satisfied.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:47.330
So you lose only 1, but
you gain at least 1.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:51.820
So eventually, it
does not change.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.060
It does not change the
number of satisfied clauses,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.330
so that's important.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.090
So what we did is we started
with some satisfying assignment

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.580
that we assumed existed.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.130
And then we just
changed the variable

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.800
and we said that it's still
at least as many clauses

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.440
being satisfied.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.200
So we did that.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.420
And now we have one
less vertex that

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:40.240
is violating-- so now we
have one less vertex that is

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.040
violating the clique property.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.560
So now we can take this
step-- this setting xi to 0.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.560
We can just repeat this.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.790
So how long do we repeat this?

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.152
So we repeat this till there
are no longer any violations.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:57.360
So every time we find a
violation-- so once we delete

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.137
xi-- so let's this is gone.

00:40:59.137 --> 00:41:00.720
So now we look for
the next violation.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.909
The next violation is this edge.

00:41:02.909 --> 00:41:03.950
So there's no edge there.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.324
So we can either take this
vertex-- so let's call this k.

00:41:06.324 --> 00:41:08.095
So we can either
remove xk or remove xj.

00:41:08.095 --> 00:41:09.830
So we remove one of them.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.020
And once you remove that, you
will end up with the 3-clique.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.530
So what happens
is once we repeat

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:26.378
this, until V dash is a clique.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.510
Does that make sense
why you can do that?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.660
So you just keep
deleting vertices

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:34.800
until this is a clique.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.510
And those clauses plus clause
condition is still satisfied.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.670
You will still have greater than
or equal to that many clauses.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.370
So now let's look
at what we have.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:56.660
We have V dash, which is a
clique and xi is equal to-- so

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.030
once you have done this
process as many times

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.656
as you need, when
is xi equal to 1?

00:42:02.656 --> 00:42:04.780
So remember that-- so V
dash is also being updated.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.857
Every time you set xi to 0, xi
is being removed form V dash.

00:42:07.857 --> 00:42:09.440
So that property is
always satisfied--

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.560
that define V dash equal
to xi for xi equal to 1.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.930
That property's
always invariant.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.180
That means that even after
reviewing these repetitions,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:24.180
you still have xi equal
to 1, if and only if i

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:30.960
is E V dash and 0 otherwise.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.760
So does make sense why
that property is solved?

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.350
So you have a clique and
you have this assignment.

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:38.980
So that should take
you back to this.

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.940
So remember where we
took a clique of size k

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.050
and we found that if you
go through all the algebra,

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:50.310
you will find something which
is like you will go through

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:54.330
and you will get mod of E bar
plus mod of V plus mod of k,

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.540
right?

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.460
So here you have a clique.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.960
So forget about
what you did before.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.250
So just consider
this is an assignment

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.790
according to those rules.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.650
And those rules
give you that you

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:14.830
should get number
of satisfied clauses

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:22.729
is equal to mod of E bar plus
mod of V plus mod of V dash.

00:43:22.729 --> 00:43:24.145
Realize that V
dash here is not k.

00:43:24.145 --> 00:43:24.860
Does that make sense?

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.070
Because V dash is just-- so
you started with some set.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.130
You started deleting
some elements.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.129
You throw [INAUDIBLE]
randomly, but you ended up

00:43:30.129 --> 00:43:31.100
with some V dash.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.575
And by this argument,
you had E bar plus mod

00:43:34.575 --> 00:43:37.150
of V plus mod of V dash--
E bar from this clause,

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:39.560
V from this clause, V
dash from this clause.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.970
So you didn't end up with this.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.800
And you know that because
of what we showed here

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.700
does not change number
of satisfied clauses,

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.130
it's still greater
than or equal to mod

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:55.649
of E bar plus mod of V plus k.

00:43:55.649 --> 00:43:56.440
And we cancel this.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.760
You cancel this.

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:05.320
And you get mod of V dash is
greater than or equal to k,

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:10.400
which means that you have
a clique of size greater

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.940
than equal to k.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:13.440
Questions?

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:19.990
Does that make sense?

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.490
Really?

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.181
All of it?

00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:23.680
OK.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:24.880
That's good.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.850
Any case.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:29.650
So let's go back and see
what we are doing here.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.690
So the way you are doing
NP-hard reductions is

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.880
you take a problem that
you already know is hard,

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.200
you take any arbitrary
instance of that problem,

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.100
and you transform the input
into an input to the problem

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.240
that you're trying
to show is hard.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.470
So you take problem A,
which you know is hard.

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:53.260
You transform the input
into an input for problem B.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:56.150
And then you show that if you
can solve [INAUDIBLE] problem

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.346
B, you will be able
to solve problem A.

00:44:59.346 --> 00:45:01.095
But since you know you
can't solve problem

00:45:01.095 --> 00:45:03.280
A in polynomial-time, you
know that you can't solve

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.630
problem B in polynomial-time.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.770
And the other important
thing to notice

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.274
here is that the reduction
needs to polynomial-time.

00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:12.940
So look at this
reduction, for instance.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.940
What are you doing here?

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.060
You're taking every vertex.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.240
You're making a clause.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.670
And how many
clauses do you have?

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:22.640
Well, you have about n
squared clauses here.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.030
You have Rn clauses and
you have Rn clauses here.

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.840
So time to construct that
is like roughly Rn squared.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.310
So you're constructing the
clause in polynomial-time.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.660
So you have a
polynomial-time reduction.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.080
And if you reduce a
known NP-hard problem

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:38.210
in polynomial-time to
an unknown problem,

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.350
you can show that it is NP-hard.

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:40.850
OK.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:44.880
I don't think we have time to do
another problem, so we're done.
