00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:23.180
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: All
right, let's get started.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.740
Good morning everyone.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.210
I see a lot of tired faces.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.030
I'm not tired.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.930
Why are you tired?

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.130
I only lecture half the time.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.240
You guys take the
class all the time.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.640
So today's lecture is
about hash functions.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.680
And you may think that you know
a lot about hash functions,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.860
and you probably do.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.840
But what we're going to do
today is talk about really

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.990
a completely different
application of hash functions,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.700
and a new set of
properties that we're

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.190
going to require
of hash functions

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.900
that I'll elaborate on.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.459
And we're going to see a bunch
of different applications

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.700
to things like
password protection,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.220
checking the integrity
of files, auctions,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.316
and so on and so forth.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.940
So a little bit of
a different lecture.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.692
Both today and on
Thursday I'm going

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:18.320
to be going to be doing
cryptography and applications,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.380
not too much of algorithms.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.960
But we will do a little bit
of analysis with respect

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.390
to whether properties
are satisfied,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.010
in this case by hash
functions or not.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.910
So let's just dive right in.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.240
You all know what
hash functions are.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
There's no real change
in the definition.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.370
But the kinds of hash
functions that we're

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.960
going to be looking at
today are quite different

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.590
from the simple hash
functions, like taking a mod

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.950
with a prime number that
we've looked at in the past.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.680
And the notion of
collisions is going

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.980
to come up again,
except that again we're

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.600
going to raise the
stakes a little bit.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.100
So a hash function
maps arbitrary

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.539
strings-- let me do this right.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.645
So you're not making a statement
about the length of the string.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.490
You will break it up, even if
you had a string of length 512,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.830
or maybe it was 27, you do
want to get a number out of it.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.540
In a specific
range there's going

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.190
to be a number of
bits associated

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.346
with our hash functions.

00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:36.970
And previously we
had a number of slots

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.620
associated with the output
of the hash function.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100
But the input
could be arbitrary.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.080
And these arbitrary
strings of data

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.310
are going to get
mapped, as I just said,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.190
to a fixed length output.

00:02:56.282 --> 00:02:57.990
And we're going to
think about this fixed

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.590
length as being a
number of bits today,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.530
as opposed to slots
in the hash table.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.170
Because we really aren't
going to be storing

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.520
a dictionary or a hash
table in the applications

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.780
we're going to look at today.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.750
It's simply a question
of computing a hash.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.120
And because the
fixed length output

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.880
is going to be something on the
order of 160-bits, or 256-bits,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.980
there's no way that you
could store two arrays

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.370
to 160 elements in a hash
table, or even two arrays to 64

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.340
really.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.120
And so we're going
to just assume

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.880
that we're computing
these hashes

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.960
and using them for
certain applications.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800
I just wrote output
twice I guess.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.720
So map it to a
fixed length output.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.990
We want to do this in a
deterministic fashion.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.430
So once we've computed the
hash of a particular arbitrary

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.960
string that is
given to us, we want

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.150
to be able to repeat
that process to get

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.090
the same hash every time.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.070
We want to do this
in a public fashion.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.170
So everything is public.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.420
There's no secrecy.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.920
There's keyed hash functions
that we won't actually

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.210
look at today, but
maybe in passing

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.500
I'll mention it next time.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.700
We're not looking at
keyed hash functions here.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.920
There's no secrets in any of
the descriptions of algorithms

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.540
or techniques I'm going
to be describing today.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.720
And we want this to be random.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.870
We want it to look random.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.750
True randomness is going to
be impossible to achieve,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.142
given our other constraints.

00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:46.850
But we're going to
try and approximate it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.880
with pseudo-randomness.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.040
But we'd want it to
look random, because we

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.210
are interested-- as we were
in the case of dictionaries

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.030
and the regular application
of hash functions-- we

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.870
are interested in
minimizing collisions.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.570
And in fact we're going to
raise the stakes really high

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.470
with respect to collisions.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.870
We want it to be impossible
for you, or anyone else,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.210
to discover collisions.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.150
And that's going to be an
important property of collision

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.520
resistance that obviously is
going to require randomness.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.220
And those are the
three things we want,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.840
deterministic,
public, and random.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.870
And so just from a function
description standpoint

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.800
you have 0, 1 star here,
which implies that it's

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.770
an arbitrary length strength.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.830
And we want to go to 0, 1 d.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.955
And this is a
string of length d.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.250
So that means that
you're getting d-bits out

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.650
from your hash function.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.630
And here the length is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.750
So that's it.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.000
Not a lot that's new here.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.880
But a few things that are going
to be a little bit different.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.630
And there's some subtleties
here that we'll get to.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.600
I want to emphasize two things,
one of which I just said.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.570
There's no secrecy, no secret
keys here in the hash functions

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.350
that we are describing.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.250
All operations are public.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.330
So just like you had your hash
function, which was k mod p,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.220
and p was a prime and p was
public and known to everyone

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.600
who used the dictionary,
everything here

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.570
we are going to be
talking about is public.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.680
So anyone can compute h.

00:06:51.942 --> 00:06:53.400
And we're going to
assume that this

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.310
is poly-time computation--
not too surprising-- but I'm

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.700
being quite flexible here.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.720
When you look at
dictionaries, and you

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.140
think about using dictionaries,
and using it to implement

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.540
efficient algorithms,
what is the assumption

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.690
we kind of implicitly made--
are perhaps explicitly

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.810
in some cases-- with respect
to computing the hash?

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.310
Anybody?

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.710
Yeah?

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.690
AUDIENCE: Constant time?

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.023
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Constant time.

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:33.680
We assumed-- so this is not
necessarily order 1, right?

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.840
So that's important.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:42.180
So we're going to-- I want
to make sure you're watching.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.770
So you're going to raise
the stakes even with respect

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.990
to the complexity of the hash.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.459
And as you'll see, because
of the desirable properties,

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:51.750
we're going to have to do that.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.010
We're going to ask for
really a lot with respect

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.610
to these hash functions.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.350
Nobody can find a
collision, right?

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.750
And if you have something
as simple as k mod p,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.910
it's going to be trivial
to find a collision.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.710
And so these order
1 hash functions

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.380
that you're familiar
with aren't going

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.160
to make the grade with respect
to any of the properties

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.500
that we'll discuss
in a few minutes.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.962
All right, so remember this
is poly-time computation.

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:19.170
And there's lots of examples
of these hash functions.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.820
And for those of you who are
kind of into computer security

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.890
and cryptography already,
you might have heard

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:29.240
of examples like MD4 and MD5.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.260
These are versions.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.309
MD stands for message digest.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.610
These were functions that were
invented by Professor Rivest.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:42.970
And they had d equals
128 way back when-- 1992,

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.830
if I recall-- when
they were proposed.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.830
And these algorithms have
since been broken in the sense

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.490
that it was conjectured that
they had particular properties

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:59.060
of collision resistance that
it would take exponential time

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.660
for anybody to find collisions.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.490
And it still kind of
takes exponential time,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:11.040
but 2 raised to 37 is
exponential at one level,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.700
but constant in another level.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.720
So you can kind of do
it in a few seconds now.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.610
So a little bit of history.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.300
I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on this.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.400
MD5 was used to create what was
called a secure hash algorithm.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.770
This is 160-bits.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.330
And this is not quite
broken at this point.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:41.920
But that people consider it
broken, or soon to be broken.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.560
Right now the
recommended algorithm

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.260
is called SHA-3, secure hash
algorithm version three.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.870
And there was a contest
that ran for like 18 months,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.770
or maybe even longer,
that eventually was won

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.580
by what turned into the SHA-3.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.200
And they had a different name
for it that I can't recall.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.180
But it turned into SHA-3.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.220
And what happened along the
way, as we went from MD4,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.690
MD5, SHA-1 to SHA-3, is that
this amount of computation

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.810
that you had to do increased.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.570
And the complexity of
operations that you

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.690
had to do in order to compute
the hash of an arbitrary string

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.460
increased to the
point where-- you

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.720
want to think about this as
100 rounds of computation.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.780
And certainly order
d computation,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.200
where d is the number of bits.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.940
And perhaps even more.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.850
So it's definitely not order 1.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.270
So as I said a little bit
of context with respect

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.355
to the things that
are out there.

00:10:45.355 --> 00:10:46.980
At the end of the
lecture I'll give you

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.570
a sense for how these
hash functions are built.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.380
We're not going to
spend a lot of time

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.220
on creating these
hash functions.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.320
It's really a research topic
onto itself and not really

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.390
in the slope of 6.046.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.920
What is in the scope
of 6.046, and what

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.510
I think is more
interesting, which

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.690
is what we'll focus
our energy and time on,

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.990
is the properties of
these hash functions.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.640
And why these properties
are useful in a bunch

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.270
of different apps.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.100
And so what is it that we want?

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.440
We want a random oracle.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.790
We want to essentially
build something

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.960
that looks like that,
deterministic, public, random.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.390
And we're going to
claim that what we want

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.135
is this random
oracle which has all

00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.892
of these wonderful properties
that I'm going to describe.

00:11:35.892 --> 00:11:37.850
I'm going to describe
the random oracle to you,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.391
and then I'm going to tell you
about what the properties are.

00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:44.420
And then unfortunately
this is an ideal world

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.890
and we can't build
this in the real world.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.919
And so we're going to
have to approximate it.

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:52.460
And that's where the MD4's and
the MD5's and the SHA-1's came

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.200
in, OK?

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.885
So this is not
achievable in practice.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.300
So what is this oracle?

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:17.170
This oracle is on input
x, belonging to 0,1 star.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.740
So that could be an
arbitrary string.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.100
If x not in the book--
so there's this the book,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.840
all right?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.720
And there's this
infinite capacity book

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.170
that has all of the computations
that were ever done prior.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.770
And they're always
stored in the book.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.770
And that's how we're
going to get determinism.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.100
Because this book
initially gets filled in.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.380
All of the entries in
the book are filled

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.000
in using pure randomness.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.610
So you flip a coin d
times to determine h of x.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.760
So that's basically it.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.420
And you just keep flipping.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.950
You have to flip d times.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.320
And so if x was 0, you
flip d times, d was 160.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.300
You flipped a coin 160
times and got a string.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.430
If x were 1, flip 160 times,
you get a different string

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.530
with very high
probability, obviously.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.890
And so on and so forth.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.280
But what you do is
you have this book.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:29.870
So you're going to record
x h of x in the book, OK?

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.770
So at some level
your hash function

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.220
is this giant look-up
table in the sky, right?

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.480
Actually not giant, infinite
capacity look-up table

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.510
in the sky.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.230
Because you can put
arbitrary strings into this.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:47.910
And if it's in the book-- this
is obviously the important part

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.740
that gives you determinism--
then you return y,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:58.700
where x and y are
in the book, OK?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:05.040
So you get a random
answer every time,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.380
except as required
for consistency

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.180
with previous answers.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.930
So the very first
time you see a string,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.730
or-- and the whole world
can create this book.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:17.740
It's public.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:22.430
So if I created the book at
first with a particular string,

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.710
let's say Eric.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.120
I was the string.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.960
And I'm the one who put
the entry-- x equals Eric,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.040
and h of x, h of Eric equals
some random 160-bit string--

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.640
into the book, I get
credit for that, right?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:43.650
But if you come a nanosecond
later and ask for h of Eric,

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.090
you should get exactly
what got put into the book

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.850
when I asked for h of Eric.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.290
And so on and so forth.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.050
So this is true for everybody.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.810
So this is like-- I mean
basically impossible to get.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.770
Because not only can
anybody and everybody query,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.190
you have to have this
ordering associated

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.450
with people querying the book.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.330
And you have to
have consistency.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:11.990
All right.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.990
So everyone convinced
that we can't build this?

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.710
All right.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.660
If you took anything
out of this lecture,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.011
that's what you should take.

00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:20.510
No, no.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.290
There's a lot more.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.750
So we want to approximate
the random oracle.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:28.840
And we're going to get to that.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.767
Obviously we're going to have to
do this in poly-space as well.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:35.850
So what's wrong with this?

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.810
Of course this picture is
I didn't actually say this,

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.320
but you'd like things to be
poly-time in terms of space.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.210
You don't want to store
an infinite number-- this

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.649
is worse than poly-time,
worse than exponential time,

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:51.190
because it's arbitrary strings
that we're talking about here,

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.920
right?

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.940
So you can't possibly do that.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.350
So we have to do
something better.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.180
But before I get into how we'd
actually build this, and give

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.346
you a sense of how SHA-1
and MD5 were built--

00:16:04.346 --> 00:16:06.220
and that's going to come
a little bit later--

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.910
I want to spend a lot of time
on the what is interesting,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.630
which are the
desirable properties.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.640
Which you can kind of see
using the random oracle.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.690
So what is cool about
the random oracle

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.140
is that it's a simple algorithm.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.060
You can understand it.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.410
You can't implement it.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.130
But now you can see what
wonderful properties

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.230
it gives you.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.350
And these properties are
going to be important

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.490
for our applications, OK?

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.146
And so let's get started with a
bunch of different properties.

00:16:36.146 --> 00:16:37.520
And these are all
properties that

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:43.030
are going to be useful for
verification or computer

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.850
security applications.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:51.100
The first one, it's not ow,
it's O, W. It's one-wayness,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:51.780
all right?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.930
So one-way, or one-wayness.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:17:03.230
And it's also called-- you're
not going to call it this--

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:09.390
but perhaps this is a more
technical term, a more precise

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.150
term, pre-image resistance.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.060
And so what does this mean?

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.167
Well this is a very
strong requirement.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:16.750
I mean a couple of
other ones are also

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.990
going to be perhaps stronger.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.270
But this is a pretty
strong requirement

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:28.710
which says it's
infeasible, given y,

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:45.170
which is in the-- it's basically
a d-bit vector, to find any x

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:50.950
such that h of x equals y.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:18:00.120
And so this is x is
the pre-image of y.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.580
So what does this say?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.400
It says that I want to
create a hash function such

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.030
that if I give you
a specific-- we call

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:12.870
it a 160-bit string, because
we're talking SHA-1 here,

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.792
and that's the hash--
I'm going to have,

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:18.250
it's going to have
to be impossible

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:25.430
for me to discover an x that
produced that 160-bit string,

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.390
OK?

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.100
Now if you go look
at our random oracle,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.750
you realize that if you
had a 160-bit string,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.970
and perhaps you
have the entire book

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.290
and you can read
the entire book.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.940
It's an infinite capacity book.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.750
It's got a bunch of stuff in it.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.800
And know that any time anyone
queried the book the first time

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.580
for a given x, that there was
this random 160-bit number that

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.700
was generated and
put into the book.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.100
And there's a whole lot
of these numbers, right?

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.954
So what's going to
happen is, you're

00:18:59.954 --> 00:19:01.870
going to have to look
through the entire book,

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.710
this entire potentially
infinite capacity book,

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:13.500
in order to figure out if this
particular y is in the book

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.660
or not.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.310
And that's going to take a long
time to do, potentially, OK?

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.290
So in the case where you
have a random oracle you'd

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:27.660
have to go through and find--
looking at the output hash

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.502
corresponding to each of the
entries in the random oracle,

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:32.960
you're going to start matching,
match, match, match, match,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.290
it's going to take
you exponential time.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.760
Well actually worse than that,
given the infinite capacity

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.930
of the book.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.970
So this clearly gives you that.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.070
Now you may not be a completely
satisfied with that answer

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.620
because you say well,
you can't implement that.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.410
But we'll talk a
little bit, as I said,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.410
about how you could
actually get this.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.510
But what's-- I should be
clear-- is that the simple hash

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:59.180
functions that we've looked
at in the past just to build

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.570
dictionaries do not
satisfy this, right?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:11.860
So suppose I had h of x
equals x square mod p.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:18.050
Is this one-way,
given a public p?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.210
No of course not, right?

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.310
Because I'm going to be--
it's going to be easy

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.730
for me to do something.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.320
Even though this is discrete
arithmetic I could do something

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.670
like, well, I know that what
I have here-- actually let's

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.170
do it with something
that's simpler,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.580
and then I'll talk
about the x squared.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.650
If I had something
as simple as x mod p,

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.100
I mean that's trivially broken
in terms of one-wayness.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.900
Because I know that h of x could
be viewed as the remainder.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.870
So anything-- if this
is h of x, and let's

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.310
just call that y for a
second, because that's

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.280
what we had it out there.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.340
Something that's a multiple
of y plus the remainder-- so I

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.777
could have a-- is that right?

00:21:02.777 --> 00:21:03.610
Is that what I want?

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.109
Yeah.

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:05.050
No, plus y.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:13.760
So I want a of-- well since
I can't figure it out,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.250
why can't you?

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.970
What do I need to
put in there in order

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:24.170
to discover an x that
would produce a y?

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.290
Can I write an equation?

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.192
Yeah?

00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:27.967
AUDIENCE: Could you
just write y itself?

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:29.300
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Just y itself.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:29.960
That's right.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.900
Good point.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.635
Just y itself in this case.

00:21:32.635 --> 00:21:33.820
Good.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.650
I knew you guys were
smarter than me.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.060
This proves it.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.500
So if you just take
y-- and y remember

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.190
is going to be something
that's 0 to p minus 1, right?

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.520
And that's it.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.170
It just goes through, right?

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.150
So that's a trivial
example, right?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.780
Now if I put x squared in
here, obviously it's not y,

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:03.050
but I could start looking
at-- what I have here is

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.280
I'm going to get y that
looks like x squared.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.220
But I could take
the y that I have,

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.240
take the square root
of that, and then start

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.570
looking for x's that give
me the y that I have.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:18.020
Actually it's not a complicated
process to try and figure out,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.230
through trial and
error potentially,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.250
what an x is that
produces a particular y

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.360
for the kinds of hash
functions that we've

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.900
looked at, all right?

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:32.050
Now as you complicate this
equation it gets harder.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.626
Because you have to invert
this set of equations.

00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:36.000
And that's what
the game is going

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.620
to be when you go create
one-way hash functions.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.520
The amount of computation
that you do in order

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.770
to compute the y is going
to increase to the point

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.770
where, as I mentioned, you have
80, 100 rounds of computation,

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.400
things getting mixed in.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.210
And the hope is that you create
this circuit, if you will,

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.970
that has all this
computation in that.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.170
Going forwards is
easy, because you've

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.350
specified the
multiplications and the mods

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.700
and so on and so forth.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.830
But not all of these operations
have simple inverses.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.790
And going backwards,
which is what

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.010
you need to do in order
to break one-wayness,

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.890
or discover the x
given a y, is going

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.100
to be harder and harder
as the computations get

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.890
more complex, OK?

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.905
So everyone have a sense
of what one-wayness is?

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.990
So that's one-wayness.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.930
There's four other properties,
two of which are very related.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.700
CR and TCR.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.550
So CR is collision resistance.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:54.290
It's infeasible to find x and
x prime such that x not equal

00:23:54.290 --> 00:24:02.269
to x prime, and h of
x equals h of x prime,

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:03.560
which is of course a collision.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.690
OK?

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.790
And that just says you have
this crazy hash function where

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.650
you can't discover collisions.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.620
Well it would be
absolutely wonderful.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.740
In fact that's what we wanted
when we built dictionaries.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.290
But why don't we use
SHA-3 in dictionaries?

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.350
Why don't we use
SHA-3 in dictionaries?

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:30.851
Yeah?

00:24:30.851 --> 00:24:33.058
AUDIENCE: Because it's more
complicated than we need.

00:24:33.058 --> 00:24:35.270
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yeah,
it's horribly slow, right?

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.365
It would take longer to
compute the hash than access

00:24:39.365 --> 00:24:40.740
the dictionary,
when you actually

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:44.847
had a reasonable dictionary
that maybe had some collisions.

00:24:44.847 --> 00:24:46.930
I mean you just go off and
you have a linked list,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:50.090
you can afford a few collisions,
what's the big deal, right?

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.860
So it just doesn't
make any sense

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:57.420
to use this level of
heavyweight hash function,

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.830
even if it satisfies
collision resistance-- which

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.070
some of these are conjectured to
do-- for the applications we've

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.617
looked at.

00:25:04.617 --> 00:25:06.950
But there'll be other apps
where collision resistance is

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.520
going to be important.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.110
So that's collision resistance.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:15.470
And then there's-- TCR is
target collision resistance.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.300
It's a weaker form--
so sometimes people

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.190
CR strong collision resistance,
and TCR weak occlusion

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.810
resistance.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.090
We'll use CR and TCR here.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:35.460
And this says it's
infeasible, given

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:39.200
x-- so there's a
specific x that you

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.590
want to find a collision
for, as opposed

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:45.360
to just finding a pair that
goes once to x and x prime.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.700
And any pair would suffice to
break the collision resistance

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.560
property.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.630
But TCR says is I'm going
to give you a specific x.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.750
And I want you to
find an x prime who's

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.050
hash collides with
the hash of x, OK?

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.065
That's TCR.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:18.082
OK that's TCR for you.

00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:20.040
And that just to be clear,
I think you probably

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.420
all got this, obviously
we want this here

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.340
because we have a
deterministic hash function.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.430
And it's a trivial thing
to say that if you had x,

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.380
and you had x again, that you
get the same hash back from it.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.740
That's a requirement, really.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.670
So we want two distinct x
and x primes that are not

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.590
equal that end up colliding.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.890
That's really what
a collision is.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.200
And so you see the difference
between CR and TCR?

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:44.700
Yup?

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.812
Yeah?

00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:49.144
AUDIENCE: Are we to
assume that given an x

00:26:49.144 --> 00:26:51.105
it's very easy to
get the h of x back?

00:26:51.105 --> 00:26:52.480
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
So the question

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.150
was, given an x, it's poly-time
computation to get h of x.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.230
Absolutely.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.480
Public poly-time computation
given an x to get h of x.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.840
So going this way is easy.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:15.170
Going this way-- I ran
out of room-- hard.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.954
OK?

00:27:16.954 --> 00:27:20.160
AUDIENCE: So does that mean that
TCR is basically the same as 1?

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.230
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: No,
no, no, absolutely not.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.890
TCR says it's OK.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.620
You can compute this.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.030
You can get x.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.720
And you can get h of x.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.125
So given x, you know
that you can get h of x.

00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:35.000
I didn't actually put
that in the definition.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.800
And maybe I should have.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.860
So given x you can
always get h of x.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.080
Remember that.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.640
It's easy to get h of x.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.350
So any time I say given
x, you can always add it,

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.400
saying given x and h of x.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.690
So I'm given x.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.960
I'm given h of x.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.600
I obviously need to
map-- I need to discover

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.080
an x prime such that h of
x prime equals h of x, OK?

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.490
Now you have situations
where for-- it

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.920
may be the case that
for particular x's you

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.900
can actually do this.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.363
And that's enough to break TCR.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.640
So you have to have
this strong property

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:22.520
that you really don't want to
find collisions are for some--

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.470
even if there's a constant
fraction of x's that

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.210
break the TCR property, you
don't like your hash function,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.710
OK?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.850
Because you might end
up picking those and go

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.490
build security applications
using those properties.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.990
I want to talk a little
bit about the relationship

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.240
between OW, CR, and TCR.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.700
So I'm going to
get back to that.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.290
And we're going to talking
about hash functions that

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.076
satisfy one property but
don't satisfy the other.

00:28:48.076 --> 00:28:49.700
And I think your
question will probably

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.150
be answered better, OK?

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.460
Thanks for the question.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.160
So those are the main ones.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.260
And really quickly, if you
want to spend a lot of time

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.972
on this-- but I do
want to put up--

00:29:02.972 --> 00:29:05.320
I think I'll leave
these properties up here

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.590
for the duration.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.350
Because it's important for you
to see these definitions as we

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.580
look at the
applications where we

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.090
require these properties, or
a subset of these properties.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.580
But that we have
pseudo randomness.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.910
And this is simply a
function of the fact

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:31.100
that-- so this is PRF-- we know
we can't build a random oracle.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.300
And so we're going to have to do
something that's pseudo-random.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.840
And basically what
we're saying here

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:45.870
is the behavior is
indistinguishable from random.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:56.140
So we're going to have to use
non-linearity, things that

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.730
are called non-linear
feedback shift registers,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.370
to create pseudo-random
functions.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.710
There's many ways that we can
create pseudo-random functions.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:05.310
We won't really get into that.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.680
But obviously
that's what we want.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:14.420
And then the last
one is a bit tricky.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.830
And we will have an app that
requires this way at the end.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:29.240
But this is infeasible
given h of x

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:42.010
to produce h of x prime, where
x and x prime are-- and it gets

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:50.150
a little bit fuzzy here-- are
related in some fashion, right?

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.630
So a concrete
example of this is,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:59.770
let's say that x
prime is x plus 1.

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.630
So this is a reasonable
example of this.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:09.930
So what this says is
you're just given h of x.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.680
It doesn't actually say
anything about one-wayness yet.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.670
But you could
assume, for example,

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.510
that if this was a
one-way hash function,

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.581
that it would be possible to
get x from h of x, correct?

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.070
And let's keep that though.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.470
Hold that thought, all right?

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.290
We're going to get back to it.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:36.710
So if I'm just given the hash
through some computation,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.300
it may be possible for me
to create another hash, h

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.330
of x prime, such that
there's some relationship

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:51.010
that I can prove or argue
for between the strings that

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:54.390
created the hashes,
namely x and x prime, OK?

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.330
That's what
malleability is, right?

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:03.440
Now you might just go off and
say here's an x, here's a y,

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:07.700
here's h of x,
and here's h of y.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.620
These look completely random.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.890
And you might go off-- I'm
being facetious here-- I

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.767
say that y is x's third cousin's
roommate's brother-in-law

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:18.600
or something, right?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.600
I mean just make
something up, right?

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.470
So clearly there's got to be
a strong, precise relationship

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:27.780
between x and y.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:32.180
If in fact you could
do this and get y

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.160
equals x plus 1, that'd
be a problem, right?

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.840
But if you are--
and then you can

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.280
do this sort of consistently
for different x's and y's, that

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.980
would absolutely be
a problem, right?

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.440
But what you're really
asking for-- and typically

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.710
when you want
non-malleability-- it's

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.000
things where you have
auctions, for example, where

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.350
you are to be careful about
making sure that you don't want

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.320
to expose your bid.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.700
And so maybe what you're
doing is exposing h of x.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.960
You don't want somebody
to look at your h of x

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.420
and figure out how
they could beat

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:13.540
your bid by just a little bit.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.140
Or in case of Vickrey auctions,
where the second highest bidder

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.031
wins, now just be a little
bit below you, right?

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.530
So that's the kind
of thing that you

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.110
want to think about when it
comes to non-malleability,

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.880
or malleability, where you
want a strong relationship

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.300
between two strings
that are related

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.510
in some ordered fashion,
like x equals-- x prime

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.950
equals x plus 1, or just
x prime equals 2 times x.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:43.040
And you don't want
to be able to-- you

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.350
don't want the adversary
to be able to discover

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.670
these new strings.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.440
Because that would be
the system, all right?

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.580
So any questions
about properties?

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.620
Are we all good on
these properties?

00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.840
All right, because I'm
going to start asking you

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.010
how to use them for
particular applications,

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:09.170
or what properties are required
for certain applications, OK?

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.150
One last thing
before we get there.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:16.960
I promised a slightly
more detailed analysis

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.170
of the relationships
between these properties.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:20.974
So let's do that.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.830
Now if your just look
at it, eyeball it,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:34.888
and you look at collision
resistance and TCR,

00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:36.429
what can I say about
the relationship

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.820
between CR and TCR?

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.953
If h is CR, it's going
to be TCR, right?

00:34:45.953 --> 00:34:46.744
It's got to be TCR.

00:34:46.744 --> 00:34:48.735
It's a strictly
stronger requirement.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.415
But not reverse.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:04.230
And you can actually
give a concrete example

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.077
of a particular hash
function that is TCR.

00:35:07.077 --> 00:35:08.160
I'm not going to go there.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.659
It's actually a
little more involved

00:35:09.659 --> 00:35:12.780
than you might think it is,
where a TCR hash function is

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.430
not collision resistant.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.180
But you can see that
examples such as these

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.340
should exist, simply because I
have a more stringent property

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.280
corresponding to
collision resistance

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.680
as opposed to TCR, right?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.170
So if you're interested in
that particular example,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.780
you're not responsible for
it, get in touch with me

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.545
and I'll point you to a,
like a three-page description

00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:34.180
of an example.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.930
So I didn't really
want to go in there.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:40.170
But what I do want to do is talk
about one-wayness and collision

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.820
resistance.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.069
Because I think that's
actually much more interesting,

00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.720
all right?

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:59.060
So if h is one-way--
any conjectures

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.370
as to what the question
mark is in the middle?

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:07.950
Can I make strong statements
about the collision resistance

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.430
of a hash function,
if I'm guaranteed

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.010
that the hash function I have
is a one-way hash function,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:14.730
or vice versa?

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.080
Another way of
putting it is, can you

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:28.970
give me an example of,
just to start with,

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:35.096
a hash function which is
one-way but not TCR, not

00:36:35.096 --> 00:36:36.220
target collision resistant?

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.540
So I'm going to try and
extract this out of you.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.870
This is somewhat subtle.

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:48.990
But the way you want
to think about this

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:59.260
is, let's say that h
of x is OW and TCR, OK?

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.660
And so I have a bunch of inputs.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:03.660
And this is the output.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.160
And I get d-bits out.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.010
And I've got x1, x2, to xn, OK?

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.620
Now I've given this h--
I've been given this h which

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.240
is one-way and TCR.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.960
It satisfies those properties
that you have up there.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.590
In the case of one-way, I give
you an arbitrary d-bit string.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.770
You can't go backwards and
find a bunch of the xi's that

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:34.150
produce exactly that
d-bit string, all right?

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.530
So it's going to be
hard to get here.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.380
But you're allowed now
to give me an example.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.390
So this is some hash
function that you can create,

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.300
which may use h as well.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.780
And h is kind of nice because
it has this one-way property.

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.030
So let's say that we want
to discover something where

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.080
one-way does not imply TCR.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.490
So I want to cook up a
hash function h prime such

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:09.550
that h prime is one-way,
but it's not TCR, OK?

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.610
The way you want to think about
this is you want to add to h.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.790
And you want to add something
to h such that it's still hard--

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:20.347
if you add h it's still hard
to go from here to there.

00:38:20.347 --> 00:38:21.680
Because you've got to go deeper.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:23.760
If you add to, for
example, the inputs of h.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.170
Or you could add to the
outputs of h as well,

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.730
or the outputs of the current h.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:34.670
But you can basically go deeper,
or need to go deeper in order

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:39.580
to find the break
one-wayness, in order

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.820
to find an x, whatever you have,
that produces the d-bit string

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:44.910
that you have, right?

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:49.690
So what's a simple way of
creating an h prime such that

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.700
it's going to be pretty easy to
find targeted collisions even,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.150
not necessarily collisions,
it's pretty easy to find

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.740
targeted collisions,
without breaking

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.180
the one-way property of h?

00:39:03.785 --> 00:39:05.264
Yeah?

00:39:05.264 --> 00:39:11.673
AUDIENCE: So if you have
x sub i, if i odd then

00:39:11.673 --> 00:39:14.631
return h of x of i.

00:39:14.631 --> 00:39:16.603
So that's minus 1.

00:39:16.603 --> 00:39:18.552
So return the even group.

00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:19.510
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Sure.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.004
Yep.

00:39:21.004 --> 00:39:24.241
AUDIENCE: Given
x any x of i, you

00:39:24.241 --> 00:39:27.478
can usually find another x of
i that was the same output?

00:39:27.478 --> 00:39:28.980
You can go backwards.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.700
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: You
can't go backwards.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.500
Yeah, that's good.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:31.450
That's good.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.114
I'm going to do something that's
almost exactly what you said.

00:39:34.114 --> 00:39:35.655
But I'm going to
draw it pictorially.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.705
And what you can do, you can
do a parity, like odd and even

00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:43.705
that was just described.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.440
And all I'll do is add
a little [? XNOR ?]

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:55.240
gate, which is a parity
gate, to one of the inputs.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.830
So you have and b here.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:01.010
So I've taken x1, and
I have a and b here.

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:04.560
So I've added-- I can
add as many inputs

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.190
as I want to this function.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.830
Oh I should mention
by the way, h of x

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.290
is working on arbitrary strings.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.630
And obviously I
put in some number

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.774
here that corresponds to
n, which is a fixed number.

00:40:16.774 --> 00:40:19.190
So you might ask, what the
heck happened here with respect

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.610
to arbitrary strings?

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.570
And there's two answers.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.000
The first answer is,
well, ignore arbitrary.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.350
And assume that you
only have n-bit strings.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:29.370
And n this is really
large number, right?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.500
And that may not be
particularly satisfying.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.220
The other answer is,
which is more practical,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.850
which is what's
used in practice,

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.140
is that typically
what happens is,

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:41.000
you do have particular
implementations

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.180
of hash functions that
obviously need to have

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.440
fixed inputs, n, for example.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.110
And n is typically 512.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.680
It's usually the block size.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.940
And you chunk the input up
into five 12-bit blocks.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.770
And typically what
you do is, you

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.800
take the first five 12-bits,
compute the hash for it.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.280
And then you can do it
for the remaining blocks.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.530
And then you can hash all
of them together, all right?

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.872
So there's typically
more invocations.

00:41:06.872 --> 00:41:08.330
I don't really want
to get into it.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.370
But there's typically
more invocations of h

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:15.600
when the input would be 2 times
n, or 3 times n, all right?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.410
So we don't really
need to go there

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.960
for the purposes
of this lecture.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.270
But keep that in mind.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.750
So we'll still stick with our
arbitrary string requirement.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.410
So having said that, take
a look at this picture.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.190
And see what this
picture implies.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.340
I have an h prime that
I've constructed, right?

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.720
Now if I look at h
prime, and I give you

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.270
an output for h prime--
so h prime now has,

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:45.640
it's a function of a and b, and
x2 all the way to xn, right?

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.850
So it's got an extra input.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.630
If I look at h prime, and I look
at the output of h prime that

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:56.280
is given to me, and I need
to discover something that

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.280
produces that, it is pretty
clear that I need to figure out

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.400
what these values
are, all right?

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.930
And I need to know what
the parity of a and b is.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:09.293
And maybe I don't need to
know exactly what a and b are,

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.626
but I absolutely need to know
what the parity of a and b

00:42:11.626 --> 00:42:13.230
are, because that's x1.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.490
And the one-way I'd
break would require

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:17.670
me to tell you what
the value of x1 is,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.070
and the value of x2,
and so on and so forth.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.640
So it's pretty clear that
h prime is one-way, right?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.520
Everybody buy that?

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.870
h prime is one-way.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:30.160
But you know what?

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.860
I've got target
collisions galore, right?

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.360
All I have to do is flip-- I
have a equals 1 and b equals 1.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.770
And I have a equals
0 and b equals 0.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.350
They're going to give
me the same hash, right?

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.690
So trivial example,
but that gets

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:50.070
to the essence of the difference
between collision resistance

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.290
and one-wayness, target
collision resistance

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.210
and one-wayness, all right?

00:42:54.210 --> 00:43:03.710
So this is one-way but not TCR,
simply because a equals 0, b

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:06.500
equals 0 for
arbitrary x's produce

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:11.200
the same thing as a equals
1 and b equals 1, right?

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.940
So those are collisions.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.690
So admittedly contrived.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.350
But it's a counterexample.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.150
Counterexamples
can be contrived.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.510
It's OK.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:24.710
All right.

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.470
So that was what
happens with that.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:32.400
Let's look at one
more interesting thing

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.150
that corresponds to
the other way, right?

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:46.030
So what I want to show is that a
TCR does not imply one-wayness.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.122
OK, so now I want an
example where it is clear

00:44:03.122 --> 00:44:05.580
that I have target collision
resistance, because I can just

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.370
assume that.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.310
And we're going to
use the same strategy.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.550
I'm just going assume
that I have an h that's

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.240
target collision resistant.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.250
And I'm going to try and cook up
an h prime that is not one-way.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:21.080
So I'm going to assume that
in fact h is TCR and OW.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.420
And I'm going to take away
one of the properties.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.060
And if I take it one
of the properties

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.350
I have a counterexample, right?

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:34.320
So think about how
you could do this.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.355
You have h as before.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:46.330
And I want to add
some stuff around it

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:52.820
such that it's going to be
easy to discover-- for a large,

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.610
for a constant
fraction of hashes

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.430
that I've given to me,
not for any old hash.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.000
Because you can always
claim that one-wayness

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.360
is broken by saying I have
x, I computed h of x, now

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.780
I know what-- given h
of x I know what x is.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.970
I mean you can't do that, right?

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.360
So that's not breaking
the one-wayness of it.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.420
It's when you have
an h of x and this

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.250
is the first time
you've seen it,

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:20.660
you're trying to find
what x is, right?

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.370
So how would you-- how
would you set it up

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:28.230
so you break the
one-wayness of h

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:31.310
without necessarily breaking
the target collision

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:37.430
resistance of the overall hash
function that you're creating?

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.339
And you have to do something
with the outputs, OK?

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:42.380
You have to do something.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.671
This is a little more involved.

00:45:43.671 --> 00:45:45.734
It's not as easy
as this example.

00:45:45.734 --> 00:45:46.900
It's a little more involved.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.920
But any ideas?

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.761
Yeah, go ahead.

00:45:52.761 --> 00:45:55.707
AUDIENCE: So x is
less than b returns x.

00:45:55.707 --> 00:45:57.964
If x is greater than
b, return [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:57.964 --> 00:45:59.130
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Beautiful.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:45:59.460
Right.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.970
What color did
you get last time?

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:02.150
AUDIENCE: Blue.

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.050
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: You
got a blue last time?

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.800
All right.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.890
Well you get a purple.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.190
You have a set.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.220
Actually we have these red ones
that are precious, that are--

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.780
no, we don't.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.479
We chose not to do red.

00:46:14.479 --> 00:46:15.020
I don't know.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.370
There was some
subliminal message

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.750
I think with throwing red
Frisbees that we didn't like.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.380
But OK.

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:22.550
So thank you.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:33.260
And h of x is simply
something where

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.360
I'm going to concatenate
a zero to the x value

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.660
and just put it out.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.810
And clearly this is
breaking one-wayness

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.610
because I'm just taking the
input, I'm adding a zero to it,

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:44.730
and shipping it out.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:46.900
So it's going to be easy
to go backwards, right?

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:53.500
And this only happens
if x is less than n,

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.460
as the gentleman just said.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:47:00.220
Less than or equal to n in
terms of the input length, OK?

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.131
Otherwise I'm
going to do h of x.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.160
So this is good news.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.400
Because I'm actually using
the hash function in the case

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.890
where I have a
longer input string.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:20.660
This is bad news for
one-wayness because I'm just

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.010
piping out the input.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:30.927
And so if I get an x, and I
see what the x is out here,

00:47:30.927 --> 00:47:32.510
and let's just say
for argument's sake

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:38.480
that-- you could
even say that n is

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:43.330
going to be something
that is less than d,

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.210
which is the final
output, which has d-bits.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.090
And so if you see something
that h prime produces

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.450
that's less than
d-bits you instantly

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:54.030
know that you can go
backwards and discover

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.186
what input produced that
for the h prime, right?

00:47:57.186 --> 00:47:59.060
Because you just go off
and you go backwards.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.350
This is what it tells you.

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.850
Now on the other
hand if it's larger

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.160
obviously you can't do that.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.770
But there's a whole
lot of combinations

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.100
that you can do that for.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:11.300
So this breaks one-wayness, OK?

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.074
Now you think about TCR.

00:48:13.074 --> 00:48:14.490
And what you want
a show of course

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.570
is that this maintains TCR.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.622
So that's the last thing
that we have to show.

00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:22.080
We know that it
breaks one-wayness.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.182
But if it broke TCR we don't
quite have our example.

00:48:25.182 --> 00:48:26.640
So we want to show
that it actually

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.220
maintains TCR, which is
kind of a weakish property

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.440
that we need to maintain.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.890
And the reason
this maintains TCR

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:39.290
is that there's really only
two cases here obviously,

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:41.720
corresponding to
the if statement.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:49.280
And it's pretty clear that if
x is less than or equal to n,

00:48:49.280 --> 00:49:03.520
clearly different x's produce
different h prime x's, correct?

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:06.620
Because I'm just passing
along the x out to the output.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:09.730
So if x is less than n I am
going to get different hashes

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.570
at the output.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:12.350
I'm just passing them out.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.940
So that's easy.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.490
And for the other case,
well I assume that h of x

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.129
was CCR, correct?

00:49:20.129 --> 00:49:22.420
Because that was the original
assumption, that I had h,

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.540
which was CCR.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:30.690
So in both cases TCR is
maintained because else h

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:38.350
of x maintains TCR, all right?

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.284
So again, a bit of
a contrived example

00:49:41.284 --> 00:49:42.700
to show you the
difference between

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.510
these different properties so
you know not to mix them up.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.630
You know what you
want to ask for,

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:51.150
what is required
when you actually

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.870
implement an
application that depends

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.000
on particular properties.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.230
All right?

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.010
Any questions so
far about properties

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.040
or any of these examples?

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.227
We're going to dive
in to using them.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.510
OK.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:12.170
So start thinking
computer security.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:18.090
Start thinking hackers,
protecting yourself

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.655
against the bad guys
that are out there who

00:50:20.655 --> 00:50:22.640
are trying to discover
your passwords,

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.924
trying to corrupt
your files, generally

00:50:24.924 --> 00:50:25.965
make your life miserable.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:38.880
And we'll start out with
fairly simple examples, where

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.730
the properties are
somewhat obvious,

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:46.205
and graduate to this auction
bidding example which

00:50:46.205 --> 00:50:48.080
should be sort of the
culmination of at least

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.120
this part of the lecture.

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.470
And depending on
how much time I have

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.800
I'll tell you a
little bit about how

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.730
to implement hash functions.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.640
But I think these
things are more

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.580
important from a
standpoint of giving you

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.610
a sense of cryptographic hashes.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.380
All right.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.970
Password storage.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:16.730
How many of you write your
password in an unencrypted text

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:22.230
file and store it in
a readable location?

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:24.380
There you go, man.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.390
Thank you for being honest.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.550
And I do worse.

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.610
Not only do I do that, I
use my first daughter's

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:35.334
name for four passwords.

00:51:35.334 --> 00:51:36.750
I won't tell you
what the name is.

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:43.470
So that's something that
we'd like to fix, right?

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.500
So what do real systems do?

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:49.530
Real systems cannot protect
against me using my first

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:51.400
daughter's name as
a password, right?

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.580
So there's no way you
can protect against that.

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.830
But if I had a reasonable
password, which

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.030
had reasonable
entropy in it-- so

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.344
let's assume here that we
have reasonable entropy

00:52:01.344 --> 00:52:02.010
in the password.

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:04.000
And you can just say 128-bits.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.240
And it's not a lot, right?

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:09.135
128-bits is 16 characters, OK?

00:52:09.135 --> 00:52:11.260
And you don't have to answer
this-- how many of you

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:15.390
have 16 characters
in your password?

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.710
Oh I'm impressed.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:17.350
OK.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.980
So you've got
128-bits of entropy.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.710
But the rest of you, forget it.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:25.040
This is not going
to help you, OK?

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.140
But what I want,
assuming you have

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.830
significant entropy in your
password-- because otherwise,

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.940
if there's not
enough entropy you

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.272
can just enumerate all possible
passwords of eight letters.

00:52:38.272 --> 00:52:39.230
And it's not that much.

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:41.391
It's 2 raised to
50, what have you.

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.390
And you can just go off.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.150
And none of these
properties matter.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:45.810
You just-- you have your h of x.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.206
It's public.

00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:50.080
We'll talk about how we
use that in a second.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.350
But clearly if the
domain is small

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:55.120
you can just
enumerate the domain.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.062
So keep that in mind.

00:52:57.062 --> 00:52:58.770
I talked about h of
x, and it's obviously

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:00.300
going to be relevant here.

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.520
But suppose I wanted
to build a system,

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.300
and this is how
systems are built,

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.700
ETC slash password
file, assuming

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.040
you have long passwords
it does it this way,

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:13.320
otherwise it needs something
that's called a salt.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.540
But that's 6, 8, 57
and we won't go there.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.590
So we just assume
a large entropy.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:21.980
What is it that a system can do?

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:26.210
What can it store in order
to let you in, and only

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.830
let you in when you
type your password,

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:32.190
and not let some bogus
password into the system?

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:34.610
Or somebody with a bogus
password into the system.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:35.249
Yeah, go ahead.

00:53:35.249 --> 00:53:37.540
AUDIENCE: If you capture the
password when you enter it

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.380
and compare it to
what's stored--

00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:40.347
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Yes.

00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:42.430
AUDIENCE: If it's a one-way
hash you know you have

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.730
what the correct password is.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:43.820
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
That's exactly right.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.790
That's exactly right.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:49.950
So it's a really simple
idea, a very powerful idea.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.610
It, as I said, assumed that the
entropy-- and I'm belaboring

00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:56.890
the obvious now--
but it is important

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.890
when you talk about security
to state your assumptions.

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:04.380
But you do not store
password on your computer.

00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.940
And you store the
hash of the password.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:09.530
Now why do I store my
password on the computer?

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.200
Because this is so
inconvenient, right?

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.180
So this is what the
system does for me.

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.110
But the fact of the matter
is, if I lose my password,

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.470
this doesn't help me.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:24.050
Because what the system wants
you to do is choose a password

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:26.720
that is long enough,
and the h is one-way.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.960
So anybody who discovers h of
PW that is publicly readable

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.840
cannot discover PW, all right?

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.420
That's what's cool about this.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.740
How do you let
the person log in?

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:47.860
Use h of PW to compare
against h of PW prime,

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:54.420
which is what is entered, where
PW prime is the typed password.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:08.530
And clearly what we need is
the disclosure of h of PW

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:14.960
should not reveal PW.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.570
So we definitely
need one-wayness.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:24.370
What about-- what about
collision resistance?

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:28.340
Our target collision resistance?

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.350
Think practitioner now, right?

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:33.590
Are we interested in
this hash function

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:34.880
being collision resistant?

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.150
What does that
mean in this case?

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:40.315
Give me the context in this
particular application?

00:55:40.315 --> 00:55:40.940
Yeah, go ahead.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.860
AUDIENCE: It means that someone
entering a different password

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:47.107
will have the same
hash [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:47.107 --> 00:55:48.190
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Exactly.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:56.600
So it means that what you have
is a situation where you do not

00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:00.900
reveal-- and so what might
happen is that h of PW prime

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:02.460
equals h of PW.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:07.190
But h of PW equals
h of PW prime.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:11.490
But PW is not equal to PW prime.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.950
What you have is
a false positive.

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:15.570
Someone who didn't
know your password

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:19.060
but guessed right-- and
this is a 128-bit value,

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.840
and they guessed right--
is going to get it.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.940
You don't particularly
care of the probability

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.190
of this occurrence.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:27.900
It's really small.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.570
Typically you're going to
have systems that lock you out

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:34.770
if you try 10 tries that occurs
one, two, wrong passwords,

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:35.270
right?

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:37.965
So really in systems
you do not require--

00:56:37.965 --> 00:56:39.340
you do want to
build systems that

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.090
have minimal
properties with respect

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.570
to the perimeters that are used.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.090
So from a system building
standpoint just require OW.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:48.350
Don't go overboard.

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:53.100
Don't require collision
resistance or TCR, OK?

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.420
Let's do a slightly
different example.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.010
Also a bit of a
warm-up for what's

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:01.895
coming next, which is a
file modification detector.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:32.800
So for each file F, I'm going to
store h of F. And as securely.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.980
So you assume that this means
that h of F cannot be modified

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:40.380
by anybody, h of F itself.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:56.030
And now we want to
check if F is modified

00:57:56.030 --> 00:58:04.470
by re-computing h of
F. Which could be,

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:05.640
this could be modified.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.130
So this could
actually be F prime.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.250
You don't know that.

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:10.500
You have a file.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.780
It's a gigabyte.

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.270
And somebody might
have tampered with one

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:16.030
of the bits in the file.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.340
All you have is a
d-bit digest that

00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:23.670
corresponds to h of F that you
stored in a secure location.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:27.190
And you want to check
to see, by re-computing

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:31.940
h of F, the file
that is given to you,

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.135
and comparing it with what
you've stored, the h of F

00:58:34.135 --> 00:58:35.730
that you've stored.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:42.200
And so what property do we
need in order to pull this off?

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.590
Of hash functions.

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:48.070
What precisely do we
need to pull this off?

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:53.040
What is the adversary
trying to do?

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.530
And what is a successful break?

00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:02.000
A successful break is if an
adversary can modify the file

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:08.720
and keep h of F the same, right?

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.780
That would be a
successful break, right?

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.600
Yup.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.125
Go ahead.

00:59:14.125 --> 00:59:14.910
AUDIENCE: TCR.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:15.550
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: TCR?

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:16.300
Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:16.841
You need TCR.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.750
So you want to modify the file.

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:38.230
So you're given that
the file-- the adversary

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:41.980
is given the file, which
is the input to the hash,

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:47.550
and is going to try and
modify-- modify the file, right?

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:51.130
So let's do a couple more.

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:57.470
And we're going to advance our
requirements here a little bit.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.891
So those two are
basic properties.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:02.140
I want to leave this up there.

01:00:04.937 --> 01:00:06.770
We're going to do
something that corresponds

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.690
to digital signatures.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:13.030
So digital signatures are
this wonderful invention

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:18.290
that came out of MIT in a
computer science laboratory--

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:23.160
again, Ron Rivest and
collaborators-- which

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:28.120
are a way of digitally
signing a document using

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.170
a secret key, a private key.

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:35.660
But anybody who has
access to a public key,

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.210
so it could be
pretty much anybody,

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:41.647
could verify the authenticity
of that signature, right?

01:00:41.647 --> 01:00:43.230
So that's what a
digital signature is.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.960
So we're going to talk
about public cryptography

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.730
on Thursday, in terms
of how you could build

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:06.640
systems or encryption algorithms
that are public key algorithms.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.470
But here I'll just tell you
what we want out of them.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.100
Essentially what we have here
in the case of signatures,

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.100
we actually want to talk
about encryption here,

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.180
are-- there's two
keys associated

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.030
with a public key system.

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:26.880
Anybody and everybody
in the system

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.090
would have a public key that
you can put on your website.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:34.500
And you also have a secret key--
that's like your password--

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.930
that you don't
want to write down,

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:38.221
you don't want to give away,
because that's effectively

01:01:38.221 --> 01:01:39.930
your identity.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.700
And what digital
signatures respond to

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.880
are that you have
two operations.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.030
You have signing
and verification.

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:56.760
So signing means that you
create a signature sigma that

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:06.420
is the sign using your
private key, your secret key,

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.070
off a message M. So you're
saying this is this message,

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:12.060
it came from me, right?

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.655
That's what signing means.

01:02:13.655 --> 01:02:16.030
You have this long message
and you sign it at the bottom.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:20.620
You're taking responsibility for
the contents of that message.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:27.710
And then verification is you
have M sigma and a public key.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:31.770
And this is simply going
to output true or false.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:42.260
And so the public key should
not reveal any information

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:43.260
about the secret key.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.700
And that's the challenge
of building PKI systems,

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:56.800
that we'll talk about in
some detail next time.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.440
But we don't need to
think about that other

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.100
than acknowledging it today.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.680
So the public and private
key are two distinct things,

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.150
neither one of which reveals
anything about the other.

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.430
Think of them as completely
distinct passwords.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.730
But they happen to be
mathematically related.

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:18.500
That's why this
whole thing works.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.260
And that mathematical
relationship

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:24.750
we'll look at in some
detail on Thursday.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.920
But having said
that, take a look

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.490
at what this app is
doing for us, right?

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.370
This is a security application.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:33.930
And I haven't quite gotten
to hash functions yet.

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.600
But I'll get to it
in just a minute.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.330
But what I want to do is
emphasize that there's

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:41.150
two operations going on.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.760
One of which is a
signature, which

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.050
is a private signature, in the
sense that it's private to me,

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.160
if I'm Alice.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.500
Or private to Alice.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.590
And you're using
secret information

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.810
on this public message,
M, because that's

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:54.690
going to be publicized.

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.580
And you're going to
sign the public message.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.160
And then anybody in the
world who has access

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.190
to Alice's public key is
going to be able to say,

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:06.840
oh I'm looking at the signature,
which is a bunch of bits.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.900
I'm looking at the message,
which is a whole lot of bits.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.590
And I have this public key,
which is a bunch of bits.

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:16.150
And I'm going to be
able to tell for sure

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:19.340
that either Alice
signed this message,

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:22.560
or Alice did not
sign this message.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.710
And the assumption
here is that Alice

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:28.950
kept her private key secret.

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.970
And of course, what
I just wrote there,

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:33.450
that the public key
does not reveal anything

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.530
about the secret key, OK?

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.350
So that's digital signatures
for you, in a nutshell.

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:40.990
And when you do MIT
certificates you're

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:45.130
using digital signatures a la
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, the RSA

01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:45.900
algorithm.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.580
So you're using
this all the time,

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:52.290
when you click on 6.046
links, for example.

01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:56.440
And what happens is M is
typically really large.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.060
I mean it could
be a file, right?

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.510
It could be a large file.

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.730
And you don't necessarily want
to compute these operations

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.150
on large files.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:09.580
So for convenience, what happens
is you end up hashing the file.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:22.550
And for large M it's
easier to sign h of M.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:29.810
And so replace the M's that
you see here with h of M,

01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:30.720
all right?

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:38.640
So now that we're given that
we're going to be doing h of M

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.550
in here, think
about what we wanted

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:45.390
to accomplish with M, right?

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:48.150
I told you what we wanted
to accomplish with M.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.360
There's a particular message.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.190
I'm Alice.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:53.850
I'm going to keep my
secret key secret.

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:57.910
But I want to commit to signing
this message M, all right?

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.330
And I want to make
sure that nobody

01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:05.320
can pretend to be me who
doesn't know my secret key.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.290
And nobody does.

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:10.760
So if I'm going to be signing
the hash of the message,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.930
now it comes down
to today's lecture.

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:16.680
I'm signing the hash
of the message h of M.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:22.120
What property do I require of
h in order for this whole thing

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.640
to work out?

01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.636
Yeah, go ahead.

01:06:24.636 --> 01:06:26.540
AUDIENCE: Is it
non-malleability?

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.665
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Non
malleability, but even before

01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:31.770
that-- suppose-- absolutely,
but non-malleability

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:36.590
is kind of beyond one of these
properties over on the right.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:39.570
You're on the
right track, right?

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:45.219
So do you want to give
me a different answer?

01:06:45.219 --> 01:06:46.677
You can give me a
different answer.

01:06:46.677 --> 01:06:50.090
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm not sure.

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:52.190
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: OK.

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.690
What?

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.898
Yeah, back there.

01:06:53.898 --> 01:06:56.766
AUDIENCE: I think you wanted to
one-way because otherwise you

01:06:56.766 --> 01:07:00.112
could take that signature and
find another message that you

01:07:00.112 --> 01:07:01.080
could credit.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.740
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: I
can make M public.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.480
I can make M-- M can be public.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.060
And h of M is public.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:13.570
So one-wayness is not
interesting for this example

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:14.690
if M is public.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.690
And we can assume that M
eventually gets public.

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.840
Because that's the message
I'm signing, right?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:21.082
I can also put M out.

01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:22.540
So I want the
relationship-- I want

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:25.760
you to focus on the relationship
between h of M and M

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.720
and tell me what would
break this system.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.120
And you're on the right track.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:31.970
Yeah, go ahead.

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:32.932
Or way back there.

01:07:32.932 --> 01:07:33.890
Yeah, sorry about that.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:35.074
AUDIENCE: TCR.

01:07:35.074 --> 01:07:35.990
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: TCR.

01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.780
Why TCR?

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.696
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:49.070
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: So I have
M. So what happens here--

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:51.920
I should write this out.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:08:12.640
I'm given-- as an adversary I
have M and h of M. It is bad

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:33.010
if Alice signs h of M, but Bob
claims Alice signed M prime.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:39.830
Because h of M equals
h of M prime, right?

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.600
That is bad.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.729
So the M is public--
could you stand up?

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:50.600
M is given.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.329
There's a specific
M, and a specific h

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:56.470
of M in particular,
that has been exposed.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:59.620
And h of M is what was
used for the signature.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.140
So you want to keep
h of M the same.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.170
It's a specific one.

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.544
So it's not
collision resistance,

01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:05.850
it's target
collision resistance,

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.460
because that's given to you.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.430
And you want to
keep that the same.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:13.600
But you want to claim that oh,
you promised me $10,000, not

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.319
$20, right?

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.899
If you can do that,
you signed saying

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:22.149
you want to pay $10,000, not
$20, then you've got a problem.

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:24.160
So your thing is very close.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.130
It's just that it doesn't need
to be a strong relationship

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.710
between the 10,000 or the 20.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.000
I mean I give you a
concrete example of that.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.720
But it could be more,
it could be less.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.479
Anything that is different
from what you signed,

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.870
be it with the numerical
relationship or not,

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.080
would cause a problem and
break this scheme, all right?

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:45.260
Are we good?

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.490
All right, one last example,
the most interesting one.

01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:57.250
And as I guessed I'm
probably not going

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:01.670
to get to saying very much
about how cache functions are

01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:02.250
implemented.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.041
But maybe I'll spend
a minute or two on it.

01:10:08.770 --> 01:10:12.700
So let's do this example that
has to do with commitments.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.890
Commitment is important, right?

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:22.640
You want to commit
to doing things.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.420
You want to keep your promises.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:28.310
And in this case we
have a legal requirement

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:34.550
that you want to be able to make
people honor their commitments,

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:37.040
and not weasel their way
out of commitments, right?

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.670
And we want to deal with
this computationally.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:42.720
And let's think about auctions.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:51.325
So Alice has value x,
e.g. an auction bid.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:11:02.170
Alice computes what
we're going to call

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:11.500
C of x, which is a commitment
of x, and cements it, right?

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:26.670
C of x, C of x is-- let's
assume that the auctioneer,

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:32.470
and perhaps other auctionees
as well, see C of x.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:34.770
You have to submit it
to somebody, right?

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.100
So you can assume
that that's exposed.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:49.460
And what is going to happen
is, when bidding is over Alice

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.145
is going to open--
so this is-- C

01:11:53.145 --> 01:12:00.069
of x can be thought
of as sealing the bid.

01:12:00.069 --> 01:12:01.110
So that's the commitment.

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.030
You're sealing the--
you're making a bid

01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.600
and you're sealing
it in an envelope.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.650
You've committed to that.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:08.110
That's obviously, what
happens in real life

01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:09.740
without cryptography,
but we want

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:12.300
to do this with cryptography,
with hash functions.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:19.250
And so now Alice opens
C of x to reveal x.

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:25.670
So she has to prove that
in fact x was her bid.

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:28.580
And that it matches
what she sealed.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.930
When you open it up, think
about it conceptually

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.660
from a standpoint of
what happens with paper,

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:38.620
and then we have to think
about this computationally

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.120
and what this implies, right?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.245
So again I'll do a
little bit of set up.

01:12:43.245 --> 01:12:45.370
And then we have start
talking about the properties

01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:48.997
that we want for this
particular application.

01:12:48.997 --> 01:12:50.580
So there are a bunch
of people who are

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.680
doing bidding for this auction.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.999
I don't-- I want
to be the first--

01:12:56.999 --> 01:12:58.540
I don't want to
spend a lot of money.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.560
But I want to win.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.640
All of us are like that, right?

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.350
If I know information
about your bid,

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.490
that is obviously a
tremendous advantage.

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:09.110
So clearly that
can't happen, right?

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:13.000
If I know one other person's
bid I just do plus 1 on that.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.090
If I know everybody else's I
just do plus 1 on the maximum.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.420
So clearly there's some secrecy
that's required here, correct?

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.000
So C of x is going to
have to do two things.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.160
It can't reveal x.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.760
Because then even maybe
the auctioneer is bad.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.570
Or other people are
looking at this.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:34.760
And you can just assume that C
of x is-- the C of x's are all

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.000
public.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.840
But I also need a
constraint that's

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.530
associated with C of x
that corresponds to making

01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.540
sure Alice is honest, correct?

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:50.940
So I need to make Alice
commit to something, right?

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:56.000
So what are the different
properties of the hash function

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:03.350
that if I use h of
x here, that I'd

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:08.090
want h to satisfy in order
for this whole process

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:14.700
to work like it's supposed to
work with paper and envelopes?

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.695
Yeah, go ahead.

01:14:15.695 --> 01:14:18.406
AUDIENCE: It has to be
one-way [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:18.406 --> 01:14:20.030
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: It
has to be one-way.

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:24.210
And explain to me-- so I
want a description of it

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:26.260
has to be one-way, because why?

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.957
AUDIENCE: Because
you want all the c

01:14:27.957 --> 01:14:29.790
x's to be hidden from
all the other options.

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:31.200
SRINIVAS DEVADAS: Right.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:40.930
C of x should not
reveal x, all right?

01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:41.430
All right.

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.950
That's good.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.320
Do you have more?

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.765
It has to be
collision resistant.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.560
OK.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:57.852
I guess.

01:14:57.852 --> 01:15:00.580
A little bit more.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.560
You're getting there.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.672
What-- why is it
collision resistant?

01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:08.132
AUDIENCE: Because you want
to make sure that Alice,

01:15:08.132 --> 01:15:12.560
when she makes a bid that
she commits that bid.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:15.512
If she's not going to resist
it then she could bid $100

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:16.805
and then find something else.

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:18.430
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
That's exactly right.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:26.540
So CR, because
Alice should not be

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:37.760
able to open this in
multiple ways, right?

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.940
And in this case it's
not TCR in the sense

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.350
that Alice controls
what her bids are.

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:51.440
And so she might find a pair
of bids that collide, correct?

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.840
She might realize that in
this particular hash function,

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.000
you know $10,000 and a billion
dollars collide, right?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.450
And so she figures
depending on what happens,

01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:07.820
she's a billionaire,
let's assume.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:09.320
She's going to open
the right thing.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.320
She's a billionaire, but
she doesn't necessarily

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.390
want to spend the billion, OK?

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:15.040
So that's that, right?

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:18.360
But I want more.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.115
Go ahead.

01:16:19.115 --> 01:16:21.590
AUDIENCE: You don't
want it to be malleable.

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.482
Assuming that the
auctioneer is not honest

01:16:23.482 --> 01:16:25.690
because you don't want to
accept a bribe from someone

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.200
and then change
everyone else's bid

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.485
to square root of
whatever they bid.

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:31.110
SRINIVAS DEVADAS:
That's exactly right.

01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:34.480
Or plus 1, which is a
great example, right?

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.050
So there you go.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:38.000
I ran out of Frisbees.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.083
You can get one next time.

01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:45.640
So yeah, I don't
need this anymore.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.020
You're exactly right.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.790
There's another-- it turns out
it's even more subtle than what

01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:51.070
you just described.

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:54.470
And I think I might be able
to point that out to you.

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:59.730
But let me just first
describe this answer, which

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:02.960
gives us non-malleability.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.130
So the claim is that you
also want non-malleability

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:08.000
in your hash function.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.147
And the simple reason is,
given C of x-- and let's assume

01:17:14.147 --> 01:17:14.980
that this is public.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.646
It's certainly public
to the auctioneer,

01:17:16.646 --> 01:17:19.530
and it could be public to
the other bidders as well.

01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:23.370
Because the notion of
sealing is that you've

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:24.372
sealed it using C of x.

01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:26.580
But people can see the
outside of the envelope, which

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.990
is C of x.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:29.510
So everyone can see C of x.

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.250
You still want this to work,
even though all other bidders

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:33.650
can see C of x.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:44.990
So given C of x, should
not be possible to produce

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:48.110
C of x plus 1.

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.250
You don't know x is.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.050
But if you can produce C of
x plus 1, you win, all right?

01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:57.590
And so that's the problem.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:04.930
Now it turns out you
now say OK, am I done?

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.930
I want these three properties.

01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:10.350
And I'm done, right?

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:13.060
There's a little
subtlety here which

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.750
these properties don't capture.

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.290
So that's why there's more here.

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:21.770
And I don't mean to
titillate, because I'll

01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:24.000
tell you what is missing here.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.370
But let's say that I have a hash
function that looks like this.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.970
And this here is non-malleable.

01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:41.690
It is collision resistant.

01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:43.290
And it's one-way, all right?

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:46.730
So h of x has all these
wonderful properties,

01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:48.710
all right?

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:52.160
I'm creating an h
prime x that looks

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.660
like this, which is
a concatenation of h

01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:00.210
of x, and giving away the most
significant bit of x, which

01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:01.670
is my bid, right?

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.780
I'm just giving
that away, right?

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:08.190
The problem here is
that we haven't really

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:11.660
made our properties
broad enough to solve

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:14.230
this particular
application to the extent

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:19.140
that there's contrived cases
where these properties aren't

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.420
enough, OK?

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.180
And the reason is simple.

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:30.000
h prime x is arguably
NM, CR, and OW.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.660
And I won't go into to
each of those arguments.

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:36.630
But you can think
about it, right?

01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:40.030
If I'm just giving you one
bit, there's 159 others,

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:42.140
there's a couple of
hundred others, whatever it

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.860
is that I have in the domain.

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.230
It's not going to be invertible.

01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:49.420
h prime x is not going to
be invertible if h of x

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.080
is not invertible.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:57.880
h prime x is not going to be
breakable in terms of collision

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.950
resistance if h of
x is not breakable,

01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:02.450
and so on and so forth.

01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:04.740
But if I had a hash
function like that,

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:09.340
is it a good hash function
for my commitment application?

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.090
No, obviously not.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.298
Because if I publicize this
hash function-- remember,

01:20:12.298 --> 01:20:13.890
everything is public
here with respect

01:20:13.890 --> 01:20:18.030
to h and h prime-- you
are giving away the most

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:21.360
significant that
corresponds to your bid

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.350
in this particular
hash function, right?

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:33.170
So you really need a little bit
more than these for secrecy,

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:34.200
for true secrecy.

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.890
But in the context
of this example,

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:41.770
I mean it's common
sense that you would not

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.550
use the hash function
like that, right?

01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:46.950
So it's not that there's
anything profound here.

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:48.540
It's just that I
want to make sure

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.480
that you understand the
nuances of the properties

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.580
that we're requiring.

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:55.560
We had all the
requirements corresponding

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:58.900
to the definitions
of NM and CR and OW.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.150
And you need a little bit
more for this example, where

01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:04.300
you have to say something,
perhaps informally,

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:10.870
like the bits of your auction
are scrambled in the final hash

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:14.010
output, which most hash
functions should do anyway,

01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:15.730
and h of x will definitely do.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:19.290
But you kind of unscrambled
it by adding this little thing

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:22.210
in here, corresponding to
the most significant thing,

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.050
all right?

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:25.480
So I'll stop with that.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.760
Let me just say that the
operation-- or sorry,

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.590
the work involved in
creating hash functions that

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:37.430
are poly-time computable
is research work.

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:40.290
People put up hash functions
and they get broken,

01:21:40.290 --> 01:21:43.770
like MD4 was put up in '92 and
then got broken, SHA-1 and so

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:44.700
on and so forth.

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.580
And so I just encourage you
to look up SHA-3 and just take

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.480
a quick scan and what
the complexity of SHA-3

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:56.820
is with respect to computing the
hash given an arbitrary string,

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.590
all right?

01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:59.575
I'll stick around for questions.
