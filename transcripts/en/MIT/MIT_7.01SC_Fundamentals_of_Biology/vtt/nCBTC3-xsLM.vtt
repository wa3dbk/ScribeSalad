00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.530
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.280
Welcome to the biochemistry
help sessions.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.710
This is the covalent bonds,
chirality, electronegativity,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.740
and hydrogen bonds module.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.570
In this help session, I'll be
going over the first practice

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.270
problem in this module.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.900
If you have not had a chance
to look over this problem

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.470
yourself, please go back, look
over the problem, try it, and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.055
then come back and we'll
go through it together.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.360
Now that you've had a chance to
look at the problem, let's

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.770
get started.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.330
First of all, what
is this molecule?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.280
To me, this molecule looks
like it's a sugar.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.340
It's a polysaccharide, to be
exact, and it's actually a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.330
chain of glucose molecules.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.020
So in this problem, the first
part of the problem asks us to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.600
name each circled bond
in this molecule.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.040
So the first circled bond is
right here, and this is a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.320
carbon to carbon bond.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310
Now, the first thing that we can
notice about this bond is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.050
that it's a carbon to carbon
bond, and we know that carbon

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.990
only forms covalent bonds
in biological systems.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.430
So the first thing we can say
is that this bond is a

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.680
covalent bond.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.300
Second, we need to decide
if this bond is

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.700
polar or non polar.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.240
And the way we decide that
is we look at the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.560
electronegativity of
the atoms involved.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.330
In this bond we have
two carbons.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.860
And so since they're the same
atoms, we know that they have

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.040
the same electronegativity.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.900
And bonds between two atoms of
the same electronegativity are

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.185
non polar bonds.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.970
So we know that this carbon
to carbon bond is

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.600
covalent and non polar.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.800
Now we'll look at the
second bond circled.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.130
This bond is a carbon
to oxygen bond.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.950
It is similar to the first
bond in that it involves

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.900
carbon, so we can say that
it is a covalent bond.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.490
What's different about this
bond, however, is that it is a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.340
carbon bound to an oxygen.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.030
And when you look at the
electronegativities of carbon

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.000
and oxygen, you find that
oxygen is much more

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.520
electronegative than carbon.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.020
So in a carbon to oxygen bond,
you actually have oxygen is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.790
greedy, and it's going to take
the electrons closer to itself

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.850
and not share them equally
with the carbon.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.650
So in this kind of bond,
oxygen will be slightly

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.000
negative and carbon will be
slightly positive, because the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.900
electrons are attracted
closer to the oxygen.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.150
In a bond where you have a
slightly negative side and a

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.525
slightly positive side, we
call this a polar bond.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.330
So we can say that a carbon to
oxygen bond is a polar bond.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.950
So in this first part, we
learned that the difference

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.120
between a covalent and
a non polar and a

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.000
covalent polar bond.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.590
The second part of the problem,
part B, asks if this

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.280
sugar molecule is soluble
in water.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.050
So first you need to know
whether this molecule is polar

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.670
or non polar.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.450
And since we know that it has
carbon to oxygen bonds, we

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.980
know that it has polar bonds,
so it is a polar molecule.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.690
And what do we know
about water?

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.170
We know water is an oxygen
bound to two hydrogens.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.960
And since it has this very
electronegative oxygen, we

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.620
know that it is also
a polar molecule.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.520
And an easy rule of thumb is
that like dissolves like.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.190
So since these are both polar
molecules, sugar dissolves

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.089
very easily in water.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.150
If you had a fat, on the other
hand, which is a non polar

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300
molecule, it would not
dissolve in water.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.030
That's why when you put
oil and water, you

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.430
don't see it dissolve.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.710
So now that we understand why
sugar dissolves very easily in

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.870
water, we'll move into the third
part of the problem,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.450
where they ask what types of
bonds can form between these

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.460
long polymers.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.470
So looking at these polymers,
the first thing that we can

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.130
notice is that there are these
oxygens and hydrogens on each

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.250
of the polymers.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.780
And looking at these, we can see
how you can have hydrogen

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.260
bonding, which we learned about
in class, between the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.940
oxygen of one sugar molecule
to the hydrogen of another

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.920
sugar molecule, thus forming
hydrogen bonding networks

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.080
between the sugar molecules.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.960
And in this way, they can
interact with each other.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.030
So in this help session we have
covered the difference

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.400
between a covalent non
polar bond and a

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.770
covalent polar bond.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.280
We have covered why water can
dissolve sugar very easily,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.220
and what kind of bonds
can form between

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.170
these two sugar molecules.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.420
Thank you.
