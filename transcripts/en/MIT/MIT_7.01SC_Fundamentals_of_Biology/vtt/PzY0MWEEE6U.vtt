00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.800
PROFESSOR:So lecture
one, introduction.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.520
When people teach biology at
different universities, they

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.230
teach many different things.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.780
You could focus on
the ecosystem.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.300
You could focus on memorizing
different phyla.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.170
You could focus on
many things.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.370
Biology is huge and diverse.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.950
We have a certain point of
view in the way we teach

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.450
7.012, and really a point of
view in the way that MIT

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.680
organizes its biology.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.180
And so I want to point out the
levels of organization of life

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.440
and indicate where we will be.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.060
You could decide to study
the entire biosphere.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.570
By the biosphere, I
mean everything.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.420
All the world's ecosystems
working together to create a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.400
happy, healthy living planet.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.570
There are, oh I don't know,
something like 10 to the sixth

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.640
eukaryotic species on this
planet, more than a million

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.880
species of things you can see
with your eye, and there are

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.690
10 to the God knows how many
species of microbes.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.180
And in fact, it's even hard to
define species for microbes.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.180
So it's a fantastic diversity.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.320
And if we think about examples,
the number of

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.940
examples of biospheres that
we are aware of is one.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.020
Currently, it's the earth.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.160
There might be other biospheres,
but we're not

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.780
aware of them.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.110
Alright, that's one level
of organization.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.420
We will have virtually nothing
to say about that level of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.200
organization other than
that we're fond of it.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.143
Next, you can study
an ecosystem.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.850
Now what do we mean
by ecosystem?

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:54.170
That's some interacting
community of organisms, like a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.700
forest, let's say.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.970
You've got trees, and you've
got, oh I don't

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.530
know, mice and deer.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.780
And you've got fungi growing
down there on the bottom, and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.920
maybe you have, I don't know,
some MIT student walking

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.880
through the forest or
something like that.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.620
That's all part of
the ecosystem.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.000
Alright, now the next level down
you could think about is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.250
whole organisms.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.990
So here we're talking about one
individual, an individual

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.240
in a species.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.380
And one can study how does
that individual work, the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.350
levels of physiology within
an organism, the overall

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.250
integration of signals, the
distribution of oxygen across

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.570
the body, things like that.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.640
This is a popular
topic to study.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.940
We'll have a little bit to say
about physiology, but that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.000
won't be our major focus, that
whole organismal level of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.970
physiology.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.760
Example of an organism, say a
human, in particular, let's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.730
say an MIT student.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.090
OK.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.220
Next up, we could study
an individual organ.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.480
So by an organ, I'm thinking
about some part of the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.970
organism that's a group of
tissues that are organized

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.390
together to carry
out a function.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.540
So it's a group of tissues that
are organized to carry

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.790
out a function.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.400
And we have the eye, the
eye on that human.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.620
So we've got these
muscles here.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.790
We've got some photoreceptors
there on the back, and they

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.920
send back nerve terminals
going there.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.400
All these tissues working
together to provide vision.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.130
OK.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.040
Going down one level below
that we have tissues.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.390
These are more homogeneous
groups of cells.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:28.080
So we could have,
say, the retina.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.790
Then those tissues are
made up of cells.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.450
So cells of course are bounded
by a membrane.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.840
They have nuclei, at least
in eukaryotes.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.130
So let's say within the retina,
we could pick a

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.600
photoreceptor cell.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.350
So the MIT student is walking
through the forest and with

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.540
her eye is getting light
on the retina, which is

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.650
triggering photoreceptor
cells.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.660
They each have a distinctive
shape, and that shape--

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.790
there's our nucleus.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.020
The light comes and impinges
there, sends a signal

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.465
out the other end.

00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:23.870
OK.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.120
That's a cell.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.805
Then we get down
to organelles.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.610
These are distinct components
within a cell.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.390
For example, this photoreceptor
is using up a

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.490
lot of energy.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.740
It has mitochondria.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:05.660
These mitochondria in here
are involved in producing

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.990
efficiently ATP.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.165
And then finally, we
have molecules.

00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:24.635
A wide variety of different
molecules in the cell: sugars

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:29.680
and DNA's and-- but I'll say ATP
will be our example here.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.630
Molecules.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.670
So if you think about it, we
have sets of levels of

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.340
organization, all the way up
there from biospheres to

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.772
ecosystems to organisms to
organs to tissues to cells to

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:40.330
organelles to molecules.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.240
And biology thinks about all of
those different levels, and

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.020
in principle, they
all interact.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.230
Of course, it's somewhat hard
to keep in mind, say, the

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.550
connection between the entire
biosphere and a ATP at any

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.240
given point.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.910
It's a bunch of levels
going up and down.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.625
At MIT, we tend to focus more
on the bottom of the picture

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.730
than the top of the picture,
and that's what this class

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.450
will focus on.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.600
You run the risk that you'll
forget there is a top of the

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.210
picture, that there are
ecosystems, there are

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.000
organisms, physiology
and all that.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.620
Oh well.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.350
What can I say?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.780
Why do we focus the bottom
of the picture?

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.450
Why do we focus so much on, say,
the molecules of life?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.460
You're going to get a lot of
molecules of life in the

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.460
beginning of this course.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.920
We're going to focus on--

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.750
we'll think about organelles
and cells.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.500
You'll hear less about tissues,
less about organs,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.280
less about organisms
as a whole.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:40.360
And the reason is life is most
universal down at its bottom.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.289
That is what's shared
across all life.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.420
Rather than, say, focus on
the glorious, wonderful

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.020
differences between all the
different phyla and learning

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.570
all sorts of genuses and of
all sorts of interesting--

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.550
we want to focus on that which
is most universal.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.750
Now, there are some
differences.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.080
We will look differently at
microbe, prokaryotes versus

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.600
eukaryotes and all.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.880
But for the most part, what
we're trying to do is ask what

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.710
are universal principles that
apply across all organisms?

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.090
What are the ways organisms
are built up?

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.910
Commonalities, like the genetic
code, that applies

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.920
pretty broadly across all
organisms, commonalities of

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.500
signalling systems, regulatory
systems.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.860
Things like that are what we're
most interested in,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.910
because once you learn that,
it's much easier to layer on

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.750
top of it the differences, the
unique differences, that makes

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.830
a fruit fly a fruit fly
or a tree a tree.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.680
So anyway, that's our
perspective on it, and I hope

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.690
you like it.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.970
But it's the only prospective
we've got, so there you go.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.550
Next, a few dates
to keep in mind.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.750
Important dates in the
history of life.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.550
Again to provide perspective,
we're not going to focus on

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.840
lots of them, but a few
that you should know.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.520
About 4.0 billion years ago--

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.000
BYA means billion years ago--

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.250
the earth cooled.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.370
Before that, it was a
hot, molten mass.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.230
There until it cooled, there was
no real prospect of life.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.040
One of the things I find
absolutely wonderful is that

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.290
by 3.7 billion years ago, there
was clear evidence of

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.940
the first life.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.610
Whatever it was, it didn't
take that all

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.250
long to get life going.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.170
Somehow, it can't be that hard,
although I got to say we

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.540
don't quite understand
all of it.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.470
Increasingly, people are looking
back to how early life

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:41.180
can form out of prebiotic
materials.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.310
And these things were
prokaryotic organisms, like

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.790
bacteria, and they played a
very important role, for

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.000
example, in changing the entire
atmosphere of the earth

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.450
to contain oxygen, which made
possible other things.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:00.330
So--

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.530
sorry, in shaping the content
of oxygen in the atmosphere.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:10.060
So 1.5 billion years ago, one
has a totally amazing

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.630
invention, which is the
first nucleated cells.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.060
These bacteria lack nuclei.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.110
Here we have nucleated
cells, eukaryotes.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.010
Major event, and it occurred
because of a fusion of two of

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.650
these prokaryotic-type cells.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.460
One takes up residence in the
other, and there is a

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.970
symbiosis between two
cells and that gave

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.390
rise to your nucleus.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.030
The one that lives inside the
other eventually discarded

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.520
most of its functions there.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.560
Sorry--

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.150
yes, that gave rise to
a nucleated cell.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.580
It's a fusion between two
different prokaryotic

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.730
organisms that had different
properties, one of which is

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.040
the nucleated cell, the other
of which you see in the

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.890
mitochondria, for example.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.060
There's still a genome in the
mitochondria, for example.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.420
And so we can recognize that
there was this prokaryotic

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.620
fusion event.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.960
Notice it took 2 billion years,
more than two billion

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.760
years, to make eukaryotes and
only 300 million years to make

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.370
the first life.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.300
I find that quite remarkable.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.330
What does that tell us?

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.860
That it was that much harder
to make a eukaryotic cell.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.170
Maybe.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.140
Or maybe it tells us about
the power of competition.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.400
Once you have some life--

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.280
that the first prokaryotic
cells-- it's so much harder to

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.850
get anything else that can come
in and compete with it,

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.160
because it has to be better.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.953
Maybe the first life didn't have
to compete with anything,

00:12:43.953 --> 00:12:45.170
and it was easy.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.100
And then in an innovation like
the eukaryotic cell, well,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.380
maybe that was a lot harder to
accomplish, because it had to

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.240
be better than the prokaryotic
cells it was competing with.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.160
I'm not sure, but I find that
difference in time to be kind

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.890
of a remarkably interesting
thing.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.250
That that was short, and
that took a lot longer.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.760
0.5 billion years ago, roughly
speaking, what you have are

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.470
multicellular organisms
with body plans.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.620
Up to this point, you have
single-celled organisms.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.190
Now you get multicellular
organisms with body plans.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.150
And another remarkable thing,
once body plans, multicellular

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.700
body plans, are invented, they
explode very quickly.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.380
Somehow it was hard to invent
multicellularity, to get cells

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.230
to work together and be an
organism, but once it was

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.510
invented, it was not hard to
diversify it into zillions of

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.390
different body plans
and forms.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.350
That tells us something.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.860
That as soon as we see
multicellularity, we start

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.640
seeing huge numbers
of different body

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.010
plans pretty quickly.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.270
Very interesting.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.650
A few other important dates.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:53.800
Two other dates.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:01.680
0.005 billion years
ago are humans.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.500
Just to put yourself in your
place on this scale.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:16.695
And 0.00000015 billion years
ago, MIT was founded.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.400
Just to put this
in prospective.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.710
Alright.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.680
Couple of other things
you should know.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.900
The types of cells I've
been referring to.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.830
There's really two fundamental
types of cells.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.570
And I've been using
the word already.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.900
Let me just get it out there.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.150
Prokaryotes.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.070
Eukaryotes.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.506
Karyo refers to nucleus.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.810
Eu- means true.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.880
Pro- means primitive, before.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.555
So eukaryotic cells--

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.730
you're, by the way,
a eukaryote.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.880
Right?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.950
Just in case you haven't read
the owner's manual, you're

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.680
eukaryotes.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.520
--have true nuclei.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:25.230
Inside the nucleus, there's your
DNA, which is organized

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.470
better than I just drew it
there, because, in fact, it's

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.760
very, very long and has
to be packed up well.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.250
It'll have organelles
like mitochondria.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.780
It could have chloroplasts.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.390
It could have other
organelles.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.410
It'll have other things
we'll talk about--

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.590
Golgi apparatuses
and endoplasmic

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.370
reticula and all that.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.140
Bacteria don't have
a true nucleus.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.310
It's not that they're DNA isn't
somehow organized, but

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.600
it doesn't have a true nucleus
with the wall around it.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.140
There's no wall around that
nucleus like that.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.790
They often have interesting
cell walls.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.520
A striking thing, although I've
drawn them as the same

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.250
size, these are much smaller.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.730
These are 1 to 2 microns.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:13.570
These, 10 to 40 microns
in diameter.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.400
And so that means that if we
talk about volume, we cube it.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.050
So the volumes of these guys
are something like 1,000 to

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.930
60,000 times bigger.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:30.090
Eukaryotic cells are large
compared to prokaryotic cells.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:34.130
Now, remember these are the
guys who were early.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.770
These guys come along later.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.650
And there are important
differences that we'll talk

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.380
about in eukaryotic and
prokaryotic cells.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.780
You're a eukaryote, all animals,
all plants are

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.680
eukaryotes.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.500
Fungi, such as yeast,
et cetera.
