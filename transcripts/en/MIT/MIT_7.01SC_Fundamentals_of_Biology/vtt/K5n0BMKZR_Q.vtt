00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.580
PROFESSOR: Welcome to
another help session

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.120
on recombinant DNA.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.850
Today, we're going to
be discussing about

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.420
transformation and protein
expression.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.110
As you can imagine, there are
often many times we will need

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.830
a large amount of protein.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.170
But it can be difficult to get
it from the original source.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.280
For example, you need insulin
to treat diabetes, but it's

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.340
not exactly practical to get a
lot of insulin from humans.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.090
In order to get a lot of the
desired protein, often other

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.980
organisms will be used to
express this protein.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.090
But it's a multi-step process.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.350
For example, let's say we want
to express our human insulin

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.000
in bacteria.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.380
Well, the human gene has both
introns and exons, as you

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.100
remember from lecture.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.310
Exons are what are actually
cut together in order to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.030
produce the final mature mRNA,
which is later used to express

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.390
the protein.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.590
Bacteria, on the other hand,
don't have introns.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.940
They just have exons.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.760
So they are only capable of
reading a gene that just has

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.420
the exons and then producing
the protein from that.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.700
In order to take a version of
the gene that's from the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.840
eukaryotic cell and get it
to be expressed in the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.810
prokaryotic, we first have to
make something called cDNA.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.840
So let's begin.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.500
We're going to take our
cell of interest.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.130
And the first step in creating
the cDNA is we're going to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.040
isolate the mRNA of interest--

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.480
this is the mRNA for insulin,
for example--

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.430
from the cell.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.260
And once we have our mRNA, we
are going to add something

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.380
called reverse transcriptase.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.790
This is a protein that's a DNA
polymerase that's going to use

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.240
the single-stranded RNA
as its template.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.870
So it's going to take the RNA
and it's going to put together

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.876
this double-stranded DNA
that we're going

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.930
to refer to as cDNA.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.540
So this is the DNA for the gene,
but unlike the original

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.740
gene, it only has the exons.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.620
It doesn't have any
of the introns.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.590
The next step, of course,
is to get the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.650
cDNA into the bacteria.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.430
We do this using something
called a vector.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.720
The vector is just a means of
getting DNA into a cell.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.280
One common type of vector
is a plasmid.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.570
The plasmid is a circular piece
of DNA that the bacteria

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.200
can then take up and read.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.840
The way we're going to get our
cDNA into this plasmid is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.210
through the use of restriction
enzymes.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.340
As you remember from our
previous help session,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.660
restriction enzymes can cut up
DNA and create these overhang

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.510
of the nucleotides.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.730
So we're going to cut up the
cDNA, and we're going to cut

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.120
up the plasmid, and they're
going to have overhangs that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.550
are complementary.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.460
This means that when we add
the cDNA to the plasmids,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.390
they're going to hybridize,
and then

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.470
we can add DNA ligase.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.210
We add DNA ligase, it will
create a phosphodiester bond

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.720
between the cDNA and the
plasmid vectors.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.810
And finally we'll get the cDNA
inserted into our plasmid.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.220
The next step, of course, is
getting the plasmid into the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.300
bacteria in order for the
protein to be expressed.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.000
There are multiple, different
ways to do this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.930
One common way is called
heat shock.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.460
What happens is that the
bacteria is heated up and then

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460
cooled rapidly, and this creates
lots of little holes

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.570
in the membrane, which
allow the plasma to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.820
get into the cell.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.060
Once you have the plasmid in
the bacteria, your job is

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.150
pretty much done.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.740
Now the bacteria will naturally
express this

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.840
protein, so you can grow up
the bacteria in large

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.080
quantities and get a lot of
the protein of interest.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.390
Referring back briefly to the
vector, there are several

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.570
parts that are important
for it to have.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.940
We're going to need to have the
origin of replication, the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.880
promoter, and the selection
marker.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.620
The origin of replication
initiation, or ORI, is

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.890
necessary if we want the
bacteria to produce more

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.330
copies of this plasmid.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.840
So once the plasmid gets into
the bacteria, if we don't have

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.630
an ORI, as the bacteria grows
and reproduces, none of the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.859
daughter cells will
have this plasmid.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.010
We'll have to continually
transform them.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.850
However if it has the ORI,
as a bacteria grows and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.190
reproduces, it will also
replicate this plasmid.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.910
Another very important thing
to have is the promoter.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.530
The promoter is a section of DNA
which signals for the RNA

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.760
polymerase to bind.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.880
The RNA's polymerase will bind
to the promoter, and then will

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.910
proceed down the DNA on the
plasmid to read the actual

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.270
gene and transcribe it.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.296
So the mRNA, which then
ultimately can

00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:48.490
be made into protein.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.890
Finally, you need a
selection marker.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.610
Now as we talked about earlier,
when you heat shock

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.220
the bacteria, the plasmid
will get taken up.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.270
However, not all the
bacteria might take

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.910
up some of the plasmid.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.830
In order to get rid of the
unwanted bacteria, the

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.760
bacteria that doesn't have the
plasmid, we're going to use

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.480
selection marker.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.880
A very common selection marker
for bacteria is antibiotic

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.440
resistance.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.600
For example, if the plasmid
provides ampicillin

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.960
resistance, then this means that
any bacteria that takes

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.410
up the plasmid will be resistant
to ampicillin.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.090
The bacteria that don't will
still be vulnerable to it.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.760
So you could plate all of your
bacteria on a plate containing

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.100
ampicillin, and the ones that
have the plasmid will survive.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.510
The ones that don't have the
plasmid will perish.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.690
So let's go once more to the
original example and discuss

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.800
about what we're going to
need for our vector.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.520
So again, we want to express
human insulin in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.180
the bacterial system.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.240
There are six possibilities
for what we

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.480
can need on our vector.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.180
You can need the bacterial
ORI, the human ORI, the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.470
bacterial promoter, the human
promoter, the bacterial

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.130
selection marker, the human
selection marker.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.280
Pause for a minute.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.580
Give you a chance to decide
what you think the vector

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.160
needs, and then we'll
go over it together.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.600
OK.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.725
Does it need a bacterial ORI?

00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:19.140
Yes.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.470
If we want to grow up a large
amount of insulin, we're going

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.130
to put the plasmid
in the bacteria.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.890
The bacteria needs to create
more of this plasmid.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.490
Does it need human ORI?

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.940
No, we're not actually assorting
the plasmid into a

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.670
human cell.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.240
So the human cell is never
going to need to

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.320
create more of them.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.100
Just the bacterial cell.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.970
What about a bacterial
promoter?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:40.420
Yes.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.600
Even though it's a human
gene, the promoter has

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.850
to be for the bacteria.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.380
Because it's going to be the
bacterial RNA polymerase that

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.730
will bind to the promoter,
and ultimately make the

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.630
mRNA from the cDNA.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.120
What about a human promoter?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.600
No, we don't need a human
promoter because the human RNA

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.520
polymerase won't be involved.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.650
Again, this is only going to
be in the bacterial cells.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.260
It's not going to be in the
human cell, so it doesn't need

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.410
a human promoter.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.740
And finally for the selection
markers, once again, we only

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.110
need the bacterial selection
marker, not the human

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.500
selection marker.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.460
We're not dealing with full
human cells at this point.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.660
We're just dealing with a
plasmid, so we only need to

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.375
select for bacteria cells that
have the plasmid of interest.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.230
This has been another help
section on recombinant DNA.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.480
Thank you for your time.
