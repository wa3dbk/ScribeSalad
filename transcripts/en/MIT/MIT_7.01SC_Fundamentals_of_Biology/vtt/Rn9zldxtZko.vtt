PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.670
In this clip, we're going to
discuss the numbering and

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.730
labeling conventions of
RNA and of protein.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.270
Here we have a nucleoside
triphosphate or NTP.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.110
This NTP is numbered
on each carbon.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.180
And we're going to start here
to the right of this oxygen

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.580
and label one prime and proceed
two prime, three

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:40.820
prime, four prime, and this
last, five prime carbon.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.560
This means that when we
polymerize two or more of

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.630
these NTP's to get an RNA chain,
it becomes apparent why

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.770
one end is labeled five prime
and the other end is labeled

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.160
three prime.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.200
On this end, the extending atom
is the five prime carbon.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.269
And on this side, the other end,
the extending atom is the

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.040
three prime carbon attached
to this oxygen.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.120
This three prime carbon is where
you would attach another

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.340
NTP if you would wish to
extend this chain.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.070
And so we label the ends of RNA
five prime to three prime.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.600
And RNA is always polymerized in
the five prime to the three

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.850
prime direction.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.150
Now with our amino acid, we
label this end, which is our

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.690
amino terminus, as N and this
end which is our carboxy

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.740
terminus as C. As before, when
we polymerize three amino

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.880
acids into this short protein
chain, I'm going to label this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.660
end which has a protruding amino
terminus as N and this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.370
end which has a protruding
carboxy terminus as C.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.260
So that's how the conventions
are in science to label and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.540
number amino acids
and proteins.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.790
Thanks for watching.
