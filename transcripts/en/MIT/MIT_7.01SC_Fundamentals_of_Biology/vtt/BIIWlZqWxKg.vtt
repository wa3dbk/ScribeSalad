00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.890
PROFESSOR: Good morning,
good morning.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.570
So last time, we talked about
the most remarkable

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.260
biochemical purification
procedure ever invented--

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.510
cloning.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.230
You remember the issue
with biochemistry.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.120
You're going to grind up a cell,
you're going to take the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.210
contents and run it over
different kinds of separation

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.660
columns or centrifuge it or
things, in order to separate

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.970
some things from other things.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.300
The problem with purifying a
gene that way, away from all

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.950
the rest of DNA in a cell, is
that the gene has exactly the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.940
same biochemical properties
as all the other genes.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.790
How in the world are
you going to do it?

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.380
The solution was devilishly
simple and devilishly complex

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.620
at the same time.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.200
All you have to do to purify
something is dilute it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.630
If I take any substance
an I add enough

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.280
water, it's very dilute.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.966
And in any little drop in any
little test tube there will

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.470
only be one DNA molecule.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.480
It's now purified.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.130
I could do that for every
molecule there is.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.550
The problem is, it's not very
useful unless I have a way to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.270
take that molecule and make
extra copies of it.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.700
But if I could do that, dilution
is purification.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.490
The trick we use initially for
making more copies is we ask

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.940
E. coli to do it for us.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.680
That, as usual, is the solution
to most issues.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.390
Find something in life
that already does it.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.360
And so, just to remember what
we did, we took total DNA.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.160
Maybe it was yeast DNA, maybe
it was human DNA, maybe

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.130
it was zebra DNA.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.840
And we cut it up with some
restriction enzyme.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.570
Our restriction enzyme we used
was EcoR1 And it therefore cut

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.560
at the EcoR1 sites, G, A, A, T,
T, C. We could have used a

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.670
different restriction enzyme.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.850
We then added it to a vector.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.420
The vector was cut open
at an EcoR1 site.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.370
The vector had an origin of
replication, ORI, and the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.030
vector had a resistance marker,
some resistance gene

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.740
that made a protein that could
break down some antibiotic

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.120
found in nature.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.875
We combine these two pieces.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.520
Vector now gets its insert.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.670
We call this vector, we
call this insert.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.292
We attach them together
using what?

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:16.720
AUDIENCE: Ligase.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.280
PROFESSOR: Ligase, the enzyme
that ligates DNA.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.030
We then take this, we transform
it into a bacterium.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.860
The scale is obviously
off, right?

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.750
This DNA plasmid here is tiny
compared to this bacteria.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.400
But if I draw it to scale,
it won't be very helpful.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.640
So we then transform
it in here.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200
We do that in a test tube.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.310
We treat the bacteria a little
roughly so it likes to slurp

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.640
up the DNA.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.650
We then plate it on a plate.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.670
And those bacteria that have
acquired our plasmid

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.800
containing the antibiotic
resistance gene are able to

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.600
grow on this plate that
has antibiotic on it.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.670
And we call this thing
a library.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.320
So that's it.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.769
We can make a library.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.329
And we have in effect,
then, what I said.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.400
We've deluded the individual
molecules out, and each one

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.010
went into its own bacteria, and
each one got replicated by

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.260
that bacteria.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.530
Those plasmids are replicated
by the bacteria.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.090
In fact, we choose plasmids
that are called multicopy

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.320
plasmids, where there's not
just one copy but the cell

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.980
might make 50 copies of it.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.070
We grow up a whole colony
of it and there you go.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.490
We talked about some of
the issues with it.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.650
Where do we get the restriction
enzymes, the

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.830
ligases, the vectors,
et cetera?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.440
It's in the catalog, right?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.940
We used to purify them
ourselves, but they're all in

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.430
the catalog.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.500
So any questions about this?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.350
We had some questions.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.540
I have a question about this.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.860
How come when we add ligase the
vector itself just doesn't

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.190
close up into a circle without
an insert in it?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.520
It might.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.346
What would happen then?

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:21.780
AUDIENCE: You'd just have
your original vector.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.890
PROFESSOR: You'd just have
your original vector.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.174
And what happens when I
transform into the bacteria?

00:05:26.174 --> 00:05:27.620
AUDIENCE: It'll still survive.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.050
PROFESSOR: It'll
still survive.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.920
So will the unimolecular closure
of that circle be more

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.120
common than the bimolecular
interaction between a vector

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.330
and an insert?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.685
AUDIENCE: Probably.

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.500
PROFESSOR: Probably, because the
two ends of the circle are

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.480
pretty close to each other.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.422
So what do I do?

00:05:45.422 --> 00:05:46.418
Yeah?

00:05:46.418 --> 00:05:47.912
AUDIENCE: Because [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:49.904
are the same.

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:50.277
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:52.643
same restriction enzymes
because if they're two

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:54.400
different enzymes so
they don't match.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.970
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.320
That's cute trick.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.620
Two different restriction
enzymes so that

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.090
they couldn't reclose.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.640
But then my fragments better
have those two different

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.530
sites, too, and only be able to
clone those fragments that

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.550
have the two different ones.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.470
But that could work.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.730
So you want a trick for making
sure it doesn't reclose.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.780
Any other tricks?

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.535
But the problem is, I won't get
all the fragments, only

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:20.020
the ones that have, say,
an Eco at a Bam site.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.910
But that's--

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.140
So I bring this up not because
it's particularly important,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.220
but to tell you the kind of
engineering that really does

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.220
have to go on in molecular
biology.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.080
What happens is when you have
your DNA put in here, we have

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.590
a sugar-phosphate backbone
in both cases.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.430
And if we look up close, one
of these sides has the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.210
phosphate, the other
has a hydroxyl.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.830
Phosphate, hydroxyl, phosphate,
hydroxyl, right?

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.640
And ligase comes in
and joins that.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.680
So this guy has a phosphate on
this strand, and this guy has

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.980
a phosphate on that
strand, hydroxyl

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.630
there, hydroxyl there.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.000
What would happen if
I got rid of the

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.580
phosphates on the vector?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.570
Could it reclose?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.540
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.000
PROFESSOR: No.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.770
So if there were an enzyme that
removed phosphates, I

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.410
could treat my vector
first with the

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.530
phosphate-removing enzyme.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.420
And now it couldn't possibly
reclose on itself.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.180
And is there such an enzyme?

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.150
And what's it called?

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.710
Phosphatase, because it takes
phosphates so easy.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.830
Phosphatase, it takes
off the phosphates.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.360
And then it can't
reclose anymore.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.900
And where do we get
phosphatase?

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.700
It's in the catalog.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.740
Exactly.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.220
So now what happens
is that the vector

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.850
only has an OH here.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.030
What happens to ligase?

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.160
When I put an insert in here,
ligase can make a covalent

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.230
join on this strand.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.170
But it can't actually
make a covalent join

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.080
on the other strand.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.580
But does it matter?

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.260
No, because I've closed up my
circle on that strand, and I

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.390
close up the circle there on the
other strand, and I just

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.840
throw it into E. coli.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.510
And you know what happens when
it goes into E. coli?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.370
It's got a nick, obviously,
on that strand.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.500
It hasn't closed up.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.270
But what does E. coli do
when it sees that DNA?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.860
Must be damaged DNA.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.540
I'll fix it.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.380
So E. coli actually does the
last little trick of closing

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.940
that up for you with
its own enzymes for

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.630
repairing its own DNA.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.039
I bring this up not because it's
crucial that you should

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.690
worry about it, but because I
want to know that there's a

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.490
whole layer of these interesting
engineering tricks

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.370
that get developed.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:45.510
Every one of them exploits
enzymes that we know.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.610
Every one of them deals with
questions like, will my vector

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.730
reclose on itself, how
do I avoid that?

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.230
And there's a vast cooking
book of protocols

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.610
in molecular biology.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.230
And we constantly are just
cribbing from things life does

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.180
to make our protocols more
and more efficient.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.710
So I bring it up more because
it's kind of a cool thing that

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.390
all that goes on, and because
it helps you remember that

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.780
these phosphates are
very important to

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.780
joining things up.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.075
That's a digression.

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.310
Now, let's go to the topic.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.460
How do we actually
read the library?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.710
How do we read our library?

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.350
How do we use the library,
read from the library?

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:34.350
Well let's say we're going to
try to find the arginine gene.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.530
We talked about the gene
for arginine in yeast.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.210
So I'd like to clone
the gene for ARG1.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.370
We found mutants before that
were unable to grow without

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.880
supplemental arginine.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.070
They somehow had a defect in
producing their own origin.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.760
It's a mutant.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.220
I want to find the
gene, please.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.500
How do I do it?

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.400
We've got to think about
what's our insert DNA.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.410
What are our vectors?

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.050
What insert DNA should
we start with, zebra?

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.160
No.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.410
Human?

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.370
No.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.110
How about yeast?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.160
We're trying to clone a gene
from yeast, right?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.820
So let's start with yeast.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:17.380
OK.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.780
So we're going to start
with yeast DNA.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.320
We're going to cut
up yeast DNA.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.330
We're going to attach it to
our vector, we're going to

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.100
transform it into E.
coli, E. coli will

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.670
grow up on our plates.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.070
And one of these guys, I happen
to know it's that one

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.860
there, contains the ARG1 gene.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.320
The problem is I happen to
know it, but you don't.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.420
How are you going to find out
where the ARG1 gene is?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.110
Any takers?

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.050
Yeah?

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.948
AUDIENCE: It could be like when
you put the gene in make

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:12.700
it flourescent.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.440
PROFESSOR: A fluorescent tag?

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.580
So I should just attach
the fluorescent

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.280
tag to the ARG1 gene?

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.160
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.970
PROFESSOR: How do I do that?

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.590
All the DNA looks the
same in the tube.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.188
How do I know where to attach
the fluorescent tag?

00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:28.390
AUDIENCE: Maybe you could
size it [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.530
PROFESSOR: There's a lot
of pieces of DNA there.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.824
And my eyes are not that good.

00:11:32.824 --> 00:11:33.650
AUDIENCE: Separate it?

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.960
PROFESSOR: Separate it.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.810
But will I know which
one is ARG1?

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.480
See, I don't actually know
anything about ARG1.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.870
All I know is I made a mutant.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.370
The mutant is unable to
grow without arginine.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.800
I haven't got a clue
what that gene is.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.040
I don't know what it encodes, I
don't know how big it is, I

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.550
don't know nothing.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.430
All I know is that whatever it
is, it's a gene which when

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.176
mutated prevents you from
growing without arginine.

00:11:58.176 --> 00:12:01.032
AUDIENCE: Could you plate all
of your colonies onto a--

00:12:01.032 --> 00:12:03.412
could you put [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:04.510
PROFESSOR: Minimal medium.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.740
What if I plate on
minimal medium?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.740
Now what?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.665
What are you hoping for?

00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:14.560
AUDIENCE: The one that has the
ARG1 gene will not grow.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.760
PROFESSOR: The one that
has the ARG1 gene

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.180
won't be able to grow--

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.170
oh wait, yeah.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.810
But something like that.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.850
Let's work it through.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.830
We've got my idea here.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.992
What are we going
to do with it?

00:12:26.992 --> 00:12:28.242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.830
PROFESSOR: I've got a working
ARG1 Mutate ARG1 afterwards?

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.350
How will that work?

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.170
I'm open for--

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.340
got an idea here?

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.116
AUDIENCE: If you have your
different colonies

00:12:46.116 --> 00:12:50.456
[INAUDIBLE], you could have a
secondary plate them all over

00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:51.440
to one of middle medium.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.160
The ones that die are the ones
that already [INAUDIBLE]--

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.850
PROFESSOR: So guys,
I have a concern.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.190
I'm just transferring
this into E. coli.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.490
E.coli grows just fine
without arginine.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.800
I mean, I'm going to take
this yeast DNA.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.880
I'm going to put
it in E. coli.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.290
E. coli was kind enough
to grow it for me.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.800
But frankly, E. coli doesn't
need this ARG1 gene.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.200
E. coli can grow without
arginine.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.520
I can plate this with and
without arginine, E. coli

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.930
grows just fine.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.150
But you're on to something.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.140
You're onto the idea that
somehow, the only thing we

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:34.120
know about ARG1 is that the
functional, wild-type copy of

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.570
that gene confers an ability
to grow without arginine.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.110
And who does it confer it on?

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.820
And what kind of yeast?

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.420
Haploid mutant yeast.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.570
Ah.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:57.310
So suppose I put a working copy
of ARG1, a good copy, a

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.770
wild-type copy, into
a mutant yeast.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.080
Now what would happen to
that mutant yeast?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:08.780
What would happen?

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.260
The mutant yeast before, could
it grow without arginine?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.100
No.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.990
If I put in a working
copy of the ARG1

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.650
gene, what will happen?

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.320
It grows.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.720
Now let's design a scheme.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.040
Do I want to use
E. coli at all?

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.870
No.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.226
What do I want to use?

00:14:34.226 --> 00:14:35.670
I want to use a yeast.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.330
So let's get rid of E. coli and
let's instead use yeast.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.140
And which yeast should we use,
wild-type or mutant?

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.280
Mutant yeast.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.280
What mutation?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.210
ARG1 mutant yeast.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.000
ARG1 minus yeast.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.740
Now, if I plate ARG1 minus
yeast on minimal

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.330
medium, what happens?

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.830
It doesn't grow.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.520
It dies.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.585
What DNA should I
be putting in?

00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:11.070
Yeast DNA.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.370
Mutant or wild type?

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.110
Why wild type?

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.070
Because it'll have a working
copy of ARG1.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.600
So I want yeast, wild type.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.410
Now what happens?

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.680
One of these guys, and only one
of these guys here, this

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.970
one, has a ARG1 gene.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.840
That's ARG1.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:40.720
When it goes in, that plasmid
has the ARG1 plus gene,

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.430
whereas other plasmids don't.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.550
That cell that inherits that
gene there, that gets that

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.320
gene, is not green.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.050
I just drew it green for you.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.850
But it has the ARG1 gene.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.950
And when I plate this on
minimal medium, what's

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.650
distinctive about it?

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.280
It grows.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.470
That's how you can clone
the ARG1 gene.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.910
You clone it by the only thing
you know about it.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.520
Namely, it confers a function.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.880
This is called cloning
by function.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:22.290
Or, what did we do when we
crossed two mutants together

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.500
to see if things were
in different genes?

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.990
It was a test of
complementation.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.040
Really what we're asking is,
is there a plasmid that

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.400
complements the defect?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.180
In effect what's happening is
in this cell, right here, we

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.760
have a yeast cell.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.470
And the yeast cell has
a defect in its ARG1.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.760
But the plasmid has
a working ARG1.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.140
So for that one gene, this cell
could be thought of maybe

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.700
a little bit like a diploid,
just at that one gene.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.569
And we've done a
complementation, just a teeny

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.780
little complementation
for one gene.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.920
And we could call this cloning
complementation.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.405
It's essentially cloning
by function.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.190
Any questions?

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.884
Yes?

00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:36.369
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:40.345
--they all have functioning
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:40.345 --> 00:17:41.836
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:17:41.836 --> 00:17:44.840
AUDIENCE: So why does that
then have a function?

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.520
PROFESSOR: Oh, oh.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.800
You see, the yeast genome has
about 4,000 different genes.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.910
I chop it up with my EcoR1.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:56.090
Some plasmids get ARG1 but most
of them get leucine 2 or

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.460
or other things.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.040
And each yeast cell in my
library only picks up a

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.160
plasmid with one chunk
of DNA, one gene.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.180
So it turns out that the yeast
cells in my library, each one

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.080
has one of thousands of
alternative possibilities.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.480
And it's just the guy who
gets ARG1 who grows.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.360
AUDIENCE: But you're saying
that the yeast [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.320
plasmid.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.210
All code for--

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.780
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.570
AUDIENCE: But I don't get why
you would end up with

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.500
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.250
PROFESSOR: What do I--?

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.162
AUDIENCE: Why do you end
up with a strain

00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:30.600
that has ARG1 in it?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.090
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.830
ARG1 is the ARG1 working copy.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.350
In the yeast, I'm talking about
this yeast here has the

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.160
working copy of ARG1,
ARG1 plus.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.200
So this guy has an ARG1 plus.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.610
It also has lots
of other genes.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.330
Each of these plasmids
gets one gene.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.150
Some of them get an ARG plus.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.500
Some of them happen to get a
leucine gene or some other

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.690
gene that's irrelevant.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.544
And the plasmids that contain
the working copy of the gene,

00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:04.600
they, when they go into the
cell, give the cell the

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.930
ability to grow.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.005
So that's why.

00:19:07.005 --> 00:19:07.710
All right.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.980
So that's how we get
a gene by function.
