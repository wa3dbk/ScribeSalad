00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.540
PROFESSOR: So now I have this.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.066
And what I need to do is
I need to transform.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:28.200
So I need to take E.coli
growing in a test tube.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.510
And I need to put into it a
whole collection of zillions

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.710
and zillions of plasmid
molecules, plasmid circles

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.070
that all have different
pieces of human DNA.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.260
One of these things might
have ARG1, one ARG2,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.630
one ARG3, et cetera.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.680
Or if it's human DNA, one of
them your hemoglobin, one of

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.420
them your collagen, whatever.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.390
I have to throw the DNA on
top of the bacteria.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.210
And then I need to come up with
some engineering trick to

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.570
make the bacteria take up this
DNA across their cell

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.630
membranes and use it.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.460
Why should I be able to
persuade bacteria

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.656
to take up my DNA?

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:20.620
AUDIENCE: They do it anyway.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.570
PROFESSOR: They do it anyway.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.550
Remember, we said they
like to exchange DNA.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.710
That's kind of their
thing, right?

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.060
They pick up DNA from their
environment anyway.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.440
See, as usual, we haven't really
invented something.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.780
What we've done is we have
used the natural property

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.970
that's out there.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.690
The natural properties, bacteria
like to slurp up DNA.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.520
Now in fairness, some pretty
cool protocols were developed

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.050
that improve the ability
to do it.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.290
You treat the DNA,
a little nastily.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.720
You give it certain ions.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.640
You heat shock it in
a certain way.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.420
And then it encourages it
to slurp up DNA better.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.410
But the ability to slurp
up DNA was there

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.580
in the first place.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.630
We couldn't have given it the
ability to slurp up DNA if it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.200
wasn't there.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.840
But we can always goose it up,
improve it in certain ways.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.500
And there are great protocols
that were developed in order

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.510
to be able to increase the
efficiency of such

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.150
transformation.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.670
So now we now have our E.coli.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.800
Here's an E.coli.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.160
Some of the E.coli have acquired
a plasmid containing

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.130
human DNA or maybe, if we
used yeast, yeast DNA.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.890
Some of them have it, right?

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.550
Because it's kind of
a random process.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.910
Some slurp it up,
some haven't.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.240
So I might have, I don't know,
maybe one in 100 of my cells

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.520
will have slurped up DNA.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.500
But 99 in 100 won't have
slurped up DNA.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.530
I want to plate these out on a
Petri plate and grow them up

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.710
into individual colonies.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.000
But I would like it to be the
case, please, that the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.750
individual colonies that grow up
are only the ones that got

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.190
my plasmid.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.840
I really don't want to see
all these guys who

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.210
didn't get my plasmid.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.980
So what do I do?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.630
Do I go in there with a
microscope and try to figure

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.528
out which ones got my
human DNA plasmid?

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.410
So I would love to plate it out
and only have the guys who

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.660
got my plasmid grow.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.030
How do I arrange that only
the guys who got my

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.280
plasmid will grow?

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.060
Sorry?

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.860
PROFESSOR: For something.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.160
I got to put in a gene into that
plasmid so that only the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.530
guys who get that will grow.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.086
Any ideas for what gene
might go in there?

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:57.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.746
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:03:57.746 --> 00:03:59.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.420
PROFESSOR: How about a gene
conferring resistance to an

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.410
antibiotic.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.270
And then what could I do?

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.520
Well, I could plate.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.980
I'm going to select--

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.290
see this E.coli here,
it had my plasmid.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.150
And it's going to have a
drug resistance gene.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.080
And it will grow up.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.565
This guy over here, he didn't
get a drug resistance gene.

00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:30.360
He doesn't grow up.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.780
The only ones who grow up
have a drug resistant--

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.950
wait a second.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.617
Why doesn't this guy grow up?

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.090
AUDIENCE: You add the drug.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.170
PROFESSOR: Oh, I got to add
the drug, good point.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.110
So what I'm going to do is I
add my drug to the plate.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.960
I add my drug to the medium,
to the Petri plate here.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.170
And now my Petri plate is say
a penicillin plate or a

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.740
streptomycin plate or a
ampicillin plate or a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.150
kanamycin plate or whatever.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.300
And then the only things that
could grow up are the ones

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.110
that have resistance to whatever
antibiotic I used.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.580
So I grow them up
on that plate.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.910
And they grew up just fine.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.960
The ones who didn't get-- now
how did I get that antibiotic

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.238
gene into the plasmid?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.890
It actually comes that way
in nature, sort of.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.050
Now when I get good,
I can move them

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.430
around from one to another.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.310
But nature thought
of it first.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.630
Nature gave us something that
had an origin of replication

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.060
and an antibiotic
resistance gene.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.840
And we could just add
things to it.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.640
It had everything we needed.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.390
It had the ability
to slurp up DNA.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.730
It had the ability to confer a
new property on the cells like

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.370
resistance to antibiotics.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.510
And when we're done, we
have a library here.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:11.420
And we call this a library of
cells or colonies, each one of

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.040
which has a distinct piece of
human DNA, each one of which

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.600
has a different piece
of human DNA.

00:06:20.987 --> 00:06:23.190
Let me stop and ask,
any questions?

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.040
This is like one of the coolest

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.830
new procedures invented.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.830
Yes?

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.763
AUDIENCE: Is it possible that
the same E.coli takes in two

00:06:29.763 --> 00:06:31.470
of the things?

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.750
PROFESSOR: Is it possible that
same E.coli takes in two?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.000
Yes, turns out we do this at a
dilution in a way so that most

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.170
take up zero, some take up one,
and a couple take up two.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.960
And what we say there
is, oh well.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.990
It's not so common.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.590
And we live with it.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.158
What else?

00:06:55.158 --> 00:06:58.152
AUDIENCE: You need to make sure
the bacteria that doesn't

00:06:58.152 --> 00:06:59.650
already have a resistance
to it?

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.990
PROFESSOR: I better use a
bacteria that's not already

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.750
resistant to this antibiotic,
good point.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.490
That's right.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.040
And I can do that.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.993
Yes?

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:09.965
AUDIENCE: When making those
vectors, how do you make sure

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:13.662
it only cuts once so you can put
one piece of human DNA and

00:07:13.662 --> 00:07:14.895
it doesn't break apart?

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:20.790
PROFESSOR: Oh, so what if the
vector had five EcoR1 sites?

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.170
People have engineered them
to just have one.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.500
In fact, what they've really
done now is they engineer them

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.260
so that within the vector
there's a little region,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.370
called a polylinker, that has
many different sites for many

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.470
different restriction enzymes,
depending on which one you

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.170
might want to use.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.130
And they're all right over
here in the same place.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.670
And they go around and
they fix the vector.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.730
So it doesn't have any
of the others.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.740
You could, for example cut it
open and change the sequence a

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:47.040
little bit.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.810
All these tools are
available to us.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.510
And rather than you
having to do it,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.590
they're all in the catalog.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.300
The catalog has vectors that
have polylinkers, don't have

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.650
any other cut sites, et cetera.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.132
Yes?

00:07:57.132 --> 00:08:00.604
AUDIENCE: How do you isolate the
sequence you want if the

00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:03.090
cutting sequence
is so frequent?

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.210
PROFESSOR: Oh, so you're
asking two questions.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.290
One is you're asking how do I
find the particular thing I'm

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.390
looking for on the plate
amongst the millions of

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.080
colonies that might grow up?

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.320
Or are you asking if the
cutting sequence is so

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.770
frequent, how do I avoid cutting
in the middle of the

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.020
sequence I want?

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.945
AUDIENCE: Well both, I guess.

00:08:25.945 --> 00:08:30.470
If you want to replicate human
genes, if you have a bunch of

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.905
DNA, how can you make
it so that you

00:08:32.905 --> 00:08:35.830
isolate only that gene?

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.530
PROFESSOR: OK, so now there
are really two questions

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.120
you're asking.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.220
They're both really
good questions.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.530
One, I take my human DNA.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.970
And let's say we're trying
to clone the gene for

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.680
beta-globin.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.890
Beta-globin is a part
of hemoglobin.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.280
It's one of the two proteins
in hemoglobin.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:06.710
And let's say the beta-globin
gene is a certain length.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:12.820
And suppose the beta-globin
gene actually has several

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.070
EcoR1 sites.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.380
I'm going to chop it up
into multiple pieces.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.250
That's bad, right?

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.370
That's step one bad.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.620
How do I avoid that?

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.130
Sorry?

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.540
AUDIENCE: Paste it.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.160
PROFESSOR: Paste it again.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.960
Oh no, once I cut it, all the
pieces of human DNA are

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.700
floating around.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.090
How do I know what
to paste to what?

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:41.470
AUDIENCE: Methylate it.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.630
PROFESSOR: Methylate it.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.800
So first I could take
my human DNA.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.470
And I could methylate it.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.030
Then it won't get cut
up by the enzyme.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.120
But what's the problem
with that?

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.640
None of it will get cut
up with the enzyme.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.620
Suppose I did something that
was a compromise though.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:05.890
Suppose I added a little
methylase and a little

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.180
restriction enzyme.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.700
And the methylase went around
randomly and put some

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.020
methyl groups on.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.640
Then these wouldn't get cut.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.620
And sometimes it might
put on that.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.010
And those wouldn't get cut.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.260
And it would just
get cut here.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.805
I would call such a thing
a partial digestion.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.810
It can be done one
of two ways.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.380
I could just add a little bit of
restriction enzyme and not

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.630
give it too long.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.800
Or I could add a mixture of a
little restriction enzyme, a

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.730
little methylation enzyme,
and let them have at it.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.540
And if I had the right balance,
I could cut on

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.730
average every second restriction
site or on average

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.880
every fourth restriction site.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.970
Or if I use a different ratio,
every tenth restriction site.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.382
So I actually can play a
stochastic, a probabilistic

00:11:00.382 --> 00:11:05.490
game of cutting every second,
fourth, tenth site and

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.420
obviously get a mix.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.250
I'll get a mixture of
different cuts.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.450
But in terms of cutting in the
middle of my gene, I no longer

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.010
care because I can do
partial digestions.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.130
Now that means that in my
library I might not just have

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.270
the Eco fragments.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.820
But because I did a partial
digestion, I might have two

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.130
consecutive or five consecutive
Eco fragments, if

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.700
I've done a partial digestion.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.860
But your question
still stands.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.740
How do I find my right gene?

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.640
How do I figure out which
is the right gene?

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.430
So I've got this.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.680
I've got my plate.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.820
I've done this amazing
purification.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.320
Every one of these guys has a
chunk of human DNA that might

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.090
be just one EcoR1 fragment.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.430
Or if I happen to have done a
partial digestion, it might be

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.450
two EcoR1 fragments.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:04.262
But it turns out that this
guy here is beta-globin.

00:12:04.262 --> 00:12:05.970
How do I know?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.050
I've purified beta-globin.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.430
I get points, right?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.070
I purified beta-globin.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.930
Somewhere on my plate is a pure

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.520
beta-globin sitting there.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.180
But the problem is I don't
know where it is.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.890
How am I going to find it?

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.080
They all still look the same.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.330
They look like bacteria.

00:12:25.867 --> 00:12:27.791
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:29.864
PROFESSOR: To do what?

00:12:29.864 --> 00:12:33.343
AUDIENCE: Well, in this case
find some way to determine

00:12:33.343 --> 00:12:37.330
whether or not a certain certain
has beta-globin.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.300
PROFESSOR: Whether a
certain colony--

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.500
AUDIENCE: Has beta-globin.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.610
PROFESSOR: Has the beta-globin
gene in it.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.330
So I somehow have to test each
colony to figure out whether

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.780
it's got the beta-globin
gene in it.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.070
How do you propose to do that?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.090
AUDIENCE: There's some
observation you can make.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:58.605
PROFESSOR: Talk loud.

00:12:58.605 --> 00:13:01.160
AUDIENCE: There's some
observation you can make.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.910
PROFESSOR: And you make
that observation.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.460
Right, so--

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:05.960
I'm with you.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.918
Yeah?

00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:09.313
AUDIENCE: You basically
want some ribosomes

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:10.750
to create the proteins.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.870
PROFESSOR: Oh, oh, oh, so maybe
I can make that thing

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.860
make beta-globin.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.190
Oh, and then look
for the protein.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.960
Problem with that is E.coli
doesn't read human

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.360
instructions.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.030
So E.coli's polymerase
won't read.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.960
But it's a great idea.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.940
Maybe we can do that.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.590
Any other ideas?

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.360
How are we going to
find our gene?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.410
We've made a library.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.100
We have a library.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.790
It's a bigger library
than MIT.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.630
It's got more volumes
than MIT.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:33.980
How are we're going
to find our book?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.820
AUDIENCE: Put it in a medium
without beta-globin.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.932
PROFESSOR: Put a medium
without beta-globin.

00:13:39.932 --> 00:13:40.900
AUDIENCE: See if it
grows or not.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.390
PROFESSOR: See if it grows up.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.700
E.coli couldn't care less
about beta-globin.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.800
It doesn't need beta-globin.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.060
And in addition, it won't
produce beta-globin because it

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.480
doesn't read the human
instructions.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.960
All right, so we've gone
to all this trouble.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.680
We've made a library with all
the possible books in the

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.380
human genome.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.170
And we don't know how
to use the library.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.190
Friday's lecture let us discuss

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.440
how to use the library.
