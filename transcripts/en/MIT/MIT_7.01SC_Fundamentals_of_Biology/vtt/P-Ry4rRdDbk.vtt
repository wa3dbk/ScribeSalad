00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.550
PROFESSOR: So here's
what we did.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.710
We found mutants that
effect biochemistry.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.330
That's one way to make the
connection between

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.830
function and gene.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.920
But if we want to go the other
way, we now have to do the

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.380
biochemistry of genetics.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.960
What's biochemistry about?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.210
It's purifying things
in a test tube.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.810
What's genetics about?

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.240
Heredity.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.630
So what do we have to do?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.020
We have to purify heredity
in a test tube.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.600
But that's it.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700
That's what we have to do.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.730
If we're going to make that
connection in that direction,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.990
all we need is to take a cell,
grind it up, and purify not

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.910
the enzyme that digests
a sugar, but heredity.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.120
We need to get a pure
tube of heredity.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.674
You can imagine that this wasn't
an obvious thing to do,

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:07.460
how you get a pure
tube of heredity.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.910
The problem is you
need an assay.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.470
If you want to find an
enzyme that digests a

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.710
sugar, you have an acid.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.560
You purify different fraction,
you make different fractions

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.450
of a cell you see which fraction
of the cell is able

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.100
to digest the sugar.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.330
But if I make different
fractions of the cell, it's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.250
not obvious how I figure out
which fraction of the cell has

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.780
heredity in it.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.320
And yet, that's exactly
what was done, and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.800
that's today's lecture.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.725
So purifying heredity.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.055
The discovery of the
transforming principle.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.390
By the transforming principle,
I don't mean an

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.250
idea, like a principle.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.850
I mean a substance.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.199
This is an old medieval kind
of word, a principle.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.400
It's kind of a Harry Potteresque
kind of word or

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.800
something like that of what is
the transforming principle,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.600
the transforming substance.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.050
It's the kind of word alchemists
would like to use,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.960
but it was actually what's
attached to this, and it was

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.610
called at the time the
transforming principle, the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.240
transforming substance.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.660
And it really is the work in
1928 of a young scientist F.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.970
Griffiths in London.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.180
Griffiths was particularly
interested in studying the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.680
bacteria pneumococcus.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.030
Why was Griffith so interested
in studying the bacteria

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.500
pneumococcus?

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.220
Well, not so long before in
1918, there had been the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.570
terrible Spanish influenza
epidemic that had killed

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.200
millions of people around the
world, the worst flu ever.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.660
Millions of people died by
this flew, and one of the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.310
reasons they died when they
have the flu was they got

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.200
pneumococcal infections.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.140
Griffiths was trying to make a
vaccine against pneumococcus,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.870
a pretty good idea trying to
make a vaccine against

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.130
pneumococcus.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.400
Pneumococcus highly virulent
stuff, but particularly if

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.220
you're compromised
by the influenza.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.510
So what did he do?

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.640
Well, Griffiths had a strain
of pneumococcus.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.550
He didn't, by the way, infect
people with it.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.570
He infected mice with it, that
being considered a somewhat

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.980
more ethical way to
do the experiment.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.610
So he had a strain of
pneumococcus that had a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.900
smooth, glistening coat.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.710
When you looked at it, it
was smooth and white and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.430
glistened, the colonies
that it made

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.750
smooth, white, glistened.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.780
And it was virulent.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.350
If you inject it into a mouse,
the mouse got pneumococcus

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.970
infection, and it died.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.180
It turns out we now know
that it has a beautiful

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.760
polysaccharide coat around it
that provides resistance to

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.780
the host's immune system,
et cetera.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.610
He also had a strain
of pneumococcus

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.380
that had a rough coat.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.660
It was not glistening.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.110
It was kind of dull looking,
and it was non-virulent.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.570
He injected it into a
mouse, mouse lives.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.550
It happens to be the case that
we now know that it had a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.190
mutation in a gene that produced
that coat, but that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.060
doesn't much matter.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.120
It didn't produce that
polysaccharide, and therefore,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.880
was more easily fought off
by the immune system.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.130
So Griffiths does the following
experiment.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:47.750
He takes his smooth, virulent
bacteria, he injects it into a

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.070
mouse, that's a mouse.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.300
And what happens to the mouse?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.620
AUDIENCE: Dies.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.870
PROFESSOR: Dies.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.180
Exactly.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.250
That's a dead mouse.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.220
And one of the easier assays
in molecular biology is the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.210
feet up, feet down assay.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.380
All right.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.910
Dead mouse.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.120
Now, what does he do?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.800
He takes the rough,
non-virulent, he injects it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.335
into a mouse, and
what happens?

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.800
Lives.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.460
Right?

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.710
Lives.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.790
Then what he does, he takes the
smooth, virulent and he

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.860
bakes it in an autoclave.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.845
He heat kills this bacteria.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.260
Now, this heat-killed, dead,
virulent bacteria when

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.770
injected into a mouse, what
happens to the mouse?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.650
It's alive.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.130
The mouse is fine.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.000
The bacteria was dead.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.300
And then he does the following
truly weird experiment.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.440
He takes the absolutely
harmless, rough, non-virulent

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:19.800
bacteria but alive, plus the
smooth, virulent bacteria that

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.960
has been killed by heat,
heat-killed.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.100
The rough stuff is harmless.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.240
The smooth heat-killed
stuff, harmless.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.440
Both are harmless.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.690
We've shown the mouse can
live with this injected.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.700
It can live with
this injected.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.700
He injects it into the mouse,
and what happens?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.950
Dead mouse.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.350
Very surprising.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.320
Not only that, when he takes the
blood of the dead mouse,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.130
he can culture out of it.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.370
He can culture on a Petri plate
from this dead mouse

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.760
live, smooth, virulent
bacteria.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.970
How did that happen?

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.420
Somehow, we didn't have any
live, smooth bacteria.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.575
We had dead, smooth bacteria.

00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:22.750
We had live non-virulent
bacteria.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:29.680
Somehow, the dead stuff
transformed the live harmless

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.120
stuff into virulence.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.030
It transformed it.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.030
The substance, the unknown
substance that transformed it

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.980
was referred to as the
transforming principle or

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.000
transforming stuff.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.840
And now we have biochemistry
because we have an assay.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.660
We could take the dead, virulent
bacteria and break it

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.120
up into fractions and see
which substance, which

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.050
fraction, is it a protein?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.880
Is it a carbohydrate?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.840
Is it nucleic acid?

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.090
Is it something, is the
transforming substance and

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.960
purify heredity because we
have seen the transfer of

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.950
heredity to the harmless
bacteria.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.590
There is an assay.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.530
The minute there's an assay,
you could do biochemistry.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.060
Now, the problem was the assay
was painfully slow.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.370
You had to grind up the dead
bacteria, you had to

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.300
demonstrate by mixing it
together, putting it into a

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.240
mouse, waiting months, and then
you had to get a further

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.020
sub fraction.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.000
It was just painfully slow.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.860
All this mouse stuff
and all that.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.070
And Griffiths didn't make much
progress through the 1930s,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.820
but he kept going at it.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.360
And I suspect might have gotten
there except for the

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.850
fact that in 1941, his lab was
hit by a German bomb during a

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.360
blitz, and he died.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.440
And so Griffiths never saw the
result of this, but he did

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.620
purify fractions and all that.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.410
But thank goodness others
picked it up.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.180
He was again, Griffiths
was a great guy.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.250
He worked in World War I, worked
during World War II on

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.370
important public health
problems, and really lays this

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.660
foundation, but never really
purified what the final

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.240
substance was because he
died in a bombing.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.060
But then you get in 1943, during
World War II, folks

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.930
working in New York City at
Rockefeller University, then

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:36.040
Rockefeller Institute, Avery,
McCarty, and MacLeod continue

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.620
this work, and they do
it without the mouse.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.570
Because what they do is they
grind up the virulent stuff

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.180
and they sprinkle it on the
living stuff, the living

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.290
bacteria and played it out,
and just looked for the

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.370
appearance of colonies
that are transformed.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.980
Skip the mouse.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.790
Skipping the mouse makes it a
lot easier, because you can do

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.080
those experiments
pretty quickly.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.570
Bacteria grow quickly.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.090
Same basic idea.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:10.830
Purify the stuff from the smooth
dead stuff, grind it

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.740
up, put it in different
fractions, apply them, and

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.900
then sprinkle them on a
plate, and look for

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.120
the occasional colony.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.300
And now you're just going to
look for a fraction of the

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.970
material that has the capability
to produce some

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.460
smooth colonies.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.270
Well, they did that, and they
purified it, and the purified

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.060
it, and they purified it, and
they purified it, and they

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:35.230
eventually found that the
particular type of molecule

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.280
that they purified appeared
to be DNA.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:52.660
But when they purified fractions
containing DNA,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.620
these fractions had the
ability to transform.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.610
Wow.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.100
You might immediately say,
that's the transforming

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.070
principle, DNA.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.130
That's the transforming
substance.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.380
What do you think the
reaction was?

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.220
Skepticism.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.590
First, it should be
noted it's 1943.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.210
People were busy at
the time, right?

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.040
We're in the middle
World War II.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.280
It wasn't exactly top on
people's minds, but there was

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.430
enormous skepticism
scientifically of those people

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.420
who did follow the work.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.950
Why?

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:45.020
Because the one thing they knew
was that DNA was truly a

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.770
boring molecule.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.330
It was understood by all smart
people that DNA was an

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:54.200
incredibly boring structural
molecule that had none of the

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.840
fascinating diversity and
richness of proteins.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.660
Proteins could do zillions
of different things.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.730
DNA, you know, it's
just scaffolding.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.930
Why?

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.090
What is the structure of DNA?

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.310
So let's turn to the structure
of DNA to see why it is that

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.570
people were not impressed.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.210
Of course, when people are not
impressed, you purified

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.580
something and you show it
transforms, what do you say to

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.000
Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.610
How do you express
your skepticism?

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.360
You say, it's very good.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.220
You've purified this and it
contains DNA, but is it

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:35.570
absolutely totally 100% pure or
is it possible that you've

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.550
carried along in the fraction
that you have purified some

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.610
other trace quantity of a highly
potent protein that is

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.290
really causing heredity?

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.200
And of course, that's the
problem is you can never prove

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.950
that there's not a teeny smidgen
of something in there.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.280
You can only show how pure it
is, but you can never rule

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.060
something out.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.490
So when people want to sort
of dis your biochemistry

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.480
experiments, it's always easy
to say, it was probably

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.290
something else in there too you
just don't know about it.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.230
And that was what the
answer was to them.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.300
But let's look at the
structure of DNA.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.580
So DNA has three important
components

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.050
which we need to learn.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.095
A, it has a sugar called
2 prime deoxyribose.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.940
So ribose is a 5-carbon sugar.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.590
A five-part carbon sugar
is a pentose.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.770
So this is a sugar, in fact a
pentose, pentose of course

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.600
five, pentose meaning it's a
5-carbon sugar, but it lacks a

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.870
hydroxyl group.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.490
So it's just slightly
different from

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.690
the 5-carbon sugar.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:46.485
And we draw it in this
configuration where there is

00:13:46.485 --> 00:13:52.620
the 1 prime carbon here, the 2
prime carbon here, the 3 prime

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.660
carbon here, the 4 prime carbon
here, the 5 prime

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.940
carbon here.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.820
That's very important to know.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.550
We've got an oxygen up here.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:10.200
Here, we have an OH and an H.
Here, we have an H and an OH.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:20.990
Here we have H. Here we
have our OH, H, H.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:25.040
But here we should have
a hydroxyl off every

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.110
carbon, and we don't.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:35.280
Only here are deoxy.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.030
That's the only difference from
this being a perfectly

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.440
normal ribose, deoxy at
the 2 prime position.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.390
Big deal.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:51.260
Now, the next component of DNA
that you need to know about

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.890
are these nitrogenous bases.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:08.730
So hanging off our
ribose is a base.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:24.940
This base has carbons, oxygens,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.920
hydrogens, and nitrogens.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:42.830
And they come in four flavors,
adenine, A, guanine, G,

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:54.880
thymine, T, cytosine, C. A, T,
C and G, and we'll look at

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.700
their structure in
just a moment.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:03.690
Then the next important part
if we look at this

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:18.450
conceptually, is that hanging
off here, we have a

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.700
triphosphate.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.290
We have a triphosphate.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.315
So this is the monomer for
making DNA, triphosphate.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.110
We have a sugar, the sugar in
exactly the same place off the

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:57.900
1 prime carbon there has a base,
off the 5 prime carbon,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.090
we have a triphosphate.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:04.240
What's the triphosphate
good for?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.859
Energy.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:08.200
We're going to do a
polymerization, and that's

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.010
going to contribute the energy
for the polymerization, and

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.700
that's pretty much it.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.089
That's the way to
think about DNA.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:22.690
So when we do our polymerization
now, we

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:44.706
polymerize and we get base,
CH2, phosphate.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:55.050
And then coming down this way
attached here, we have our

00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:12.890
phosphate, and that attaches
to the 5 prime carbon here,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.840
and onward that way.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:28.170
So notice that our polymer goes
from a 5-prime carbon

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:35.710
here, 3-prime carbon here,
5-prime carbon here, 3-prime

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.390
carbon there.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.530
And we go sugar, phosphate,
sugar, phosphate, sugar,

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.240
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,
5-prime attachment, 3-prime

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.430
attachment, 5-prime attachment,
3-prime

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:48.370
attachment.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.680
That's DNA.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.630
Pretty boring.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.060
The same sugar, same phosphates
strung together,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.850
totally boring.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:02.270
The only difference
are these bases.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.860
And there's only four of them,
and they're not very

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.582
impressive.

00:19:06.582 --> 00:19:10.460
They're pretty boring,
these bases.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.920
There are purines.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.900
The A and G are purines,
and their ring

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.750
structure looks like this.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:24.590
This is six-membered ring and
there's a five-membered ring.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:31.870
There are pyrimidines, T and
C, and they just have a

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.120
six-membered ring.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.890
They've got carbons, and
oxygens, and nitrogens, and

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.510
hydrogens, and they
don't differ

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.630
really in their charges.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.670
By compared to the amino acids,
positive charges,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.820
negative charges, hydrophobic
groups,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.660
sulfurs that are reactive.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.230
Amino acids, that's
impressive.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.030
Those 20 different side chains
have wildly different chemical

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.820
properties.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.510
These form measly bases, have
essentially, the same chemical

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.300
properties.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.240
There's nothing very different
about their chemical

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.410
properties and therefore, all
smart right-thinking people

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.220
recognize the DNA
could not be a

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.800
particularly interesting molecule.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.020
It had to be largely
a structural

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.850
molecule of some sort.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.400
So when Avery, McCarty, and
MacLeod tell us ah, the

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.695
transforming principle of
DNA, nobody's impressed.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.500
But of course, it's
World War II.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.020
People are busy.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.670
Lot of things going on.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.810
And not that long afterwards,
not that long afterwards,

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.400
another really important
experiment gets done in the

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:56.515
early 1950s, the Hershey-Chase
experiment.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.260
Hershey is not the candy bar.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.500
It is Alfred Hershey
and Martha Chase.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.680
Martha Chase and Alfred Hershey
do a cool experiment.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.780
People were studying something
else at the time.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.060
They were studying the viruses
that infect bacteria,

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.470
bacterial viruses.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:35.670
So it turns out just like you
may get a viral infection, E.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.540
coli gets viral infections
too.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.440
It usually dies of them or at
least often dies of viral

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.830
infection, not necessarily
usually, I take that back,

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.300
sometimes dies of viral
infections.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:54.120
So that is a virus, actually,
greatly magnified, glommed on

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.710
to E. coli, virus E. coli.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:06.560
What happens is, if you mix
the virus with E. coli, it

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.850
gloms on, and then if you wait
a little while giving it a

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.880
happy medium to grow in, the E.
coli some time later, half

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.760
an hour later maybe, bursts
open, dead, and spews out

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.140
zillions of viral particles
which could go on

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.080
to infect new cells.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.180
How does it do that?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.470
How does it instruct E. coli
to make viral particles?

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.070
It must be bringing
information.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.080
It's having progeny.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.100
It is passing on heredity too.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.940
It has some transforming
information.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:47.310
Where is the transforming
principle in the little virus?

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.560
It gloms on to the cell somehow
gives something into

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:56.210
the cell, and poof, 20 minutes
later, half an hour later,

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.060
lots of viruses.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.360
Where's the information
carried?

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.030
Now, this was a much
simpler system.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:05.780
This system, you're asking
what's in the bacterial virus.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.170
There's not a lot in
a bacterial virus.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.750
It's not like a cell that
have zillions of things.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.110
The bacterial virus is a
pretty simple particle.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:32.890
The bacteria virus consists of
protein coat, proteins are on

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:38.305
the outside, DNA
on the inside.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.490
That's it.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.070
You don't have a lot to work
with, a limited number of

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:47.390
proteins, DNA in the middle.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.890
These things just as an aside
were thought to kind of like

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.030
eat bacteria.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:56.040
Because they were thought to
eat bacteria in a way by at

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.470
least the early things, they're
called bacteriophage,

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.720
bacteriophage.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.390
The word phage means to eat.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:11.690
So you may hear me talking about
bacteriophage, meaning

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.520
eaters of bacteria.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.620
Indeed, actually there was some
nutty ideas in the 1920s

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.860
and 1930s when bacteriophage
were first discovered that the

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.710
way to cure a bacterial
infection was to drink a lot

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.960
of bacteriophage.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.660
They would kill the bacteria.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.190
It's a thought.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.570
People actually tried
these things.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.830
Anyway, it turns out not
to be such a good idea.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.970
So Hershey and Chase decided
we're going to figure out

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:39.690
which is it?

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.650
Is it the DNA or is
it the protein?

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.560
How do you find out?

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:50.820
Yeah?

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.480
PROFESSOR: Put in only protein,
and see what happens.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.930
So take the bacteriophage,
purify it from

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.500
protein verses DNA.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.730
I've got a pure component of the
protein, I sprinkle it on,

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.800
nothing happens.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:17.080
I take the DNA, I sprinkle
it on, nothing happens.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.920
Neither works.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.170
Why is that?

00:25:22.278 --> 00:25:25.659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:29.370
PROFESSOR: The shape, those
little feet in the shape were

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.060
critical for the
pathogenicity.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.840
So when we grind up the virus,
it doesn't work anymore.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.800
It's a great idea.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.740
If it worked, bingo, we'd have
it, and that should be the

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.400
first experiment we do
because it's so easy.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.430
But it turned out not to work.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.830
Yes?

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:47.315 --> 00:25:50.680
PROFESSOR: Put a chemical marker
on the protein, put a

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.490
chemical marker on the DNA,
and see which one

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.000
goes into the cell.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.250
What chemical marker?

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.370
How are we going to attach a
chemical marker to the protein

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.330
without messing it up?

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.580
We can't mess up the
protein, right?

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.660
It still got to function.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.520
How do we get a chemical
marker on it?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.176
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:12.176 --> 00:26:12.845
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:26:12.845 --> 00:26:14.095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:17.348 --> 00:26:19.150
PROFESSOR: So what chemical
do you want me to put in?

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.910
Well, how am I going to tell
whether, DNA's got phosphorus.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.654
How am I going to follow
the phosphorus?

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.030
AUDIENCE: Radioactive tag.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.330
PROFESSOR: Radioactive tag.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.250
Bingo.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.650
What if I used radioactive
tags, and I made a

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.980
radioactively-labeled virus.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.720
How can I radioactively
label the DNA?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.850
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.586
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:51.260
PROFESSOR: A radioactive base.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.330
I could do that.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.960
What else could I do?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.360
Yup?

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.080
AUDIENCE: Phosphorus.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.930
PROFESSOR: Phosphorus.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.470
Phosphorus has the nice property
that phosphorus is in

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.750
my DNA, but it's not
an proteins.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.630
So what do I use?

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.110
Phosphorus-32, P-32.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.820
So I use P-32, and how do I
manage to chemically create a

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.040
virus that has P-32 in it?

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.060
PROFESSOR: Just throw it in the
solution with P-32, and

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.410
the virus will take care
that itself, right?

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.610
So simply grow virus for a while
in the presence of P-32.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.730
Let's do that.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:29.290
So grow virus in a test
tube with bacteria.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.740
Here's my bacteria.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.220
Here's my virus I've put in
there, and let me put in P-32,

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:41.640
and what I'll get is
P-32-labeled labeled virus.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.890
How do I label my protein?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.880
Someone said it already.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.650
What elements can we
find that's in

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.462
proteins but not in DNA?

00:27:53.462 --> 00:27:54.938
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:55.705
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:27:55.705 --> 00:27:56.385
AUDIENCE: Sulfur.

00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:57.870
PROFESSOR: Sulfur.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.380
Sulfur.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:05.370
S-35 is a radioactive isotope of
sulfur, and if I grow it, I

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.870
can S-35 label the proteins
in my virus.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.920
Nice.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.420
This radioactive labeling
trick is very cool.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.340
So I take it, I take some
P-32-labeled virus where these

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.910
P-32 was only in the DNA.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.110
I got some S-35-labeled
label virus where the

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.890
S-35 is in the protein.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:38.160
I could mix them together, now
do my experiment, wait 20

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.220
minutes and, or even wait last
10, 15 minutes, and see which

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.070
element has gone
into the cell.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.320
How do I do that?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:55.620
See I've got my cells here,
and I've got the viruses

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.350
attached to them, and they've
injected something in here.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:02.010
They've either injected
a protein or

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:05.560
they've injected DNA.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.940
What was injected?

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.290
I need to carefully go in there
and remove the virus and

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.640
look at just what's
in the cell.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.880
I have to now separate the virus
glommed onto the outside

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.580
of the cell from the cell.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.070
So do I use micro manipulator
tweezers to

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.522
pull off the virus?

00:29:23.522 --> 00:29:25.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.930
PROFESSOR: Well, if I
denature, I might

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.600
crack open the cell.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.110
Centrifuge it.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:34.080
If I centrifuge it, the whole
thing will spin down.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.040
I need to kind of knock the
viruses off the cell,

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.550
physically.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.520
I just got to agitate it so
I get them off the cell.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.450
With enough kind of hydrodynamic
agitation, the

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.980
viruses fall off.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.310
So a device was created that
was able to just perfectly

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.140
knock the viruses off.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.240
It's referred to as the Waring
kitchen blender.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.620
It turns on your kitchen blender
is perfect for this.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.780
Take the viruses, add it to the
bacteria, sit for a little

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.470
bit, put it in your kitchen
blender, press puree.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.240
And let's say on puree setting,
the viruses fall off,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.770
and now you can spin it in a
centrifuge, the bacteria are

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.370
denser, they come down.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.600
The viruses are lighter, they
stay in the supernatant, and

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.760
you can take the supernatant and
the pellet at the bottom

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.920
over your radioactivity counter
and see which one is

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.220
in the bacteria.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.600
These were referred to as the
famous Waring blender

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.330
experiments.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.310
They really are, actually.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:44.320
So you put this in the Waring
blender, you knock off the

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:54.710
viruses, you spin it down, and
what happens is after you've

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.150
done it, there's a pellet here
of the bacteria that are spun

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.200
down in the centrifuge.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.440
The virus particles
are still up here.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.880
We take this pellet over to our
counter, and which element

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.165
do we find in great abundance,
S-35 or P-32?

00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:12.975
AUDIENCE: P-32.

00:31:12.975 --> 00:31:17.740
PROFESSOR: P-32.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.940
The DNA is what's going in.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.500
Bingo.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.510
Nice experiment.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.190
Now if you were churlish,
couldn't you say, yeah, look

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.600
it's mostly the DNA, but there's
a little smidgen of

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.480
protein maybe, that
came along too.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.770
Do you think they found
absolutely zero S-35 in there?

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.910
No, because they don't perfectly
knock the virus off.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.160
Some of it kind of sticks.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.180
There's 1% S-35.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.770
And if you're being really
churlish about this you would

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.490
say I still don't believe you.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.400
But now you have it from two
different directions.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.600
You have it from the
pneumococcus, this bacteria

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.940
experiment from Avery, McCarty,
and MacLeod Hershey

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.930
and Chase coming from two
different systems.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.710
They're giving you
the same answer.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.620
It's pretty clear.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:58.250
It's in the air.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.810
People know DNA is the stuff.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.280
They're believing it now.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.580
DNA is the stuff.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.460
But how does it work?

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.840
How can this dumb molecule
possibly be the

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.050
transforming principle?

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.130
Well, smart, young people
want to know.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:29.200
So an erstwhile ornithologist,
that is a college kid from the

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.220
University of Indiana who
particularly liked bird

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.490
watching got very enamored by
this problem, actually based

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.390
on some fabulous faculty at
the University of Indiana.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:44.150
He got really intrigued by how
could DNA possibly do this.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:47.600
But he recognized he didn't
know any chemistry.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:53.010
He decided to go to Cambridge,
England to the Medical

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.440
Research Council lab, the MRC
lab in Cambridge, England

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.190
where he teamed up with someone
who did a lot of

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.350
talking and very few
experiments.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:05.820
A physicist who had worked for
the British admiralty during

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.330
World War II on classified
things and had somehow gotten

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.440
interested in biology.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.110
And because he had this kid,
this recently graduated

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.310
college kid, and you had this
35-year-old physicist who

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.840
nobody was quite sure what to
make of, they kind of hung out

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.760
with each other in
the same office.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.960
And they didn't really do many
experiments, but boy did they

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.400
do a lot of talking, and
thinking, and looking at all

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.870
the data that were out there.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.510
And that's pretty much what
James Watson and Francis Crick

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.610
were doing.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.430
They knew this problem
was important.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.330
And Jim and Francis would talk
every day about this stuff,

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:47.050
and they will talk to people
down the hall who really knew

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.290
about the chemistry
of nucleic acids.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:55.230
And they went down to London to
Maurice Wilkins' lab where

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.660
crystals were being
made of DNA.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.810
And Rosalind Franklin, who was
a fantastic scientist and had

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.930
managed to make crystals of DNA,
showed Crick and Watson

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.460
her crystals of DNA.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.670
Francis Crick being a physicist
was very good at

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.500
understanding crystallography
and how crystal structures and

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.949
x-ray diffraction patterns
related to each other.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:22.550
And Francis knew immediately
this thing had to be a helix.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.839
He could tell it was a helix.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.969
And they went back, and based
on Rosalind Franklin's x-ray

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:35.300
diffraction patterns, went and
made a model, a model for the

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.360
structure of DNA.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.330
You all know the model.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.389
You've seen the double
helix forever.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:45.290
It's a cultural icon, but that's
how this came about.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:57.530
And The Double Helix, the
Structure of DNA, April of

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.330
1953 is published.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:13.090
The double helix has two
strands running an

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:19.730
anti-parallel directions, 5
prime to 3 prime, 5 prime to 3

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:25.950
prime anti-parallel directions,
and it has a

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:32.240
perfect base pairing between
purines and pyrimidines.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.350
If you have a T, and
I'm just going to

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.050
draw this very quickly.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.620
You can look in your book for
getting it just right.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.990
You have two hydrogen bonds.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:11.590
That's T and A, and if you
have a C, you have three

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:25.075
hydrogen bonds that perfectly
hold it to the G, et cetera.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:32.520
So notice C and G fit perfectly
together to make

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.140
three hydrogen bonds.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.620
A and T fit perfectly together
to make two hydrogen bonds,

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.500
and that was the key was to
recognize that when you stick

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.140
them together in that way, you
get exactly the same width.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.510
They fit perfectly.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.900
You couldn't match an A with a
G, an A with a C, you could

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.700
only match the A with
a T. That was it.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.190
Brilliant.

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.640
Beautiful.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.200
Now, you guys should read
Crick's book The Double Helix

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.610
in which he tells the stories
because it's just a

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.770
fascinating, fascinating
business.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.900
He'll tell, or others will
tell actually, the story.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.770
So you know what this
means by the way?

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.350
This means that the amount of
A should equal the amount of

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:14.470
T. And the amount of G should
equal the amount of C.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:19.575
There should be a ratio, a
one-to-one ratio that the A to

00:37:19.575 --> 00:37:23.230
T ratio should be one to one.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.520
And the G to C ratio should
be one to one.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.340
Although any organism might have
more As than Ts and Gs

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.420
than Cs, the ratio of these guys
should be one and these

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.020
guys should be one.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.700
This actually was discovered
by a chemist at Columbia

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.950
called Chargaff.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.380
These were called Chargaff's
rules.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.250
Chargaff was a very
distinguished chemist who came

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.036
up with Chargaff's rules with
the As equals the Ts, and the

00:37:50.036 --> 00:37:51.720
Gs equals the Cs, and
he didn't know

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.760
what to make of it.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.920
By the way, Chargaff actually
visited Cambridge, England

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.700
while Crick and Watson were
there before their discovery,

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.630
and he had lunch with them.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.920
And he related that Crick and
Watson seemed like Bozos to

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.660
him, because they couldn't even
keep straight the exact

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.610
structure of the four bases.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.860
They always had to keep
looking it up.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.180
They hadn't memorized the
structures the four bases, and

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.580
Chargaff was such a brilliant
chemist, he, of course, knew

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.270
this instantly, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.680
And he said, these guys are
never going to get anywhere

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.705
because they really don't even
understand the structure of

00:38:25.705 --> 00:38:29.090
the bases, haven't
memorized it.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.020
When Crick and Watson's
discovery turned out to be the

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.940
single most important biological
discovery of the

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:37.770
20th century, Erwin Chargaff who
lived a very long life was

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.340
sort of bitter because he's kind
of worked it out in a way

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.680
with the ratio and never figured
out what it meant.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.835
And he said one of the
bitterest, cuttingest comments

00:38:46.835 --> 00:38:51.220
I've have ever heard from a
scientist which is referring

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.850
to Crick and Watson as still not
being impressed even after

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.120
they won their Nobel
Prize for this.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.940
He said that two such pygmies
should cast such giant shadows

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.560
only shows how late
in the day it is.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.810
Anyway, he was not happy to
have missed this point.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.840
Crick and Watson were
very happy to have

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.180
figured this out.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.330
They, when they figured this out
in February of 1953, what

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.710
do you do in England when you
make a big discovery?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.596
AUDIENCE: You have tea.

00:39:20.596 --> 00:39:23.284
PROFESSOR: No, you
don't have tea.

00:39:23.284 --> 00:39:25.140
You go to the pub.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.560
They went to the pub.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.480
They ran down to the Eagle Pub,
they brought everybody

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.780
drinks, and they told everybody
at the Eagle Pub,

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.750
we've discovered the
secret of life.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.590
The people at the Eagle Pub
had no idea what they were

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.980
talking about, but were happy to
have a round of drinks, and

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.190
there you go.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.660
They immediately raced to
write this up in Nature.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.290
It appears in Nature in
April of 1953, and

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.670
it's a one-page paper.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.360
And get it on the
web and read it.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.490
It's the single best one page
that has been written in

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.130
biology in the 20th century.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.515
And of course, what
did they say?

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.590
The title is kind of unassuming,
"A Structure for

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.360
the Salt of Deoxyribonucleic
Acid," nothing too exciting.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.460
But Crick and Watson
realized something.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.290
What do they realize?

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:18.440
Crick and Watson realized
why is this a big deal?

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.320
Why is this double helix
so important?

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:38.850
Well, the implication of the
double helix is that if I have

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:47.680
a double helix and those strands
were to separate, each

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:56.930
would be a template for a
double helix, heredity.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:00.660
How do you pass information
to two daughter cells?

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.700
You got a double helix.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.200
It's redundant.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.830
If you know the A is on
one strand, you know

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.230
the Ts on the other.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:11.710
Unzip it, copy, voila.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.020
I now have two copies
of heredity.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.270
What's a mutation?

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.310
Occasionally get it wrong.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:21.910
Bingo.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:22.770
They saw it.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.020
They knew.

00:41:26.612 --> 00:41:29.390
Now, they didn't have
time to prove this.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.960
I mean, who has time
to prove this.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.940
This is such an exciting
discovery secret of life.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.580
Drinks for everybody, they write
it up, but in the last

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.520
paragraph, they certainly don't
want anybody to think

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.110
that they missed the point.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:45.160
And they write the coyest
sentence in molecular biology.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.250
They write, "It has not escaped
our notice that this

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:52.480
structure offers an
explanation for

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.580
heredity and mutation.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.870
We'll address this in another
paper." Cute.

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.130
Very cute.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.290
They put down their marker, they
knew what it meant, but

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.720
they got the thing off to
Nature very quickly.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.680
It was a hot topic.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.950
They were competing
with other people.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.030
You'll read about the
competition with Linus Pauling

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.550
and other things like that.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.030
It had not escaped their notice
that this pretty much

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.410
explains heredity.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.860
Now, of course, are
you convinced

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.330
that it explains heredity?

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:24.480
It's a nice model, but don't
we require proof?

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.520
We do require proof.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.800
It's an ex post facto model, we
need proof, It's a pretty

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.230
good ex post facto model,
but we need proof.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:39.650
So the last step, which I'll
touch on very briefly, was

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:46.530
proof of what's called
semi-conservative replication.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.720
Meaning that each strand
is used for the other.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.210
And I might run two
minutes over.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:42:58.640
We'll see.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.310
I'll try to keep
it within time.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.290
Out at Caltech, two graduate
students, Frank Stahl and Matt

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:11.020
Meselson hear of this.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.890
Matt Meselson by the
way is still

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.370
working in Harvard Square.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:15.120
He's at Harvard.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.520
He's a wonderful guy.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.130
Matt is there.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.410
You could ask Matt about this,
young graduate student at

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:21.590
Caltech in the early '50s.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:24.660
Obviously, this model looks
like it must be right.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.170
How do you prove it?

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:33.830
Well, Matt and Frank, Meselson
and Stahl came up with a cool

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.690
experiment to prove it.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:46.940
Meselson and Stahl, they take
bacteria, here's my DNA in

00:43:46.940 --> 00:44:01.320
there, they want to show that
each strand, each, when we

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:06.170
make a new generation of
bacteria, the new DNA has one

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.270
old strand and one new strand.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.400
That each old strand
is being used as a

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.200
template for a new strand.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.240
How are we going to tell?

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.680
We gotta label it somehow.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.875
We got a label the old strand
different than the new strand.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.880
How do we possibly label and
they're the same chemical

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:26.930
composition?

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.115
What are we going to do?

00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:28.985
AUDIENCE: Radioactivity.

00:44:28.985 --> 00:44:33.600
PROFESSOR: Radioactivity or
some kind of isotope.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.950
Well, they used an isotope.

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:40.660
What they did, super cool, they
grew this up, but not in

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:46.540
normal nitrogen, but in N-15,
not, by the way, radioactive,

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.780
but different weight.

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.560
They grew it up in N-15.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.000
They added bacterias that had
grown up, and all of their DNA

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.240
had lots of N-15 in it
on both strands.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.760
They then pour in a lot of
medium that has N-14.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.650
Tons, they swamp it with
N-14 so what's this

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:08.610
strand going to be?

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.520
N-14.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.660
So what can you tell me about
the difference between this

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.692
DNA and that DNA?

00:45:19.692 --> 00:45:21.420
AUDIENCE: One's going
to be lighter.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.430
PROFESSOR: One is going
to be lighter.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.800
How do you measure how
much lighter it is?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.920
They came up, they invented the
technique for this purpose

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.920
of centrifuging in
a salt gradient.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.860
They put in the right amounts of
salt, cesium salt, and they

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.120
centrifuge it so hard that
there's a gradient of

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.730
densities, denser here,
lighter here.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:54.570
And they find that this DNA
and this DNA centrifuge to

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.900
different places.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.300
There's a difference
in their density.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:05.300
The new DNA is half old,
N-15, half new, N-14.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.810
It has the intermediate
density.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:11.060
If I grow another generation,
I'm going to see some N-15

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.240
14s, and I'm also going
to see some N-14, 14s.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.050
And that's what they found.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:22.110
They invented this technique
it's isopycnic centrifugation

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:27.790
and Matt Meselson and Frank
Stahl provided an experimental

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:32.940
prediction of the beautiful
Crick-Watson model that was

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.170
fair to say the secret
of life.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.200
Anyway, these are
the foundations.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:43.560
Notice now, we've taken genetics
and used it to do

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:44.840
biochemistry.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.500
We've taken biochemistry
and used it

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.230
to understand genetics.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:54.590
And so finally, we are
making the bridge

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.580
of molecular biology.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.830
Next time.
