00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.530
PROFESSOR: Hello and
welcome to the

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.660
help session on pedigrees.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.560
Today, we will be working
out a problem together.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.050
If you have not yet had a chance
to work it on your own,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.600
please do so now, and
return to this video

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.850
when you are done.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.380
Now that you've had a chance to
look at this problem, let's

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.780
work it out together.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
The first part of this question
asks, what is the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.930
mode of inheritance that is
observed in this pedigree?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.730
So, we know that there are two
main types of modes of

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.800
inheritance.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.780
It can either be dominant
or recessive.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.030
And from there it can either
be autosomal or X-linked.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.720
If a disease follows a dominant
inheritance pattern,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.990
generally, it must be present
in every generation.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.230
So here we notice that the
disease is present in the

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.660
first generation, but it's not
present in anyone in the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.430
second generation.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.500
However, then it reappears
in the third generation.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.170
This suggests that the
disease is recessive.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.950
So now, do we think
this disease is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.910
autosomal or is it X-linked?

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.010
So we look at the pedigree
again, and upon closer

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.000
inspection, we notice
that the affected

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.040
individuals are only males.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.620
This is a key characteristic
of an

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.370
X-linked recessive disease.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.990
However, we're also given more
information that tells us that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.460
this individual here does not
carry an allele associated

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.370
with the affected phenotype.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.100
This rules out the possibility
that this disease could be an

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.450
autosomal recessive disease.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.890
Thus, the most likely mode of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.795
inheritance is X-linked recessive.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.400
Great, so moving on to the
second part of this problem,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.480
we are asked to determine the
genotypes of individuals

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.280
number one and number three.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.940
So, if we look at this pedigree,
we know individual

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.400
one is female and not affected
by the disease.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.860
Female individuals contain two
X chromosomes, and since she

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.345
is not affected she must contain
at least one large R.

00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.170
So we'll call the allele
associated with the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.420
disease small r.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.950
We do not yet know what her
second X chromosome could be.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.050
It could be either another
large R or it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.100
could be a small r.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.140
And she also would still not
be affected by the disease.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.930
This male right here is affected
by the disease.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.410
So he must have an
X with a small r.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.320
Remember that males have one
X chromosome and one Y

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.650
chromosome.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.250
So now, making our way down to
individual number three.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.120
Individual number three does
not have the disease and is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.520
female, so again, must have
two X chromosomes.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.060
One of the X chromosomes must
come from her father and the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.940
other from her mother.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.070
The only X chromosome that her
father can pass along to her

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.940
is X small r.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.930
In order for her to not be
affected with the disease, her

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.480
other X chromosome must
have a large R.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.860
She was able to get this
genotype with her mother

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.420
having either of these
two genotypes.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.780
To make sure that both of these
genotypes are possible

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.320
for this mother, we need to
examine her other children.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.300
Her son here is unaffected.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:39.540
So his genotype must have been
X large R, Y. It's possible

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.640
for him to get this genotype
when the mother has either of

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.560
these two genotypes.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.635
Similarly, this daughter could
be unaffected just as this

00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:51.000
daughter was unaffected.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.970
So the mother can have either
of these two genotypes.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.770
And we're unable to rule
out one of them.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.620
So let me just write up
the answer over here.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.030
All right, so far, so good.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.060
Next, we're asked to calculate
the probability that

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.720
individual A is affected.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.960
Individual A is over here at
the bottom of the pedigree.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.520
In order for individual A to be
affected, she must have the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.770
following genotype.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.460
The only way for her to get two
little r's is for her to

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.100
get one from her father and
one from her mother.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.970
We know this is possible because
her father is affected

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.970
with the following genotype
of Y, X small r.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.790
Her mother is not affected.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.840
So for her to get this small
r, her mother must be a

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.100
carrier for the disease,
and have the genotype X

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.860
large R, X small r.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.940
So in order to determine the
probability that A is affected

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.850
with both X small r's, we must
also know the probability that

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.570
her mother was a carrier
for the disease.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.190
Let's call her mother
individual C.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.820
So, we know the genotypes
of her parents.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.410
Her mother was a carrier.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.190
And her father did not have the
disease, so his genotype

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:45.420
was Y with X large R. So to
calculate the probability that

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.680
individual C is a carrier for
the disease, let's go back

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.731
over here and draw out
a Punnett square.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.410
On one side, we're going to
write the genotype of her

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:09.080
father, which was Y because
he's a male.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.210
And then, he was not affected
by the disease, so it was X

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.410
with a large R. Her mother
was a carrier.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.330
So she had one copy that was X
large R, and one copy that was

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.770
x little r.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.630
So next, we want to know
the probability

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.270
that she was a carrier.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.990
The only ways you can get
females is by looking at this

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.240
top row here.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.170
So, for now, we're going to
ignore the bottom row.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.090
Of the two possible ways to
generate a female, only one of

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.960
them is a carrier.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.260
So there's a 50% chance that
a female will be a carrier.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.660
So this is a 50% chance that
individual C is a carrier,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.330
which we will denote with this
half filled in circle.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.530
All right, so now that we know
the probability that C was a

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.610
carrier, we need to know the
probability that her progeny,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.290
A, was affected with
the disease.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.570
Again, looking back over here,
her progeny needs to inherit

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.030
the X small r from the
mother and the X

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.150
small r from the father.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.130
So, once again, we can draw
a Punnett square to better

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.380
understand this.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.700
Individual A's father
was indeed

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.340
affected by the disease.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.960
So his genotype was X small r
and Y. Her mother, we just

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.730
calculated the probability of
her being a carrier, so she is

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.690
X large R, X small r.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.550
Now, we're looking at individual
A, who is a female,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.500
so again, we can ignore
the bottom row because

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.760
this will be males.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.655
Here are the progeny
which are female.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.150
Of the two possibilities, only
the one on the right, X small

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.900
r, X small r is affected
by the disease.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.130
So there is a 50% chance that
A will be affected by the

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.220
disease given that her mother
is a carrier of the disease.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.330
Now to finish up this part of
the problem, we need to

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.760
multiply these two probabilities
together because

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.280
we're looking at the probability
that C is a

00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.930
carrier, and the probability
that A is

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.180
affected with the disease.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.170
This gives us our answer
of one fourth.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.310
All right, so, moving on to the
last part of the problem.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.590
We need to calculate the
probability that B is affected

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.910
with the disease.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.840
So this isn't that hard now that
we've drawn out all of

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.820
these Punnett squares already.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.700
So, let's take a look back at
our pedigree over here.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.520
If B is going to be affected
with the disease, he must have

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.760
the genotype Y, X
with a small r.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.450
He gets the Y from his father
and he must get this X with a

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.770
small r from his mother.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.600
So again, we need the mother,
C, to be a carrier.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.000
So let's go back to our Punnett
squares over here.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.510
We know that there is
a 50% chance that

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.310
individual C is a carrier.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.220
Now we need to look at
individual B being affected by

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.810
the disease.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.090
So we can go ahead and fill
in the bottom part of this

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.340
Punnett square.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.910
So of these two males, that are
possible, only one of them

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.620
is affected with the disease.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.510
So again, there is a 50%
probability that that child

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.760
will be affected with
the disease.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.340
Again, we are going
to multiply these

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.620
probabilities together.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:38.270
So the probability that the
mother is a carrier, and that

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:46.470
the son is affected with the
disease, gives us one quarter.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.270
That concludes our problem
on pedigrees.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.520
Thank you for joining us.
