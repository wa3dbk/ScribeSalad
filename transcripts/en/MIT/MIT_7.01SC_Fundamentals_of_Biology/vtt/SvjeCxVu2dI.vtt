PROFESSOR: Hello, and welcome
to another help session on

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.270
recombinant DNA.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.960
Today we're going to
discuss genomic

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.290
libraries and cDNA libraries.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.100
So what is a genomic library?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.340
Well, with most organisms
the genome is really too

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.080
large to deal with.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.260
It's too large to work
with or to examine.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.870
So oftentimes it's more useful
to cut it down into smaller

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.600
pieces that you can
then examine.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.170
How do we make a genomic
library?

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.920
Well, we start off with
our cell of interest.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.750
And the first thing that we're
going to do is we're going to

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.940
isolate all the DNA
from the cell.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.510
Once we have the DNA, we're
going to use restriction

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.500
enzymes to cut it into
smaller sections.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650
Now, we have to be very careful
when we choose which

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.720
restriction enzyme
we want to use.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.240
We want to use an enzyme that
has enough restriction sites

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.940
in the genome so that we'll get
small enough pieces to put

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.580
in the vector, but not
so small that all the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.960
genes get cut up.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.250
Usually what we we'll use for
the vector is a plasmid.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.530
A plasmid is a very standard
and easy way to get foreign

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.030
DNA into a bacteria.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.440
So we're going to cut up our DNA
and the plasmid with our

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.900
restriction enzyme.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.390
Sometimes we might want to
even make two different

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.830
libraries using two different
restriction enzymes so that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.125
we'll have the cuts in
different places.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.510
Once we have our cut up DNA and
our plasmids, now we need

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.190
to ligate them together
using DNA ligase.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.180
Once the cDNA is pasted into the
plasmid, now we're ready

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.790
to actually transform
them into bacteria.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.620
It's very easy to transform
plasmids into bacteria.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.990
There are multiple different
ways to do it.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.110
One common one is to use heat
shock, whereby you heat the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.150
bacteria up and then cool it
down rapidly, which causes

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.910
little holes to open
up that allows the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.190
plasmids to be taken up.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.380
What we end up with are
thousands of different

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.280
bacteria cells, all with
different sections of the DNA.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.170
So combined, all these different
sections form the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.440
genome, the original genome that
we have, but they're in

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.600
much smaller sections.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.430
They're much easier
to work with.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.350
And this combination of all
these different cells forms

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.590
our genomic library.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.470
So that's one type of library.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.320
Another type of library
is a cDNA library.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.690
So the way that the cDNA library
is different from a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.690
genomic library is that while
the genomic library

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.090
encompasses the entire genome of
the cell, the cDNA library

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.860
just looks at what genes are
being expressed in the cell.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.870
So let's go over how we would
make a cDNA library.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.870
What we're going to start off
with is we're going to start

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.160
off by isolating the mRNA.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.760
So the mRNA, clearly, is
the RNA that's being

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.690
expressed in the cell.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.690
This is what's ultimately-- the
proteins are going to be

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.021
produced by the cell.

00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:57.530
We're then going to use reverse
transcription to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.670
create the DNA version
of the RNA.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.750
This is what we're referring
to, again, as the cDNA.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.700
Once we have the cDNA, we then
need to add restriction sites

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.643
to the ends of them.

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:12.490
Remember, before we were just
able to use innate restriction

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.530
sites in the genomes.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.720
But for the cDNA library,
we really want to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.620
keep the cDNA intact.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.050
We don't want to cut it up.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.630
So we just want to add
restriction sites to the ends

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.440
of the cDNA.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.190
Then we can treat the cDNA
and the plasmids

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.550
with restriction enzymes.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.500
Once again, once they've been
cut up we can use DNA ligase

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.850
to combine the cut up plasmids
and the cut up cDNA to the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.930
complete plasmid plus cDNA.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.320
And finally, once again, we can
transform our bacteria,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.410
and then the combination of
all these cells, all with

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.300
different types of cDNA,
form our cDNA library.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.240
And cDNA libraries are very
useful if you want to compare

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.780
the difference in protein
expressions between two

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.010
different cells.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.780
Thank you very much.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.880
This has been another help
session for recombinant DNA.
