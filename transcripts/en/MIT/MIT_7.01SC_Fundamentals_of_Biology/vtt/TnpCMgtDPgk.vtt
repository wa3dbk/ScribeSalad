00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.540
ERIC LANDER: So, now what I'd
like to do is turn to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.310
variations on the theme.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:19.770
One of the best ways to
understand what's going on

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.040
with DNA goes to RNA goes to
protein is to consider how it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.500
works in different organisms.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.580
And the organisms we'll consider
are eukaryotes, like

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:50.000
you; prokaryotes, like a
bacterium; and viruses.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.990
And each does the same basic
copying of nucleic acid to

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.630
nucleic acid, transcription,
and translation.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.280
But there are some pretty
fascinating

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.080
variations on the theme.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.860
So let's turn to those
variations.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.183
Let's start with DNA
replication.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:29.530
For eukaryotes, your genome are
long, double-stranded DNA

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.450
molecules, and they're linear.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.310
Long, linear, double
stranded--

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.880
ds for double.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.476
I'll write it out-- double
stranded DNA.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:45.850
You know this.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.320
And you've got a lot of it.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:02.190
The human, you actually have
23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.190
And the total length of your DNA
is about 3 times 10 to the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.700
ninth base pairs.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.890
So about 3 billion bases or so,
typical chromosome on the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.330
order of about 150 million
bases or so.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.100
The mouse, pretty similar.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.060
Mouse, 20 pairs of
chromosomes.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.810
And it's something like 2.7
times 10 to the ninth bases.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.030
The dog's about 2.5, the
elephant's about 3.3,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.600
essentially all mammals are
about 3 times 10 to the ninth.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.790
Tomatoes, 12 chromosomes.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.370
They're also in the
neighborhood of 3

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.630
times 10 to the ninth.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.400
You don't have more DNA than
a tomato, for example.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.830
Yeast, much smaller genome.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.080
Yeast is like--

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.810
it's got 16 chromosomes.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.720
Yeast is in the neighborhood
of about 13 million bases

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.370
instead of billions of bases.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.910
Fruit flies, four chromosomes,
including a pretty measly one.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.870
And it's in the order of 200
million bases, et cetera.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.770
Many different sizes
for eukaryotes.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.810
But there's one significant
issue that all eukaryotes

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.800
have, which is this chromosome
here, this linear chromosome,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.770
how do we replicate it?

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.470
Well, we told you.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.970
We open up a bubble.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.600
We start making little
primers.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.640
Primase makes primers, you
extend it, it's all just fine.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.175
Except in one place, the end.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.650
Primase makes a primer,
continues

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.515
to the end, no problem.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.640
What happens out there
at the end?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.370
Suppose primase sits
down here.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.504
What happens at the very
end of the chromosome?

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:30.980
If my primer wasn't exactly at
the end of the chromosome,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.990
what happens?

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.430
STUDENT: A little bit of it
doesn't get replicated.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.566
ERIC LANDER: A little bit
doesn't get replicated.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:38.550
Does that matter?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.244
Just a little bit--

00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:41.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.470
ERIC LANDER: --per
cell division.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.990
Every cell division, you lose
a little bit of information

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.240
off the end of your
chromosome.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.400
That's not so good .

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.820
The word for end is tel.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.510
And so the ends of chromosomes
are called telomeres.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.930
And if you have a linear
chromosome, you have a problem

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.540
with replicating your telomeres
because it's going

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.375
to get a little short
each cell division.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.360
So what do you think
the cell does?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.010
Special mechanism, special
enzyme that

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.910
comes along and adds--

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.330
there's a repeat sequence
that occurs.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.650
There's a repetitive sequence
that occurs out here.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.350
T2AGGG in humans, different
things in other organisms.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.750
And there's a specific enzyme
that comes along and adds back

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.570
telomeres so you don't get in
trouble failing to replicate

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.710
enough stuff at the end.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.880
By chance, the enzyme happens
to be called--?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.740
STUDENT: Telomerase.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.370
ERIC LANDER: Telomerase.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.710
And some folks got a Nobel Prize
for this last year, for

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.805
understanding how telomerase
works.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.540
What cells in your body are
in need of replicating and

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.380
replicating and replicating?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.410
Well, not necessarily
in your body.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.085
What cells in some people are
replicating and replicating

00:06:18.085 --> 00:06:18.950
and replicating and
replicating?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.500
Cancer cells.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.900
Cancer cells probably need
their telomerase, right?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.980
So one way to possibly treat
cancer might be to inhibit

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.476
telomerase.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:30.880
So you see, all the things I'm
telling you about, these are

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.890
useful fun facts to know and
tell about how the cell works.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.580
They're also the heart of a lot
of approaches in medicine.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.440
Because if you could
specifically inhibit

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.350
telomerase, you might
specifically create a

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.960
liability for rapidly
dividing cells.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.960
And so telomerase,
very interesting.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.150
Anyway, so a linear chromosome
has that problem.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.980
And if you understood our
mechanisms for replication,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.680
you'll understand there why the
linear chromosome needs

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.860
some special mechanism.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.660
Now, here, prokaryotes
are much easier.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:09.450
Because most prokaryotes have
circular chromosomes,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.730
double-stranded circular--

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.990
ds circular--

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.240
DNA.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.870
This is much easier because
there are no ends.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.720
They don't have to worry about
the telomerase problem.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.890
They start somewhere, they start
replicating around, it

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.490
all works fine.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:33.250
E. coli, for example, 4
million bases of DNA.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.895
The smallest are
microbacteria.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.090
They're on the order of about
a million bases of DNA.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.400
And they work just like
we talked about.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:54.580
But now, viruses,
they are weird.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:02.302
Viruses --

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:12.840
Turns out some viruses have some
double-stranded linear

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.120
DNA, and some with multiple
chromosomes, even.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:26.110
Some viruses, though, have
double-stranded circular DNA.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.800
So it turns out viruses can
do either of those.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.070
It turns out they can
do more than that.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:48.390
Some viruses have
single-stranded circular DNA.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.130
That is to say, when they're
traveling around in their

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.590
capsid, in the protein coat,
what's in the protein coat

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:08.590
that you get infected with is
a single-strand of DNA.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.840
Well, how does it replicate?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.975
When it gets in, it becomes
double stranded.

00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:21.380
The first thing it has to do is
polymerases end up making

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.640
this guy double stranded.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.820
But it travels around in its
single-stranded form.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.320
Why?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.860
Because it decided to.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.210
The great thing about viruses
is they are small.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.280
They've had a chance to
experiment with a zillion

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.160
different things.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:42.430
But some viruses don't have
any DNA at all when they

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.640
travel around.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:51.320
Instead of having DNA, they
alternatively could have RNA.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.240
Remember I said Crick already
figured out DNA and RNA are

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.670
essentially equivalent.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.030
They're both nucleic acid.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.830
You can go from one
to the other.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:05.310
Some viruses decided to bring
along single-stranded RNA.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.460
So when the virus attaches to
the cell, it injects an RNA.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.710
The RNA is in the cell.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:24.245
But how is the virus going
to do anything?

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.490
How's it going to replicate
itself?

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.940
How do you replicate RNA?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.450
Well, the same stuff I told you
about replicating DNA--

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.460
namely, for replicating DNA
you use a DNA polymerase.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.885
It's a DNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

00:10:46.885 --> 00:10:49.670
It uses DNA as a template.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.410
Any reason not to have an
RNA-directed RNA polymerase?

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.840
No.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.240
You can have one of those.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:04.400
So the way this works is
this gets replicated

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.630
into a strand of RNA.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:14.590
It makes double-stranded RNA
by an RNA-directed RNA

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.840
polymerase.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.090
That's a kind of weird enzyme.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.280
It takes RNA as its template.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.520
And it uses RNA as its
template, and it

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.420
makes another copy.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.160
It makes a strand of RNA to
make it double stranded.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.830
And then it goes back and makes
another strand of RNA.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.070
But you don't have
that enzyme.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.264
Where does that enzyme
come from?

00:11:40.264 --> 00:11:41.470
STUDENT: The virus.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.845
ERIC LANDER: The virus?

00:11:42.845 --> 00:11:45.255
Did it bring it with it?

00:11:45.255 --> 00:11:47.200
STUDENT: Another cell
that it infects?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.020
ERIC LANDER: Another
cell that infects?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.790
STUDENT: The RNA encodes--

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:51.480
STUDENT: The RNA does--

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.100
ERIC LANDER: Whoa!

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.660
Wouldn't it be cool if the RNA
was a messenger RNA and it

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.700
encoded a protein, and the
protein it encoded was the

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.060
RNA-directed RNA polymerase?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.040
Bingo.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.280
That is, in fact, what happens
with a certain class of what

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.600
are called plus-strand
viruses.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.980
This is a messenger.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.870
It's a messenger RNA.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.370
And it's actually encodes the
instructions to the cell,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.340
please make me an RNA-directed
RNA polymerase.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.590
That's way cool.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:38.310
It also turns out that some
viruses are what are called

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.870
minus-strand viruses.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.390
They don't bring a
messenger RNA.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.340
But instead, like you said,
they bring their own

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.240
polymerase with them.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.620
The polymerase comes--

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.405
So here, these bring the
instructions for a polymerase.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.550
These actually bring the
polymerase itself.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:16.010
The polymerase then copies
this strand, which is the

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.790
messenger RNA.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.490
And it makes more RNA-directed
RNA polymerases.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.510
So both of your two
solutions--

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.400
the virus brings a polymerase
with itself, or the virus

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.500
brings the instructions
for the polymerase.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.280
Both of those actually happen.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.720
Pretty much a good rule with
viruses is anything that can

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.900
happen does happen.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.400
This is pretty much Murphy's
rule for viruses there.

00:13:42.326 --> 00:13:45.620
Turns out viruses can
do one other thing.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:53.060
It turns out that viruses can
take that RNA strand--

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.400
RNA--

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.620
and, although I won't go into
all the details, copy that RNA

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:14.340
strand into a DNA strand and
then copy that DNA strand to a

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:19.010
second DNA strand, to make
double-stranded DNA.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:24.800
So some viruses that bring RNA
with them copy themselves not

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.080
into more RNA, but
back into DNA.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.270
So instead of an RNA-directed
RNA polymerase or a

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:38.040
DNA-directed DNA polymerase,
what is this?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:42.216
It's an RNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:55.410
So this is an RNA-directed
DNA polymerase.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.280
In effect, what is
this thing doing?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.960
It's doing the exact opposite
of transcription.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.470
What's transcription?

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.010
Reading DNA into RNA.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.300
What's this guy doing?

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.880
Reading RNA into DNA.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.770
It's the reverse of
transcription.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.130
What is the enzyme called?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.380
Reverse transcriptase.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.010
It's called reverse
transcriptase.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.070
And then what happens is quite
insidious, is that if this is

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:48.560
your own chromosomal DNA, that
piece of double-stranded DNA

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:54.000
from the virus can be inserted
into your own human

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.250
chromosome.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.200
The virus can then make more
copies of itself by

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.950
transcription of that.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.610
This is a truly insidious virus
because it doesn't just

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.600
infect your cells and grow.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.000
It infects your cells, turns
into double-stranded DNA, and

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.940
installs itself.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.590
And how do you get that DNA
from the virus out of your

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.840
chromosome?

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.210
You don't.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.480
You can't get it out.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.730
It's stuck there.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.820
These things, because they work
in this fashion of back

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.286
from RNA into DNA, have
the name retroviruses.

00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:37.816
That's what these are,
retroviruses.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.680
And can anyone name a particular
retrovirus?

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.530
STUDENT: HIV.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.460
ERIC LANDER: HIV.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.760
And that's how HIV works.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.770
It turns out that David
Baltimore won a Nobel Prize

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.710
for the discovery of reverse
transcriptase.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.520
And again, the reason I tell you
about all these mechanisms

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.250
is A, they're cool, and
they're about biology.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.109
And B, they're medically
important.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.780
Why is reverse transcriptase
not just cool

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.220
but medically important?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.910
Because you could inhibit it.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.390
If you wanted to fight the HIV,
if you wanted to fight

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.720
the AIDS virus, you could come
up with chemicals that inhibit

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.240
reverse transcriptase.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.240
And of course, the cocktails
that are given to patients who

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.530
have been infected by HIV that
now keep them alive very, very

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.120
nicely include reverse
transcriptase inhibitors.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.260
It's a very important thing.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.260
If you understand the biology
of retroviruses, you

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.060
understand the targets you can
use for drug development.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.600
And they have saved
billions of lives.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.660
So again, I say this is not
entirely unimportant stuff.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.210
This is kind of cool stuff, to
understand how this works.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.990
All right.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:04.740
Next up, transcription.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:05.990
Let's turn to transcription.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:19.350
Transcription is a little
bit easier.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.360
Transcription varies.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.810
Here, eukaryotes, prokaryotes,
and viruses.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.720
Let's see, let's start
now with prokaryotes.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.470
Prokaryotes, pretty simple.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:38.840
I have a chromosome, I have my
promoter, I make my messenger

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.190
RNA, I'm done.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.040
Just like I taught you before.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.220
Transcription looks just
like I told you.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.815
But for eukaryotes, it's
a little weirder.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:03.931
Transcription, I have my RNA.

00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:04.950
I have my promoter.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.970
I make my RNA.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.100
And my RNA, it turns out, gets
processed in all sorts of

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.040
interesting ways.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.590
The three ways in which
eukaryotic RNA are processed--

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:24.210
first, there is a modification
put onto the five-prime end.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.702
It is called--

00:19:26.702 --> 00:19:29.930
well, it's basically a
backwards G. It's a G

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:35.190
triphosphate that is put on
backwards, so it goes GPPP,

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.140
right there.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.220
And this is called a cap.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.270
And it's important for message
recognition and stability.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.890
Eukaryotes put a funny little
chemical modification there.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.410
Eukaryotes also do something
where somewhere near the end,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:55.000
they cut the message, and they
stick on a bunch of A's as a

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.900
tail at the end.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.240
And this is also important for
message recognition and

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.010
message stability
and all that.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.220
And this is called
the poly(A) tail.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.870
Most of the names are
quite reasonable.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.910
The tail of lots of A's is
called the poly(A) tail.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.540
So eukaryotic messages have a
cap at the front, the poly(A)

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.590
tail at the back.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.450
But the truly weird thing that
they have is, if this is my

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:42.980
eukaryotic message here, some
chunks of the message are cut

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.990
out and discarded entirely.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.060
They are spliced out.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.070
You might make a longer message,
and whole chunks are

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.600
spliced out.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.435
This is called splicing.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:07.130
Splicing throws out sequences.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.200
And it could start with a long
mRNA and make it a short mRNA.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.970
Now, Phil Sharp, who is on the
faculty here at MIT, won a

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.990
Nobel Prize some years ago for
his discovery, together with

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.160
someone else, of the phenomenon
of splicing.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.840
So Phil is really cool.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.120
You should talk to Phil.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:36.290
This splicing involves leaving
some things in and excising

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.180
other things.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.660
The things that are --

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:50.250
the things that go out
are called introns.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.820
The things that stay
in and are not

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.265
excised are called exons.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.880
The nomenclature is
a little nuts.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.300
If it stays in, it's an exon.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.980
If it goes out, it's
an intron.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.860
As I told you, the phenomenon
was discovered by

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.730
Phil Sharpe at MIT.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.800
The nomenclature was
proposed by Wally

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.780
Gilbert at Harvard, [LAUGHTER]

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.540
who's a good friend.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.320
I'm teasing Wally.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.640
I'm teasing Wally, but Wally
Is responsible for this

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.120
nomenclature that confuses
generations of students.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.990
Why is this called an intron?

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.540
Not because it stays in,
but because it's

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.840
an intervening sequence.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:47.230
It's an Intervening sequence
when it is called an intron.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.840
And once something was called
an intron, the other thing

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.490
became an exon.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.500
But I've got to say, for all
purposes, to me, in means in

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:55.970
an ex means out.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.690
But it's exactly backward.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.310
I've now said that
a few times.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.280
That may help you remember that
it goes the other way.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.680
Introns are intervening
sequences, okay?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.630
So there are some pretty
impressive splicing events

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.850
that go on.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:18.530
A typical gene, might
start off 30

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.360
kilobases, 30,000 bases.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.220
And it might get spliced down
to 3 kilobases, 3,000 bases.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:32.620
But for example, the Factor
VIII gene that encodes the

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:46.360
factor that hemophiliacs lack,
it starts off with 200

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.520
kilobases, 200,000 bases.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.680
And all but 10,000
are cut out.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.800
So it starts off 200,000, you
throw out 190,000, you get

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.920
down to 10.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:06.520
The winner, the Duchenne
muscular dystrophy gene,

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:13.060
starts out at 2 million bases.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.710
And it gets cut down
to 16,000 bases.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.410
You make 2 million bases of RNA,
and you throw out almost

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.000
the entirety of it and
retain only 16,000.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.420
What a waste.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.550
Why do this?

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.360
Why break up your genes in
patches of exons separated by

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.045
big intervening spaces and then
make a big RNA and splice

00:24:39.045 --> 00:24:40.360
it together?

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.730
Why do something that dumb?

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.328
Yeah?

00:24:42.328 --> 00:24:44.200
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:44.530
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:45.270
STUDENT: Are they recycled?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.810
ERIC LANDER: The nucleotides,
you mean, in the RNA?

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.760
The nucleotides are recycled.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.430
But remember, you spent the
trinucleotides there.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.430
So that was an energy
expenditure.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.060
Well, it turns out the
energy expenditure,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.030
big deal, who cares?

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.160
But it turns out that this is
actually very interesting

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.980
evolutionarily.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.630
I'll just tell you
for a second.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.330
Maybe you'll forget it.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.990
In a given organism,
it might be more

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.830
efficient to not have introns.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.680
Well, actually, there's
one use for it.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.050
If I had introns, the cell could
do alternative splicing.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.760
It could take the same message
and splice it different ways

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.420
in different cells.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.100
Your liver might splice
the message one

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.380
way to make one protein.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.130
Your muscle might splice the
message a different way to

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.110
make another protein.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.640
So you could actually
make multiple,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.710
different mature messages.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.400
That's cool, and that's used,
and most genes actually have

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.130
alternative splice forms.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.810
They can be spliced up
in different ways.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.200
It's also cool evolutionarily.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.180
Because it turns out that if
your genes are broken up into

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.990
patches like that, when random
breaks happen in your genome,

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.930
and this bit of chromosome
attaches to that bit of

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.650
chromosome, as happens
sometimes--

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.350
you get hit by some little
radiation, it breaks

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.210
something, it puts
it together--

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.290
the gene you could have
a functioning gene.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.560
Because since your cell knows
how to take a long message and

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.300
splice it together, the fact
that there was a break and a

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.520
reunion, if it happens in
one of those intervening

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.250
sequences, would give you
a new gene, and a

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:14.900
new functional gene.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.490
And so, in fact, some people
think that this is one of the

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.610
tricks evolution uses to
create diversity is by

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.260
breaking up its information like
that into little patches

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.960
of files that can then be
recombined with each other in

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.100
different ways.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.180
So those are the ideas.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.700
In any case, it happens
a great deal.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.537
Now, viruses.

00:26:35.537 --> 00:26:39.700
Viruses it turns out, will
behave with regard to this

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.190
like the organism in
which they live.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.890
Prokaryotic viruses will
behave like prokes.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.860
Eukaryotic viruses will
behave like eukes.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:53.430
Now, let's turn to
translation.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.615
How does translation
work between--?

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:12.060
Well, now here, eukaryotes,
for the most

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.770
part, are well behaved.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:26.210
A eukaryote makes an mRNA, it
goes to the ribosome, the mRNA

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.240
makes your protein, just
like I taught you.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.180
But now, prokaryotes
are a little weird.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:47.590
Prokaryotes, you know, their
messages are fine.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.610
None of this funny cap business,
none of these

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:51.900
poly(A) tails, none
of this splicing.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.690
But here's the weirdness
that prokes do.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:02.470
This mRNA, one mRNA
might encode

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.480
multiple different proteins.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.740
Multiple proteins.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.030
So this is one protein.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.970
This, multiple proteins.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:20.640
So what happens is this RNA, the
ribosome gets on here at a

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.780
certain site.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.870
Now remember I told you the
ribosome finds the first AUG?

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.620
Well, it's a little
more complicated.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.660
There's a particular ribosome
binding site that ribosomes

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.125
like to go to.

00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:37.620
It turns out that this
prokaryotic message has

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.310
several of those ribosome
binding sites.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.150
Ribosomes sit down.

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.580
They then scan for the first AUG
that they see after that

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.930
point and start making
a protein.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.790
So I might have several
different proteins all being

00:28:52.790 --> 00:29:00.150
made by one messenger RNA, one
RNA making multiple proteins.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.400
Why would I do that?

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.140
Wouldn't it be simpler, make
your head hurt less, to have

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.320
one gene making one protein
instead of this one mRNA

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.310
encoding multiple proteins?

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.620
STUDENT: They're related
to one another.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.610
ERIC LANDER: They're related.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:18.751
Tell me about that.

00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:20.329
STUDENT: Well, like their
functions, if

00:29:20.329 --> 00:29:21.460
they had similar functions.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.220
ERIC LANDER: If they had similar
functions, it might be

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.370
very efficient to have
regulatory controls that made

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:28.410
one message.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:30.270
And then I get all the proteins
made together, rather

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.340
than having separate regulatory

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.960
controls for each message.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.890
Suppose I'm a prokaryote, and
I'm dividing very rapidly, and

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.510
I care about having
a small genome.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.850
It might be very efficient
to do it this way.

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.170
So what related genes
might you put

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.862
together on the same message?

00:29:45.862 --> 00:29:46.690
STUDENT: Pathway.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.120
STUDENT: Same pathway.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.540
Maybe if you're in charge of the
committee, you would say,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.410
I would like to arrange the
genes encoding the multiple

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.780
steps of a biochemical
pathway.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.430
And that's often what happens.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.830
That's exactly what happens.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:09.190
So you can get co-regulation
of genes, of

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.440
genes in the same pathway.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:20.170
And such a thing, which is
called polycistronic message.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.470
Polycistronic is an unhelpful
name for it, but it's what

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:28.740
they call it sometimes, or an
operon, a regulatory thing

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.670
that makes many such things.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.280
Now, why do bacteria do it?

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.060
To minimize DNA.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.080
They just want to use as little
space as possible.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.260
So once it's invented a
regulatory control that turns

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.690
on this message when I want to
make arginine, well, just

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.410
stick all the genes on
the same message.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:52.110
It's cheaper, simpler,
less DNA needed.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:54.980
Now, who really has trouble
with the amount of

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.410
DNA they can have?

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.760
Do you have trouble with--

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.270
Is replicating your DNA a rate
limiting step in your

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.010
replication as an organism?

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:09.150
No.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.340
What is the rate limiting
step in your organismal

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:15.564
replication, your having
offspring?

00:31:15.564 --> 00:31:16.380
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.223
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:31:18.223 --> 00:31:20.870
STUDENT: When it comes
to an age that--

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.390
ERIC LANDER: It's graduating
from MIT, getting a job,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.665
things like that, right?

00:31:24.665 --> 00:31:26.370
And DNA replication is not rate

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.420
limiting, actually, right?

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.910
Getting a degree, all that,
that's rate limiting.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.830
But for bacteria, who are
reproducing not every 20 years

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.970
but every 20 minutes,
DNA replication is a

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:38.890
rate limiting step.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.730
It's important to their
replication.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.290
And they want compact genomes.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:43.750
You, you don't care about
a compact genome.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.350
It's simply not a big metabolic
cost to you.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:48.240
Viruses--

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.730
think about viruses.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.940
Their genomes are tiny.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.710
They're much tinier even
than prokaryotes.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.040
Typical viruses might have
a few thousand or tens of

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.290
thousands of bases.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.500
Bacteria were millions
of bases.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:07.570
Viruses sometimes might
only have 10,000

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.370
letters of nucleic acid.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.825
They really have to use their
information very compactly.

00:32:14.825 --> 00:32:17.010
So you know what viruses
do sometimes?

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.690
Not all, but some?

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.760
Some viruses make
a messenger RNA.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.070
They have a ribosome binding
site right here.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.720
And they start translating
the message--

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.660
let's give it a sequence.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:49.820
ACUUGAGCAA, and we'll put
an AUG in front of that.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.810
They can start translating
here.

00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:02.000
Whoops, I'm just going
to fix that.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.010
But you know what?

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.160
There's also an AUG over here.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.810
They could start
using that one.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:19.430
And you know what else?

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.640
If they found another AUG
off frame, some of

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.580
them use that too.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:31.370
Remember, the first AUG in
normal messages get used to

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.830
set the phase of the codons.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.970
But in theory, I could be
reading those codons in a

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.540
different reading frame, shifted
over by one or shifted

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.180
over by two.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.050
Some viruses are so clever
that they encode three

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:52.440
different proteins smack on top
of each other by reading

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.865
the same nucleic
acid sequence.

00:33:54.865 --> 00:33:57.720
It shifted three
different ways.

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.920
It makes your head hurt to
think, how could I make a

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.900
functional protein?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.530
I've got to manage to get three
separate functional

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.310
proteins built out of a single
nucleic acid sequence.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.030
One, it's easy.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.980
Just tell me the amino acids.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.810
Now this becomes an interesting
puzzle.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:19.190
Can I make a sequence where read
one out of frame, it also

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.480
makes a protein I want.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.760
And another one where--

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.639
And some viruses have evolved
to do that, showing you how

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:29.239
much they care about economizing
their DNA.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:29.719
All right.

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.820
So what have we got?

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.699
We have DNA replicates.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:35.530
We've seen how it replicates.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:39.900
Its mostly the same by nucleic
acid copying, but all these

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.820
variations--

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.889
linears, circulars, single
strand, double strand, RNA,

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:50.239
reverse transcriptase,
transcription, translation.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.070
Look over these examples.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.460
And what they should do is help
solidify how these things

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.040
work and how they're used in
slightly different fashions.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.290
Next time.
