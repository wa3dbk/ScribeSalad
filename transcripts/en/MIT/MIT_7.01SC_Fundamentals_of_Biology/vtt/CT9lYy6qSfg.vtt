00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:10.560
PROFESSOR: Mendel's
second law--

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.290
this thing over here about a
three to one ratio about a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.000
single trait being controlled
by a pair of alleles, and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.350
those alleles being distributed
independently of

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.630
each other to the offspring, the
stuff you always learned

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.420
about Mendel--

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.580
that's often referred to
as Mendel's first law.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.530
Mendel, by the way, didn't call
it Mendel's first law.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.770
It's considered--

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.400
you don't write that in your own
papers or something like

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.680
that, right?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
So Mendel did actually observed
some other things

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.500
beyond this independent
segregation of the alleles for

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.510
a single trait.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.180
Mendel began to cross his peas
together and try to make

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.830
combinations.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.020
He had rounds and wrinkles.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.250
He had greens and yellows,
talls and shorts.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.100
He started making
combinations.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.630
How about a plant that was
wrinkled and yellow?

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.910
Green was the normal color.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.620
Round was the normal shape.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.020
But he had yellows.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.950
He had wrinkleds.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.760
How about making
a combination?

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.300
So he begin to make plants that
bred true for different

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.020
pairs of phenotypes.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.430
So for example, he had a pure
breeding line here that was

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.890
both round and green.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.300
That was the stuff he could
pick up at the market.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.330
But he made a line here that was
both wrinkled and yellow.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.840
What is the genotype of this
round, green strain?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.500
At the round gene--

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.430
the gene for roundness-
what is its genotype?

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.030
Big R, big R. It's a pure
breeding strain.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.970
It was homozygous--

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.340
we're just testing our words
here-- homozygous

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.600
for the big R allele.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.020
Green is controlled by
a different gene.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.140
It has an allele big G. It's
pure breeding for this.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.730
And we call it big G, big G.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.250
Convention, when we use capital
letters, it tends to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.570
mean that the associated
phenotype is dominant.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.520
OK?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.660
It'll make you think that the
allele is dominant, but it's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.740
the associated phenotype
that's dominant.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.360
Now, wrinkled-- what
was wrinkled?

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.180
Wrinkled was a homozygous
wrinkled-- little r, little r.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.650
And what was the genotype
at the yellow locus?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.990
Little g, a little g is
how we'll denote it.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.670
Geneticists use four or five
different kinds of notations.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.250
We're going to use this notation
today of big R's and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.500
little r's and little g's.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.280
But you'll get used to other
kinds of genetic notations.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.690
So when we cross these guys
together, this F0 generation

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.870
here of these two pure breeding
parental strains, we

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.940
get an F1 generation.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.440
The F1 generation--

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.550
what is it phenotypically?

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.040
What did it look like?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.650
Round and green, yep--
round and green.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.900
What was in genotypically?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.460
Big R, little R, big
G, little g.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.290
Now we could self
these plants.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.353
And our head would hurt with
the nine to three to

00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:36.560
three to one ratio.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.710
So instead, why don't we cross
these plants back to the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.690
wrinkled, yellow strain to
make our life easier?

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.070
Little r, little r, little
g, little g--

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.380
and when we cross that back,
what is the segregation that's

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.880
going to happen?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.710
Well, what are the possible
gametes that could emerge from

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.960
this parent?

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.410
We could get a big R and a big
G. We could get a big R

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.130
and a little g.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.269
We could get a little r and a
big G. We could get a little r

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.180
and a little g.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.029
Those are the four possibilities
that could be

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.029
contributed by this parent.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.640
What could be contributed
by this parent?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.420
Little r and little g--
that's it, right?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.960
No other options.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.650
So that's what our little
Punnett square looks like here

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.850
of our options--

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.640
parent number one, parent
number two.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.460
What will this be?

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.650
This will be big R, big G over
little r, little g, big R,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.780
little g over little r little g,
little r, big G over little

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.440
r little g, little r little
g over little r little g.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.840
In other words, this will
be round and green.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.345
This'll be round and yellow.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.020
This'll be wrinkled and green.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.430
And this'll be wrinkled
and yellow.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.495
And what will be the
ratio of these?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.130
One to one to one to one,
provided that those gametes

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.230
were all equally frequent,
provided that that parental

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.750
plant made each of those four
types in equal proportions.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.780
That one to one to one ratio
in the gametes will

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.210
necessarily translate into a one
to one to one ratio in the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.890
phenotypes observed in
the next generation.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.570
When we cross back--
not by selfing--

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.110
but when we cross back to the
parent that has the recessive

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.240
phenotypes, we'll often
call this a

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.175
backcross or a test cross.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.210
If I haven't done a backcross
or a test cross where I

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.530
crossed back to the wrinkled,
yellow parent, I would instead

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.110
have had to make a square here
that had 16 boxes in it, and I

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.170
would have had to add up to 16
boxes to figure out how many

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.470
were round and green--

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.900
nine out of the 16.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.660
How many were round
and yellow?

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.710
Three out of the 16.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.350
How many were wrinkled
and green?

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.590
Three out of the 16.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.230
And how many were wrinkled
and yellow?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.730
One out of the 16.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.650
But for the purposes of using
the white board up here, I did

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.710
the test cross or
the backcross,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.970
because it's simpler.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.600
But you can also do the four by
four matrix and figure out

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.850
what it looks like.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.650
That was news.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.890
It didn't have to be
that way, right?

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.560
Maybe it was something else.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.400
This is pretty cool.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.840
What it tells you is not just
is it the case that here the

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.370
alleles segregate
independently.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.960
It's a random coin flip
which one you get.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.040
It tells you no correlation
between the two traits.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.370
They're independent.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.430
This is called independent
assortment.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.175
Mendel's second law is the law
of independent assortment.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.500
All right.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.280
So Mendel publishes the paper.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.370
1865, it comes out.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.180
Here's a copy of
Mendel's paper.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.980
It's translated into English
from the original German.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.370
So I got Mendel's paper here.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.710
There's no Punnett squares.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.710
It's kind of messy notation.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.500
Look at that.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.970
Look at all that--

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.280
big A, little b.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.570
He's got A's, B's, C's.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.950
He's got three factor crosses
running around in here.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.230
Mendel really goes to town.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.440
It's a beautiful paper here.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.670
But it just goes on and on.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.460
It's incredibly hard to read.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.512
Look at this.

00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:58.580
It takes a lot to
read this thing.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.680
But in a way, it's simple.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.380
It's nothing so sophisticated.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.900
Oh yeah, here.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.030
Look at this-- long, green,
inflated, constricted--

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.430
all this kind of stuff.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.400
It's pretty cool.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:08.960
You should look it up.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.440
It's online.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.880
You can find Mendel's paper.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.130
What happens to Mendel's
paper?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.720
Nobody reads it.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.135
It sinks like a stone.

00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:21.215
It's this cool paper and
nobody reads it.

00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.870
Nobody reads it for
a lot of reasons.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.860
Scientific communication wasn't
so big in those days.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.740
Oh, well.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.630
Mendel also ends up getting
promoted to become the abbot

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.460
of the monastery, and that's
pretty much the end of his

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.400
scientific career,
in my opinion.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.020
He got too many administrative
duties, doesn't do more

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.260
science there.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.770
Also, he has some
poor choices.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.320
The next plant he works
on is hawk weed.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.870
Hawk weed turns out to have
really weird genetics that

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.570
totally leads him astray.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.090
Basically, this is
the one important

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.660
paper Mendel ever publishes.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.890
It's an incredibly
important paper.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.060
It's so important because it
contains the clue to what

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.490
Darwin, living at exactly
the same time, wished he

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.280
understood, which is what the
basis of genetic variation is.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.270
Wouldn't it be great if Darwin
had read Mendel's paper?

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.390
Darwin actually owned a copy
of Mendel's paper.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.960
He received a copy of
Mendel's paper.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.030
In those days, the way they
printed books, there were

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.950
folded pages and you had to
slit the page to read it.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.650
Darwin never slit the pages of
the copy of Mendel's paper.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.570
So we know he's never read
Mendel's paper, but he has one

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.810
in his library.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.810
He had Mendel's paper.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.920
He had the answers sitting
there on the shelf,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.650
but never read it.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.970
The stuff sinks like a stone.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.390
Nobody really pays much
attention to it.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.398
And Mendel goes on,
dies that's it.

00:09:38.398 --> 00:09:40.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:48.660
PROFESSOR: Until the end of
the 1800s, right at the

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.436
beginning of the 20th century,
along comes cytology--

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.030
looking at cells in
the microscope.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:08.910
Microscopes began to get
good in the late 1800s.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.720
And cytologists began to see in
their microscope that when

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:20.720
cells divided, these funny
structures began to appear--

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.360
these long, thread-like
things.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.420
And the German chemical industry
being developed at

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.080
that time had invented
all sorts of dyes.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.760
And cytologists began
experimenting putting dyes on

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.840
these cells.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.960
And the dyes let them see really
clearly these funny

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.400
things that were condensing
out when cells divided.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.600
And they had no clue what these
funny things were other

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.390
than that they took up dyes.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.130
And so in the absence of any
clue what were, they called

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:53.770
them chromosomes, meaning
colored things.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.600
That is what chromosome means.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:05.150
They called them colored thing
Chromos colored bodies,

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.050
colored things.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.300
That's all they knew.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.980
And they observed that these
chromosomes, these colored

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.090
things, did really interesting
choreography.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:21.280
When cells divided, when they
underwent mitosis, what would

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.220
happen is that the chromosomes
would line

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.670
up along the midline.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.900
And they would have, at that
point, these funny X-like

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.150
structures.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.680
And I'll draw four of
these chromosomes

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.160
lining up like this.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.725
And what would happen
during mitosis?

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:54.280
The cell would divide, and each
of the two cells would

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:04.320
get one half of the X. So if you
started with four of these

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.610
X's, you ended up with
four like this.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.870
There you go.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.055
That was the chromosome being
somehow tugged apart.

00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:17.610
Now, anything that gets tugged
apart when a cell divides--

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.680
that's kind of interesting.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.870
Then those chromosomes
would disappear.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.440
You couldn't see them again for
a while until the cell was

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.760
ready to divide again.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.380
And when the cell is ready to
divide again, darned if those

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.480
single lines hadn't
turned into X's.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.960
Somehow the cell had turned the
single lines into these

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.960
two pieces, these X's,
and they were

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.530
ready to divide again.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.360
And that was mitosis--

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.700
the process of ordinary
cellular division.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.810
But there was another process.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.893
Folks observed meiosis.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.330
That's what happens when
you make gametes.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.750
So when gametes get made, the

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.390
choreography was a bit different.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:12.010
Instead of all the chromosomes
lining up on the midline as

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.470
individuals, they lined
up as pairs.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.720
They line up as pairs.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:33.180
When the cell divides, you
end up with now only two

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.475
X's, not four X's.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.275
Then what happens is those
cells divide again.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.480
And you end up with those
straight lines--

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.220
but not four of them,
only two of them.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:10.190
The first step gets called
meiosis number one--

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:18.510
meiosis I. The second is
called meiosis II.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.710
The second step looks just
like mitosis, doesn't it?

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.810
Chromosomes are lined up
along the midline.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:24.550
They separate it.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.010
It just looks like mitosis,
ordinary cell division.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.300
But that first step
is special.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.250
That first step says, somehow,
the chromosomes come in pairs,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.720
and the cell picks one from
each pair and gives to its

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720
gametes-- its sperm
or its egg--

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.270
one from each pair.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.900
And what do you think happens
on fertilization?

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.510
Well, you had one from each
pair, one from each pair, it

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.560
comes together and it
restores a pair now.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.070
And you know what folks said?

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.540
They said this sounds just like
what that dead monk was

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.480
talking about.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.980
Pairs, particles of
inheritance--

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.560
particles that come in pairs and
you give to your gametes

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.170
one of the two pairs.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.440
These colored things must be
the basis of inheritance or

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.690
genes or something.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.630
Wow, because it fits Mendel's
model beautifully.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.090
It explains the first law.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.281
What about the second law?

00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:36.220
What about Mendel's
second law?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:42.240
How could it explain the big R
and the big G being inherited

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.340
independently of each other
with no correlation?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.780
What would that have to mean?

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.170
They're on different
chromosomes.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.710
The genes are on different
chromosomes.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.130
Because if big R is on one
chromosome and big G is on the

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.230
other chromosome, then it's a
coin flip whether or not the

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.830
big R might be here and a little
r might be there or the

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.000
big G might be there or
maybe it's over there.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.290
It's a random draw which
way it's going to go.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.140
So it perfectly explains
Mendel's second law.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.620
Unless--

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.400
what happens if big R and big G
are on the same chromosome?

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.830
Then they're going
to go together.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.580
I'm not going to have
independent assortment.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.620
I may have totally dependent
correlated assortment.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.780
If big R and big G are on the
same chromosome, they're going

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.530
to be inherited together.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.960
Mendel's second law is
going to be wrong.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.020
So why did Mendel find big R
and big G going together?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.910
Maybe was lucky and he picked
traits on different

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.310
chromosomes.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.820
But what about his next trait?

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.640
Lucky again?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.440
Lucky again?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.380
Mendel studied seven traits.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.575
How many chromosome pairs
do peas have?

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.350
Turns out, seven.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.210
But anyway, what happens?

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.190
What's going on?

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.670
Mendel's second law can't be
right if the chromosome theory

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.040
is right when the genes are
on the same chromosome.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.140
They would be dependent.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.530
They won't be independent one
to one to one to one.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.550
So which is it?

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.470
Is Mendel right, my hero?

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.740
Or is this chromosome
theory right?

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.850
Because they can't be both
perfectly right.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.060
So which is it?

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.370
Oops, we've run out of time.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.210
PROFESSOR: Next time.
