00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.920
PROFESSOR: Hello and welcome
to the help session on

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.220
complementation.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.140
Today, we will briefly be
reviewing the concept of

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.400
complementation.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.870
And then, we will discuss
complementation with a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.320
non-biological example.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.250
So to begin, complementation is
generally used to determine

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.090
if two mutations fall in the
same gene or if they fall in

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.390
different genes.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
So here, we have two mutants--
mutant one and mutant two.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.820
Both of these have
mutations in the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.880
lysine biogenesis pathway.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.390
So on their own, they cannot
produce lysine.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.820
To determine if these mutations
fall in the same

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.710
gene or in different genes, we
need to cross the two mutants

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.250
together and examine
their progeny.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.040
If the progeny can grow, this
means that the two mutations

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.010
were in different genes,
and thus, they

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.160
complement each other.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.690
However, if the progeny cannot
grow, this means that the two

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.730
mutations were in the same
gene, and they do not

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.910
complement each other.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.550
So now, let me explain

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.570
complementation yet another way.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.770
So over here, we have the
knitting pathway.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.330
It's very simple and
straightforward.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.575
In order to knit, you
need two things.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.200
You need both the knitting
needles and you need yarn.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.170
When you have both of these
things together, you can knit

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.880
a nice scarf.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.200
So to explain how this is
related to complementation, I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.645
have brought along my friend
Robert to give us a hand.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.800
All right.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.600
So in the first scenario, we're
going to have me with

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.830
yarn and Robert with needles.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.060
When I have yarn, I can't knit
by myself, because I am

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.640
lacking needles.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.699
This is equivalent to having a
mutation in what we'll call

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.840
the gene for needles.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.310
Robert, on the other hand, has
needles, but by himself, he

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.520
has no yarn.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.460
So he can't knit.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.550
So alone, neither of us
are able to knit.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.870
However, if we team up and we
work together and we share our

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.350
resources, now we have both yarn
and needles, so we can

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.210
knit a nice scarf.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.810
All right.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.600
So how about the case of
non-complementation?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.170
If I have needles now, and
Robert also has needles, me by

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.770
myself, I cannot knit, because
I have a mutation in that I

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.590
have to no yarn.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.030
Robert also has needles and he
also does not have yarn.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.070
So by himself, he can't
knit either.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.800
This time, when we team up and
we try to work together, even

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.910
if we share our needles, we
still can't knit, because we

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.080
have no yarn.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.460
So this is the case of
non-complementation.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.040
Thanks, Robert.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.210
This concludes the help session
on complementation.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.460
Thanks for joining us.
