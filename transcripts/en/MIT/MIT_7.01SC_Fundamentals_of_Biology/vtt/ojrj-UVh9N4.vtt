00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:23.590
Monomer of nucleic acids is
called a nucleotide, which I

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.860
will abbreviate NTIDE.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.500
And a nucleotide comprises
three parts--

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.505
a phosphate, a sugar,
and a base.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:54.650
Phosphate, sugar, base --that we
will abbreviate P-S-B. The

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:12.590
polymer of nucleotides makes up
ribonucleic acid, RNA; or

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.360
deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.170
You need to know the full
names of those.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.040
I'm not going to
write them out.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.430
And those are all
polynucleotides.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.420
And the way that polynucleotides
are put

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.710
together is through the joining
of the phosphate and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.030
sugar into a sugar phosphate
backbone, from

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.230
which the bases hang.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.860
And so they look kind
of like this.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.840
There's phosphate,
sugar, phosphate,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.860
sugar, phosphate, sugar.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.480
And from the sugar
hangs the base.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.700
The phosphate and the sugar, as
I've just said, forms the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.990
sugar phosphate backbone.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.005
And the bases, as we'll discuss
in a moment, comprise

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:20.075
the information that is encoded
in nucleic acids.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.230
Let's talk more about this
nucleotide and the structure

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.810
of the nucleotide and the kinds
of components there are

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.050
in the nucleotide.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.940
The sugar of the nucleotide
is a pentose.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.920
It's a five carbon sugar.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.370
It is called ribose,
and it's cyclic.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.565
And it's called ribose in RNA,
and as you will see,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:03:01.240
deoxyribose in DNA.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.510
There are four bases in DNA.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:28.640
They are called adenine,
guanine,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.300
cytosine, and thymine.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.490
And they are abbreviated
A, G, C, and T--

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.620
by their first initial.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.260
But you need to know
the whole name.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.610
In RNA, the bases are the same,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.680
except instead of thymine--

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.200
there is no thymine.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.660
Instead, there is something
called uracil, which is

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.180
closely related, and
abbreviated U.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.250
The bases have a particular
structure.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.760
You do not need to be able to
draw them, but you should be

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.480
able to recognize the
class of base.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.640
There is a class called
purines, which

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.950
comprise two rings.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.680
I'll show you some slides
in a moment.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.430
And adenine and guanine fall
into that category.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.230
And then, there's another class
called pyrimidines,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.880
which are made of one ring.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.205
And cytosine, thymine, and
uracil fall into that class.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.860
Let's draw the structure
of a nucleotide

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.500
out in chemical formula.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.930
We're not going to
draw the bases.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.270
We're going to draw mostly the
sugar and the phosphate,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.570
because it will be important
when we think about

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.400
polymerizing nucleotides.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.500
And then I'll show
you some slides.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.970
So nucleotide structure--

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.040
the best way to draw a
nucleotide structure is to

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.290
start with the sugar.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.920
So start with an oxygen.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.920
And then you can put
in the carbons.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.990
And the carbons are numbered,
because, in many

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.440
macromolecules, there are so
many carbons, it can be very

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.720
useful to give them
specific numbers.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.950
And that's true in the sugar.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.770
It's also true in the bases.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.590
But the sugar numberings
of the carbons are very

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.890
important for you.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.510
There's a one prime carbon, two
prime, three prime, four

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.730
prime, and five prime.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.045
The base is attached to
the one prime carbon.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.595
And the phosphate is attached
to the five prime carbon.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.700
The two prime and the three
prime carbon are also notable.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.680
The three prime carbon always
has a hydroxyl group.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.060
And it's this hydroxyl group and
this hydroxyl group of the

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.180
phosphate that react together
when the sugar phosphate

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.370
backbone forms covalent bonds.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.110
The two prime carbon can either
have a hydrogen, as in

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:06.630
DNA, or a hydroxyl as RNA.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.065
Hydroxyl groups are reactive,
and having this extra hydroxyl

00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:14.720
group on RNA makes this
sugar more reactive

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.001
than the one in DNA.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.240
OK.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.450
That is your nucleotide
structure.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.996
And you should know it.

00:07:25.996 --> 00:07:28.205
Let's see what we have
for slides here.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.190
Nucleic acid monomer
and polymer.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.420
We're going to draw in one
moment the nucleic acid

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.210
polymer on the board,
but here it is.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:47.080
Here is the sugar, the base,
and the phosphate group.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.500
All right.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.190
Let's think about how you
actually get this sugar

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.610
phosphate backbone formed.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.490
And let us draw formation
of a dinucleotide.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.490
And I'm going to abbreviate on
one of the nucleotides the

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.840
phosphate as PO4, otherwise we
won't fit this on the board.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.160
So let's put the sugars first.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.030
And let me actually just make
sure that you guys understand

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.040
that the sugar can be drawn as
I've drawn it, with all the

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.360
carbons there, or it can be
drawn in this way, where the

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.810
carbons are the apices, or
at the ends of a line.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.350
If this is a new you-- if this
is new organic chemistry

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.640
formula to you or chemical
formula to you, then please

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.490
come and see one of us, and
we'll make sure that you get

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.770
up to speed, because you really
do need to know that

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.400
for this course.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.890
Okay so let us draw
some sugars.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.700
Actually, I'm going to erase
this one and put it even

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.960
closer to the top of the board,
because these are small

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.880
boards no--

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.435
new boards, nice but small.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.680
Okay.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.125
And we're going to put here
a phosphate group.

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.925
I'm going to extend this.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:14.560
And we'll put a phosphate
group here.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.810
And we're going to put a base.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.130
And we're going to put a
three prime hydroxyl.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.730
So here is the five
prime carbon and

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.920
the three prime hydroxyl.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.810
And this is going to
be nucleotide one.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.570
And then we'll draw an identical
one below it, which

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.240
will be nucleotide two,
where now I'll

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.380
draw out the phosphate.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:50.010
Let's again start with the
sugar and a hydroxyl.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:58.810
And then let's put
in the phosphate.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.800
Okay.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.250
And this is going to
be nucleotide two--

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.520
so nucleotide one and
nucleotide two.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.490
The phosphate, hydroxyl,
and the sugar--

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.582
and we can put in some
negatives here.

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.370
On the phosphate, that's fine.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.180
Depends on the pH as to what
the ionization of the

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.800
phosphate group is.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.870
This hydroxyl group and
this phosphate group,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.170
are going to interact.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:41.050
And the outcome is going to be
a dinucleotide, where the two

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.170
nucleotides, as you will see,
are joined by a particular

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.630
linkage called a phosphodiester
linkage or a

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.270
phosphodiester bond.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.700
We'll leave a phosphate
there attached to

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.230
the five prime carbon.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.020
Here's the first base.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.000
And now, we've got--

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.490
and I've got to fit it in.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.820
Okay.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.810
So here is our dinucleotide--

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.050
slightly skewed, but OK.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.850
And there are three features
that I want to point out to

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.980
you on this dinucleotide.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.930
The first is the bond that
joins them together,

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.470
which is this guy.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:51.710
It is called a phosphodiester
bond or

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.830
phosphodiester linkage.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.620
And the second is that
the two ends of this

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.820
dinucleotide are different.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.680
On one end, there is a
free phosphate group.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.930
And where there is a free
phosphate group, that is

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.380
called the five prime
phosphate, or

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.474
the five prime end.

00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:20.330
But the five prime end
has got a phosphate.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.390
That's part of its property.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.040
On the other end, you'll
see, there is a

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.380
free hydroxyl group.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.540
And that is called the three
prime hydroxyl, or

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.610
the three prime end.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.390
And they're equivalent,
pretty much.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.210
But you should know that at
one side, there's a free

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.990
hydroxyl group, the other side
a free phosphate group.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.110
You will see later on that
this is pivotal in

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.950
synthesizing DNA, as in DNA
replication and mitosis,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.500
meiosis, and so on.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.730
All right.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.900
Few more slides--

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.080
here are the sugars that are
found in nucleic acids.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.030
There's the deoxyribose
and ribose.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.370
I just put these up
for you for recap.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.730
Here are the bases.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.010
Here are the pyrimidines--

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.920
cytosine, thymine,
and uracil--

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.250
and then the purines, with this

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.090
interesting di-ring structure.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.200
This I drew for you, okay?

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.800
And so it's on your
PowerPoint.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.760
If you're a bit shaky as to
what's on the board and how we

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.770
got there, you can go and get
this from the PowerPoints that

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.020
I'll post after class.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.170
All right.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:45.690
Now, in contrast to lipids and
carbohydrates, nucleic acids,

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.100
and as you will see, proteins,
have two extraordinary

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.920
properties that allow them to
encode information in really a

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.920
way that is extremely rich.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.430
And those two properties I've
already touched on.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.180
One is that the ends
are different.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.550
They're different in a
dinucleotide, and they're

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.730
different in a polynucleotide
that's a

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.050
thousand nucleotides long.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.250
So they have different ends.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.020
And the bases have
a linear order.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.640
And this linear order is part
and parcel of the information

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.570
that the nucleic acid encodes.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.380
So let's draw out,
for instance---

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:43.220
and we're going to start
with five prime.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:53.830
Phosphate, sugar, phosphate,
sugar, phosphate, sugar

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.300
phosphate--

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.950
and we're going to end with the
sugar that has the three

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.410
prime hydroxyl.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.960
Okay, so we've got a five prime
and a three prime end.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.585
And from this, the bases
are hanging.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.860
Now, when nucleotides are
incorporated into a nucleic

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.580
acid polymer, there is an order
of synthesis, which is

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:26.410
why the linear order of the
molecule eventually can be

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.350
used for information.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:32.300
The base nearest the free
five prime phosphate

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.550
is the first added.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.970
And the base--

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:40.810
so it's part of the
nucleotide--

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.740
nearest the three prime hydroxyl
is the last added.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.810
It's really important
that you know this.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.940
Furthermore, when we write out
nucleotides, nucleotide

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.310
sequence, when we write out a
nucleic acid sequence, we

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.360
don't generally write the sugar
phosphate backbone in.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.410
We just write the bases.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:08.678
So it's written five
prime, base, base,

00:16:08.678 --> 00:16:13.080
base, base, three prime.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.940
But of course, the bases
can be anything.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:24.320
So for example, we could have
five prime, adenine, guanine,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.430
guanine, cytosine,
three prime.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.780
And there's a convention that
you have to follow.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.120
And it doesn't matter how long
you're in this business.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.960
When you write out a nucleic
acid polymer, you always write

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.770
the five prime and the
three prime end.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.860
I've been in this business for
30 years now, and I still have

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.080
to write the five prime and
the three prime end.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.180
If you don't, you get lost, and
you will get mixed up in

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.030
your calculations, both in this
course and in real life.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.670
Now, there are lots of
combinations of bases, even

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.380
though there are only
four bases.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.040
For example, if there are four
bases and you have a three

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.290
nucleotide polymer--

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.579
four bases, three possibilities,
64

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:17.829
possibilities.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:30.800
Genes can be thousands and
thousands of bases in length.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.550
And so the information, the
combinatorics involved in the

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.700
nucleic acid polymer
is very large.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:55.420
So genes can be, let's say,
100 to ten to the fifth

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.600
nucleotides long.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.330
And so the number of
possibilities is really

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.420
extraordinary.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.500
And it's one of the reasons
that all of life can be

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.335
encoded in nucleic acids.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.960
And the last thing that
I want to tell you

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.010
about nucleic acids--

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.220
which will become and will
remain one of the most

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.960
important things you learn
in this class--

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.220
is that DNA is usually
double stranded.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:33.180
RNA is too, but it's really
DNA that uses this in an

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.085
extraordinarily important way.

00:18:36.085 --> 00:18:42.480
So DNA is usually
double stranded.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.550
What does that mean?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.760
It gets to be double
stranded via

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.420
something called base pairing--

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.240
you'll see what this
means in a moment--

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:13.850
which also means, or there's
another term that's used,

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:19.100
which is complementarity,
as you will see.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.430
And this double strandedness
does not

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.890
involve covalent bonds.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.230
It involves that special type
of bonds that we discussed

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.765
last time, which are
the hydrogen bonds.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.400
And there are rules
about this.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:43.410
Adenine will form two hydrogen
bonds with thymine or uracil.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.520
Guanine forms three hydrogen
bonds with cytosine.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.110
And that is a rule that is one
of the most important rules in

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.360
nucleic acids.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.380
From your book, here is a
picture of the two bases,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:07.360
adenine and thymine, that can
be lain opposite one another

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.990
such that these dotted lines
are hydrogen bonds between

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.120
oxygen and hydrogen or nitrogen
and hydrogen--

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.805
and the same kind of thing
for guanine and cytosine.

00:20:17.805 --> 00:20:20.500
You don't need to know these
structures, exactly, but you

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.440
do need to know base pairing
inside, outside, and

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.550
never forget it.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:26.800
Okay.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.970
Why is this important?

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.640
I'll tell you why this
is important.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.960
It's important for DNA
replication and for the

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.950
passage of hereditary
information from one

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.270
generation to the next.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:52.070
So, in DNA replication, the
idea is to pass genes on,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.620
unperturbed, in the same
sequence from one generation

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.640
to the next at every
cell division.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:07.720
So let's just, for instance,
start with a polymer here.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.920
Ah, and something else that I
needed to tell you, which I

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:16.160
will in a second, is that when
nucleic acids form double

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.810
stranded structure, one strand
of nucleic acid--

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.110
my one arm--

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.630
will form a double stranded
structure with another strand

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.310
of nucleic acids, like so.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.030
Okay.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.560
That's what's referred
to up there.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.010
The adenine's on one polymer.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.080
The thymine is on
another polymer.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.180
When these polymers form, they
form in what's called an

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.770
anti-parallel direction.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.280
It's really hard to do.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.890
But if this is my five prime end
and three prime end, the

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.450
five prime end of one and the
will be opposite the three

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.690
prime end of another strand.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:52.880
I guess I can do it this way--

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.130
topologically easier.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.290
Okay--

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.120
so five prime opposite three
prime, five prime opposite

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.770
three prime.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.310
So let's draw the complement
of this for

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.350
the nucleotide polymer.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:15.100
There'll be thymine, cytosine,
adenine, thymine.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.420
And look what I've done to the
five primes and three prime.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.730
Means they are one five prime
opposite a three prime, and

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.630
the other three prime opposite
a five prime.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:32.200
This arrangement called an
anti-parallel arrangement of

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.710
nucleic acids.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.140
And it is super important that
you never forget this.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:42.390
During DNA replication, the
strands of this double

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.060
stranded polymer separate.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:00.350
And so you have five prime
AGTA three prime--

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.760
is one strand--

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:09.740
plus three prime TCAT five
prime-- two single strands.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.460
And here's the magic, and this
is what Watson and Crick got

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.080
the Nobel Prize for long ago
for understanding that when

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.330
DNA replicates, those strands
get filled in.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:29.820
So this five prime AGTA three
prime will now get synthesized

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.000
opposite its complement--

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.800
three prime of TCAT five
prime plus this guy--

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:48.420
three prime TCAT five prime will
get its complement made.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.600
And look what you have got.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.540
You have started with one
strand, one double stranded

00:23:54.540 --> 00:24:00.000
moiety, and you've landed up
with two identical replicas of

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.495
what you started with--

00:24:01.495 --> 00:24:03.645
so two identical replicates.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.980
That's redundant, but it really
pushes the point home--

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:18.230
two identical replicates of this
parent molecule that we

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.170
started with.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.700
We'll have a lot more to say
about this when we spend a

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.430
whole lecture on DNA
replication, but you should

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:29.160
understand that this is one of
the profound natures of DNA as

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.410
the hereditary information.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.270
And from your book-- double
stranded DNA.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.040
We'll have more to say about
this, but double stranded DNA,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.450
because of chemical
considerations, goes into its

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.980
most stable chemical state,
which is this very beautiful

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:53.250
double helix that has structure
and is able to pack

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.390
very tightly so that you
can get lots of genetic

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.860
information in one cell.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.110
Last thing about
nucleic acids--

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.940
RNA is often single stranded,
but it can also form

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.770
structures that are partially
double stranded.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:15.040
And this is one such RNA
that's formed this very

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.610
complicated, partially double
stranded molecule.
