00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.770
PROFESSOR: Now having cut
DNA, we then need to

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.020
do something else.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.245
What's the next thing
we have to do?

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:19.710
AUDIENCE: Paste it.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.290
PROFESSOR: Paste it right.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.601
Oh, I put past.

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:25.840
It should be paste.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.890
There we go.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.680
We should paste it.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.780
So, how are we going
to paste our DNA?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.960
So let's take some human DNA.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.360
We'll take your human DNA.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.490
We'll add EcoR1 to it.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.870
And your human DNA is going to
get cut up in lots of little

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.680
pieces of length about 4,000.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420
And I'm writing R1 at the ends
because these pieces of DNA

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.230
have EcoR1 sites.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.790
Now, I can take that human DNA
and I can combine it with

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.040
other pieces of DNA.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.710
Here's a piece of DNA.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.500
Remember it had this
overhang like that.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.410
T-T-A-A was this piece
here of human DNA.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.510
And I could take another piece
of DNA that matched it a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.100
A-A-T-T.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.290
And it doesn't have
to be human.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.080
It could be something else.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.330
It could be zebra.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.320
Some human DNA, some zebra DNA,
and by that base pairing

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.732
of those four bases, they'll
sort of stick.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:58.580
It's not that strong.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.536
It's four bases of base pairing,
but they'll stick.

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:05.100
Now I'd like to glue
them together.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.889
What's the word for attaching
together DNA strands?

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.500
We talked about it--

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.010
Ligate, we want to ligate
them together.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.750
So now we go back to our MIT
engineers and say, please

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.150
invent me a protein that's
able to ligate

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.850
together pieces of DNA.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
But actually, who invented
it first?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.220
Bacteria invented it first.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.260
And it's called?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.620
Ligase.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.110
So all we have to do
is add ligase.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.450
So it was kind of useful
to know how

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.180
DNA replication worked.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.110
We add ligase.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.260
And what does ligase
do for a living?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.230
For a living, ligase is paid to
go around and find pieces

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.890
of DNA that have nicks and seal
them back up by repairing

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860
the sugar phosphate
backbone of DNA.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
And again, ancient molecular
biologists would prove their

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.090
mettle by purifying ligase and
using it in their reactions.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.480
And today, where do
we get ligase?

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.100
It's in the catalog.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.760
Ligase is in the catalog,
reasonably cheap.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.770
So, when we add ligase we could
now get a hybrid piece

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.310
of DNA that was half human
and half zebra.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.950
I got to say, this freaks
some people out.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.610
This doesn't freak me out
because it's just a sequence

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.410
of nucleotides.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.920
If I give you a sequence of
nucleotides, to my mind,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.990
there's nothing human
or zebra about it.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.390
It's a chemical.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.210
And you can make bonds between
chemicals and all that.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.080
So, we now pasted our
DNA using ligase.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.070
Ligase from the catalog.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.550
Now the question is, what are we
going to paste our DNA to?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.185
What do we paste our DNA to?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.910
We're going to paste our DNA to
a fascinating other piece

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:29.224
of DNA like this.

00:04:29.224 --> 00:04:33.400
I'll make that a little
bigger here.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.580
That has an EcoR1 site,
has an EcoR1 site.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:48.680
And we're going to take our
human DNA and paste it in such

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.890
a way that it makes a circle.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.900
This piece of DNA is a vector.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.470
Vector means it travels
around.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.700
It carries things with it.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:11.840
So I want this vector to be
able to replicate if I

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.990
transfer it to E Coli.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.810
So that's the trick.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.250
I would like to be able to
attachment my human DNA to

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.720
this vector DNA, and when I
transfer it to E coli, have

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.450
this thing be able to grow.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.460
So that means we need to invent
a piece of DNA, a

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.010
vector, that is capable
of causing E. coli

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.450
to replicate itself.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.510
It's got to have all the
instructions to cause E. coli

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.280
to replicate this
piece of DNA.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.920
So this is another amazing
bit of engineering.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.650
How do we invent just the right
sequence of letters that

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.990
would allow E. coli to
replicate this thing?

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.750
AUDIENCE: Already
been invented.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.630
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.030
AUDIENCE: It's already been
invented by E. coli.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.490
PROFESSOR: It's already
been invented by E.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.610
coli, hasn't it?

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.790
So you're getting the theme
here, is that we don't

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.010
actually do anything in
molecular biology.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.830
Now look, in fairness, life's
had 3.5 billion years.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.340
We've been at this a decade
or two, on the

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.790
whole, maybe three.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.080
On the whole, life's had
a lot more time to

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.090
work this stuff out.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.360
And usually the best solution
is to look in nature to see

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.420
where nature has already
done it for you.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.670
So E. coli, it turns out,
replicates its own chromosome.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.010
You could use the machinery
from its own chromosome.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.130
But it turns out even
better than that.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.230
E. coli has the following.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.570
Here's its big chromosome, four
million letters of E.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.790
coli chromosome.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:07:00.100
E. Coli also has within
it little circles

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.080
of DNA called plasmids.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.370
These little circles
of DNA are able to

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.020
autonomously replicate.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.330
They can copy themselves.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.180
Or that is to say, E.
coli copies them.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.310
These little plasmids have the
full replication instructions

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.480
encoded in them.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.450
Now why does E. coli have
these plasmids?

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.530
What's in these plasmids?

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.220
What's going on?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.050
Well let's blow up one
of these plasmids.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.370
It's a big circle.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.960
And it has an instruction here,
a sequence, called an

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:51.195
origin of replication - or
amongst friends, just ORI.

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:52.480
It's called ORI.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.850
You'll find on maps, origin
of replication.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.820
That sequence alone is enough to
cause E. coli to open it up

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.330
and start doing its DNA
replication from the origin.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.520
But what tells you why this is
so important is that these

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.160
plasmids typically have
one or two genes.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.150
And the one or two genes that
they typically have are genes

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:29.330
that encode a protein that gives
them resistance to an

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:35.424
antibiotic, like say,
penicillin.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.200
There could be a gene that
gives you penicillin

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.450
resistance.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.070
That's kind of cool.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.140
E. coli, or other bacteria--

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.230
not E. coli necessarily
for penicillin--

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.520
carry around often
little circles.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.500
And these little circles encode
genes that give them

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.540
resistance to streptomycin,
penicillin, ampicillin, all

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.790
sorts of things.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.360
This allows it to grow, even if
you're taking penicillin.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.840
Now, that's pretty clever.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.090
How did E. Coli come up?

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.980
How is it so smart to know to
have come up with a gene able

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.670
to break down penicillin, given
that we've only been

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:29.620
using penicillin since
the 1940s?

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.510
Pretty fast for E. coli to have
figured out how to do

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.760
that, isn't it?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.900
Oh yeah, who invented
penicillin?

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.440
Nature invented penicillin.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.780
It's produced by fungi.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.250
Fungi have been fighting E.
Coli with penicillin for

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.070
millions of years.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.185
E. coli didn't invent
it for us.

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:58.690
E. Coli invented it because it's
in a war down there at

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.460
the single cell level
with fungi.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.850
Fungi make antibi--

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.730
You see, we think
we're so cool.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.160
We make antibiotics.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.500
Well we've been making
antibiotics

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.640
only since the 1940s.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.350
Nature's been making antibiotics
forever.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.270
Just like the viruses are
infecting E. coli and E. coli

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.770
needs an immune system
against the viruses.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.150
Well the fungi are throwing
antibiotics at the bacteria

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.620
and it needs a defense
mechanism.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.570
And the defense mechanism are
these genes that can break

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.140
down those antibiotics.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.040
And as usual, we just
come along and we

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.860
say, oh look at that.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.020
It's already been invented.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.610
Kind of cool.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.870
We'll use that one too.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.370
Now why are these on these
little circles?

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.750
They're on the little circles
because when this bacteria has

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.420
lived a long and happy life and
it dies and it spews its

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:56.540
guts out, neighboring bacteria
suck up the DNA.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.670
Sounds a little cannibalistic
or something.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.280
But that's how it
is down there at

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.880
the single cell level.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.420
The neighboring bacteria
will suck up DNA.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.980
And why is that cool?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.310
It's cool because they can
acquire these resistances.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.250
That's pretty impressive.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.670
They can acquire
the resistance.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.890
And in fact, it even works
across species.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.490
That's why you don't put it
on the chromosome here.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.140
Because E. coli could pick it up
from another species that's

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.160
not E. coli, but related
enough that it

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160
can use that plasmid.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.640
And you can transfer antibiotic
resistance across

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.410
many species of bacteria.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:36.520
So the bacteria like to suck up
DNA and see what they find.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.560
Pretty cool.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.070
By the way, this is also why
indiscriminate use of

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.560
antibiotics, for example, in
animal feed, or when you were

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.670
given antibiotics by the MIT
health service and are told to

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.690
take them for two weeks and you
take them for five days,

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.260
you're not doing anything
very good.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.980
You're just selecting for
bacteria that can grow in the

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.210
presence of antibiotics and
selecting for multidrug

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.470
resistance in the spread
of antibiotics.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.410
We have to be pretty careful.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.560
Because all these mechanisms
of swapping antibiotic

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.460
resistance are pretty
impressive tricks.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.320
Anyway, so these things exist.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.570
And originally, molecular
biologists

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.050
discovered these plasmids.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.680
They purified these plasmids.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.460
And the deal was this,
they cut the

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.620
plasmid with EcoR1, ideally.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.980
So I'm going to put this
up here, vectors.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.340
They cut the plasmid
with EcoR1.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:37.060
They ligate human DNA into it.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.640
And they get these circles.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.640
And there you go.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:48.200
Now today, obviously, if I
wanted to do this experiment,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.160
would I purify the
plasmid myself?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.540
No.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.100
Where would I get the
plasmid from?

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.920
AUDIENCE: Catalog.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.980
PROFESSOR: It's in
the catalog.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.660
There's a whole section
a plasmids here.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.240
They have vectors
of all sorts.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.310
So you get it from
the catalog.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.560
All right.
