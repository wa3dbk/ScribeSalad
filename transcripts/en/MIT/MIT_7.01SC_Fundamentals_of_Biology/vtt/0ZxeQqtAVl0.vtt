00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.150
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about what
was probably the first

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.442
energy producing system
that evolved.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.840
The thought is when the earth
first formed and the first

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.530
primitive organisms, perhaps
resembling a present-day

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.550
bacterium in some way came
out, there were a lot of

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.970
organic compounds that had
been aided by lightning

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.410
strikes and cosmic radiations
triggering chemical

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.615
reactions and so on.

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:49.980
So there was food around, but
they depleted those resources

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.820
in the same way we're depleting
the petroleum

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.180
resources right now.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.950
If life was going to continue,
somehow a way had to be found

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.790
to make energy.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.220
Glycolysis, it looks kind
of complicated.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.760
It takes a molecule of sugar and
then there are a series of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.060
10 chemical reactions, each
catalyzed by a separate enzyme

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:42.940
that give two molecules of this,
molecules of pyruvate,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.990
plus two ATPs, plus two NADHs.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
Which tells you there must
have been some kind of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.020
oxidation step as part of this
sequence of events, because

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.190
electrons got taken off and
got stashed on this NADH.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.250
There are a couple of things
that are important about this.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.340
One is its a pathway.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.600
It evolved probably 3.7 billion
years ago or sometime,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.980
nobody really knows.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.990
But a long time ago.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.000
It's pretty much universal.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.037
Not perfectly so, but it's
in bacteria, it's in

00:02:29.037 --> 00:02:31.045
yeast, it's in humans.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:45.220
And another really important
thing is that it evolved early

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.120
in the evolution of earth, so
it evolved when there was no

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.580
oxygen around.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.440
So it's a way of making
energy from glucose in

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.740
the absence of oxygen.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.280
Which is a really important
thing as you'll

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.920
see as we go along.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.080
You're not going to have to
memorize this pathway.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.200
We'll give it to you
if you need it.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.070
But you're going to need to
understand its implications.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.300
And just let me point out
a couple of things.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.340
You're going to see a sequence
of 10 chemical transformations

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.850
that in the end are going to
end up with a couple of

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.910
pyruvates being produced.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.220
And I'll try to explain
to you why you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.010
should care about this.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.940
There's a concept that you're
familiar with, that if you

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.170
want to make something and you
get a little start up company,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.980
what's the very first thing
you have to do?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.060
You actually have to
make an investment

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.030
before you can get going.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.370
And you're out looking for
venture capital things.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.840
Well one of the odd things about
this, here's probably

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.380
the first sequence of reactions
that arose on earth

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.520
within some organism and enabled
that organism to make

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.490
energy out of glucose.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.810
And look, the first thing
that happens.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.270
Trying to make ATP, the very
first thing it does is it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.370
spends an ATP.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.020
And it takes glucose, and it
makes glucose 6-phosphate.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.420
Go down a couple of steps.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.769
There's an enzyme that takes
another molecule of ATP.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.110
And now you've got this point.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.130
You're at fructose with
two phosphates on it.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.560
If this was your venture
capital, we'd say, guys, how

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.400
about some product?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.760
Stop spending, stop
spending money.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.520
But at this point then, this
is a 6-carbon sugar.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.970
And it gets split into two
3-carbon compounds that are

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.720
going back and forth.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.550
Oh I can see it.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.800
It's over there, OK.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.740
In equilibrium over here.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.650
And this particular 3-carbon
compound then

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.820
goes on to be oxidized.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.030
You get the production
of NADH.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.570
And at that point, this molecule
has a lot of energy

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.430
stored in it, and in the next
transformation this cell is

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.960
able to make two ATPs.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.820
And it gets back the
initial investment.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.320
It goes all the way through
the rest of the pathway.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.650
And the very last step, you
get two more ATPs back.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.000
There's your net yield.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.610
So what you get out of this
are 4ATP+2NADH, and your

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.380
investment was two ATPs.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.720
So your net 2ATP+NADH.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.640
Why is this cell going and
doing these initial

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.240
investments?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.280
Well if we look at the changes
in free energy associated with

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.110
what's going on, there's glucose
up in the upper left

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.710
starting up there, and there's
pyruvate down there.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.010
So you're going energetically
downhill in the end.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.350
So this is a sequence of events
that, in principle, you

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.660
should be able to get some
energy out of it.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.570
But for reasons that may seem
obscure to you at this point,

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.040
before it gets to the point of
making energy, it undergoes a

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.590
set of transformations that's
pushing the reaction.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.870
It requires the reactants to go
energetically uphill, i.e.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.590
in an unfavorable direction.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.960
So what the cell does is, by
coupling ATP hydrolysis to

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.220
this step, it makes
that reaction go.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.780
Here's another unfavorable one
that makes that one go by

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.360
coupling ATP hydrolysis to it.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.590
This is an uphill reaction,
but look over here.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.710
This is an immensely favorable
reaction that goes essentially

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.150
to completion.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.570
It goes all the way.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.480
So that means this product is
just being continually taken

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.780
out of the system, so the
equilibrium is basically being

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.520
pulled over the edge by the
removal of that product.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.270
This is where the oxidation
takes place.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.580
You get the NADH made
right there.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.770
And it's finally down here
where you've got to lose.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:21.080
This transformation gives you
two ATPs and later there's

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.930
another one.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.690
Let me just give you
a sense of why you

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.540
get ATP at that step.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:36.460
The compound that you have
at that point is 1, 3

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.710
diphosphoglycerate.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.710
Or sometimes this is
called bis, is also

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.930
used to describe this.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.750
But what is this compound?

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.770
It's a 3-carbon compound.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:18.020
So glycerate is basically an
oxidized version of glycerol

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.080
that has been oxidized up
to a carboxyl acid.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.230
So this is a mixed anhydride
between carboxyl acid and a

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.400
phosphate ion.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.210
So that's a very reactive
and unstable compound.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.980
And the other thing that the
cell has succeeded in doing by

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.669
all of these transformations
is it's got these two

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.760
phosphates with all their
negative charges in.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.010
So this is a compound that would
very much like to move

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.230
to a lower energy.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.000
So you can get rid of this
phosphate and move to an

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.320
energy level, use that
energy to make ATP.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.240
And there's a similar kind of
logic that explains why you

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.510
get energy out of the final
step when you look at it.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:07.760
So there's several points, I
guess, to make out of this.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.330
One is its pathway.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:15.380
None of these reactions make
any particular sense by

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.990
themselves.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.120
You could have a cell that knew
how to do one of them and

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.170
it would gain nothing.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.040
Unless you wanted to use the
product to make something.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.720
This thing only makes sense,
these reactions only make

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.810
sense in the context of
this 10 step pathway.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.200
And each step in that pathway
we were looking at is

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.080
catalyzed by a different
enzyme.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.040
So for an organism to pull this
off, the first one that

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:49.670
did it had to collect in one
cell all 10 of those enzymes.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.870
And probably there is the reason
that this is such a

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.720
complicated system.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.040
If you were sitting as a
designer you might be able to

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.080
come up now with a more
efficient way to get ATP out.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.880
But what happened evolutionarily
was some bug

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.910
somewhere got all of these
things together, and now

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.210
suddenly it could make energy.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.360
So it had a huge advantage
over everybody else.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.110
And once it took over, that
system took over, then it

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.820
became universal.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.440
Whether it was the best that
ever could be designed, it

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.100
doesn't matter, because it
had an evolutionary edge.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.700
And that's so, to some extent,
we're looking at a living

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.120
fossil, biochemical.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:39.750
But it's in bacteria, it's in
yeast, and it's going on

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.320
inside of our body.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.790
Another principle that I think
you can see here, which I've

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:50.260
been trying to say, is in this
case, the energy consuming

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.030
reactions are driven by
coupling them to the

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.400
hydrolysis of ATP.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.740
The cell spends a bit of its
energy money to get these

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.440
intermediates, knowing
that it's invest--

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.160
well not knowing, but at least
conceptually anyway, knowing

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.650
that it's going to get
its investment back.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:13.400
And then the reactions that
release energy are used to

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.770
drive the synthesis of ATP.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.830
And you'll begin to see, we're
going to just talk about some

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.090
other aspects of this
in just a minute.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.850
So, what do you think?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.850
You're the first bug and you've
got this and nobody

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.420
else can do it, so you can
start charging away.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.360
What do we need to do?

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000
We just let this thing
cycle away?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.780
The stuff that I had up there,
is it going to work?

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.460
There's a problem.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.820
Anybody see what
the problem is?

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.320
We're making two molecules of
ATP and two molecules of NADH.

00:11:58.272 --> 00:12:00.240
Talk to the person beside you.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.394
Figure out why something
else has to happen.

00:12:04.394 --> 00:12:05.876
Go ahead.

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:07.358
See if you've got any ideas.

00:12:27.612 --> 00:12:29.290
We're going to keep doing
this, over and

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.070
over and over again.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:34.034 --> 00:12:35.516
Where's the first ATP?

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:38.040
Where's the first ATP?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.990
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
imagine for the--

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.880
I don't think this process could
have invented ATP, it

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.540
had to have been around,
because many of the

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.010
enzymes used it.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.940
What else is being used
in this thing though?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.553
Did I hear NAD?

00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:06.610
To make this thing work, I have
to keep taking NADs out

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.400
of my pocket and putting it in
the reaction, or it isn't

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.040
going to go anywhere.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.870
So this isn't such a great
invention at the moment.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:21.460
We have to do something to get
the NADH back to NAD+ so we

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.300
can do another molecule
of glucose.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:25.835
You guys see?

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:26.660
Do you see this?

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.520
This is really, really an
important consideration.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:36.160
So in order for cells to make
energy using glycolysis in the

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.150
absence of oxygen, which is when
it evolved, they have to

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:44.700
do something with that NADH or
it's only going to use up the

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.060
few molecules of NAD+ in the
cell, and then it stops.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.570
And so there are two ways
that nature's figured.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.820
Major ways nature had figured
out how to do that.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.200
So here's a molecule
of pyruvate.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.980
I got an extra.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.300
Something was nagging at me
when I did this here.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.380
Sorry about that.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.570
It's always hard to see things
when you're up at the board.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.900
OK.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.710
Molecule of pyruvate.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.270
There's a couple of solutions
that have been arrived at.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:36.580
One is to take NADH,
2NADH, this is 2H+.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:47.620
Convert, make these back into
2NAD+, and to take those

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:55.320
electrons and put them on the
pyruvate to give this

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:02.340
molecule, which is
lactic acid.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.650
So by parking the electrons
there, the cell is able to

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.570
recycle the NADH.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.490
And lactic acid, we've
run into that.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.250
That's why I showed you this
picture of yogurt.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.530
The lactobacilli that make
yogurt take the sugars that

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.760
are present in milk and make
them into lactic acid.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.850
And what's interesting in
their case is they, even

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.350
though there's oxygen around,
they don't do respiration,

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.100
which you'll see you can
get more energy.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.500
They want it to get very acidic
because that prevents

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.120
their competitors
from growing.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.570
And that's why you can leave
yogurt sitting out on the

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.900
tabletop and it'll be OK
for quite a while.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.660
Whereas if you left some milk
or something it'll go bad

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.910
almost right away.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.650
Here's another example of
when we run into it.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.400
When we do hard aerobic
exercise, when you're running

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.720
or skating really hard, things
you see in the Olympics all

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.125
the time, you deplete the oxygen
supply in your blood

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:05.580
when you do hard anaerobic
exercise.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.770
And so the cells have the same
problem of regenerating NADH.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.910
The way they solve it is they
make the lactic acid.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.570
And that contributes to the sore
muscles you feel after

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.830
you've done hard anaerobic
training.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:29.990
The other way of handling this
is to take the 2NADH plus two

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:39.460
hydrogen ions to make it
into acetaldehyde, two

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.710
acetaldehydes.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.834
Plus two CO2s.

00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:48.466
Oops, excuse me.

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.430
Let's do this first.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:57.960
And then take the 2NADH
plus the 2H+.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:02.740
Convert this to 2NAD+, and what
we get out of this are

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:11.470
two molecules of ethanol plus
two molecules of CO2.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:16.510
Again, a process that's very
similar to you, familiar to

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.369
you, when I was showing
you yeast growing.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.790
What yeast is doing is it's
carrying out glycolysis and

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.869
then it's taking those extra
electrons, putting them on the

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:29.755
pyruvate and making ethanol
and carbon dioxide.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.520
I think there's a fermentation
with what we call a

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.750
fermentation with yeast.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.700
I think in that case they're
making bourbon whiskey.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.130
Wine making, beer making,
it's all the same thing.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.980
You have yeast, you're
converting the sugars first to

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:55.150
pyruvate, and then making
ethanol and carboxylic acid.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.880
So anyway.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.320
There's no energy gain out
of this, but these

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.320
are important processes.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.570
They're called fermentation.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.590
And they can happen when there's
no oxygen around.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:24.950
If you recall, there's a version
of photosynthesis,

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.660
what I called the second release
of photosynthesis that

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.280
began to evolve oxygen
as a waste product.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.250
And then over the next ensuing
millennia, the levels of

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.920
oxygen slowly, slowly began
to rise on earth.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.170
And as oxygen levels got to
higher levels, and recall the

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.990
Cambrian period, which
is down on the fourth

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.210
blackboard down there.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.890
We were only still even there
half a billion years ago.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.840
We were only about 5% the
present oxygen levels.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:02.690
But as oxygen levels arose, new
metabolic opportunities

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.485
became available.

00:19:03.485 --> 00:19:07.290
And in particular, cells were
able to get at that energy

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.160
which is stored in NADH.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.890
In the absence of oxygen,
NADH is just a nuisance.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.390
You've got to get rid of it.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.010
But as you'll see in a minute,
you can do something

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.230
interesting if you have
oxygen around.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.860
So just to look at this from a
broad perspective, if we have

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.260
glucose and we have all these
little steps going along to

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:35.490
give the two pyruvate, if
there's, in the absence of

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:50.380
oxygen, they get 2 lactate or
we can get 2 ethanol, 2CO2.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.690
And in both cases, 2ATP.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.010
2ATP.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:06.710
These processes happening in the
absence of oxygen to get

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:11.010
rid of the, or at least not
requiring oxygen in any case

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.600
called fermentations.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.490
However, when oxygen is
available, it became possible

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:24.630
to evolve a new system for
handling these pyruvates.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.650
We go into a biochemical
cycle known as

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.305
the citric acid cycle.

00:20:34.305 --> 00:20:36.920
And I'll say a word about
this in a minute.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:44.250
Plus something else that's
known as oxidative

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.500
phosphorylation.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.100
This is also referred to as
the respiratory chain.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.710
And what these two sets of
processes together, enable the

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:10.960
cell to take these two 3-carbon
compounds and take

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.120
them all the way down to six
molecules of carbon dioxide,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.920
six molecules of water.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:29.010
And to make a net yield of
36 molecules of ATP.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.710
So if you go by fermentation
a molecule of sugar

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.650
gives you two ATPs.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.300
If you go by glycolysis and then
follow it by respiration,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.130
you get 36.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:48.350
So respiration using oxygen, 18
times more efficient than

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.160
by glycolysis.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:56.330
So in order to understand how
this works though, we have to

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.240
talk more about how you
change from one form

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.930
of energy to another.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.275
And it's interesting, although
this process had to have

00:22:06.275 --> 00:22:10.310
evolved billions of years ago,
it was only relatively

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.790
recently that we understood
the principal that was

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.460
necessary for this kind
of thing to happen.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:29.460
It's known as the Chemiosmotic
Hypothesis.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:40.740
It was proposed by Peter
Mitchell in 1961.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.550
He eventually got a Nobel
Prize for it.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:49.780
It took quite a long time, it
took more than 10 years for it

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.630
to be accepted.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.310
In fact when I was in grad
school in the mid '70s, people

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.680
were still arguing whether
this made sense or not.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.340
So here's the way it works.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.390
And we have to consider first
three different forms of

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:07.070
chemical energy that can
be all interconverted.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.110
One of them is familiar to you,
we've been talking about

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.270
it all along.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.990
It's a chemical bond.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.745
Energy can be stored in
a high energy bond.

00:23:15.745 --> 00:23:22.480
And if we break it to get ADP,
an inorganic phosphate, we can

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.135
release energy.

00:23:24.135 --> 00:23:26.600
However there's another way
of storing energy as a

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.850
concentration gradient.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:36.160
The principal here would be to
have a barrier, which in this

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:43.240
case is the cell membrane, and
to have a high concentration

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.460
of whatever it is on one side,
and a low concentration on the

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.710
other side.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.840
And there's energy
stored in that.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.080
If you give it a chance it'll
get to be the same

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.240
concentration on both sides.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.950
And the trick is to have
whatever the substance is, is

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:09.920
to have a protein in the
membrane that can permit this

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.510
thing to go across in a
controlled fashion.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.960
The third form is electrical
potential.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:36.340
Again, the membrane actually
acts as an insulator, and all

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:52.540
cells, if this is the inside,
and this is the outside,

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:59.310
there's a gradient of hydrogen
ions, so there are more

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:03.810
hydrogen ions outside the cell
than there are inside.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:09.450
So it creates an electrical
potential.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.740
And these can't cross the
membrane unless, guess what?

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.560
There's a protein in the
membrane that's able to permit

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.190
their passage under controlled
circumstances.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.760
So there's basically three
different forms of energy that

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.750
can be interconverted.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.660
And Peter Mitchell's great
insight, which I will say was

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:35.730
not intuitive for many people,
was the combination, so the

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:53.530
combo of this proton
concentration gradient plus

00:25:53.530 --> 00:26:07.580
the electrical potential, could
be used to drive the

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:11.920
synthesis of ATP.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.190
And let me just say
a couple of words.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.805
Because this may feel,
how could this be?

00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:24.500
Could you really have energy?

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:33.242
Well the potential across a cell
is about 70 millivolts.

00:26:33.242 --> 00:26:35.690
May not seem all that much.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:42.720
But remember the membrane is
about three nanometers thick.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:50.340
So that's about 200,000
volts per centimeter.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.620
High tension wires are 200,000
volts per mile or something.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.880
There's a lot of
power in there.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.500
And furthermore, let's see
if I can bring this up.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.060
I've been showing
you this little

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.380
movie a couple of times.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.040
The bacteria with these little
nanomotors are spinning those

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.900
flagella, and we saw how there's
this machinery that's

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.840
a little nanomotor.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.150
You know how it's powered?

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.850
It's powered by the
proton gradient.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.880
A proton trickles its way
through this apparatus from

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.460
the outside to the inside.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.010
It's coming down the gradient.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.600
That's the source
of the power.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.310
And as I showed you, it's
a pretty powerful motor.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:34.990
You can basically glue the
propeller to a slide and it

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.010
can twirl the bacteria
all around.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:44.040
In fact, one of my favorite
demos is, years ago people

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.040
took a bacterium, and they
managed to pop it open.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.280
So all the cytoplasm, all of the
stuff on the inside came

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.130
out of the cell, and you just
got buffer on the inside.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.530
But it had these flagella.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:06.950
So you had just shells of
bacteria with nothing really

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:07.990
inside them.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:12.850
But, if you add a drop of acid
to this media, now you've

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:18.500
created a proton gradient with
more protons on the outside

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.970
than are on the inside, and
guess what happens?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.540
The flagella motor starts
working, and the bacteria

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.710
start swimming, even though all
the air, talk about dead

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.640
man walking or something
like that.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.080
It gives you an idea of the
power that's in this

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.720
combination of the proton
gradient and

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.210
the electric potential.

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:49.970
The combination of this is
often referred to as the

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.230
proton motive force.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.450
So here's the principle
of how the cell is

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.220
able to exploit that.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.800
And this is what underlies
respiration.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.050
There are two stages.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:19.810
Stage one, there's a membrane
with some kind of membrane

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:27.510
protein in it, which is actually
a protein, functions

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.300
as a proton pump.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:36.310
So it's a protein that's
designed to be embedded into a

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.640
membrane and to work there.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.550
This part here is the
membrane itself.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:52.340
The proton gets transported from
the inside to the outside

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:57.350
when energy is put into
this proton pump.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:03.160
So in response to some energy
producing event, the cell

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.790
pumps protons from its inside to
its outside, and this then

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.415
establishes the proton
gradient.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:31.590
The second phase, then, is to
take advantage of that proton

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:37.160
gradient, and there's a
different protein embedded in

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.676
the membrane.

00:30:38.676 --> 00:30:43.890
It's known as an ATP synthase.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:51.550
And it permits a proton to come
down the gradient, which

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.880
you would want to do.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.830
But if that's all that happened,
all you'd do is

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.960
you'd just dissipate
your gradient.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.580
So the key here is that this
proton is only allowed to come

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.530
down the gradient to the
energetically more favorable

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:12.750
side if ADP and inorganic
phosphate are bound to this

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.380
ATP synthase.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.340
And the dropping of the proton
down the gradient's passage

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.900
through this ATP synthase, which
is an energy favorable

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.400
reaction, drives the
synthesis of ATP.

00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:31.850
So much energy is basically
given off with this, you can

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.970
make an ATP and the thing
will still go.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:41.910
Now interestingly, this ATP
synthase, which really lies at

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:47.930
the heart of our energetics for
how we function as human

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:57.990
beings, is derived from it's
crystal structure.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:01.600
But in fact, evolutionarily,
it's related to

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.360
that flagella motor.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.670
And as that proton comes down
the gradient, or actually this

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.470
is presented upside down, so
there's the outside as it goes

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:17.070
through in this direction, the
ATP synthase, which is known

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:29.990
as the F1F0 ATP synthase
rotates.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.590
And probably this came first.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.390
It's a little hard in this one
because you don't have the

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:38.690
flagella, so what scientists
have done is they've been able

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.120
to attach something like an
actin filament onto this F1

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.130
ATP synthase, and show
that as a proton

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.650
passages the thing rotates.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.710
So in all likelihood what
happened in evolution was this

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:59.690
came first, and then later the
machinery got duplicated and

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.120
evolved to become a nanomotor.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.610
And as I told you the other day,
that apparatus for the

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:09.920
flagella motor got evolved again
into becoming a little

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:17.050
syringe that bacteria like
ursinia are able to use to

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.240
pump or to squeeze proteins or
squirt proteins from inside

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.780
them into inside of
a mammalian cell.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.080
OK, well.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.460
Thanks to this work by Peter
Mitchell then, we can now

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:37.840
understand how cells were able
to take advantage of that

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.805
energy that was in the NADH.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.230
So this process is known
as respiration.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:58.680
And basically it's
taking the 2NADH.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.060
I'm supposed to see the physical
therapist today, so I

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.110
hope we're going to begin to
make progress to lecturing on

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.460
two feet sooner or later.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:19.570
Plus 2NAD+ plus two water.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:25.389
So as I said earlier,
NADH and protons,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.909
it's basically hydrogen.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:32.090
It's the equivalent of having
hydrogen gas and adding

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.830
oxygen, and we're burning the
hydrogen gas down to water.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.429
So there's a lot
to yield water.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.560
So there's a lot of energy
potentially can be given off.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.630
That's the 50 kcals per mole.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.730
Now if you recall when we talked
about thermodynamics,

00:34:51.730 --> 00:35:08.660
so the NADH is up here, by the
time we get down to the 2NAD+

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.830
plus the water, the two waters,

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.960
energetically we're down here.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.930
And this is about a free energy
changed of about 50

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.990
kcals per mole.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.610
In physiological terms, that's
a huge amount of energy.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:30.250
And I think some of the
textbooks compare it to

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.910
letting a stick of dynamite
off inside of a cell.

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.650
So it's really more than biology
figured out how to

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:39.780
handle this in a single step.

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:41.800
But do you remember that
important principle about a

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.450
thermodynamic property,
when I had the little

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:45.410
picture of the skier?

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.730
It doesn't matter which
pathway you take.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.520
You get the same amount of
energy released whether you go

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.790
down the black diamond
slope or you go

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.420
down the bunny slope.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:01.750
So in fact, the way biology has
learned, life has learned

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.960
to control this amount of energy
is basically taking the

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.290
bunny slope.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:14.350
And so the energy drop occurs
in a series of stages, where

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.720
you have the transfer of two
electrons to a lower state

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:21.760
intermediate, transfer of two
electrons to another one,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.400
transfer of two electrons
to another one.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.560
And where this connects with
the stuff that I just told

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.800
you, is as these two electrons
are coming down, what's

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.740
happening is a proton is
being pumped from the

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.250
inside to the outside.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:47.750
As it moves to the next lower
energy state, another proton

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.860
gets pumped from the inside,
the outside.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:53.590
And the same thing
happens here.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:08.790
So at the end, you get the two
hydrogens plus the half of an

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.680
oxygen and we get
a water molecule

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.010
from these two electrons.

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:18.890
But what's happened is these
three protons have changed

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.820
from inside to outside.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:26.500
That enables the cell
to make three ATPs.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.740
So now instead of throwing away
all that energy, losing

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.560
the NADH as in the
fermentations, the cell is

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:37.940
extracting energy out of it by
taking advantage of this

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.440
principle of the proton
gradient.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.720
So the game changes
if you're this

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.530
evolutionary designer or something.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.390
If you were trying to design
life from first principles

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:53.950
now, you could take
advantage of this.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.350
Well of course it doesn't
happen that way.

00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:00.620
Experiments happen all the time
in nature and something

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.940
happens and sometimes
it's very efficient,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:03.860
sometimes it isn't.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.160
But if it's there first
it gets going.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:12.440
In this case, the need now, or
the opportunity was that if an

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:20.505
organism could get more NADH out
of that original molecule

00:38:20.505 --> 00:38:24.400
of glucose, it could make more
energy than somebody else.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.950
And so the ultimate way to take
a molecule of glucose is

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.560
if you burn it with, oxygen
you end up with six carbon

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.990
dioxides and water.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.410
You burn it all away.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.590
So there's a system that,
in essence, does that.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:43.130
It's known as the citric
acid cycle.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:55.080
So you have the pyruvate that
comes from glycolysis.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:00.680
And the way it's processed is
first, one of the carboxyl

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.620
group on the pyruvate
is released, and

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.480
this produces acetyl.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.610
You can look to see
what CoA is.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:16.900
At the moment, it
doesn't matter.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.830
What does matter is this
is a 3-carbon compound.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:24.700
Acetyl, as you probably know,
is a two-carbon compound.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.790
And when you look in your
textbooks at the citric acid

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:33.990
cycle, you'll see this very
confusing circle with lots of

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.360
compounds and enzymes
and stuff.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.850
But I want you just keep your
eye on the ball here.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:45.750
If you'll notice, the compound
over here is in the cycle, is

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.390
four carbons.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.480
And what happens is this
2-carbon compound that was

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.170
derived from pyruvate gets
added to this to give a

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.080
6-carbon compound.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.690
And then that gets converted to
a 5-carbon compound with a

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.980
molecule of CO2 being
given off.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:10.120
That in turn gets converted to
a 4-carbon compound with

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.480
another molecule of
CO2 given off.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.400
And then there's some molecular
gymnastics here that

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.620
change the nature of the four
carbon compound a bit so you

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.940
can get back into the cycle.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:27.970
But look what's happened to
those three carbons that were

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.280
in the pyruvate.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.850
There's one of them, there's
the other one,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.490
there's the other one.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:40.250
So this citric acid cycle
produces, it actually makes

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:45.840
some ATP, but it makes
quite a bit of NADH.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:58.000
And it also makes another, one
more reduced electron carrier.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.920
It's not NADH, it's another one
that's used in the cell.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.160
But anyway, the cell is then
able to take all of this NADH

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.250
and this electron carrier plus
these to give you, what I'd

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.430
said, the net yield you
get from respiration.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:25.330
36 ATPs from a single
molecule of glucose.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.205
So sort of quite remarkable
to some extent.

00:41:29.205 --> 00:41:32.960
We're looking at evolution,
through, if you will, almost

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.770
like looking at biochemical
fossils and then when

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:41.060
something works, it's a living
fossil, we still

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.550
find it in our cells.
