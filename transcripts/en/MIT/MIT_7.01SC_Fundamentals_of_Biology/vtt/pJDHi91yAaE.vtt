00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.480
PROFESSOR: Here is the game
plan for the next

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.180
two or three lectures.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.460
I'm going to start by talking
about the chemical forces that

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.070
are important for the structure
and function of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.010
these biomolecules.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.800
And then I'm going to relate
them, as we go along, to how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.920
these properties influence the
characteristics of these key

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530
macromolecules.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:49.150
And in particular we'll be
talking about covalent bonds,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:59.640
hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, a
force known as van der Waals

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.610
forces, and something that's not
really a force but it's a

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.170
characteristic that's very
important, particularly when

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.760
we think about proteins
and lipids, called

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.010
hydrophobicity--

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.400
literally "fear of water."

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.810
And then the order
of the molecules.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.200
As we talk, I'll talk about
carbohydrates first.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.710
I'll try and get
to that today.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:47.590
Then we'll talk about proteins,
nucleic acids, and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.390
lipids, in that order.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.170
As you'll see, these two will
be sufficient to understand

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.130
most of the characteristics
of carbohydrates.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.630
Whereas we're going to need all
five of these to be able

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.890
to get an intelligent
understanding of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.695
how proteins work.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:08.789
Now, I'll caution you.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.209
It's going to seem--

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.780
God, he's going to talk about
covalent bonds, as everybody

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.190
is rolling their eyes.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.530
I heard about covalent bonds
in grade one or something.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.140
But the difference here is that
we're going to be looking

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.720
at some of these forces, some
of which you've been exposed

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.900
to already, but from a
biological perspective.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.770
And I hope if you kind of watch
that, you'll begin to

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.650
see that you're looking at
something that may be sort of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.560
familiar to you.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.060
But you have to start thinking
about it in a different way

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.910
once you start thinking of what
are the implications of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.510
the properties of these forces
and the way these molecules

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.110
behave for biology.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.350
So, begin with the one that
everybody undoubtedly knows,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.780
which are covalent bonds.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.370
And this is the principal force

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.410
that holds atoms together.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.220
And it's based on sharing
electrons.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.130
And as I'll say, these are
very strong bonds.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.720
And so in the simplest sort of
example, hydrogen atom has one

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.710
unpaired electron, a
carbon has four.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:32.630
And so you can make
methane, CH4.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.840
And commonly in chemistry and
biology we use a line to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.465
represent a pair of electrons.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.570
So there's methane.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.160
As I said, apart from you know
it burns, if you go out in a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.790
swamp or in a beach and you
see bubbles, muddy bottom

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.980
coming up, those are bubbles of
methane made by methanogens

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.810
that are living in the anaerobic
layer underneath.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.470
A cow has a special
fermentation,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.720
digestion cavity inside.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.630
It's huge, called a rumen,
stuff sloshing around.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.240
And it's full of archaea,
that are methanogens.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.329
And a cow makes about 400
liters of methane a day.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.440
And Penny will tell you, it's
a very bad greenhouse gas.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.740
It's much more potent
than carbon dioxide.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.710
And so the typical length of a
covalent bond is about 1.5 to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.190
0.2 nanometers.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.830
And I hope you'll try and begin
to get a sense of the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.180
links of some of these
things, too.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:58.700
But the key point about this
is to break a carbon-carbon

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.550
bond needs 83 kilocalories
per mole.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.000
So that's a lot of energy.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.950
At 25 degrees centigrade, if
you take, say, a typical

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:25.040
vibrational mode of a covalent
bond, the energy that it has

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:32.110
is about 0.6 kcals per mole.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.020
So what that means is that
covalent bonds don't break on

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.510
their own under physiological
conditions.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:51.680
They can bend, they can rotate,
and they can stretch.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.590
So they're back and forth this
way, they can go this way,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.420
this way, but they
don't break.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:04.740
And so this sort of leads to
another topic that we'll talk

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.410
about, which is utterly key--

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.720
It's one of the secrets
of how life works--

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.740
are these protein molecules
that are known as enzymes.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.890
And we'll also talk a little bit
about a similar thing made

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.210
of RNA called a ribozyme.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:38.340
But what these are are
biological catalysts that

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:47.000
enable specific bonds-- and
this is important--

00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:06.280
specific bonds to be broken or
formed under physiological

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.530
conditions.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.910
And this part is so important.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.850
If you're trying to work out
a chemical reaction, the

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.410
original process for taking
nitrogen gas and making

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.840
ammonia, the Haber process,
involved some very, very tough

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.260
molecule to break the bond of.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.310
So just heat it up to 500
degrees and put in a catalyst.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.810
But if you're a living
organism, you

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:34.990
don't have that option.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.453
You have to continually make
and break bonds under the

00:07:40.453 --> 00:07:43.160
conditions -- the very, very
narrow conditions where life

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.170
is possible.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.710
If you go a little too high,
things like proteins unfold.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.380
And then they don't work as
properly as machines anymore.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.880
So we'll be talking more about
that as we go along.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.590
There are different types
of covalent bonds.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.700
And again, the first
part of this isn't

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.500
going to surprise you.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.290
There are single bonds,
like this.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:16.140
There are double bonds,
and triple.

00:08:18.822 --> 00:08:19.716
Excuse me.

00:08:19.716 --> 00:08:21.615
I'll just stay with carbon
for the moment.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.030
The more electrons that are
shared, the stronger the bond.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:39.260
And these two are referred to,
if it's a carbon compound, as

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.919
being unsaturated bonds, the
same term you hear when you

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.950
hear about unsaturated fats.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.540
And what that means is a fat
with an unsaturation, that's

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.130
unsaturated, will have somewhere
in it a double bond,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.640
or in some cases, many
double bonds.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.390
However, there's another aspect
of this which might not

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.020
have been relevant to you, but
you'll see it becomes relevant

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.550
for thinking about proteins as
soon as the next lecture.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:14.090
And that is, a single bond is
able to rotate this way.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:22.190
These guys can't rotate.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.330
And that, as you'll see, becomes
important in quite a

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.240
variety of situations.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.540
But we'll run into a very
important example of that when

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:38.990
we're thinking about the very
backbone of all proteins, the

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.500
peptide bond, which is at the
heart of being a protein.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.970
There are other molecules that
have more than one bond that

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.520
are important.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.402
Oxygen is one.

00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:50.020
And nitrogen, as I said, is a

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.195
particularly hard nut to crack.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.400
Most organisms, as I said the
other day, are unable

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.590
to break this bond.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.530
The only organisms that
have learned how

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.310
to do it are bacteria.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.760
The vast majority of them use
one, single enzyme called

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.620
nitrogenase that evolved that's
a very complicated

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.070
enzyme and has very, very
stringent requirements and

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.070
needs a huge energy input.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.580
But it is able to crack
this bond and get

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.800
it made into ammonia.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.060
But it's an example of another
molecule that has a triple

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.538
bond in it.

00:10:29.538 --> 00:10:32.090
Let's see, how are
we doing here?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.950
Okay.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:45.130
So another aspect of these
covalent bonds that you need

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.440
to think about has to
do with when you're

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.340
thinking about carbon.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.240
And it's a property
called chirality.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:01.120
And it comes from the fact that
carbon has four bonds but

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.600
they come out as
a tetrahedron.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.220
So that doesn't matter in
the case of methane.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.560
But I'm going to depict the
tetrahedron in this way, so

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.760
that this bond is coming --

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.930
these two are in the plane of
the board, this one's coming

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.030
out, that one's going back.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.160
And let's just put on four
different substituents.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:37.160
Now if I get the mirror image
of that, we will have--

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.820
these two molecules are called
optical isomers.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.800
And if you sit down and play
with this, you will find you

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.290
can't convert one to the other
without actually physically

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.130
breaking a bond.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.510
And this is really important,
one of the central concepts

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.400
that I hope you might remember
from this course because it

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.270
cuts across a lot of the stuff
talk we'll be talking about.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:39.500
At a molecular level, much
of biology relies on the

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:50.350
interaction of complementary
3D surfaces.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:58.720
We're actually very familiar
with this at a macro level in

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.610
our own lives.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.070
Imagine you've just come back
from the party late on

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.815
Saturday night, you're
crossing the Mass.

00:13:05.815 --> 00:13:09.590
Ave. Bridge, the wind is
howling, you're freezing.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.365
But no problem, you've
got your gloves.

00:13:11.365 --> 00:13:16.170
And you reach in your pocket and
you have two left gloves.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.070
No matter what you do, you can't
get that right hand to

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.750
fit properly into the
left-handed glove.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.125
One's a mirror image
of the other.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:32.260
But we run into this problem
even in our own lives.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.750
When you saw how that DNA
had fit right into a

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.450
groove in the protein.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.635
If we had a mirror image of
the DNA or we had a mirror

00:13:44.635 --> 00:13:46.430
image of the protein,
it wouldn't work.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.790
This principle goes all the
way through biology.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.580
There is another characteristic
of covalent

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:04.120
bonds that becomes
important again.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:10.040
And that is how equally the
electrons are sharing.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.740
So again, it goes back
to the sharing of

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.290
electrons, but with a twist.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:20.930
If we have a carbon-carbon or
a carbon-hydrogen bond, it's

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.100
pretty much equal sharing.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.710
And this is known as
a nonpolar bond.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:41.725
But if you have a nitrogen or an
oxygen bond, it's unequal.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:50.350
And these are known
as polar bonds.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:56.740
And the term that's used to
describe this unequal sharing

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:08.210
of electrons is known as the
electronegativity of the atom.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.240
It's basically a word that
means the greediness of a

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.790
particular atom for electrons.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:19.490
So if you have an oxygen and a
hydrogen bond, although we

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.680
write it like that on the board
and you've undoubtedly

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.790
seen this for many years in
chemistry, in fact, the

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.780
electrons spend more time down
here than they spend up there.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.450
So there's a little bit of a
negative charge on the oxygen

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.840
and a little bit of a plus
charge on the hydrogen.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.030
That's usually represented by
a little delta to indicate

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:46.760
that this has a wee bit of
negative charge, that has a

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.270
wee bit of positive charge.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.540
And a molecule that's
very important with

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.710
respect to this is water.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.315
Because water, as you
know, is H2O.

00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:01.390
But it's not symmetrical.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.570
The angle here is
104.5 degrees.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:10.210
And so the oxygen has a little
bit of a negative charge but

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.960
each of these has a little
bit of a plus charge.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:20.550
Actually, water is 55 molar.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.440
So it's a little dipole.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.510
You've got 55 molar, these
little dipoles going on.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.430
This property of
electronegativity and nonpolar

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:42.090
bonds then leads to the second
of the forces that we're going

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.680
to be talking about.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.428
That's force number two.

00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:56.210
And that's a hydrogen,
or H bond.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:06.829
And this is a bond that's made
possible by a little bit of a

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.200
negative charge that's on
oxygen, or nitrogen, or a few

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.352
other molecules and a little
bit of a positive charge

00:17:16.352 --> 00:17:21.270
that's due to the hydrogen
that's in a polar bond.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:38.400
This is very important, as
you'll see, for proteins,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:48.160
nucleic acids, and for
carbohydrates.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.330
And it has a huge amount
to do with the

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.240
way that water behaves.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.590
Because in that 55-molar water,
you'll have one water

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.830
molecule that's going
to be like this.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.255
And there will be another water
molecule down here with

00:18:06.255 --> 00:18:07.670
a little bit of a
negative charge.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.880
And this a little bit of a plus
charge on this hydrogen

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.860
and a little bit of a negative
charge can form what's known

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.500
as a hydrogen bond
between them.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.060
And what's especially important
about these hydrogen

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:40.270
bonds is they're about
1/20 the strength

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.110
of a covalent bond.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.320
And that means that in a
distribution of molecules at

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.463
physiological temperatures,
there will be some guys up in

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:52.360
the -- the most energetic
molecules within the bunch

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.330
will have enough energy to
break hydrogen bonds.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.830
But they're much easier to do.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.430
And just to peer ahead, when we
talk about replicating DNA,

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.270
those two strands are held
together by hydrogen bonds.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.860
So the backbones are really
solid, just like two strips of

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:10.870
Velcro or something.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:15.490
But the hydrogen bonds hold the
two strands together, but

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:16.660
1/20 the strength.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.960
So it's basically like molecular
Velcro between the

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.850
two strands of DNA.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:28.500
And we'll see some more
examples of this.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.943
Let's see if I can go
back to this and get

00:19:29.943 --> 00:19:30.900
this thing to play.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.730
This is static representation
just illustrating this.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.580
But in fact, what happens,
water molecules are

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.160
continually changing partners.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.770
So they're constantly making
shells, and cages, and so on.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:49.430
And the next little movie is a
picosecond simulation of water

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.760
just at zero degrees.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.250
And you can see how the
molecules are changing

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.440
partners, making little
shells and things.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.490
And here's a picosecond
simulation of water at the

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.225
boiling temperature.

00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:03.790
And what you can see from this
is every now and then, a

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.020
molecule like this one will get
enough energy to break out

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.010
of this constant sharing
of little

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:14.820
hydrogen bonds and escape.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.870
And another thing, when we talk
about getting something

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.170
dissolved in water, this
is something we'll

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:20.940
have to think about.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.800
Because if you try and dissolve
something in water,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.270
like stir a lot of oil into
it, you know what happens.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.510
You can stir like mad
and doesn't go in.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.890
Part of the problem is if you
put something in the water,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.210
it's going to have to break
these existing hydrogen bonds.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.920
And that's an energy cost.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.880
So in order to get something to
dissolve, you're going to

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.490
have to get the energy back.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:42.630
And we'll be talking
about that.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.800
But it's one of the fundamental
parts of water.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.760
You're familiar with the
characteristics of water.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.390
There's surface tension.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.920
It's why trees can grow 300 feet
tall, because they've got

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.330
basically little nanotubes
and little capillaries.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:01.620
And with this surface tension,
water, due to hydrogen bonds,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.120
can go 300 feet up.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.490
The water can go right up.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.470
You've seen water bugs
walk around on water.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.100
There's a particularly
interesting lizard in South

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.800
America, Central America called
the basilisk lizard

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.250
that's about 2 and
1/2 feet long.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.530
It's able to run across
the top of the water.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.900
It's actually called the
Jesus Christ lizard.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.030
And it's able to do that
because of this surface

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.300
tension in the water.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:33.160
In fact, when I finished my
Ph.D. Thesis, I went in a

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.610
competition for the theses.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.490
And mine was something like, a
chemical enzymatic synthesis

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.310
of oligoribonucleotides.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.870
And I was competing against a
guy who said why do lizards

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.280
run on water, and his entire
talk consisted of movies of

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.510
this thing running
across the water.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.970
I thought I was toast, but I
actually won that prize.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.090
But anyway, every time I
see this I remember it.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.380
For example, when they go and
explore Mars or think about

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.350
planets, they're always looking
for water because it

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.300
has this very, very special set
of properties that are so

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.980
important for life.
