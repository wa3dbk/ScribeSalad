00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:40.120
PROFESSOR: Recombinant DNA,
often referred to also as

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.050
genetic engineering.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
This is a series of techniques,
series of methods

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.440
that allow us to manipulate DNA
for a variety of reasons.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.140
Now, we take it for granted.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170
It's very much part of our
everyday life in the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.180
laboratory.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.920
It's made a huge impact on
the biotechnology and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.910
pharmaceutical industries
as well.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.150
It wasn't always so
uncontroversial.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.930
In fact, in the 1960s and '70s,
when this technology was

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.490
first being developed, it was
great concern about scientists

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.840
manipulating DNA, manipulating
genetic material.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.600
In the city of Cambridge, in
fact, had a moratorium for a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.430
while on the practice of
genetic engineering or

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.920
recombinant DNA technology,
which fortunately, ultimately

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.910
was overcome with good practices
and I think good

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.800
education about what the real
limits of risk and benefit

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.030
were so that now it's used very
widely and, I would also

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.360
say, very safely.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.570
The bottom line for what we're
going to talk about today and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.540
for this section of the class is
the ability to isolate and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.055
to amplify specific
DNA sequences.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.210
They might be particular genes
of interest to us.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.320
They might be whole genomes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.690
They might be other regions of
DNA, but we need to be able to

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.680
isolate them from the cells of
the organisms of interest,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.730
amplify them up into large
quantities in order to be able

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.270
to study them in detail, and to
make modifications in them.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.460
This is done in a variety
of organisms for

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.320
a variety of purposes.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.220
One of them, and this is by no
means the only one, but one

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.690
that sort of strikes home
is the ability to make

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.700
therapeutic proteins, to be
able to manufacture in the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.400
laboratory or in a company
proteins they could have

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.230
benefit for patients who are,
for example, lacking the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.350
function of a particular protein
or enzyme leading to a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.470
disease state.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.820
One can use these methods to
produce that protein in the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.645
laboratory, and treat
the individual.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.700
This can be done in bacteria
such as E. coli.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.440
E. coli, which is the common
gut bacterium that we all

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.650
carry, a very useful organism.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.460
We use it in the lab.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.580
We're going to use in our
demonstrations today.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.170
This is the standard vehicle
in which we'd grow up,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.870
recombinant DNA, amplify
recombinant DNA for further

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.690
uses, but we can also make
therapeutic proteins using the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.925
manufacturing capabilities
of the bacterium.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.020
Plants, likewise,
can be a source

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.410
of therapeutic proteins.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.650
We can modify the genomes of
plants so they will produce in

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.990
large quantities therapeutic
proteins of interest, which

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.910
then can be ingested by the
individual, which can reduce

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.750
production costs significantly,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.890
and animals, likewise.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.860
We can manipulate the genes of
animals so that they will

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.070
express a protein of interest
and secrete that protein, for

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.400
example, into the milk.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.430
So there are so-called
transgenic cows and transgenic

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.854
goats that produce therapeutic
proteins in the mammary gland

00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:22.780
and secrete those therapeutic
proteins into the milk.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.620
So the individual just needs to
drink the milk and receive

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.260
the relevant dose.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.290
So there are lots of ways, that
this technology can be

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.140
helpful including in the
context of medicine.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.080
We can also engineer
organisms.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.910
I've already given you examples
of that, but that was

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.220
really for the purposes of using
those organisms as a

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.930
factory to make something
of interest to us.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.930
But we can manipulate the genes
of plants, for example,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.950
to make them resistant to
various pests to make them

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.040
more robust, to give them
a longer shelf life.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.530
We can manipulate them for the
better production of things

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.600
that are valuable to us.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.560
Again, this is a bit of
a controversial area,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.170
genetically modified foods, not
always well-accepted by

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.590
everyone because again, the
thought is, this might be

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.160
disrupting the food chain in
important ways, and this might

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.450
be ultimately not
so beneficial.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.720
Personally don't agree with
that, but lots of people do

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.540
feel that way.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.920
We're going to teach you the
methods that we use to allow

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.800
us to do this.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:50.810
And again, in work that I've
alluded to from my own lab, we

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.690
use these methods to manipulate
the genes of

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.790
animals, in our case it's mice,
but there are lots of

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.560
animal species that one can use
in order to create, for

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.860
example, disease models.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.600
We talked to you about,
Professor Brown talked to you

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.350
about genetic diseases.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.610
They have specific alterations
in genes.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.260
We can use these methods to make
similar alterations in

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.740
the genes of mice and other
animal species and then study

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.250
the disease process in those
animals, develop new

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.610
treatments in those animals
in ways that are

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.750
hard to do in people.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.750
So there's lots and lots, and
these are just a few examples,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.400
lots and lots of important uses
for genetic engineering

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.880
and recombinant DNA
technology.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.080
One that we'll emphasize in
just a few lectures and is

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.320
becoming extremely common and
popular nowadays is DNA

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.780
sequencing.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.090
You need to isolate the DNA from
the organism of interest

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.780
and then have it in such a
fashion that you can sequence

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.200
it's nucleotides.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.260
This is a very popular
activity now.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.430
And specifically with respect
to human health, DNA

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.130
sequencing, But some of the
other methods that we're going

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.610
to talk about as well, allow
us to characterize

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.950
disease-causing mutations
at molecular detail.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.120
So we know what causes x
disease or y disease.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.020
We can understand the
consequences for the

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.520
individual-encoded proteins
for the pathways that they

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.370
regulate, and we can come up
with better medicines.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.210
I think about this with respect
to cancer, but it's

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.880
really changing the treatment
of all diseases as we

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.760
understand more the molecular
basis, the genetic basis of

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.870
those diseases.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.110
And these techniques have
been essential to

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.620
allow us to do that.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.020
I want to cover a little bit
of history so that you know

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.270
from whence this came.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.120
Things really began
to pick up in this

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.380
field in the late 1960s.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:17.870
And the critical advance at this
stage, was the discovery

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.070
of a method to cleave DNA into
defined fragments, to start

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.700
with a genome or chromosome
and to be able to cut it

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.010
particular places reproducibly
so that one could isolate

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.130
fragments of DNA away from the
mass of DNA, isolate a

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.450
particular region of the DNA
away from everything else

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.700
using this method.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.670
It wasn't enough just
to cut the DNA up.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.470
You had to amplify it up.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.120
In order to amplify it up, you
needed a vessel in which to do

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.240
the amplification, and the
vessel of choice as I

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.930
mentioned was bacteria.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.310
And this relied on a method that
actually was known for

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.470
decades before but actually was
not used for this purpose

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:23.590
until the early 1970s, and
it's called bacterial

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.210
transformation.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.430
You can transform bacteria by
adding a new DNA sequence, and

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.130
the bacteria will take up that
new DNA sequence and begin to

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.415
express the genes that are
present on that DNA sequence

00:09:34.415 --> 00:09:36.860
as if it was one of their own.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.890
So the transfer of DNA a was
critical, this process of

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.320
bacterial transformation.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.870
And then the final thing which
also occurred in the 1970s was

00:09:45.870 --> 00:10:03.020
the identification of methods to
amplify DNA sequences once

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.090
they got inside of bacteria.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.320
It wasn't enough to actually
get them in there.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.180
You needed some special way
to cause the bacterium to

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.700
amplify, that is, to replicate
the DNA that was present

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.450
within them.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.760
And these three events, which
all came together in about a

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.770
five to ten year period, really
initiated, launched

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:32.590
what we now call the recombinant
DNA revolution and

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.840
initiated the biotechnology
industry, which

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.710
started in the mid 1970s.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.090
And an individual above all
others who is credited with

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:51.990
launching the biotechnology
industry was Robert Swanson

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.790
who in 1966 or so was
sitting where you

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:59.010
are as an MIT freshman.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.650
Bob Swanson was class
of '69, actually.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:07.620
And at the age of 28, in 1976,
founded the company Genentech

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.550
with a scientist, Herb Boyer,
who was very instrumental in

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.070
some of those breakthroughs that
I just mentioned to you.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.130
And I mention Bob to you now
because of your connections

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.660
through MIT.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.220
But he was a wonderful guy and
sadly passed away from

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.790
glioblastoma at the age of 52.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.080
So he didn't really get to fully
realize the benefits of

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.340
what he had started, but
he did, in fact,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.670
start a great deal.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.810
And this is a famous statue at
Genentech which shows Herb

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.100
Boyer and Bob Swanson talking
about the idea for the first

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.390
time and you might notice over a
beer, very important part of

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.880
science, discussions
over a beer.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.320
In addition to this connection
to MIT and really in honor of

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.880
Bob's connections to MIT, and
a great pride that Bob had

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.320
actually in MIT, credited MIT
greatly with him learning

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.520
about science, the importance of
science, and also business.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.580
He got a degree in chemistry as
well as a degree from the

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.900
Sloan School.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.590
We decided when we launched the
Koch Institute to name a

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.950
very large space in the Koch
Institute for Bob Swanson.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.910
It's called the Swanson
Biotechnology Center.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.980
You can visit it.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.470
So it's a series of core
facilities that support all of

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.090
our researchers.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.160
And indeed, researchers across
the MIT campus, and this is a

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.310
nice quote from Bob's widow,
Judy Swanson, who has been

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.320
very supportive of
this effort.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.050
So Bob Swanson and MIT, in many
ways, actually, have a

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.990
lot to do with the technology
and the revolution that we're

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.990
going to talk about now.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.760
All right.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.330
So as I mentioned, we are
going to do a demo.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:50.040
We're going to teach you a
real-life example now of how

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.270
this work is done.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:02.800
And our goal is to
clone a gene.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.450
You can actually wait
right there, Anna.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.700
Thanks.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.820
We're going to clone a gene,
and we're going to clone a

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.440
particular gene.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.600
It's a toxin gene.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.075
It's a gene from a pathogenic
bacterium.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.910
And you might ask the question,
a reasonable

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.190
question, why the heck
would you do that?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.530
Why would you clone
a toxin gene?

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.950
So what do you think?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.100
What's the purpose in the
laboratory of cloning out a

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.415
toxin-encoding gene from
a pathogenic bacterium?

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.450
So several people have suggested
the obvious was that

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:59.950
you want to engage in global
terror, which we actually

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:04.900
don't support here at MIT, so
we're going to take that down.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.030
But maybe somebody else
is going to do that.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:11.160
So perhaps it would be good if
we got one step ahead of the

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.760
game, isolated the gene,
manufactured the protein, and

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.400
then made a vaccine against that
toxin so that we could

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.490
prevent the bad consequences
of exposure to the toxin.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.480
Or maybe that thing is actually
very interesting

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.210
independent of its bad uses.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.460
We could learn stuff, which
might be helpful ultimately in

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.490
related activities.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.050
So for the general purpose of
biomedical research, we often

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.743
study how these organisms work
because it can teach us

00:14:44.743 --> 00:14:46.100
things, sometimes surprising
things that are

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.740
useful down the road.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:59.240
The organism in question is
Streptococcus pyogenes.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.490
Streptococcus pyogenes, which
causes in certain cases, in

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:12.270
certain individuals a disease
called necrotizing fasciitis.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.960
Necrotizing fasciitis, which
is otherwise more commonly

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.855
called the flesh-eating
disease.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.440
And you might think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.240
This is a true thing.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.010
This is a true thing, and some
of you might be squeamish, and

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:38.520
if you are, and I'm being
serious here.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.270
If you're squeamish looking
at ugly, nasty, disgusting

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.120
pictures, close your
eyes for a second.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.910
I'll tell you when you
can open them.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.800
But this is an individual who
was exposed to this bacterium

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.680
and developed necrotizing
fasciitis.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.340
That's a real-world case, so
it is really pretty bad.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.570
You can open your eyes now
if you closed them.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.450
I hesitate to show that slide
because in the past, I've had

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.720
a few boys throw up when
I showed that slide.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.090
So what are we going to do?

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.610
Well, we're going to
isolate this gene.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.010
And in order to isolate this
gene, we need to be able to

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:19.390
separate it, this gene,
from the chromosome

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.160
in which it is contained.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.610
And the chromosome from which
it is contained is the

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.860
chromosome of S. pyogenes.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.500
So this is the S. pyogenes
chromosome.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.370
It's about four million
base pairs and it

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:51.220
has about 1,000 genes.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.090
So spread throughout this
circular chromosome, there are

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.030
lots of genes.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.980
We're interested
in one of them.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.620
Now, this chromosome also has
another thing on it, which I

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.670
hope you all know about from
the material that Professor

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.760
Sive just covered for you.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.420
What is the one piece of DNA
material that all chromosomes

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.585
need in order to replicate?

00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:14.275
AUDIENCE: Origin
of replication.

00:17:14.275 --> 00:17:20.119
PROFESSOR: An origin of
replication, very good.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.450
An origin of replication.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.430
It has an origin of replication,
and then it has a

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.680
bunch of genes.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.130
It has gene A. I'm just
making this up.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.030
It has gene B, and it
has a whole bunch of

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.710
other genes as well.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.580
And then it has -- and imagine
that this orange chalk was red

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.040
because it's more effective
if it's red.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.610
It has the T gene, and that's
the toxin gene.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:57.390
So our goal is to transfer the
T gene and not the rest of

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.300
this stuff, because we don't
actually care about the rest

00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.800
of the stuff.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.540
We just care about
the T gene --

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.940
into the E. coli cells for
the reasons that I

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.320
mentioned up there.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:23.850
And in order to do that, we have
to grow large amounts of

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.110
the organism that's going to
in a sense donate the DNA.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:35.150
We then isolate the chromosomal
DNA, and we'll

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.400
show you how.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:48.750
We're then going to use this
method to fragment the DNA not

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.055
randomly, but in specific
places.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.310
And then we're going to transfer
the DNA of interest

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.580
to E. coli using this method
of transformation.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.910
We're going to take this
fragment and move it through

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.700
the membrane of the E. coli so
that it becomes resident

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.470
inside the E. coli cell.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.120
So now on to our demonstration
and my lab assistant, Anna

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.850
Deconinck, will help me here.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:28.530
So what we've done is to, in
the laboratory, isolate S.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:35.950
pyogenes as well as E. coli,
grow them up in large

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:36.900
quantities.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.150
You've got your gloves, right?

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.510
So I'll take the buffers.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.300
So we have various solutions and
buffers that will allow us

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.660
to sort of wash the stuff we
don't want away from the

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.980
bacterial cells, lice the
bacterial membrane, isolate

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.600
the nucleic acid away from all
the other stuff that's inside

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:07.720
the cells, and then we'll purify
the chromosomal DNA.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:16.250
So Anna has grown up E. coli
and S. pyogenes, taken that

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.910
suspension of cells, and used
a centrifuge to spin those

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.720
cells down to the bottom of
these tubes here-- you can

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.360
show them, Anna-- these
tubes here.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.400
And the first thing we need
to do is get rid of the

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.640
supernate, the broth that
the cells grew in.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.740
So first, we're going
to decant.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.580
Here, you can decant the
pyogenes, but be

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:35.310
careful with it.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.220
So we're going to decant this
in order to grow up the

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.980
amounts of bacteria
that we need.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.860
Now we're doing this in a
very small quantities.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.740
In fact, in industrial scale,
you do it in huge--

00:20:55.206 --> 00:20:56.456
ANNA: Sorry.

00:20:59.688 --> 00:21:01.870
PROFESSOR: Ah, that's
a problem.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.401
It's actually a bit
more of a problem.

00:21:07.401 --> 00:21:11.170
ANNA: I just have a
buffer to wash.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.120
PROFESSOR: I don't think that's
going to do it, Anna.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.380
Dude, we may need to actually
skip, we may need to cancel.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.600
This is a little more serious.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.850
Wait a minute.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.460
Well, I don't know.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.200
Maybe.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.050
Let's just see if it's
safe or not.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.740
I think it'll be okay.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.210
All right.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.460
That was a joke.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.260
She did very well though,
don't you think?

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.360
She did very well.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.695
That was outstanding.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.390
Anybody want some apple juice?

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.580
You're welcome to it.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.166
ANNA: It needs ice.

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:58.430
PROFESSOR: Of course we would
never bring pathogenic

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.680
bacterium to class.
