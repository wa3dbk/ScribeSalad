00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:07.290
ERIC LANDER: That worked.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.800
Let's do it again.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.970
Now, number 2.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.790
I would like to clone not the
Arg1 gene, but let's say the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.020
beta globin gene from human.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.290
So let's take human
beta globin.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.070
I want to clone it.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.810
So human beta globin,
hemoglobin, it's a tetromer.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.530
It has four parts.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.070
It's got an alpha, an alpha,
a beta, and a beta.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.930
Four proteins come together
in a protein tetromer.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.880
And it's got two alphas,
two betas.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.520
The beta subunit of hemoglobin
is encoded by the human beta

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.820
globin gene.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.245
That's the nomenclature here.

00:00:55.245 --> 00:00:56.870
All right.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.120
Let's clone beta globin.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.670
Same deal.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.709
How are we going to do it?

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:05.959
Any takers?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.800
What should we start with?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.210
Yes?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.436
AUDIENCE: Find a restriction
enzyme?

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:14.080
ERIC LANDER: Find a restriction
enzyme.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.890
I'll go to catalogue and
try EcoRI today.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.800
OK?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.158
Now what?

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:25.078
AUDIENCE: Add it to a bunch
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:25.078 --> 00:01:26.740
ERIC LANDER: So I'm going
to start with human DNA?

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.945
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:31.380
ERIC LANDER: Yes is
a good answer.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.050
Yes.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.990
I'm going to start
with human DNA.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.370
Good.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.160
Let's get that up there.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.780
We're going to start--

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.745
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:38.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.120
ERIC LANDER: So we'll start
with human DNA.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.430
There we go, pieces of human
DNA cut with EcoRI.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.680
Now, what are we going to do?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.590
Takers?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.590
Let's attach it to a vector.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.560
Actually, wait a second.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.330
This vector here, I told you
that there were vectors that

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.707
could grow in E. coli.

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:08.930
Did I ever tell you there
were vectors that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.180
could grow a yeast?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.800
There are.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.720
And they're in the catalog.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.530
OK.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.000
Yes?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.650
Now, what am I going to do?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.980
I'm going to attach
this to a vector.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.900
Now, what do I do?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.490
What vector do I want
to attach this to?

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.490
Where is it going to grow?

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.740
Human cells.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.550
That's interesting.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.365
So one option would
be human cells.

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:47.340
So we want to take a vector
that grows in human cells.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.590
Ha.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.373
Yep.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.623
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.790
ERIC LANDER: Then I need
a mammalian origin of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.730
replication.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.520
ERIC LANDER: And a mammal--

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.380
Well, so it turns out that I
can technically do this.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.610
There are now vectors
that I can use to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.340
grow in human cells.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.820
It's a lot harder to do.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.680
So let's try doing it with a
microbe first, but then we'll

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.950
come back and we'll
do it with human.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.220
So try doing this
in a microbe.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.050
What have you got
for a microbe?

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.300
How do we do this
in a microbe?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.710
Well, let's try E. coli for
the sake of argument.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.480
But we could also try, keep in
mind your human for a second.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.450
We do this, we do this,
we get a plate.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.070
One of these guys is going to
have alpha globin, one of them

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.500
will have collagen.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.910
That guy here has beta globin.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.770
How are we going to
recognize it?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.020
This is tough.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.490
What were you going to
do for the human?

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.194
AUDIENCE: No idea.

00:04:02.194 --> 00:04:03.405
ERIC LANDER: But you were
going to get it

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:04.390
into a human cell.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.680
ERIC LANDER: Were you going to
try to do complementation?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.886
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:04:07.886 --> 00:04:08.400
ERIC LANDER: Yeah.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.440
The problem doing
complementation is most human

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.660
cells don't need beta globin.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.900
What's beta globin good for?

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.375
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.472
ERIC LANDER: What's hemoglobin
good for?

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:18.316
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:20.790
ERIC LANDER: It's in your red
blood cells to transport

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.500
oxygen around.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.940
You think individual
cells care?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.840
Nah.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.130
Your marrow might,
but only in C2.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.680
The problem with doing it in a
human cell initially is, if we

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.920
tried the same exact trick
and we tried a beta

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.580
globin-deficient human cell,
and we're going to try to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.810
complement with a beta globin,
the problem is we don't have

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.480
any conditions under which
that cell cares.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.230
But we'll come back and even
do more because we could do

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.960
things here.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.970
So now what are we
going to do?

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.950
How are we going to see where
our beta globin is?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.800
ERIC LANDER: Make the protein.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.100
So we're going to
persuade this E.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.570
coli to make the protein.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.271
And how are we going to
recognize the protein?

00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:59.955
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:59.955 --> 00:05:03.430
ERIC LANDER: So how can we
recognize a protein?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.705
AUDIENCE: Function.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:06.590
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.536
AUDIENCE: Function.

00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:09.120
ERIC LANDER: Function.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.880
The problem is we didn't really
have a function to

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.130
complement.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.490
Electrophoresis.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.110
We could actually take every
colony on the plate, grow it

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.760
up, purify the proteins, and
see if there was a protein

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.410
band at just the right place
for beta globin.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.590
We'd have to look at about a
million colonies to do it.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.550
Maybe a little more, actually
more because you know,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.710
statistics and all, 10
million colonies.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.640
And the issue there is graduate
students tend to, you

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.480
can check with the TAs, but on
the whole, tend to rebel at

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.530
the thought of prepping protein
from 10 million

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.030
separate cells.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.780
How else can we tell if our
cells are making beta globin?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.680
AUDIENCE: You add
a marker to it?

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.850
ERIC LANDER: Something that
sticks to beta globin.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.480
Turns out that antibodies are
really good for this.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.590
If you take beta globin and you
inject a mouse with beta

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.835
globin, it'll make an immune
reaction against it.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.960
And we'll learn more about the
immune system in the course,

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.840
but it will actually make
antibodies that

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.540
bind to beta globin.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.030
So suppose I told you there were
antibodies that actually

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.280
bind to beta globin?

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.900
Now, what can I do?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.235
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:26.550
ERIC LANDER: I'll make it a
fluorescent antibody, sure.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.780
You can have a fluorescent
antibody if you want.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.320
Fluorescent antibody
that knows how to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.780
bind to beta globin.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.940
Now, how do I find my cell?

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.660
AUDIENCE: Colonies.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.900
ERIC LANDER: Take my colonies.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.410
Do what to them?

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.874
AUDIENCE: Add antibodies.

00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:41.314
And look for the colony
that had antibodies--

00:06:41.314 --> 00:06:42.630
ERIC LANDER: Stuck to it.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.780
I just wash antibodies
over my colonies and

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.470
see where it sticks.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.810
Now, the only details are this
is on an agar plate, and it's

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.520
really messy to do that.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.010
So just technical details of
pulling that off are I

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.970
actually grew these on a little
piece of filter paper.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.330
So I put a piece of
filter paper down.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.490
I grow the colonies on filter
paper getting their little

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.680
nutrients through there.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.350
I take off my piece of filter
paper that has my colonies

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.490
growing on it.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.780
I need to crack open all of
those cells, and it turns out

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.200
I can do that by a chemical
treatment that will crack open

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.480
all the cells and leave
their protein

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.960
contents just spewed out.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.570
They spew out their guts
right here, each cell.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.190
And then I wash my antibody
over it, and my

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.550
fluorescently-labeled antibody
sticks to that guy telling me

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.090
that beta globin was
right there.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.340
Any questions?

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.835
I did it.

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:39.085
You did it.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.780
Except there's a problem.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.568
What was your problem?

00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:49.774
AUDIENCE: Is it possible that
the antibody won't stick?

00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:51.330
ERIC LANDER: It's a wonderful
antibody.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.665
It's a perfectly specific
antibody.

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:54.230
The antibody is totally
perfect.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.480
It only sticks to beta globin.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.010
Does the bacteria want
to make beta globin?

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.050
You're throwing this stuff in
and if any bacteria actually

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.210
did make you beta globin, this
would be working perfectly.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.800
The little problem is, will a
piece of human DNA thrown into

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.890
E. coli make beta globin?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.120
No.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.280
Why not?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.220
Well, let's go back to
our understanding

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.470
of how genes work.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.210
The beta globin gene is a
locus that has a human

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:36.940
promoter which then goes
and makes a transcript.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.809
That transcript has
multiple exons.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.660
Those exons go into the
transcript and are spliced

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.490
together to make a
mature message.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.830
Here is the mature message,
which gets translated.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.480
We have splicing, and then
this gets translated.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.070
The spliced product
gets translated.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.280
And what's the problem asking
E. coli to do this?

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.106
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
do splicing.

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:07.010
ERIC LANDER: It doesn't
do splicing.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.070
And in fact, if you told me
we'll use yeast instead, it

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.390
turns out yeast does a very
bad job in splicing human

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.220
introns also.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.405
And E. coli doesn't recognize
human promoters.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.740
So this doesn't work
very well.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.480
Any takers on what we're
going to do about this?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.630
How do we fix this problem?

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.350
ERIC LANDER: Ah.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.420
So one solution would be teach
E. coli how to splice DNA.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.030
That's hard.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.930
Start with cDNA.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.870
That's nice.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:49.300
So let's take our messenger
RNA, mRNA, and let's now

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.920
convert it into cDNA.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.170
What is cDNA?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.920
cDNA remember, we can
copy RNA into DNA.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.340
What enzyme copies
RNA into DNA?

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.090
We learned about it
when we studied

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.390
replication and all that.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.510
AUDIENCE: Reverse
transcriptase.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.750
ERIC LANDER: Reverse
transcriptase.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.550
So if I can get my hands on some
reverse transcriptase, I

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.410
would be able to add reverse
transcriptase to mRNAs from a

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.240
human cell and make cDNA.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.600
And where do I get reversed
transcriptase?

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.980
It's in the catalog.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.880
So I now make cDNA and
instead, I put

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.000
the cDNA in the vector.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.380
I do this, of course,
for many, many,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.600
many different RNAs.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.900
I take total RNA from the human
cell, I convert all the

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.780
total RNA all at once into
different cDNAs.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.720
Those different cDNAs get put
into the vector, and I now

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.680
have what's called
a cDNA library.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.760
So now I have a cDNA library.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.300
And now each of these guys has
not a piece of human genomic

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.110
DNA, but a piece of human cDNA
copied back from a message.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.430
One of those guys
has beta globin.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.240
Now will E. coli produce
beta globin?

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.280
No.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.160
Because

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.946
AUDIENCE: Promoter.

00:11:17.946 --> 00:11:18.940
ERIC LANDER: Promoter.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.000
It doesn't have a promoter
that it recognizes.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.945
What are we going to do
we do about that?

00:11:22.945 --> 00:11:24.590
AUDIENCE: Add one
in the vector.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.540
ERIC LANDER: Add one
in the vector.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.045
Give it a promoter
in the vector.

00:11:27.045 --> 00:11:27.190
Good.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.130
You guys are getting into
the engineering of this.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.755
Let's say that the vector
has an E. coli promoter.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.470
Now, each of these cells will
actually make that mRNA.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.740
That mRNA is spliced,
and it will, in

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.160
fact, produce an mRNA.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.570
The cell will translate it if
we do this right, and is the

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.810
genetic code the same
in E. coli in human?

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.260
Yup.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.030
So we can actually make, you
could make beta globin.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.070
Now, we wash over our antibody,
it recognizes which

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.800
cell is making beta globin,
and it sticks.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.110
There's beta globin.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.466
It works.

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:20.140
Oh, by the way, what have we
also just invented here?

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.430
We've invented a bacterial cell
that's able to produce a

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.050
human protein.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.790
What if instead of beta
globin, we put in

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.790
the gene for insulin?

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.040
What would we have invented?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.370
A way to produce insulin without
having to purify it

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.800
from the pancreases of animals,
which is how we used

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.590
to have to treat juvenile
diabetics.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:53.130
But instead, if we put the
insulin gene in, and we have

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.000
an E. coli promoter, let's
say, in theory,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.590
we can make us insulin.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.050
And what would we
have invented?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.570
The biotechnology industry.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.110
That's basically the start to
the biotechnology industry.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.790
One of the first things that
was done was cloning the

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.330
insulin gene to make
recombinantly-produced insulin

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.040
by just the method you
guys invented today.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.330
It's just unfortunately others
invented them first, so you

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.930
don't get a patent on it or
anything, but all right.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:26.590
So now we got two ways to clone
genes so far, and there

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.950
are a lot of ways
to clone genes.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.770
I've given you two, later
in the course,

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:31.020
I'll give you a third.
