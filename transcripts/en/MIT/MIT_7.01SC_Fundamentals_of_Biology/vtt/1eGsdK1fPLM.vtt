00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.160
HAZEL SIVE: Another truism of
biochemistry is that many of

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.870
the molecules within cells
are very large.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.940
And they're called

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.700
macromolecules, to indicate this.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.950
So macromolecules.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.680
So these are often --

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.540
Biological molecules are
often macromolecules.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.225
And these macromolecules
are often polymers--

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.600
not always--

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.830
where a polymer is some
kind of repeat of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.435
a monomer "n" times.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.030
And in formation of
macromolecules, there are two

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.970
kinds of reactions that
you need to know.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.820
They are called condensation
and hydrolysis reactions.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.240
And they go something
like this.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.395
Condensation reactions
form bonds.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.230
Hydrolysis reactions
break bonds.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.050
And condensation reactions
go something like this.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.120
If we call the monomer M, there
would be a monomer with

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.730
a hydroxyl group that interacts
with another monomer

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.950
that has a hydroxyl group.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:12.130
And the outcome of that would
be a bond between the two

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.390
monomers, with the
release of water.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.450
And the flip of that, during
a hydrolysis reaction, is

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.340
exactly the opposite, where this
dimonomer here, M-O-M,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.030
where there's an ether bond
between the two monomers as

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.550
I've drawn it, called different
things-- we'll talk

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.550
about that--

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.050
adds water and then is broken
down into two monomers.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.220
And so you should know a
condensation and a hydrolysis

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.900
reaction, because every reaction
that we talk about in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.780
this course and in much of
biochemistry involves either

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.800
condensation or hydrolysis
reactions.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.540
Often, both condensation or
hydrolysis require energy,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.290
sometimes that they
release it.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:17.145
So often, both often require
energy in order to proceed.

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.395
Okay.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.410
Very good.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.900
Let's move then to the second
topic that I'd like to discuss

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.030
today, which is the
first big class of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.500
macromolecules, the lipids.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.020
Lipids are a fascinating
class of macromolecules

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.790
essential for life.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:06.780
They comprise about 5% of the
dry mass of a cell, the dry

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.530
mass referring to the mass
remaining after the water has

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.070
been removed.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.700
And lipids are crucial--

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.290
and we discussed this briefly
last lecture--

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.079
for formation of the membranes
around the cell and around the

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.080
various organelles.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.640
So lipids are required
for membranes.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.780
They also serve as major energy
stores for the cells.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.280
Their bonds are very
energy rich.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.080
They are also involved in
various signaling processes.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.280
We'll touch on this today
and later in the course.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.710
And of course, they are involved
in insulation, both

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.590
in keeping the whole organism
warm-- if it's an animal,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.780
during winter--

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.560
but also in insulating nerve
cells as nerve cells transmit

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.900
their signals by insulating
them, kind of like an

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.970
electrical wire is insulated
by plastic.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.210
The condensation reactions
that form during lipid

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.600
formation often involve
synthesis of things called

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.810
triglycerides.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.580
And triglycerides are formed
from glycerol.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.540
And I'm going to warn you that
my chemical structures are

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.580
going to be casual.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.090
We assume that you have enough
chemistry that if you know

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.700
that I write CH2OH, you
actually know that the

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.320
hydrogens are sticking out
around the carbon.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.470
Okay?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.460
That's my contract with you.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.770
We assume you know enough
chemistry to deal with that.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.440
If you don't, then please come
and see me or Dr. Sinha.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.710
And to that glycerol is
added a fatty acid.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:16.050
And the fatty acid has got a
hydroxyl group attached to a

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:24.490
carbonyl, which is attached to
a long-chain hydrocarbon,

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.440
where n is 16 to 20.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.770
And this guy here is called
a fatty acid.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.200
And out of the addition of
glycerol and the fatty acid--

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.670
I'm going to put a line between
the two so that you

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.920
can see the difference--

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.340
comes something called
a triglyceride.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.200
And I'm going to draw this for
just one of the glycerol

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.480
carbon atoms.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.840
And then the same thing is
true for all the others.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.320
So you'll have CH2 at
the end, and then a

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.740
condensation reaction.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.950
And we're going to write et
cetera here, being casual

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.140
about this.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.530
And out of this comes
this triglyceride.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:49.130
This reaction is a condensation
reaction.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.380
It eliminates water.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.220
It's a condensation reaction.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:10.160
And it's also a
transesterification, where you

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.300
can see the ester bond formed
in the triglyceride.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm going to notate
triglycerides in a slightly

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.110
different way.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.170
I'll show you this
in a moment.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.260
But let's take a look at a
picture here so you can see

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.250
what it actually looks like.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.100
Here's glycerol,
from your book.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.799
And here is a fatty acid.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:41.580
And here are the reactive
species interacting to give

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.760
you a condensation reaction and
joining up the glycerol to

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.580
the fatty acid.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.290
And the glycerol then serves
as a backbone to have these

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.470
three chains of fatty acid.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.690
Hence the name triglycerides.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.490
Lipids are not, strictly
speaking, polymers.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.440
And so what I said about
macromolecules being polymers

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.860
really doesn't hold
for lipids.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.890
But the other principles do.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.400
One of the things about lipids
is that they can be modified.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.720
And they can be modified by
replacing one of the fatty

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.540
acid chains with something
that is polar.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.340
So if you look at this
triglyceride, you can see at a

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.260
glance that it is really
hydrogens and carbons.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.510
It's very non-polar.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.680
There's a couple of
oxygens up here.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.840
But there are so few relative
to the molecule that really

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.950
this is a very non-polar
molecule.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.500
But you can change the
properties of lipids in an

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.410
extraordinary way by replacing
one of the fatty acid chains

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.860
with something polar.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.415
And that is particularly
done in phospholipids.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.110
And we're going to now draw a
triglyceride in a different

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:17.690
way, in shorthand, where the
glycerol is going to have a

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:24.190
horizontal bar and the fatty
acid chains are going to

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.070
emanate as vertical lines.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:33.380
The triglyceride, your classic
one, is hydrophobic because it

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.630
is non-polar.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.820
But you can also take one of
those side chains, or one of

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.290
those fatty acid chains,
and replace it

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.040
with a phosphate group.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:11:02.500
So you can replace one fatty
acid with a phosphate, which

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.070
is highly charged.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:14.960
And then you get something like
this, where the blob is

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.070
the phosphate group.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.030
Phospholipids are the things
which make cell membranes.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:26.300
And they make cell membranes
because they are on one end

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.420
polar, and on the other
end they're non-polar.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:35.040
And so here on the top end,
they are polar and

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.540
hydrophilic.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:41.340
And then the bottom
part is non-polar.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:51.820
And this causes them to
self-associate so that the

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.670
polar groups face water
and the non-polar

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.410
groups face one another.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:01.230
And these will spontaneously
form a lipid bilayer, the

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.070
thing that surrounds all of
the cell and all of the

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.270
organelles.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:11.610
So they will go and
spontaneously associate into a

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:37.130
bilayered membrane, which we can
draw like this, using our

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.350
shorthand notation.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.380
And what I've done is to now
put the hydrophobic or the

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.465
non-polar bits facing
one another.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:59.240
And these polar bits are now
interacting with water.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.490
So these are hydrophilic--

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.100
which I'm going to hyphenate.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.810
And they are indeed interacting
with water.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.630
Let's look at some pictures
to exemplify this.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.830
Here is the chemical structure
of a phospholipid.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.790
They're the long-chain
fatty acids.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.290
And here's the phosphate
group.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.570
This is actually a modified
phosphate group.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.380
It's got a choline moiety,
which makes

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.600
it even more polar.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.200
And here you go with this
little bit sticking out.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.890
So you can see the shape of
the molecule has changed.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.100
And also its electronegativity
has changed.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.900
And here are these molecules
that spontaneously form this

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.220
lipid bilayer, the phospholipid
membrane, with

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.780
all the hydrophilic parts
sticking out and touching

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.480
water on either side and the
hydrophobic parts interacting

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.470
with one another.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.950
I want to really make
a point that this is

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.720
not a double membrane.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.890
This is a single membrane.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.900
We talked last time about
mitochondria and the nucleus

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.170
having double membranes
around them.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.060
That would be two of these.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.000
This thing that we've got up
here is a single membrane.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.710
This is what all cell membranes
and organelle

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.530
membranes look like.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.005
That's an important
thing to realize.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:23.486
The last thing I want
to mention --

00:14:23.486 --> 00:14:25.150
Actually, the last thing
I want to mention about

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.230
triglycerides is that there
are a couple of different

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.470
kinds of triglyceride
chains which are

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.540
very important medically.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.720
And you've heard of them.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:45.850
There are saturated fats, where
the triglyceride chains

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:51.910
have got all single
carbon atoms.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:56.280
And all of these completely
saturated--

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.220
in other words, there
are no double bonds.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.000
Triglycerides with these
types of chains

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.265
tend to pack tightly.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.750
And this gives them the property
of chemical stability

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.525
and confers on them a
high melting point.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.830
So saturated fats
are often solid.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.840
And this is bad.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.980
These are bad for you.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.070
In contrast, unsaturated fats
are sometimes good for you and

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:42.600
sometimes not.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:53.020
So unsaturated fats all
have, somewhere, a

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.880
carbon double bond.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.150
There are two kinds of
unsaturated fats.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:05.520
There are cis-unsaturated
fats, where--

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:14.150
let's just put in some
extra bonds here--

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:20.160
where the other bonds that are
available to the carbons are

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.800
on the same side of
the molecule.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.980
And you remember that there's
no free rotation around a

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.100
double bond.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:32.720
So if that molecule looks like
that, it is stuck that way.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.670
If it synthesized that way,
it's stuck that way.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:46.420
On the other hand, there are
trans-unsaturated fats, where

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.050
the additional valencies of
carbon are on opposite sides

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.850
of the molecule.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:52.960
Cis fats--

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.050
I'll show you a slide
in a moment--

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.550
so these have got
double bonds.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:08.680
The cis fats pack poorly because
they are kinked.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.144
And these have got a
low melting point.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:16.369
And these are good for you.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:24.150
The trans-fats, however, are
much more like the saturated

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:30.155
fats, and they pack tightly, et
cetera, high melting point.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.170
And they are particularly
bad for you.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.900
Trans-fats are very seldom
found in nature.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:49.060
They are found in Twinkies
and other gourmet treats.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.250
All right, let's look
at some structures

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.230
here from your book.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.380
Saturated fats, you can see the
chains are all straight,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.430
and they pack very tightly.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.810
Cis-unsaturated fats, here's a
bend in the chain, and this

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.470
makes the molecules
pack loosely.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.970
This is a steric, a spatial,
consideration.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.930
And then if you look at
trans and cis fats,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.000
here's oleic acid.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.120
It's the same carbon chain.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.690
But trans-oleic acid has
a straight chain,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.770
cis-oleic has a bend.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.080
They're both unsaturated fats.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:31.510
And the question that I am sure
you have seen is whether

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.270
or not trans fat should be
removed from all food, and how

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.300
that can be done, and why
it is bad for you.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.850
And now it's required that there
are ingredients posted

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.290
on various food so that you
know what you're eating.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.200
And I'm going to tell you a
little bit about why trans fat

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.410
is bad for you.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.640
But I have to introduce to you
another lipid and another

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.880
class of lipids in
order to do so.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.040
And that's not the only reason
that I'm going to introduce

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.430
this other class of lipids.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:05.360
I'm going to do it because it's
a very important class.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.150
So a second class of lipids that
we should consider beyond

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.643
the triglycerides are
the steroids.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:26.070
Steroids share a common
ring structure.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.910
They are lipids with a common
ring structure.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:44.410
And I have the slide up so you
can look at it even now.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.820
Their precursor is
cholesterol.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:58.420
And cholesterol is,
in fact, not bad.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.140
It is an essential lipid.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.000
And it's essential both for
formation of the membrane, and

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.060
all membranes, and it is also
crucial for signaling.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.580
And if an organism develops
without cholesterol, it

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.650
develops with one eye.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.060
You lack the whole midline that
divides you into two more

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.610
or less bilaterally
symmetric parts.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:33.140
So cholesterol is a very
essential component.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:38.570
Other things that come from
lipids are vitamin D, much in

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.450
the news also with regard to
preventing inflammation, and

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.700
various hormones.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.480
Their structure's on the
board -- on the screen.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.640
And you can see, in green, the
common ring structure with

00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:01.610
various other groups attached,
which give these different

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.660
steroidal lipids their
particular structures.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.850
And we'll come back to the
notion of cholesterol and why

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:12.360
it's both essential but--
let me annotate here--

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.340
too much is bad.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.590
All right.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.570
In the news a lot are steroids
androgens, a particular class

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.560
of artificial androgens
are normal steroids.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.200
But there is a class of
artificial steroids.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.930
Here's one,
tetrahydrogestrinone, which is

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.490
used by athletes.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:42.290
It is mostly undetectable.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.700
The tests for anabolic steroids
used by athletes are

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.340
actually very high tech.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.830
And this one is very difficult
to detect.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.560
And it makes the question of
whether particular athletes

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.610
have used steroids rather
difficult to answer

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.860
unequivocally.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:02.736
Too much cholesterol --

00:22:02.736 --> 00:22:03.850
I should be using the screen.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.000
Too much cholesterol leads
to a condition called

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.450
atherosclerosis, where
cholesterol is deposited in

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.850
the arteries.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:12.900
Here it is.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.100
And this literally physically
blocks up the artery, causes

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.580
the blood to clot, and leads
to heart attacks.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.500
And here's an artery
that's OK--

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.340
well, actually it's
not quite, there.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.490
You can see it's being injected
with contrast, and

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.060
there's a little place
where it's not OK.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.400
And here's one which is
completely occluded by an

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.090
atherosclerotic plaque.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.990
What's the deal with
cholesterol?

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.960
Cholesterol is used for
membranes and signalling.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.360
But it also is carried through
the body by a component called

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.370
low-density lipoprotein.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.910
And this low-density
lipoprotein, or LDL, is

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.430
deposited in the arteries, where
it plugs them and leads

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.550
to heart attack.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.510
If cholesterol binds
high-density lipoproteins, a

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.970
different kind of a transport
molecule, then the excess

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.400
cholesterol is excreted by the
liver, and you're good.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.760
You're well.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.870
Turns out, through complicated
reasons, that trans fat and

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.960
saturated fat increases the
levels of this bad,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.500
low-density lipoprotein
and thereby

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.140
increases heart attacks.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.750
I should note that most
cholesterol is made by you.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.990
80% of your cholesterol
is made by you.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.740
20% you get from food.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.780
So eating a low cholesterol diet
usually doesn't do much

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.150
for cholesterol levels.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:35.170
You actually have to interfere
with synthesis, which is what

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.080
the various drugs called
statins do.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.390
All right.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.840
So enough about lipids.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:48.210
Let us move to our third topic
today, another fascinating and

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:52.690
important set of macromolecules,
the

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:53.940
carbohydrates.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.380
Carbohydrates make up
about 25% of the dry

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.940
mass of a cell .

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:14.370
They're used as an energy
source, as a carbon source to

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.620
build other molecules.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.600
And they also encode
information, as in your blood

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.256
type, which I will try to touch
on in a few moments.

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:33.270
Their chemical formula is much
simpler and is polymeric,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.520
unlike the lipids.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:45.670
(CH2O)n, or if you like, more
informatively, (H-C-OH)n.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.240
And because of the hydroxyl
group, carbohydrates are

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.995
pretty much always
hydrophilic.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.760
The monomer of carbohydrates
is called a monosaccharide.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.460
And there can be polymers
that are two

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.330
monomers or multiple monomers.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.370
So the monomer--

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.580
and you should know this--

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.300
is called a monosaccharide,
where

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.590
saccharide sounds like saccharin.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.840
That means sugar.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.850
And there can be dimers, which
would be a small polymer,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.800
which would be a disaccharide.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.860
And then you can also get long
sugars, which would be

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.110
polysaccharides.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.390
A monosaccharide, for example,
would be glucose.

00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:51.640
A disaccharide, sucrose.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:26:00.340
And a polysaccharide, glycogen
in animals or

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.355
cellulose in plants.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.210
All right.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.520
Let's look at the condensation
reaction that is responsible

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.390
for making carbohydrates.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.580
It's a simple condensation
reaction, at

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.540
least on the board.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.090
It requires careful
orchestration by the cell, but

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.920
on the board it's
easy to draw.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:35.506
One carbohydrate plus another
carbohydrate--

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.920
I'm not going to put all the
side groups on, but you

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:46.900
understand there are other side
groups here or another

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.530
carbon there, giving rise to--

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.780
with the release of water.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.650
So here is a condensation
reaction.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:10.770
And this bond that forms
in carbohydrates--

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.140
I'm actually going to add the
next carbons on here, instead

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:20.100
of X. I apologize for erasing
here, but let's put some

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.710
carbons here rather than X
because that will be clearer.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:29.340
But the bond between two
monomers is called a

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.910
glycosidic bond.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.810
And that designates that it
is found in carbohydrates.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.260
Carbohydrates can isomerize.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:53.800
That means the same chemical
formula can change its shape,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:02.620
can change the organization of
its atoms, and can isomerize

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.015
between the ring and
a linear structure.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:13.910
And carbohydrates can
also be modified.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.680
They remain hydrophilic in
general, but there are many

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:23.570
modifications which are rather
crucial to their function.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:28.710
They can get, for example,
phosphate

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:33.930
groups or amino groups.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.480
And this will change their
particular properties.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.600
Let's look at some slides.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.220
And then I want to tell you
about a very fascinating and

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.070
important example of
carbohydrates as an

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.500
information source.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.840
So here's glucose as straight
chain and glucose as a ring.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.880
If you're not familiar with
looking at chemical

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.740
structures--

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.930
I keep forgetting that
is my usual board.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.210
But let's look at this one
because it's brighter.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.280
If you're not familiar with
looking at chemical

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.350
structures, if you see these
dark areas in a molecule, it

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.150
means that the molecule is
coming out of the board

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:18.900
towards you.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.750
So it gives a bit of

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.035
three-dimensionality to that molecule.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.480
And here are the condensation
reactions involved in the

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.090
formation of maltose, which
is a glucose disaccharide.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.800
And here is the glycosidic
linkage.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.060
The atoms in carbohydrates
get particular numbers.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.410
It is the carbon atoms that
get particular numbers.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.270
And next lecture, that is going
to become very important

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.410
when we talk about
nucleic acids.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.030
And here is sucrose, a dimer
of glucose and fructose.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:01.610
Now, depending on the
orientation of these bonds

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.610
between the saccharides, between
the monomers, they may

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:11.620
or may not be able to be broken
by the enzymes, by the

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.030
chemicals in your body
that are involved

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.810
in hydrolysis reactions.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.550
So sucroses can be broken down
pretty much by everyone.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.350
But lactose, which is the
galactose-glucose dimer has

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:29.100
got a glycosidic bond which
has a particular shape.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.150
And that particular shape is
only recognized by people who

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.890
have a molecule called
lactase--

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.160
we'll talk about this in
a couple of lectures--

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.820
which is able to break this
chemical bond here.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.440
And if you're lactose
intolerant, the reason you get

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.400
stomach ache and so on is
because you get accumulation

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.260
of this disaccharide, and it
has side effects on your

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.475
digestive system.

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:52.600
All right.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.930
So I want to tell you now about
a really fascinating

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:05.670
example of information as
encoded by carbohydrates.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.780
We will have much more
to say about

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.860
carbohydrates as we go along.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.510
But I'm going to tell you
about information--

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.510
particularly here, because
we won't talk about

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.600
it very much more.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.150
One example of carbohydrates
giving information is in your

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.670
blood type.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:28.130
So for blood type, there
are specific

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:36.580
carbohydrates for each.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:50.270
But there is the same core set
of molecules, which is then

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:58.510
modified to give you the
different blood groups, to

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.780
four blood groups.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.490
This is a representation of
the four blood groups.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.610
They are called O,
A, B, and AB.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.890
And you probably know
which one you are.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.890
I am A.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.850
One of those blood groups
is really valuable.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.320
It's called O. And it's valuable
because anyone could

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.910
receive this blood
in a transfusion.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:34.830
And anyone can because it's kind
of your basic blood type.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:39.190
It contains an H group, which is
the basic sugar information

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.680
on blood cells.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.800
And all of the other blood
groups also contains this

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.060
basic information, but they
contain other sugars as well,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.890
here indicated by purple.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.730
The key to these different
sugars is indicated below.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:00.540
But O can be given to any kind
of person because you do not

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.520
have antibodies against this
particular H group.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.090
Because everyone's got it.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.440
So O is the only blood group
where, when you put it into

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.740
anyone, there are
not antibodies--

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.690
which you'll learn about
later in the course--

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.830
that will then attack the blood
cells and cause massive

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.300
blood clots and deaths.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:32.540
When people donate blood, 3/4 of
it is not O. After a time,

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.690
blood is thrown away from blood
banks because it's not

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.540
usable forever.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.430
And a lot of this type, A, B and
AB blood, is thrown away.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.020
And so investigators have been
asking for a long time whether

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.270
they couldn't remove these extra
sugars from AB, B, and

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:53.190
A, and turn those bloods into
type O, which would then be

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.955
useful for everyone.

00:33:54.955 --> 00:33:58.100
It turns out that's kind
of difficult to do.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.080
But a few years ago, a group
did come up with

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.980
what may be a solution.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.970
It still hasn't been proved,
even though this

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:05.810
was a few years ago.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.430
It takes a long time.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.889
Here's a different
representation of the sugars

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.389
on blood types.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:15.710
Here's group A and group B.
And there are enzymes--

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.159
there you see, office hours.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:17.770
I'm not kidding.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.679
It's on my calendar.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.340
All right.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.699
There are substances, enzymes,
we'll talk about which can

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:30.080
actually remove some of these
sugars off groups A and B and

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.949
convert them into group O.
These substances, these

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.469
enzymes, were isolated
by Liu et al.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.030
When you see this
at the bottom--

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:39.400
Here's a piece of education.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.239
Often I will show you something,
and in the bottom

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:45.590
right-hand corner it will say
"Liu et al" or "Jones et al"

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.520
and a date.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.800
That refers to a publication.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.880
This group was able to convert
group type A and type B into a

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.900
type O. And they are now working
on a machine which can

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.600
convert type A, AB, and
B blood into type O.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.850
And we'll stop there.
