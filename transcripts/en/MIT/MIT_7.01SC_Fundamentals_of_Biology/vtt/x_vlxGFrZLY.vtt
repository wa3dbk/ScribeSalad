00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.900
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.180
In this clip, we're going to go
through problem two of the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.670
transcription and translation
unit.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.390
We're also going to review all
of the information you would

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.710
need to fill out problem
one, the table.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.280
If you haven't tried these
problems yet on your own,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.780
please pause the video now and
try them, and then come back

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.275
and watch this explanation.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.840
OK.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.740
So here we have, as in problem
two, the double stranded DNA.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.050
Now, this is a piece of the
eukaryotic genome, and so this

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
DNA is in the nucleus
of the cell.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.080
Now what we're going to do is
we're going to go through

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.970
transcription and translation
with this gene.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.600
So the first thing we need to
do is we need to figure out

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.860
where we want to start
transcription and in what

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.780
direction we want to go and what
strand we want to use as

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.900
our template.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.990
So in the problem, we're given
our promoter region and we're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.120
given that our transcription
starts right here at this

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.100
arrow and moves in
this direction.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.660
So we know where we're starting
and what direction

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.000
we're moving in.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.280
All transcription will proceed
reading a template in the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.220
three prime to five prime
direction and will polymerize

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.640
the RNA made in the five prime
to three prime direction.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.600
So what we need to do now is
figure out what strand is

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.430
going in the three prime to five
prime direction and the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.170
direction that we're going
to be transcribed.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.080
So that means that this strand,
which is going from

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.520
three prime over here down to
five prime at the end, this is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090
going to be our template
strand.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.790
So our template strand is going
to be at the bottom.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.740
OK.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.900
So when our RNA polymerase
starts, it's going to be

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.350
reading this template strand
and adding nucleic acid,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:17.330
adding nucleotide triphosphates,
or NTPs, one by

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.360
one together to make the RNA.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.290
Now it's going to add these
together by adding a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.400
phosphodiester bond in between
all of the monomers.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.190
So we're going to start
our transcription.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.900
And basically, what I need
to do is just use the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.190
complimentary base pair
to my template strand.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.830
So I'm going to write
it out here.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.070
So I've done a lot of
transcription here.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.640
Now where am I going to
stop my transcription?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.140
I'm not going to stop
just randomly in

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.400
the middle of nowhere.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.130
What my RNA polymerase is going
to do is it's going to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.240
stop when it gets to the end of
this terminator sequence.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.340
So I'm going to keep
transcribing until I get to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.630
the end of my terminator here.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.250
OK.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.340
So this is my RNA strand.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.290
And as I said before, we're
going to polymerize this mRNA

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.636
in the five prime to three
prime direction.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.170
OK, we've got our mRNA.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.710
Since this is a eukaryotic cell
and the mRNA right now is

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.830
in the nucleus, what we need to
do is transport it out of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.470
the nucleus and into the
cytoplasm where it will be

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.970
translated by a ribosome.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.190
Now what the ribosome is going
to do is it's going to take

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.710
this mRNA, which is a message
that encodes the sequence of

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.840
amino acids that we need to
put together to make the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.460
protein, and we're going to take
this message and we're

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.360
going to find a place to
start translation.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.500
So what the ribosome is going
to do is it's going to start

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.370
at the five prime end of the
template and read towards the

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.480
three prime end of
the template.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.690
It's going to read until it
gets to a start codon.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.980
The start codon is AUG.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.000
So this is where we're going
to start, and AUG encodes

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.250
methionine.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.500
We're then going to read in
three base pair codons down

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.200
from the five prime end of our
template to the three prime

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.450
end of our template.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.760
And so we're going to keep
going in this translation

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.350
until we reach what's
called a stop codon.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.350
Now there are three
stop codons.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:43.730
Stop codons are UAA,
UGA, and UAG.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.720
So if when my ribosome finds any
of these three codons in

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.260
frame, it's going to stop.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.510
So I get all the way down here
before I hit a stop codon on

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.400
this transcript.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.310
So what my ribosome is going
to be doing as it's reading

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.380
these codons is it's going to
insert amino acid by amino

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.620
acid, pairing them together
with a peptide bond.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:22.130
So we've got methionine bonded
to histidine, tyrosine,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:30.250
leucine, and so on
and so forth.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.630
OK, so this is the protein chain
that's encoded by this

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.760
gene in the DNA.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.120
And in proteins, we always
synthesize from the N terminus

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.485
to the C terminus.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.670
OK, so we've gone through both
transcription and translation.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.540
Now what we want to do is we
want to take into account what

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.650
would happen if we had a
mutation in our sequence.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.990
So in this case, in this
problem, we're going to insert

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.820
a base pair right here.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.160
So we're going to insert
an extra T here

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.050
and an extra A here.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.340
Now, if this is happening in
the DNA, when our DNA is

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.130
transcribed to make our
RNA, what's going to

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.610
happen to the RNA?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.810
Well, we're going to also add
the corresponding base into

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.230
our RNA, so we're going to
have an extra U here.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.950
So in addition to only adding
one nucleotide in our RNA,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.980
this is also going to throw
off our frame that we're

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:56.320
reading when our ribosome
is reading our RNA.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.310
So instead of the frame that we
had previously, we're now

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.920
going to have a new frame.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.680
So it's going to start at the
same start codon and then read

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:15.350
this codon just as normal, but
then this U will make UUA and

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.820
then will read in codons
of three from there.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:28.250
So again, I need to translate
until I hit a stop codon.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.890
And so the stop codon is going
to be different in this case,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.500
because this stop codon
is no longer in frame.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.280
I need to find an in
frame stop codon.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.980
And the first stop codon that I
hit is going to be this you

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.299
UAG right here.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:51.010
And so our new protein sequence
is now going to be N

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:57.540
terminus, and then the beginning
is going to be very

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:03.240
similar, and then our amino
acids are going to be

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.280
completely different because
we're reading this in a

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.530
different frame.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.280
OK, so we can see how this one
mutation, addition of one base

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.610
pair into our DNA, has caused
us to create a completely

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.780
different peptide.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.400
It's probably not going to
perform the same function.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.060
OK.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.930
So we've gone over transcription
and translation.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.380
You should be able at this
point to answer all of

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.070
question two and you should
also be able to fill in

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.050
all of table one.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.300
Thank you for watching.
