PROFESSOR ROBERT DORKIN:Hi, and
welcome to a help session

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.850
on recombinant DNA.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.250
Today we will be talking about
the polymerase chain reaction

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.730
as well as DNA sequencing.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.170
The polymerase chain reaction,
also known as

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.910
PCR, has many uses.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.340
One of the most common
uses is to amplify a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.180
desired section of DNA.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.530
What you need for the reaction
is your DNA sequence of

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.160
interest, DNA polymerase, DNA
primers, and then four

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.410
different nucleotides.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.700
You combine all these together,
and the first thing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.950
that you do is you heat
the reaction up.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.670
What this does is that by adding
heat to the system, you

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.410
break the hydrogen bonds
between the two

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.900
different DNA strands.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.070
This results in two separate
DNA sequences.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.430
Now what happens is that you
allow the system to cool.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.030
As it cools, the DNA primers are
able to hybridize to this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.400
separate strands.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.640
Now as you remember from
lecture, when you're

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.030
synthesizing DNA, you synthesize
from the five prime

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.610
to three prime direction.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.550
This means that the primers you
design have to match the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.480
three prime end of your
sequences of interest.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.140
So for example, if we were
designing primers for these

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:43.400
two sequences, one of them would
be GGTA and the other

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.060
one would be AGCT.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.460
Now, I've written four here.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.440
In actuality, these primers are
generally longer, around

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.070
16 or so, 16 to 27.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.300
However, they can be a whole
different variety of lengths

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.790
dependent on numerous
different factors.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.510
The next thing that happens is
that the DNA polymerase is

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.570
going to bind to the DNA
sequence with the primer.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.830
Once the DNA polymerase is
bound, it's going to take some

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.800
of the free nucleotides in the
surrounding area and slowly

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.800
add them to finish
up the strand.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.140
And so on and so forth.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.990
Once it's completed, we are
going to have now doubled our

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.040
original DNA sequence.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.970
We're going to have two strands
that are identical to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.020
the first one.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.580
As you can see, by repeating
the steps, heating it,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.160
allowing it to cool, allowing
more primers to bond, and then

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.050
allowing the DNA polymerase to
elongate, we can double the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.150
number of sequences
every round.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.690
And you can rapidly
get a large amount

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.580
of the desired sequence.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.950
PCR has other uses though
besides simply increasing the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.080
total amount of DNA
that you have.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.320
One of the uses of PCR
is to sequence DNA.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:26.350
Now, if we look over here,
normally DNA is form of

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.920
deoxyribonucleic acids.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.700
You have the phosphate group
on the five prime end.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.325
You have a hydroxyl group
on the three prime end.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.590
This hydroxyl group
is very important.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.060
That's because when a new
nucleotide is added, this

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.390
hydroxyl group undergoes a
covalent bond with the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.390
phosphate on the new nucleotide
and then adds a new

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.370
nucleotide that way.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.010
So you can see you're adding
the five prime

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.200
the three prime direction.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.770
However, it is possible
to create a

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.220
dideoxyribonucleic acid.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.980
The dideoxyribonucleic acid,
instead of having a three

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.570
prime hydroxyl group, has
a three prime hydrogen.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.410
This three prime hydrogen is no
longer capable of forming a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.000
covalent bond with
a phosphate.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.170
That means as soon as the
dideoxyribonucleic acid is

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.820
added to DNA, no further
nucleotides can be added in

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.010
the series.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.670
Let's go back to our example
with the primers.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.960
What does that mean for here?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.250
Well, let's say you have a
normal PCR reaction, but in

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.070
addition to the four
deoxyribonucleic acids you

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.490
have, you also take a little
bit of dideoxyribonucleic

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.310
acids of one of the types.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.400
So let's say we add
in some ddTTP.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.410
Now what happens is that your
DNA polymerase will go along

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.730
adding nucleotides as normal,
but if it ever adds a

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.660
dideoxyribonucleic acid, the
polymerase will stop.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.920
So if it adds, say
a normal T here--

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.605
continues down, continues
down.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.740
If it adds a dideoxyribonucleic
acid here,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.510
it's going to stop,
and we're going to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.360
get a truncated sequence.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.080
And so you can see that at any
position that we have an A,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.040
it's going to be possible to
have a truncated sequence of

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.810
that length.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.280
What this means that we're now
going to, once the PCR is

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.360
complete, have different DNA
sequences of numerous

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.180
different lengths.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.980
But the one thing they're all
going to have in common is

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.350
that they're all going to end
with a T. So you can imagine

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.090
doing this now for each of the
four different letters.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.030
Then we can take them and
run them out of a gel.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.610
Let's go look at such
a gel over here.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.020
Here we have a gel.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.880
Each of these letters
represents which

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.530
dideoxyribonucleic acid was
used for that experiment.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.330
And then the PCR was
run out on the gel.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.400
As you remember, the strands
close to the bottom are the

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.310
shorter strands, and the strands
close to the top are

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.400
the longer strands.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.260
So if we look at this gel, we
know that the shortest strand

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:08.931
ends with a G. The next shortest
strand ends in a T.

00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.020
Oh, sorry, ends in
an A, excuse me.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:24.130
Then the next short strand ends
in a T, then two A's,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.410
then a G, then a C, then a T. So
as you can see, this is one

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.490
way to determine the
sequence of DNA.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.570
Another way has been devised,
which is even faster.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.000
Instead of running the sequences
all out in different

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.380
polymerase chain reactions, what
they do is they have some

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.840
of each of the
dideoxynucleotides together.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.820
But now, they fluorescently
label them, such that you have

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.640
a different fluorescent
label on each

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.290
dideoxyribonucleic acid.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.840
Now what happens is that
you can run it

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.870
out all on one column.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.110
And then by just looking at the
colors, you can determine

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.510
what the sequence is.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.976
So once again, the sequence
would be GATAAGCT.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.750
And so this way, you can more
efficiently, more rapidly,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.570
determine what the
DNA sequence is.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.410
This has been two examples of
polymerase chain reactions and

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.510
their uses.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.280
This has been another help
session on recombinant DNA.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.960
We hope you join us
again next time.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.210
Thank you.
