00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.710
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.900
In this clip we're going
to demonstrate the gene

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.460
regulation of the E.
coli lac operon.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.260
As you remember from the lecture
clips, the lac operon

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.120
is a collection of genes that
produces the lactose

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.990
metabolism machinery
when expressed.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.080
Now, when these are expressed,
E. coli is able

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.660
to metabolize lactose.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.070
However, it prefers to
metabolize glucose, to use

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.510
that as its sugar.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.710
Thus, when there's glucose
available to the cell, it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.480
pointless for it to create this
machinery, because it's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000
not going to actually use it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.780
It's going to metabolize
the glucose instead.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.310
But when we remove glucose and
add lactose, the E. coli

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.890
absolutely needs to be able to
metabolize this lactose,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.080
otherwise it's not going to
be able to grow with the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.280
available energy source.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.370
Thus, we have a couple of
different situations.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.650
When we have glucose present
but not lactose, we do not

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.950
want to express the
lac operon.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.690
However, when we remove glucose
and we add lactose, we

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.620
do want to express
the lac operon.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.250
Now we've covered when the E.
coli would like to express

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.300
this operon.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.600
However, how can it express this
operon only when it wants

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.610
to and not when it doesn't?

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.000
That's where the promoter
comes into play.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.350
The promoter is where RNA
polymerase binds.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.440
And RNA polymerase needs to bind
to this promoter in order

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.850
to transcribe and express
these genes.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.550
In this particular promoter,
we have a site where a

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.480
repressor can bind and a site
where an activator can bind.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.810
So I have a repressor and
I have an activator.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.920
So when the repressor is bound,
polymerase cannot bind

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.650
to the promoter.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.240
Polymerase also needs the
activator to be bound to the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.640
promoter in order to bind.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.910
So how can the E. coli regulate
when the repressor

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.710
and activator are bound
to the promoter?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.210
Well, when we have lactose in
the system, I have lactose

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.510
right here, the repressor
is able to bind lactose.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.830
The repressor only binds
to the promoter

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.240
when there is no lactose.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.130
And when binding to lactose,
the repressor comes undone

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.380
from the promoter.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.970
How does the cell tell whether
there's glucose

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.760
in the cell or not?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.210
When glucose is low in the
cell, the cell makes a

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.990
molecule called cyclic
AMP, or CAMP.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.160
I have a molecule of
CAMP right here.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.210
And so CAMP is the cell's way
of indicating that there is

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.700
low glucose in the cell.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.640
The activator needs
CAMP to bind to be

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.940
activator binding site.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.730
When CAMP is removed, or
glucose is added, the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.440
activator cannot bind to
the promoter anymore.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.240
Ok, so let's give it a try.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.010
In this first situation
we have glucose,

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.000
we don't have lactose.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.415
So I have neither my lactose
nor my CAMP in the system.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.390
Repressor, can you bind?

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.650
The Repressor is bound.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.140
Activator, can you bind?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.500
No, the activator
is not bound.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.180
The repressor is bound, and so
when RNA polymerase comes to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.490
the promoter, RNA polymerase
is not able to

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.930
bind at this promoter.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.140
And thus, it's not able to
express these genes.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.850
And so, as we can see here,
there is no expression.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.740
In this second situation,
we have no glucose

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.770
and we do have lactose.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.180
Since I'm removing glucose,
I am adding back CAMP.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.950
Activator, can you bind?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.730
Activator is now bound.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.145
And I'm also adding lactose
to the system.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.790
Repressor can't bind anymore.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.820
So what do I have at
my promoter now?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.480
RNA polymerase comes along
and finds only an

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.150
activator at the promoter.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.080
The polymerase can thus bind
to the promoter and move

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.770
downstream to transcribe and
express the lactose metabolism

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.270
machinery that we have here.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.400
So we have now covered how the
E. coli organism is able to

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.290
regulate the transcription
of the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.590
lactose metabolism machinery.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.710
This is only one example of many
genes and many organisms

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.050
that are regulated by mechanisms
such as this.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.320
Gene regulation is a very
widespread mechanism, in order

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.950
to keep a cell from producing
proteins that

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.820
are a waste to produce.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.070
Thank you for watching.
