00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.650
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.270
Come on down.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.700
All right.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:20.170
So last time, we talked about
the first couple of steps of

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.570
the central dogma.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:33.200
The central dogma is this name
given to the statement DNA

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.260
goes to DNA by replication.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.016
DNA goes to RNA by the process
of transcription.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.440
We call it transcription because
it's such a direct

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.020
copying of letter to letter.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.300
RNA goes to protein by a
process of translation,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.340
because translation is the
kind of word we would use

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.650
between two different
languages.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.850
And there are two different
languages--

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.890
the languages of nucleotides
and the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.880
language of amino acids.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.360
For what it's worth, it's name,
the central dogma, goes

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.980
back to Francis Crick, who
called this the central dogma.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.700
He did it in a kind of a
light-hearted way, although

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.510
others since then have
criticized it, saying, oh,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.190
this is dogmatic.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.740
Actually, Crick said not
that DNA goes to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.670
RNA goes to the protein.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.190
He says that all information
flows from nucleic acids to

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.330
proteins and not back again.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.750
Because even then, Crick knew
that in theory, there was no

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.740
reason you couldn't go back from
RNA to DNA, and as we'll

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410
see today, that happens.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.080
So sometimes people say, oh,
well, the central dogma was

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.480
proved wrong because RNA
can go back to DNA.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.730
Well, actually, that was even
anticipated right then at the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.645
very beginning, when they
realized RNA and DNA were

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:58.440
essentially equivalent
information.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.900
The key step of converting
nucleic acid information into

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.150
protein information
is translation.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.320
And that's the last bit
we have to fill in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.050
and talk about today.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.970
So let me start by just
reminding you-- because most

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.760
of you know it--

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.600
how translation works.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.320
So, in translation, you have a
particular RNA that has been

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.860
made by the cell.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.460
Here's my RNA.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.540
It goes five prime
to three prime.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.790
That's always the way we
write these things.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.210
And it has some particular
sequence.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.810
I'll make up a sequence here.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:52.110
A, U, A, C, G, A, U, G, A, A,
G, A, G, G, C, C, C, dot dot

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.270
dot dot dot, U, A, G, dot dot
dot dot, three prime.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.140
All right.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.920
Somehow, that's going to be
translated into a protein.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.310
It's translated according to a
fantastic look-up up table.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.750
This look-up table is called
the genetic code.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390
And the rule, the algorithm--

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.260
and it's a fairly simple
algorithm, well, nothing's

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.940
ever really simple in biology,
but it's close to simple--

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.740
is you run along the sequence
from the beginning.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.820
And you guys could write this.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.200
Anybody who's taken basic
computer programming.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.030
Run along the sequence and find
the first occurrence of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.410
A, U, G. Why A, U, G?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.460
Because A, U, G is the
place you start.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.680
That's how life worked it out,
and that's what it does.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.120
After that, you parse the
sequence in triplets.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.665
These triplets get
the name codons.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.410
And then you keep going
until you hit one of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.490
three possible triplets.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:16.560
U, A, G. U, A, A. U, G,
A. And you stop there.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.350
Any MIT student should be able
to write an algorithm that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.150
takes a string, finds the first
occurrence of U, A, G,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.000
breaks it up into triplets
passed there, keeps going

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.010
until you encounter one of
these three triplets.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.620
What do you do for
a given triplet?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.660
You look it up against
the table.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.610
How many triplets are there?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.550
How many three-letter words
are there with the four

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.128
nucleotides?

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:47.570
AUDIENCE: 64.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.390
PROFESSOR: It's 4 to the 3rd--

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.600
64 possible words.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.800
I've used up three of them to be
stop, so there are 4 to the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.360
3rd possible codons.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.920
That's 64.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.340
Three stops.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.790
The other 61 possible codons
specify an amino acid.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.890
That's it.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.300
There's a look-up table.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.670
The genetic code.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.430
How many amino acids
are there?

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.960
20.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.560
And there are 61 possible
codons, so that implies there

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.780
is some redundancy.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.000
Some codons--

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.564
some amino acids are coded
for by the same codon.

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:31.330
Okay.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.200
That's fine.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.300
And in your book is the genetic
code that is the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.920
look-up table here.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:52.070
The genetic code translates
these codons into amino acids.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.870
Or to stop, in the case of
the three stop signals.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.760
So for example, this A, U,
G at the front is always

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.200
translated into methionine.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.560
Met.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.630
And if I've got it right,
this should be a lysine.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.130
Here we go.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.830
Arginine, proline, et cetera--
you just look it up.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.580
That's it.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.290
That's the order in which
you make the proteins.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.310
So you send off an order written
in RNA, you send it

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.630
off to the factory, the factory
sends you back a

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.660
protein that is methionine,
lysine, arginine, proline,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.270
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.760
That's it.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.720
This genetic code is essentially
universal amongst

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.970
all of life.

00:06:42.183 --> 00:06:43.900
That's pretty stunning.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.150
What does that tell you?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.250
The fact that all of life uses
virtually the identical

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.100
genetic code?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.805
There's actually a tiny
difference between prokaryotes

00:06:51.805 --> 00:06:55.130
and eukaryotes affecting a
codon and there's a tiny

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.290
difference somewhere else.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.560
But essentially, it's the exact
same genetic code that

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.630
all of life uses.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.220
It's very unlikely that this
genetic code is the only

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.990
possible way you could make
a genetic code, right?

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.410
So the fact that all of life
uses, essentially, exactly the

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.450
same code is pretty strong
evidence that all currently

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.960
existing life descends from
a common ancestor.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.540
Because if these were evolved
independently, it's extremely

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.080
unlikely that you would have
gotten exactly the same

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.560
genetic code.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.880
So that's an interesting point
that you can see from just the

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.270
fact that everybody uses
essentially the

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.450
same genetic code.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.040
It's a universal genetic code.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.540
All right.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.160
So I've expressed this to you
in a completely computer

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.450
sciencey kind of way.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.960
But, of course, the cell doesn't
do this by computer

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.840
science because cells are
unable to write C code.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.520
The reason that cells are unable
to write C code is C

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.710
wasn't really developed until
the last several decades, and

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.020
cells, pretty sure, precede the
development of C code by

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.900
Kernighan and Ritchie.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.980
So it's got to be the case that
it's done some other way.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.620
How is it done?

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.880
Well, it's done like this.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.750
And I'll just be very
schematic and you'll

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.150
get it in your book.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:20.400
There's a big machine.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.230
The big machine here is
called the ribosome.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.860
It consists, itself, of proteins
and RNAs, and it's a

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.289
huge structure.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.230
The huge structure needs
to read codons.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.720
And this is a case where
Francis Crick

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.500
drove everybody nuts.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:53.230
Francis Crick, back in the
1950s, just sat at his desk

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.750
and thought.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.630
He was terrible at doing
experiments--

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.420
nobody really wanted to let
him do experiments.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.830
Francis was a great thinker.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.310
He thought.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.210
He said, golly, how can this
sequence be translated into

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.560
amino acids?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.880
Well, people at the time had
all sorts of nutty ideas.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.440
Some of the nutty ideas was that
the sequence of the RNA

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.840
folded up into pockets that
just fit a proline.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.710
And another pocket that
just an arginine.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.040
And if you just think about the
constraints to get that to

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.510
work, it's nuts.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.840
That the sequence itself would
form perfect binding pockets

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.110
for the necessary amino acids.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.360
Crick said impossible.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.350
He said the really sensible
way to do this, if I were

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.100
running life, what I
would do is I would

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.510
have an adapter molecule.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.340
The adapter molecule would be
some kind of a nucleic acid,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.960
and the nucleic acid would kind
of match the codon on one

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:52.020
end and have the amino acid
on the other end.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.410
And then there'd be another
adapter, and the adapter would

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.640
have the next amino acid.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.840
And then you would catalyze
a bond between them.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.360
Therefore, I predict, says
Francis, there will be small

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.420
adapter molecules, probably made
out of RNAs themselves.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.145
And Francis called this the
Adapter Hypothesis.

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:17.160
It drove people crazy because,
of course, he was right.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.590
People found the adapters and
they would use transfer things

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.360
that transfer information--

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.680
get called transfer RNAs.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.120
What happens is the ribosome
has pockets in which these

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.670
transfer RNAs basically come
in, match their sequence,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.050
there's a codon each of these
transfer RNAs has a matching

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.060
anticodon that matches the
triplet, and it has already

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.380
attached to it an amino acid--

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.640
the right amino acid
for that anticodon.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.340
How does that right amino
acid get attached

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.590
to the right tRNA?

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.030
There's an enzyme.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.740
The job of that enzyme is to
attach this amino acid,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.200
proline, to this transfer RNA.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.870
It's a Prolyl-tRNA synthetase.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.900
And its job is to put proline
on the right tRNAs.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.760
There's another one that puts
arginine on the right tRNAs.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.030
There's a whole business that's
set up to get the right

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.920
tRNAs, have the right amino
acids attached to them through

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.220
a bunch of enzymes
floating around.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.332
So then these tRNAs with the
amino acid attached drop in,

00:11:34.332 --> 00:11:37.910
they drop into the next
position, and a bond--

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.410
the peptide bond--
is catalyzed.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.660
Interesting factoid.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.010
The catalysis, this enzymatic
catalysis to join together

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.020
those amino acids is actually
carried out not by the

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.900
proteins in a ribosome,
but actually

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.860
by RNA in the ribosome.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.122
The RNA is the enzyme.

00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:02.810
You know why that's
kind of cool?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.050
If this bothers you, just forget
it, but one of the

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.720
mysteries about how you ever go
from DNA to RNA to protein

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.570
and all of that is how the whole
thing ever got started.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.930
How could you possibly have
gotten protein synthesis

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.980
started if the things that were
needed to make protein

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.230
synthesis were proteins?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.720
So this is actually an echo of
an ancient world 3 billion

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.720
years ago, where this was all
probably carried out by RNAs.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.480
RNA was probably the early
catalysts for most things, and

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.700
we still see evidence of the
fact that even today your

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.110
peptide bonds are catalyzed
actually by RNA and they're

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.260
doing the enzymatic work.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.630
Anyway, it's kind of cool.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.230
If you didn't get that, don't
worry about it, but

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.120
it's kind of cool.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.410
So then what happens after
you attach the

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.840
first two amino acids?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.320
Well, the ribosome chugs down
here and grabs the next code--

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.320
these two shift over.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.210
You can either think about the
ribosome moving this way or

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.680
the RNA moving that way.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.830
The next tRNA drops in, the
next bond gets made, chugs

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.920
over, the next one drops in,
the next one gets made, and

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.860
onward like that until it hits
a stop codon at which, it

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.830
releases it.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.260
The ribosome knows
to release it.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.900
There's actually a little factor
that drops in and tells

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.120
it to release it there.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.800
And that's how you
make proteins--

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.730
kind of cool.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.345
It works very well.

00:13:21.345 --> 00:13:23.200
It chugs along in
that fashion.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.560
For you computer scientists,
what you basically have is a

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.990
two-tape turing machine--

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.510
you're reading one tape and
writing to the other tape.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.100
There's a nucleic acid
tape and there's

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.600
an amino acid tape.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.290
If you're not a computer
scientist, forget I said that.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.080
OK.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.420
So it's basically a two-tape
tape turing machine where the

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.370
RNA is coming through here and
the protein is coming out that

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:48.310
way, but the amino acids
attach to each other

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.220
until it comes off.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.110
In fact, actually, very
recently, a Nobel Prize was

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.770
awarded last year for beautiful,
beautiful work on

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.030
how this actually takes place--
the molecular details

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.780
of the ribosome.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.600
Really gorgeous.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.694
Any questions about that?

00:14:07.694 --> 00:14:09.152
Yeah.

00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:10.610
AUDIENCE: Is that not
susceptible to the same error

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.560
as replication is?

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.260
PROFESSOR: Oh, is that not
susceptible to the same error?

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.870
Does the ribosome ever
make mistakes?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.740
It does.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.342
What happens if you make
the wrong protein?

00:14:28.342 --> 00:14:30.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.440
PROFESSOR: Oh well.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.890
The answer turns out to be "oh
well" because for any given

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.180
DNA, you make lots of RNAs.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.335
For any RNA, you use it
again and again to

00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:40.810
make lots of proteins.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.670
And if the occasional protein is
not so good, if the quality

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.660
control is not perfect, it's
much less serious than if your

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.820
master instructions in the
DNA were not perfect.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.550
So the cell actually
devotes a lot less

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.360
attention to quality control.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.550
Now.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.570
That's not to say there isn't
important quality control.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.850
There are quality control
mechanisms, but it doesn't

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.840
have to be as accurate as one
error in a billion, like you

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.810
want to be in copying
your DNA.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.910
And that's really an important
point, is the archival copy

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.580
has to be really good, but
little yellow sticky notes--

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.520
what you make from it, which
are basically RNA or the

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.810
little yellow sticky notes you
copied down-- they don't have

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.430
to be perfect.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.330
And each copy, the protein
doesn't have to be--

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.750
and if the protein is not
perfect, there are mechanisms

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.540
that take unfolded proteins
and degrade them.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.040
So it turns out there are ways
to achieve quality control in

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.610
that sense.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:27.860
It's a great question.
