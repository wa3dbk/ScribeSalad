00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.130
ERIC LANDER: Let's talk about
what Mendel really did in his

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.323
experiments.

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:32.680
So section one, Mendel's
experiments.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.900
Mendel did a lot of really
cool things.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.940
The first thing he did was, in
order to study heredity, that

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.730
was his assignment as a monk--
go study heredity--

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.150
he had to get some material
to work with.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.230
He decided to use peas.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.526
Why peas?

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:52.700
Well, there are a lot of
varieties of peas in the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.350
market, many different
kinds of peas.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.980
And you could breed
them together.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.110
There were tall peas, short
peas, green peas, yellow peas,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.580
round peas, wrinkled peas, all
kinds of peas that you could

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.500
find in the market.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.510
They grew very well
in the garden.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.990
And when you're done with the
experiment, you could feed

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.340
them to the monks.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.330
So the first thing he did
was he got his material.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.490
And did he immediately start
crossing his peas together?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.780
No.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.370
What did he do?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.695
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:23.625
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:25.335
AUDIENCE: He grew
them separately.

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:27.160
ERIC LANDER: He first grew
them separately.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.370
Because he wanted to see if he
was going to study how traits

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.580
were inherited, he first had to
do the control experiment.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.860
He first had to show that if he
took each variety of peas,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.790
they would breed true.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.160
So the first thing is,
Mendel did controls.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.210
That's an important thing
we learned from Mendel.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.130
He took round peas.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.820
He took wrinkled peas.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.100
And he bred them with
themselves.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.390
And they always came
out round.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.950
And he took wrinkled peas and he
bred them with themselves.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.380
And they came out wrinkled.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.750
And if they hadn't always come
out round or hadn't always

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.760
come out wrinkled, it would've
been a much harder experiment

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.670
to interpret later.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.800
So that was incredibly important
thing to do, was do

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.090
the controls, round
and wrinkled.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.270
Then, when he was satisfied that
he had pure breeding or

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.670
true breeding plants, then and
only then did he do an

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.920
experiment.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.060
What experiment did he do?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.620
You all know Mendel.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.700
The truth is, this is not
like a surprise here.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.802
So what did he do?

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:39.450
He crossed the round
and the wrinkled.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680
I'm trying to draw out the new
things here, but some of the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.770
old ones you know.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.000
And when he crossed round
and wrinkled--

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.780
We'll call this the
F 0 generation.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.630
In the F 1 generation,
what did he see?

00:03:00.624 --> 00:03:03.010
Round.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.200
You all know this.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.850
He saw all round.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.590
He didn't see puckered,
slightly puckered or

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.260
anything like that.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.840
He didn't see any wrinkles.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.740
They were all every bit as round
as the rounds in the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.720
parental generation.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.770
That was an extremely important
point, because of

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.750
course, a competing theory of
inheritance was blending

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.450
inheritance, where the
offspring would be

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.250
intermediates.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.950
And the truth is almost every
experiment that you do when

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.680
you take plants and you cross
them, or animals and you cross

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.350
them, despite your biology
textbook, shows blending

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.930
inheritance.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.870
A tall plant and a short
plant, you breed them.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.490
Almost always is
a middle plant.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.420
But not for the peas.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.400
The peas were a beautiful
system.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.650
And Mendel very lucky to have
chosen it, because truth is,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.810
there was only one gene
difference that was

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.790
controlling these traits.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.080
If there'd been 10 genes
controlling this, you'd get

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.820
some blending, blah,
blah, blah.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.720
But Mendel got a situation
with really clean

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.510
experimental data.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.970
The round was every
bit as round.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.545
And so that said, no blending.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.980
Now what did he do?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:19.140
Next, what Mendel does is he
crosses these round peas to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.959
themselves.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.640
He selfs them.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.770
So we're going to
self the peas.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.180
The peas can be selfed.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.580
They have both male and female
reproductive parts.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
And when he selfs them,
they self pollinate.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.190
And what do they produce?

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.440
Peas.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.190
That's good.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.440
They produce peas.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.000
And what does he notice?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.530
He notices that now they're
not all round.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.530
Some of them are wrinkled.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.340
And the wrinkleds are every
bit as wrinkled as the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.420
wrinkleds were in the parental
generation F 0.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.310
And the round were every
bit as round.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.590
So suddenly wrinkled
had gone away.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.240
And what had happened?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.490
Sorry.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.380
Wrinkled had gone away
in this generation.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.190
And now it had reappeared.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.735
The trait reappears.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.950
It's quantal.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.200
It's discrete.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.180
It's not blended
out in any way.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.040
It's not blended.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.090
It's not imperfect.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.115
It's the same wrinkled that
was there before.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.760
That's a big qualitative
observation.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.030
This whole blending notion can't
be right, at least for

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.530
this experiment.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.920
Discreteness rules.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.270
So that was his experiment.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.800
Mendel could've written it up
and said, wow, the traits

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.920
don't blend.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.920
They're discrete.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.530
But Mendel, being an MIT kind
of monk, went further.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.780
What did he do?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.130
Sorry?

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.520
AUDIENCE: He repeated it.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.360
ERIC LANDER: He repeated it.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.770
And it still showed
some rounds and

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.850
wrinkleds and all that.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.830
But he was a very quantitative
MIT monk.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.960
He counted them, which seems
obvious, but ain't so obvious.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.790
He counted them.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.040
And what did he find?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.360
A fixed proportion?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.560
What?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.326
AUDIENCE: A ratio.

00:06:36.326 --> 00:06:38.041
ERIC LANDER: A ratio.

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:39.805
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there 1:3?

00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:43.180
ERIC LANDER: 1:3 or 3:1 or
something like that?

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.650
No.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.170
No.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.550
Nope.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.320
No, he counted.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.170
He counted.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:07:00.500
And what he found was
rounds: 5,474.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.310
Wrinkleds: 1,850.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:13.350
Ratio, not 3:1 at all.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:18.010
2.96:1.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.360
No, no, no.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.980
But you see, you say because
your books all tell you 3:1,

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.120
that it's obvious if you
do that, you say,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.680
that must be 3:1.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.570
It not must be 3:1.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.770
It's 2.96:1.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.200
And if you do it again,
you might get 2.87:1.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.210
And it actually takes quite an
imagination to say, it's

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.070
trying to be 3.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.290
Just think about it.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.670
You come to this experiment
and you say, it's

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.890
trying to be 3.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.240
That's a separate leap and
an important leap.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.320
He counted.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.200
And he got numbers, 2.96:1.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.740
And he got other numbers.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.930
He then, as you've done so
quickly, made a hypothesis.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:04.350
That hypothesis was that, in
fact, this was trying to be

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:10.180
3:1, that it quote "wanted to
be 3:1." It was near 3:1.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.050
And that really the reason
it was trying

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.260
to be 3:1 was because--

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.220
Well, there was a pretty
nice explanation here.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.900
His cool explanation was, the
round plants and the wrinkled

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.130
plants, well he made
up a model.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.810
These guys had two particles of
inheritance, big R big R,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.820
little r little r.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.010
When you cross them together,
these guys were

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.530
big R, little r.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:45.820
And when you self them, if you
randomly chose one particle

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.310
from the sperm and one particle
from the egg, ovule,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:59.910
you would have big R, big R, big
R, little r, little r, big

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.970
R, and little r, little r,
all as possibilities.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:11.050
And that these guys, big R, big
R, they would be round.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.890
Why would they be round?

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.130
Well because that's what the
parental generation here was.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.710
The little r little r, they
would be wrinkled.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.230
Because that's the parental
generation there.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.530
And these guys that have one of
each, what would they be?

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.240
Round, because we saw that in
the F1 generation, one of each

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.260
makes it round.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.345
So we had a model, a hypothesis,
a model.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.190
Pretty cool.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.480
You can come up with this
model by saying, the

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.840
contribution from the male,
the contribution from the

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.550
female, this is the male
gametes, the female gametes.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.350
You get this nice little thing
sometimes referred to as a

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.080
Punnett square.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.670
Although he didn't use
Punnett squares.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.120
And Punnett wasn't born yet.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.360
Now what do you do?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.960
Mendel went out and got
experimental material.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.490
He did controls.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.090
He did an experiment.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.200
He counted.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.380
He then made this creative leap
to say, I see something

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.710
cool going on.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.290
Integers are what's going on.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.110
And made up a model.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.440
What does a scientist
do at that point?

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.500
Sorry?

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:40.950
Oh come on.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.940
In this modern world, if you got
a result this cool, what

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.620
would you be doing?

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:45.930
Sorry?

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.646
AUDIENCE: Publish it.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.930
ERIC LANDER: Publish it right?

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.410
You're going to get out there
quickly and publish it.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:56.760
Mendel whips off an email to
Nature in London, saying--

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.160
Or whatever the 1865 emails.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.390
Actually it wasn't Nature.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.220
It gets published in the
Proceedings of the Royal

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.710
Society of Brun.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.790
But forgive me.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.440
I'll use Nature, OK.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.590
So he whips off an email to
Nature, which is what we do

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.600
today, telling the editor, we
have this really cool result.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.120
I think it'll be of
broad interest to

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.620
the readers of Nature.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.380
We're going to try to send
you a paper next week,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:17.860
et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.650
Are you interested?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.240
They write back, oh yeah.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.780
We'd love to see your
paper Gregor.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.840
And Mendel whips together
a paper.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.102
What happens when Mendel whips
together this paper and it

00:11:31.102 --> 00:11:33.990
goes off to London, to Nature,
the offices of Nature?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.976
What does Nature do with it?

00:11:34.976 --> 00:11:39.930
They just set it and type
and say, here it is?

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.920
What's the scientific process?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.670
Peer review.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.525
Before you go print this thing,
you've got to send it

00:11:46.525 --> 00:11:49.710
out to some other scientists
as anonymous reviewers and

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.220
say, we've received this paper,
this correspondence

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:58.990
from Brother Mendel
in Moravia.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.960
Would you review it for the
journal Nature and tell us

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.980
your candid opinion?

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.290
And they write it up.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.510
And they send it
back to Nature.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.860
And Nature makes a decision
whether to publish the paper.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.110
So you're the reviewers.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.380
Should we publish
Mendel's paper?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.990
Who says yes?

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.910
Who says no?

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.392
Why no?

00:12:29.392 --> 00:12:30.766
AUDIENCE: He needs
more examples.

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:31.880
ERIC LANDER: Needs
more examples.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.710
So you're right.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.020
One lousy trait.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.060
Mendel actually had seven
traits in the paper.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.730
It turns out I didn't tell you
them all, green and yellow,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:39.650
and tall and short.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.750
And they're all in the paper.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.810
He actually has seven separate
examples that

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.020
show the same thing.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.170
Should we publish it?

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.770
Why not?

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.280
It's just peas.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.860
Oh boy, you're churlish there.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.010
I mean, come on.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.220
It's peas.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.150
People eat a lot of peas.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.210
It's a result.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.920
It'll get others in the
scientific community

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.312
interested.

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:03.630
AUDIENCE: Who are the
peer reviewers?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.300
ERIC LANDER: You.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.700
I've assigned you as
peer reviewers.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.600
I'm asking you, should we
publish this thing?

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.700
We got seven traits we're
going to publish.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.340
And it's pretty cool.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.705
Nobody's ever reported this
3:1 ratio in this model.

00:13:12.705 --> 00:13:13.310
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.850
But I wasn't the peer
reviewer back then.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.633
ERIC LANDER: You are now.

00:13:15.633 --> 00:13:16.620
AUDIENCE: Then yes, I
would publish it.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.210
ERIC LANDER: You'd publish it.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.405
OK.

00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:18.210
He'd publish it.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.360
Because nobody's
reported this.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:19.990
It's pretty cool.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.610
The model perfectly
fits the data.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.990
Yes.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.316
AUDIENCE: It's got to
make predictions.

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:27.230
ERIC LANDER: It's going
to make predictions.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.598
But the model fits the data.

00:13:29.598 --> 00:13:32.161
AUDIENCE: The model needs to
make predictions [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:32.394
data.

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:34.370
ERIC LANDER: Are you saying
that we made up the model

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.490
after we saw the data?

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.040
And that it's not a surprise
that the model fits the data?

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.240
Yeah, that's right, isn't it.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.380
That's a real problem.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.200
If you make up models after they
fit the data, they tend

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.450
to fit the data.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:49.890
Well they do.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.020
That's a real problem.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.900
So the reviewers write back to
Mendel and say, Mendel-- this

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.465
isn't actually how it happened,
you understand.

00:13:57.465 --> 00:13:59.210
But anyway, they write
back to Mendel.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.850
They write back to the
journal Nature.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.240
And they anonymously say, we
would like to see some

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.380
predictions of this model to
see if this is really true.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.660
And Nature writes
back to Mendel.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.300
And the email says, could
you just show us some

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.730
predictions from this?

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.310
So to help Mendel out, what
predictions can we make?

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.040
What surprising predictions
could you make for Mendel's

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:26.640
experiment?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.790
Well, this experiment, round
by wrinkled, gives round,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.030
gives some rounds and some
wrinkles, which we think are

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.750
big R, big R, big R, little
r little r, big R,

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.340
little r, little r.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.840
And that this is big R, big R.
How could we prove something's

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.320
going on in this generation?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.670
AUDIENCE: Self them.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.000
ERIC LANDER: Self them.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.210
If we pick out a round
and self it,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.460
what's going to happen?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.340
Sorry?

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.116
AUDIENCE: It depends
on which round.

00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:02.770
ERIC LANDER: So how do I know
which round to pick.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:03.440
They all look the same.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.112
AUDIENCE: You just
try all of them.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.060
ERIC LANDER: Try all of them.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.630
If I try to all of them,
what am I going to see?

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.540
AUDIENCE: You'll see some that
only produce rounds.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.362
ERIC LANDER: Produce rounds.

00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:13.120
About what fraction of them
will only produce rounds?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.310
1/3.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.460
And what fraction will produce
rounds and wrinkleds?

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.080
AUDIENCE: 2/3.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.180
ERIC LANDER: 2/3.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.110
We have a prediction.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.010
Thank you.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.885
The prediction is,
test the rounds.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.280
And although we don't know which
are which, 1/3 of them

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:38.320
will give rise to only rounds,
whereas 2/3 of them will give

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.800
rise to our 3:1 ratio.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.090
That is a non-obvious
prediction.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.850
If this model weren't right,
it's very surprising if you

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.480
would have nailed
that prediction.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.800
Nice.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.420
What other predictions
can you make?

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:57.626
What other crosses could
you set up to test it?

00:15:57.626 --> 00:15:59.896
AUDIENCE: Wrinkleds
by wrinkleds.

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:01.550
ERIC LANDER: The wrinkleds
by themselves

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.490
will only give wrinkles.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.700
And that's true.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.020
Bingo.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.030
So we're doing well.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.186
What else?

00:16:06.186 --> 00:16:07.644
AUDIENCE: Wrinkleds
with rounds.

00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:09.330
ERIC LANDER: Wrinkleds
with rounds.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:17.080
So I could take these three
rounds here and I can cross

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.410
them to wrinkleds.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.260
What'll happen here?

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.900
If this was rounds, rounds over
wrinkled, wrinkled, it's

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.090
going to give rise to what?

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:25.980
AUDIENCE: Rounds.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.960
ERIC LANDER: All rounds.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.436
But if this is round wrinkled,
what would it give rise to?

00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:33.744
AUDIENCE: Half and half.

00:16:33.744 --> 00:16:35.680
ERIC LANDER: 50:50.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.890
Half and half.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.095
Now we're cooking.

00:16:40.095 --> 00:16:42.070
There are all these predictions
that start

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.750
dropping out, because your model
tells you things you

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.490
haven't yet seen.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:52.670
Mendel writes back and says,
I did all the experiments.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.890
I did what the referees
requested.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.200
The referees get
the paper back.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.370
They say, yes indeed, Mendel's
done the experiments.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.510
We recommend publication.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.060
Nature publishes it.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.320
They put out a press release
and all that.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.280
Mendel's on the evening news,
that kind of thing.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.740
It didn't really happen
that way exactly.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.130
But anyway, you get the point.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.980
That's the process
of doing science.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.150
It's a cool process.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.530
And it's a back and forth.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.869
And it's a process of convincing
people, and you

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.550
convince them by predictions.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.089
And you can think of
the kinds of cool

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.680
predictions you could make.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.780
And that's what's fun about
working in a lab, is making

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.900
those kind of predictions.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.400
Now all right.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.650
I need to give you a
few definitions.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.940
A gene.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.510
When I refer to a gene for the
moment, I mean a discrete

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.100
factor of inheritance, discrete
particle, factor of

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.380
inheritance, something
like that.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.730
Because geneticists early on had
no idea what genes were.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.965
You know perfectly well a
gene is a DNA sequence,

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:04.230
blah blah blah blah.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:06.020
But it's useful to be
able to think about

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.580
a gene in the abstract.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.260
It's the thing that controls a
particular inheritance of a

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.410
particular trait.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.130
Variant forms of a gene,
alternative forms of a gene,

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.380
are called alleles.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:30.570
When I write big R, little r,
they are alleles of the gene

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.590
for roundness.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.500
Allele, from the Greek meaning
other or alternative.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:47.690
When I write genotype, I mean
the combination of alleles

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.830
that an individual has.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.350
Like when I write big R, big
R, that's a genotype.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.770
Or big R, little
r, or little r,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.440
little r, that's a genotype.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:09.050
When I say the word phenotype,
what do I mean?

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.403
A trait, an appearance.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.440
What are the traits under
discussion here?

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.690
Round and wrinkled.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.400
Geneticists are like
mathematicians.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.070
They're very precise
about their words.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.130
Now comes the ones that people
always have trouble with,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:41.080
dominant and recessive.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:20:08.146
Phenotype 1 is dominant to
phenotype 2 if the--

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:09.396
Oops, sorry.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.870
I meant to add two words here.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:23.450
Heterozygote, homozygote,
words you know as well.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.740
Heterozygote, having
different alleles.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.440
Homozygote, having
the same alleles.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.360
Different, same alleles.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.930
So a phenotype, phenotype 1 is
dominant to phenotype 2 if the

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:47.300
F1 heterozygote, the cross
between them, has phenotype 1.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.100
Why did I write this in this
wacky mathematical way?

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.570
That says round is dominant to
wrinkled if when I cross round

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.110
to wrinkled, the offspring
are round.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.870
So which is dominant,
round or wrinkled?

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.630
Which is dominant, big
R, or little r?

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.860
No.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.060
Big R is an allele.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.420
We said phenotypes are dominant,
not alleles.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.230
We don't say big R is dominant
to little r.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.940
We say round is dominant
to wrinkled.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.300
Now this will bother
you greatly.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.010
And it will bother about 95%
of my biology colleagues.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.890
But geneticists who are careful
use the word dominant

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.200
and recessive to refer to
phenotypes, not alleles.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.450
Why do I care?

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.950
I care because big R, as a
molecular allele, as a variant

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.200
of a gene, might end up
controlling three or five

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.120
different traits.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.490
Some of the traits that big R
controls could be dominant.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.240
Some of them could
be recessive.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.390
Sickle cell anemia, there's
a sickle cell mutation.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.210
Is that recessive or dominant?

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.750
Sickle cell anemia
is a recessive

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.400
trait, a recessive phenotype.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.430
But sickle cell trait, the
tendency for blood cells to

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.240
sickle at low oxygen tension,
is a dominant phenotype.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.740
The allele that causes sickle
cell anemia causes a recessive

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.600
trait, anemia, and a dominant
trait that can be measured in

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.240
heterzygotes.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.150
You'll forget this.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.400
Everyone will forget this.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.830
But I've at least told you
once that alleles could

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.480
control multiple phenotypes
and do control multiple

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:42.870
phenotypes.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.770
And that's why geneticists
obsess about using the words

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.330
recessive and dominant to refer
to the phenotype, not

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.980
the genotype.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.920
I've made my plea.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.880
Like all of my colleagues in
the biology department, you

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.520
will continue to misuse
the word.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.600
But there's a better chance
you'll get it right because

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.460
I've made my little
stand here.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.775
Recessive is the opposite
of this.

00:23:02.775 --> 00:23:04.050
Good.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.220
This is mostly to say,
geneticists try to think

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.950
carefully about their words.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:11.240
Those are the definitions.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.130
You should be able to use the
words gene, allele, genotype,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.200
heterzygote, homozygote,
phenotype, dominant, recessive

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.450
in a good way.
