00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.720
PROFESSOR: OK, well let's move
on then, and just talk about

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.130
the amino acids.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.380
Amino acids side chains.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.520
And you won't have to memorize
these structures.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.210
We will give you a chart
if you have a problem.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.680
On the other hand, you need to
get very familiar with them,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.640
so they're old friends even if
you can't quite remember how

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.740
many methylene are in a chain,
or something like that.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.980
And you will find that they fall
into certain categories.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.100
And I'm just going to try and
give you examples of the major

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.260
categories.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.420
There are negatively charged
side chains.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.560
An example would be amino acids
known as aspartate, or

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.815
Asp, in which the side chain
which corresponds to the R1 or

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:21.840
to the R2 over there, has a
methylene group, and then a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.780
carboxyl group.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.300
But at pH sevenish, which is the
pH that you find inside a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.340
cell, that carboxyl group would
be deprotonated so it

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.020
would have a negative charge.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.630
The other negatively charged
amino acid is glutamate, which

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.380
also, as you'll see has
a carboxyl group.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.510
There are positively charged
amino acids.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.040
A good one to illustrate this
is Lysine, in which there's

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.110
four methylene groups,
and then an amino

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.900
group at the end.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.240
However, again, at pH 7, the
kind of pH that you find

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.250
inside the cell, that amino
group is going to get

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.240
protonated.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.400
And so it will have a
positive charge on.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.120
If you have a Lysine side chain,
and Arginine, and in

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.160
most cases, Histidine, are
examples of other amino acids

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.650
that can have a positively
charged group.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.720
And why I'm going through all
of this, I hope, will become

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.980
apparent in a few minutes.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.590
Some of the side chains are
not positive or negative

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.210
charged, but rather,
they're polar.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.070
And we just talked about polar
bonds the last time, where you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.510
have, the more electronegative
an atom is, the more greedy it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.680
is for electrons.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.900
And if you recall, if you have
a carbon carbon bond or a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.270
hydrogen hydrogen bond that's
nonpolar, and the electrons

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.290
were distributed equally, the
oxygen is greedier for

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.170
electrons and so there is a
little bit of a negative

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.050
charge there and a little
bit of positive

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.490
charge on the hydrogen.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.560
Well, that same principle
applies to

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.400
amino acid side chains.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.260
Take, for example, the amino
acid Serine, which has a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.230
methylene group and then
a hydroxyl group.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.530
Well, here we are.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.390
There's an OH bond, so there
will be a little bit of a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.620
negative charge on oxygen with
a positive charge on there.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.660
There's another alcohol called
threonine, which also has

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.230
hydroxyl groups.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.300
And you can make amides of both
Aspartate and Glutamate,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.650
to give Asparagine and
Glutamine, and both of these

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.870
are also polar too.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.380
So what I'm hoping you're
beginning to get a sense of,

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.150
you can do an awful lot with
the properties of a peptide

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.500
chain, depending on which
amino acids you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.710
dangle off the side.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.900
And ultimately, that order of
amino acids is what's going to

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.800
be determined by what's in the
gene encoding that protein.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:25.600
Then there are quite a number
of amino acids side chains

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.990
which are hydrophobic.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.430
They're sort of fearing
water, if you will.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.130
The simplest is Alanine, or Ala,
which is just a methyl

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.770
group, or Leucine, is perhaps,
a little more obvious because

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.240
that's got this.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.770
And you can see that
that's a kind of--

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.540
draw it like that.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.240
This is, very much, a kind of
structure that's not going to

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.820
want to interact with water.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:23.060
And then, another example would
be Phenylalanine, or

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.600
Phe, and that one is a methylene
group and, then, a

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.830
benzene ring.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.800
So most of you know, have some
sense of the properties of

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.230
benzene, a very, very
organic solvent.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.980
So here you put a side chain
like this, it's very much a

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.440
residue that doesn't want to
interact with water anymore

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920
than Benzene wants to
interact with water.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.960
And then there are three
special cases.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.070
One of these is Glycine.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.100
In this case, it's
just a hydrogen.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.390
One of the consequences of that
is that since it's just a

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.825
hydrogen, that's going to be a
very, very flexible place, if

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:21.270
we have a chain of amino acids
and there's a Glycine there,

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.320
it's going to be very little
of way of constraints

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.420
introduced, either by steric
constraints or by

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.880
interactions.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:35.230
Another very special one is
one called Cystine, Cys.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.490
And it's the same idea as
Cyrine, there's an ethylene.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.530
But instead of having an
OH, it has an SH group.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.850
And that may not seem to be a
great consequence, the sulfur

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.620
is a little bit larger.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.530
But sulfurs have--

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.890
a sulfide group here has a
sulfhydryl group here has a

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.980
very special property, and that
is, it can oxidatively

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.720
dimerize with another
sulfhydryl.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.080
So if you have a side chain, and
there's a cystine that has

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.320
an SH group, and another, either
part of the same chain,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.390
or part of the different
polypeptide chain that also

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.460
has a cystine, and they're in an
oxidizing environment, and

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.010
they're also close enough
together to interact, they can

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:39.060
form a bond like this, which is
known as a disulfide bond,

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:44.050
and it's the only one of the
amino acids that's capable of

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.860
reaching outside the chain in
either hooking to a different

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.010
part of the chain or to a
completely different protein.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.260
And in fact, proteins that tend
to get excreted out into

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.860
the media, either by bacteria or
other things, often have a

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.380
lot of disulfide bonds.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.200
Because when you link the
peptide chains together like

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.660
that, it tends to make a very
tough protein that's hard to

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.630
break down and can be
very, very robust.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:18.570
And there is one other special
category of, one other special

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:23.550
amino acid that's known
as Proline.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:31.820
You have the alpha carbon atom,
the carboxyl group, and

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.650
then there's the amino
group here.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:43.770
But this carbon is linked by
a little ring with three

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.080
methylenes to that amino acid.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.710
Again, this may seem sort of
an unnecessary detail or

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.400
something, but this is the way
life evolved on earth.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.500
This is an amino acid, but
because of this ring

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.100
structure, this bond is
not able to rotate.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.610
So wherever a Proline shows up
in the sequence, it puts some

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.760
structural constraints on the
conformational space that that

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.760
chain is capable of getting
itself into.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:26.760
So when we study protein
structure, this is at the

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.630
heart of how proteins work,
we'll spend quite a bit of

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.815
time in the ensuing lectures
talking about the central

00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:41.090
dogma and the idea that the
linear order of the amino

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.980
acids, in a protein, is
determined by the sequence of

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.440
the DNA and how that's
encoded.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.610
But at the end, what you end up
with is a linear sequence

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.120
of amino acids, all joined
together by peptide bonds.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.590
And there's an incredible
number of

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.660
conformations possible.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.650
These things could go all over
the place in all kinds of

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.330
different ways.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.780
Yet, only one form, in general,
is the biologically

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.256
active conformation or maybe
there's a couple of them and

00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:16.740
it switches back and forth as
part of a machine action, or

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.330
are part of what it does.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:22.000
But by and large, for every
protein there'll be one, or

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.030
just a couple of
conformations.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.140
And so understanding proteins,
what many, many people are

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.850
interested in is trying to
understand how you can get

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.010
from that linear sequence
and determine the three

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.010
dimensional structure.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:42.240
There are techniques, X-ray
crystallography and NMR

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.250
techniques now, which enable
us to get the structures,

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.880
solve the structures
of proteins.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.750
In fact, there's the structures
of tens of

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.960
thousands of them are
in a database

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.900
called the Protein Database.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.030
And we're going to be talking
about a little protein viewer

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.020
that you'll be using that, in
fact, once you've used it in

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.780
your problem set, you could go
open the structure of any

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.570
protein whose structure has ever
has been solved, if you

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.000
want to do it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.820
But what we haven't yet figured
out is a reliable way

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.590
of saying, here is a protein
that consists of a particular

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.400
chain of amino acids.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.550
I'm going to predict its three
dimensional shape.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.430
So we understand parts
of it, but there's

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.830
parts we don't know.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.120
And I'm going to take you
through the first part of

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.900
understanding protein
structure.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.760
And before we do that, I want to
just talk about the levels

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:47.450
of protein structure and the
terms that are used to

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.700
describe these.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.800
When people talk about the
primary structure of a

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:09.490
protein, what they're talking
about is the sequence of amino

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.630
acids, and it's possible I'll
abbreviate those as AA, at

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.260
some point without thinking
about it.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.060
So just in case I do, that's
a fairly commonly used

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.850
abbreviation for amino acids.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.580
So that simply, Phenylalanine
joined to a Proline joined to

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.490
a Glycine joined to two Cystines
joined to something

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:33.190
else, but that's not terribly
useful in terms of telling

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.170
what the protein does.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.780
Then there's secondary
structure.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:50.350
These are regions of local
folding and they're driven by,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.120
guess what?

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.960
Hydrogen bonds.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.710
And we'll talk about how that
goes in just a moment.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.030
Then the term, tertiary
structure, is the term used to

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.010
describe the entirety of
the folded protein.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.250
If I went in and determined
the structure of a protein

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.950
using x-ray crystallography,
this is what I would see.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.490
It would be the tertiary
structure.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:20.810
And there are other forces that
we haven't discussed yet

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.540
that contribute to that
tertiary structure.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:32.070
And then, a quaternary structure
means that there's

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:42.650
more than one polypeptide
chain.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.940
And it could be as simple as
an enzyme that's got two

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.080
subunits and you've got to have
them both there in order

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.870
for it to work, or as I think
you're beginning to probably

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.950
get the sense from my use of
the term protein machines,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.590
there are structures that have
multiple interacting proteins

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.880
and have complexities that rival
some of the mechanical

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.740
things that we build
ourselves.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:14.030
So the interesting story, a
little, bit how the insights

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:21.110
into secondary structure
were first arrived.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.970
Some of you may have heard
the term Linus Pauling.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.160
He was at Cal Tech, a Nobel
Prize winner, very, very

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.260
influential scientist,
in a variety of ways.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.950
The key insight that
Linus Pauling had

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.180
came in the late 1940s.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.020
People had been doing X-ray
crystallography on minerals

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.270
and things like that, and the
basic idea was you had a

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.490
crystal of some type, you
bounced electrons off, you got

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.530
a diffraction pattern.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.660
Then you could work backwards
and figure out the structure

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.300
that was generating the
diffraction pattern.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.140
And that had, then, been
extended to proteins.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.760
And it was discovered there
were certain proteins that

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.210
would crystallize and you could
bounce electrons off and

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:17.000
get a diffraction pattern.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.860
And at least a category of these
proteins, and analysis

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.630
of the diffraction pattern
suggested it was some kind of

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:33.620
helix, and there was a repeating
element of about 5.4

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.680
angstroms, roughly.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.400
And so, Linus Pauling was very

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.910
interested in protein structure.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:47.560
And I think it was in late 1948,
he was visiting England

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.890
and he caught the flu,
just like some of

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.180
you have been catching.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.663
And he spent a few days reading
detective stories and

00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:56.120
then he got bored.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.350
And so he tried to
take on this--

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.770
think about this problem.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.340
While he was lying in bed.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.710
And he made a simplifying
assumption.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:09.720
He said let's just forget about
all the side chains.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.010
Maybe they don't really
matter in terms

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.600
of this basic property.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:20.700
Maybe it's determined by the
backbone of the peptide chain.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.250
So he took a strip of paper,
started pleating it.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.760
And he was a very good chemist,
so he knew about this

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.250
partial double [? blind ?]

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:36.260
character of the peptide bond
and the constraints that it

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.950
put on the structures that
the protein could take.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.630
And in doing this, he realized
that if he folded the thing

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.350
into a helix, kind of like
this, into a right handed

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:57.820
helix, that things worked out
such that the carboxyl group

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:03.960
in the backbone was just
beautifully positioned to form

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.724
hydrogen bond that was on
one of the nitrogens.

00:17:08.724 --> 00:17:10.885
He called this an alpha helix.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:21.369
There were 3.7 amino
acids per turn.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:29.750
And the distance from here to
here was 5.4 angstroms.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.900
And if we just--

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.340
sorry, I meant to put that up

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.180
earlier, or did I go backwards?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.740
Anyway, there are all
the amino acids and

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.880
they're in your book.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.830
Here is just the backbone
of an alpha helix.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:53.820
And the orangey yellow colored
bonds are the hydrogen bonds.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.860
And I hope you can see
how the spiral goes.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.900
And you can also see, as it goes
by, you can look right

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.800
down the hole down the
middle of the helix.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.260
So let's put on some
amino acids now.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.920
And again, you'll see, as it
goes by, you can look right

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.700
down the helix.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.750
But you see how the amino acids
stick out onto the side.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.590
And if you look, for example,
there is a Phenylalanine and a

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.240
Tyrosine, they're aromatic
groups that are very

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.620
hydrophobic.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.490
And up here there's a Lysine,
so that's this side of the

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.370
helix is charged.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.380
That's a glutamate.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.270
So there's a couple of charged
amino acids on

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.620
this side of the helix.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.530
Up here we've got a water hating
part and somehow this

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.946
is, I think, reminding me that
I left something out.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.870
Let me just fix that
up while I'm at it.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:19:01.340
The other hydrophobic amino
acids, I forgot to say those

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:11.450
are Isoleucine, Valine,
Methionine, Tyrosine, and

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.380
Tryptophan.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.060
Those are in your book.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.320
Those are other examples of
hydrophobic amino acids.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.660
But I think, even in this little
example of an alpha

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:29.810
helix, you can see, depending on
which amino acid was where,

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.610
along that little region of
alpha helix, it would very

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.700
much influence what that
part of the protein

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.790
was capable of doing.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:46.150
There's a second region of
secondary structure that's

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.070
very important.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.080
It's called a beta sheet.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.520
The one I'm showing you is an
example of an anti-parallel

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.130
beta sheet, although you
can have parallel

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.000
beta sheets as well.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.010
But what I've done here is
to take one strand of a

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.560
polypeptide chain and I've
written it out this way.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.590
And then I've taken a second--

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.132
what has happened?

00:20:12.132 --> 00:20:13.382
Oops.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.680
That's interesting.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.040
The stool just broke.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.070
OK.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.520
Fortunately, I noticed.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.810
So what we have here is that the
possibility for hydrogen

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.760
bonding between this hydrogen
of amino group and this

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.720
oxygen, again, so we
can get hydrogen

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:42.140
bonds formed like this.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.490
And this makes what are called
a beta sheet structure.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.400
And they can build up as well.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.390
This next one gives-- you can
see how you can put one beta

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.210
sheet on top of another.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:02.310
And both of these are two
major types of secondary

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:09.180
structure and the way an alpha
helix is represented is

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.430
something like this.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:14.890
This would be an alpha helix.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:22.530
And a beta sheet is written
as an arrow like that.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.680
And so most proteins tend to
have structures that consist

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.340
of, for example, an alpha helix,
some kind of turn,

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:39.970
maybe a beta sheet, another
turn, another beta sheet.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.940
Now maybe a turn, maybe an alpha
helix going this way,

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.820
some combination of regions
of secondary structure.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:54.880
And I've got just a couple
of examples of that.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.670
Here you can see a domain of a
protein with some beta sheets

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:05.740
in purple, alpha
helix in green.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.550
Where that's a piece of a
protein coming from what's

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.290
known as the bracket one gene.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.180
Some of you may be aware
there's a familial

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:22.050
susceptibility to breast cancer
that was discovered.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.090
It's a complex protein.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.830
Part of it, and a very, very
important part of it, is this

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.660
piece known as the
BRCT domain.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.840
It's the bracket one c terminal
domain, consists of

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.020
beta sheets alpha helix.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.090
Here's a protein I've already
shown you the structure of,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.430
but maybe you recognize now,
that green fluorescent protein

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.810
is mostly beta sheets.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.690
It's the only beta sheets
is going down here.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.350
There's a little bit of an
alpha helix up there.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.840
And there's a bit of
one over here?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:58.760
Here's an example of a protein
that's mostly alpha helix.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.600
What's this one do?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.650
This is a protein we'll talk
about when we talk about DNA

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.750
replication.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.610
It's involved in recognizing
mismatches in DNA, for

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.790
example, the G improperly got
paired with the T during DNA

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.200
replication.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.050
There's a system comes along and
repairs those mismatches

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.490
gives you another several
thousandfold increase in

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.630
fidelity, and if you mutate it
in that kind of protein in a

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.790
human, you have a familial

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.630
susceptibility to colon cancer.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:31.670
So it doesn't matter what their
function is, when you

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.040
get down to regions of secondary
structure, you'll

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.540
see these recurring things --
alpha helices, beta sheets.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.140
And if you understand their
properties, you begin to

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.480
understand some of the basic
structure of forces that are

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.550
giving the proteins
their properties.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.020
That's an enzyme called
chymotrypsin.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.180
What it does, it's an enzyme
that catalyzes the cleavage of

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.050
peptide bonds in
other proteins.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.740
But there it is.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.950
Got a lot of alpha helices,
beta sheets, turns.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.340
You can go on and on.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.640
I just said, one
more up there.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.310
That's the Ras protein.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.310
That's an oncogene.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.890
Mutate that in a particular
way, you have a

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.980
susceptibility to cancer.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.480
But it doesn't matter, when you
get down to the protein

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:22.040
structure, most proteins have
beta sheets, alpha helices.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.770
OK.

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.240
Go back to that one
in a second.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:31.040
So we have to understand
the rest of the

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.650
structure of proteins.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.880
We have to be able to talk about
the other forces that

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.790
are important for making
a protein.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:49.670
And the third force
is pretty simple.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.480
That's an ionic bond, and it's
just this simple, that if you

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.815
had a peptide chain that had,
for example, an Aspartate with

00:25:01.815 --> 00:25:08.420
a negatively charged amino acid
on it, and we had, say, a

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:16.160
Lysine, four Methylenes, and the
NH3 plus that was attached

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.860
somewhere else on that
polypeptide chain, then we can

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.640
get an ionic bond, because of
the attraction between the

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.800
negative charge on here and
a positive charge on that.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.380
So that is one of the things
that then a force that can

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.000
influence the structure
of proteins.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.200
The next one is a harder
one to understand.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.540
It's known as the van der
Waals interaction.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.400
And here's basically what's
going on is that a non-polar

00:25:50.400 --> 00:26:01.610
bond can have a transient
polarity.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.500
Sorry about this.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:26.000
And it can induce polarity in
a nearby non-polar bond, and

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.250
that can then give
an attraction.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:43.150
These things need to be very
close together, about 0.2 to

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:50.500
0.4 nanometers apart, the two
non-polar bonds, in order for

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.950
this to happen.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:57.080
Does anybody remember the length
of the covalent bond,

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.240
the 0.15 to 0.2 nanometers,
so within one or

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.090
two covalent bonds.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:06.060
They have to be that close.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:13.160
Their strength is about one
third, one quarter to one

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.670
third, to that of the
hydrogen bond.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.880
And if you remember, the
hydrogen bond was about one

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:26.550
twentieth of the force of the
strength of the hydrogen bond.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.700
But nevertheless, you can have
a lot of them because, if you

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.930
have an extended surface of a
protein that's very close

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.650
together, you can get a lot
of these van der Waal

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:37.880
interactions.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.230
And I'd always found
this a somewhat

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.490
esoteric kind of force.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:48.380
But in fact, we're familiar with
these because that's how

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.410
a lizard manages to
go up a surface.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.780
It uses van der Waals
interactions.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.470
And as I'll show you in a
minute, the trick is it's got

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:04.120
little hairs on the bottom of
its feet that have about a

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:08.640
billion split ends and they're
so tiny they're able to make

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.650
van der Waals interactions
with the surface.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:15.180
In a minute, I think there's
a shot from underneath.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.170
I got these movies from Robert
Full at Berkeley,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.530
who's worked on these.

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:24.210
You could see the lizard kind
of peeling its foot off.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.302
And here they've made a little
robot that can work by van der

00:28:28.302 --> 00:28:30.750
Waals forces and it will
climb up the wall

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.410
kind of like a lizard.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.090
And here's what's going on
at the molecular level.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.500
These are the toe pads on
a lizard like this.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.390
We're going to be just
zooming in now.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.750
And you'll see they're covered
with hairs, and you keep

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.425
zooming in more, there's
more hairs.

00:28:49.425 --> 00:28:53.140
And we keep zooming in more,
get down to a single hair,

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.500
there is a 30,000 fold
magnification.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.240
There's 115,000 magnification.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.660
And in the end, a gecko, such
as you've got here, has a

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.550
billion 0.2 micron tips.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:12.540
And just to compare it to a
human hair, over on the edge,

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.510
then you can see what the
gecko hair is like.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.182
It's a very, very fine hair and
it's able to use van der

00:29:20.182 --> 00:29:23.380
Waal interactions to stick
to the surface.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.940
Bob actually made a Band-Aid
by collecting this little

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.180
hairs out of the thing.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.440
And he made a little joke of
putting it in a Band-Aid box.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.690
But this is interesting
because it

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.800
isn't affected by water.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.000
You can peel it off.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.230
You can put it back down.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.000
And he thinks there were
commercial possibilities for

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.070
using van der Waals
interaction.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.100
So, OK, I think we have one more
force to go, but I think

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.340
we will call it a
day right here.
