00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.180
So far, there are a lot of
ways to clone genes.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.240
I've given you two.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.060
Later in the course, I'll give
you a third, but we cloned it

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.870
here by its function,
complementation.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.350
We cloned it here on
the basis of the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.275
protein it actually made.

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:19.580
Now, how do we analyze
these genes?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.270
How do you know which gene
we're dealing with?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.630
How do we study it?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.850
Let's turn to that.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.136
Analyzing our gene.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.570
Well, let's suppose we
have our cell, maybe

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.300
it's our yeast cell.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.170
It's Arg1 again.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.260
We'll go back to yeast.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.240
It's got its yeast DNA it's also
got this circle that has

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.260
our plasmid here.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.250
Circle is plasmid.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.020
How are we going to
study that gene?

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.350
We know that yeast is
able to now grow.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.750
We can grow up that yeast.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.420
We can purify DNA from it.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.670
But wait a second.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.070
How do we get our plasmids away
from the chromosomal DNA?

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.070
Aren't we back in the same
boat of you can't

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.330
purify DNA from DNA?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.120
Thankfully, this is easy.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.210
Little circles of DNA have
different biochemical

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.780
properties than the long, linear
chromosomes or the big

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.110
chunks of DNA.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.760
And you can use biochemistry to
separate little circles of

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.830
DNA from big chunks of DNA.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.080
So no problem.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.360
You can purify the plasmids.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.820
Purify the plasmid,
and there it is.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.100
It's back again.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.230
And now, you've got
your Arg1 gene.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.436
How do I study it?

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:40.230
Well, the first thing I might
want to find out about my Arg1

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.830
gene, is how big
is that insert.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.445
How can I find out how
big that insert is?

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:48.355
AUDIENCE: Electrophoresis.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:50.160
ERIC LANDER: Electrophoresis.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.610
I first have to cut
out the insert.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.816
How do I do that?

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:54.184
AUDIENCE: The restriction
enzyme.

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:56.640
ERIC LANDER: My restriction
enzyme, EcoRI.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.860
I cut with EcoRI and it
liberates the insert.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:08.280
And then I take a gel, which can
be made out of different

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.470
substances, and I put
my DNA there.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
Agarose is particularly nice
stuff, which is basically

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.980
Jell-O. And I turn on
an electric field.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.260
DNA is what, positively charged
or negatively charged?

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.180
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300
ERIC LANDER: So what kind of
charge do I want to put here?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.290
AUDIENCE: Positive.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.550
ERIC LANDER: What charge
do I put here?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.265
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:28.780
ERIC LANDER: What happens
if I do it backwards?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.590
Bad.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.090
Everybody does it backwards
in the lab at some point.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.950
So then you do this.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.220
The DNA goes this way and it
turns out that agarose is this

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.700
matrix of cross links
and all that.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.660
And DNA molecules wiggle through
like a snake, through

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.430
this matrix, and little ones go
much faster than big ones.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.930
So what happens is, little DNA
molecules move faster than big

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.660
DNA molecules.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.520
And if I stop at some point, and
I add a dye that sticks to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.850
DNA, and look at it with a
fluorescent light, I can

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.520
actually see where the
DNA molecules are.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.850
So I've grown up a ton of this
plasmid, lots of it, couple of

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.050
micrograms of it.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.260
I cut it, I add it to the top of
my well here, I turn on the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.330
electricity, and it wiggle,
wiggle, wiggles through.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.180
This is the vector, and
this is the insert.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.010
It might be actually, that I
found another plasmid that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.180
could do this too, that
rescued yeast.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.870
It had a vector and maybe
at a different insert.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.455
Maybe I had one, I don't know
why, that had the same insert

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:37.490
right there.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.810
In any case, the first
characterization that I would

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.470
do is look at the size
of my insert.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.010
How big is that insert?

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:59.450
I might find out that the insert
is one kilobase, 1,000

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.740
bases, or one KB, or 2 KB
or something like that.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.975
That's a first order of
characterization.

00:04:08.975 --> 00:04:10.580
Now, of course, what I
really want to know

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.950
about the insert, sequence.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.910
I want the DNA sequencing
insert, right?

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.050
Let's not just mess around with,
it's got 1,000 bases, I

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.110
want to know what are those
bases in what order.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.320
So that means I have to
invent DNA sequencing.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.790
All right.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.350
So how am I going to invent
DNA sequencing?

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.550
This is a little tough.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.265
I have my piece of DNA.

00:04:40.265 --> 00:04:42.280
I cut it out.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.772
Here's my piece of DNA,
5 prime to 3 prime,

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:50.090
5 prime to 3 prime.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:03.330
Let's give it a sequence
ATTAAGAATGCAT, et cetera.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.620
DNA sequencing is actually
remarkably cute.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.370
I take a primer just like
Kornberg did back when he was

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.880
discovering polymerase.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.450
Here's my primer, let's say.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.700
Here's my primer.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.980
Here's the matching template.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.660
And what did Kornberg
teaches us?

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.110
He taught us that if we add
polymerase, what will

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.040
polymerase do?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.910
It'll add the right
bases, right?

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.910
TACGTA onward.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.850
If we could look really fast,
maybe we could just

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.190
see it going by.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.390
But we can't look really fast.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.110
If we just add polymerase,
it'll just zip up

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.670
and add all the bases.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.590
But someone had a
clever trick.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.660
The clever trick is this.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.860
Suppose I threw in a smidgen
of defective Ts, Ts that

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.550
couldn't be extended
for some reason?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.310
I'll call that T star.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.640
What happens if a defective
T goes in there?

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.950
Can't be extended anymore.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.930
And what happens then
to my reaction?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.180
It comes to a halt.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.520
Ah, but what happened if
I put in a good T?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.232
Then instead, what would
the next base be?

00:06:55.232 --> 00:06:59.780
A. Then what would happen?

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.470
C, G. Then what's next?

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.460
T. And what would happen if
I put in a defective T?

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.770
It would stop.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.340
Now, maybe instead the defective
T didn't go in.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.220
And it would go on, and the
next T that it encounters,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.480
maybe it would put a
defective T there.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.750
Or maybe it would put
a defective T there.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.520
Now, of course, I just have
a little smidgen of

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.020
defective T, right?

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.650
So which of these will happen?

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.920
Will it sometimes stop
at the first T?

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.160
Sometimes at the second?

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.410
Sometimes at the third?

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.260
I'll actually get a series
of molecules.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.350
What will the lengths of those
molecules tell me?

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.820
Where the Ts are.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.710
Kind of cute.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:21.890
This is very cute.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:29.340
So if I do that reaction, I'll
call that the defective Ts, I

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.260
could see that there is some
molecules, stop here at this

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.150
very small size, some stop here,
some stop here, some

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.890
stop there, some stop there.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.010
And what have I just learned?

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.950
The sizes, the lengths of the
fragments that end in T.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.700
But that's not good.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.352
I also want to know the As.

00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.090
AUDIENCE: Do it with
defective As.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.910
ERIC LANDER: Do it will
defective As, right?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.180
I'll just use defective As.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.520
And then I'll see the
As stop there.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.540
And then I'll do it with
defective Cs, and I'll do it

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.540
with defective Gs.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.570
And I'll see exactly where the
molecules are, the lengths of

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:14.090
the molecules that end
in A, T, C, and G.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.620
And I've just read the
sequence, haven't I?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.180
Pretty cool.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.010
This actually is so cool,
it won a Nobel Prize.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.152
I mean cool usually means won
a Nobel Prize or something

00:09:26.152 --> 00:09:27.980
like that in this class.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.300
So actually, how do
I visualize the

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.520
little letters there?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.780
So the little fragments
on the gel?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.480
I visualize the little
fragments back in

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.076
ancient days, yes?

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:41.992
AUDIENCE: How do you
know [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.518
necessarily be inserted
in every place

00:09:47.518 --> 00:09:48.768
where there is a letter?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.500
ERIC LANDER: I'd make
the right ratio.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.290
I'd choose a ratio of defective
to good Ts.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.510
Like if I choose 1% defective
T's, then about 1% of the

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.920
time, I put in the defective
T it turns out.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.560
It turns out to work OK.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.020
I just put in a smidgen of
defective Ts, like 1%, and 1%

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.260
of the time it stops here, and
1% here, and 1% there.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.670
So and then, of course, to see
them in old days, what people

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.540
did was they made these primers
radioactive, and these

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.050
radioactive primers here within
the gel would be held

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.380
up against a piece of x-ray
film, and you would see where

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.660
little radioactive bands were.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.690
That's how you could visualize
the primers, because it turns

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.460
out you have too little primer
to see it even with my

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.620
fluorescent dye.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.430
But a little radioactivity,
you add radioactivity, you

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.480
take the gel off, you put on a
piece of, I guess you've got

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.690
to wrap it with Saran.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.045
You'd better be standing
behind a shield.

00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:44.060
So you're standing behind a
plastic shield, you reach

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.510
around the shield, you wrap
it with Saran Wrap.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.340
You then put x-ray film on.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.760
You are you doing this
in a dark room.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.980
You then seal it up.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.600
You put it in the freezer
for two weeks.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.210
You take it out.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.050
You develop it.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.380
You get your magic marker, and
you follow where all the

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.160
little bands are.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.410
And that's DNA sequencing.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:03.660
It's cool.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.355
It won a Nobel Prize.

00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:07.160
It's also like really tedious.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.490
So little tricks were done to
speed it up, some nice pieces

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.910
of engineering.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:30.620
Instead of visualizing our DNA,
faster DNA sequencing,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.870
what happens instead?

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.640
What people did, which was very
cool, was they simply

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.390
took the As, Ts, Cs and Gs,
the defective ones, they

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.150
attached a colored
dye to each one.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:51.810
The As were green, and the Ts
were blue and the Gs were red.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.900
Now, when I run it out, I can
do it with fluorescence.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.900
And I can see the Ts all glow
one color, and the As glow

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.750
another color.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.340
Now, it turns out, of course,
if they're glowing four

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.090
different colors, I don't
actually need to run them in

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.330
separate lanes.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.780
I could run them in the
same lane, right?

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:29.950
So I could run them all in a
single lane, and I'd see Ts

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.753
and As, and Gs.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.500
And now, instead of putting this
up against the piece of

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.800
x-ray film, I could do
this in a very thin

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.050
tube called a capillary.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.960
And instead of holding it up to
an x-ray film, I could just

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.210
put a laser detector.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.975
I can turn on the electricity
and watch the fragments go by

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:09.200
and just look at it with
my laser detector.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.890
Shines a light.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.900
I say, oh yeah, green,
red, blue.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.440
That's the sequence.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.020
This made it a lot
easier than that.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.070
I actually got involved in
molecular biology when it was

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.680
still that.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.120
That is a lot better.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.750
By the way, I didn't tell
you what the defective

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.148
Ts were, did I?

00:13:33.148 --> 00:13:36.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:36.284 --> 00:13:37.230
ERIC LANDER: Sorry?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.565
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:38.565 --> 00:13:40.490
ERIC LANDER: Well, they gotta
have something that prevents

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.380
them from being extended,
right?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.920
What prevents them from
being extended?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.710
Do we remember how
DNA is extended?

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.390
We have a sugar phosphate
backbone, right?

00:13:53.390 --> 00:14:04.850
Phosphate, base, 5 prime.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.350
Where do we extend, what base?

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.300
3 prime.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.400
And what do we use
to extend on?

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.670
The 3 prime hydroxyl.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.970
Remember, DNA has no hydroxyl
at its 2 prime position.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:24.220
Its normal DNA is
2 prime deoxy.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.536
How do you think we prevent
it from being extended?

00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.410
AUDIENCE: 2 prime [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.160
ERIC LANDER: 2 prime,
3 prime dideoxy.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:44.700
Defective just means 2 prime,
3 prime dideoxy.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.140
See, we tell you about these
structure not just so you

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.430
memorize structures, but because
those are the tricks

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.580
we use in the trade.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:15:01.260
Now, you get yourself some 2
prime, 3 prime dideoxies.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.690
You put in a smidgen,
maybe 1%.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.020
You run your reaction.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.120
Those dideoxies have dyes,
spelled differently, D-Y-E

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.250
color dyes attached to them.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.190
And you sit there with
your laser detector.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.270
Turns out to be even better.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.270
If you have one capillary,
you could have two.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.670
If you have two, you could have
three, and the machines

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:31.285
that were built around 1999
had 96 capillaries.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.620
I'll call it 100.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:45.060
You could sit there and read
700 bases every hour.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.640
You can do this maybe
20 hours in the day

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.890
because it's automated.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:59.892
You could do this
360 days a year.

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:06.530
And at MIT, we had 100 machines
during the Human

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.710
Genome Project.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:16.980
And if you do the arithmetic, we
could read about 60 billion

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:27.610
bases a year, 60 billion bases
a year during the height of

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.860
the Human Genome Project.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:52.650
Now, this is pretty cool, but
it ain't nothing compared to

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.490
what we're doing
10 years later.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:12.250
Currently, we are doing
60 billion bases every

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:17.039
10 minutes at MIT.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.010
There's a little trick that I'll
tell you about next time

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:29.500
of how DNA sequencing went from
that, where you could do

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.110
about 250 letters a day, when I
first got involved in this,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.420
to that, where at a large
facility like MIT, you could

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.330
do 60 billion letters a day, to
today when you can do about

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.750
60 billion letters
in 10 minutes.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.030
We'll touch on that next time.
