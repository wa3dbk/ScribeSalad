00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.450
We're going to do
a couple of results

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:11.610
with this formula that connect
even a little more with what

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.620
we're doing.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.270
Maybe I'll leave
that blackboard here,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.180
because [INAUDIBLE] simple
formulas come out of this,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.715
which is very nice, actually.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.950
So one simple formula was
that the total cross section--

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.880
we wrote the formula for the
differential cross-section.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.130
But the total cross-section is
the integral of fk of theta,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.710
in this case the omega.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.460
So this is the integral
of fk of theta star

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.760
fk of theta with omega.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.670
But we have fk of theta here.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.200
That 0 looks like
theta, isn't it?

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
That's not good.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.995
That's a 0.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.300
And we can plug all this in.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.130
So what do we have?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.040
We do this because the
answer is very simple.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.330
We get a 4 pi over k squared.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.950
We have a sum over l and l prime
because we have two factors--

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.640
2l plus 1, 2l prime plus 1.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.660
The phase shift for l prime
and the phase shift for l--

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.610
so e to the minus i
delta l sine of delta l.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.050
So I guess I'm using l for this
one and l prime for that one.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:16.340
e to the i delta l prime
sine of delta l prime.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.460
But happily, all that will
not matter, because then you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:29.750
have the integral over solid
angle of yl star 0 of omega

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.160
yl 0 of omega prime here.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.220
Seems like a lot
of work, but we're

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
doing nothing else than
integrating this f of theta.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.810
Let's look at it for a second.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.790
It's just that formula squared.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.290
So basically, you
star the one y.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.670
You don't start the other, but
you have to integrate them.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.500
And there orthonormality
of our spherical harmonics

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.300
means that this
is delta ll prime.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.370
So you can set l
prime equal to l.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.470
These phases will cancel.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.300
This factor will be squared.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.850
This square root will disappear.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.180
And you have a simple formula
that the cross-section

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:38.280
is 4 pi over k squared sum 2l
plus 1 sine squared delta l.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.300
Very nice formula for
a physical observable.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.890
What did you get?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.770
That the cross-section is
the sum of contributions.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.160
The total cross-section
is the sum

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.640
of contributions from
partial cross-sections

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.030
from each partial wave.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.180
That's not true for the
differential cross-section.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.520
Because in the
differential cross-section,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.620
you don't integrate.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.420
And as long as you
don't integrate,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.090
you have mixing
between different l's.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.500
The different partial waves
interfere in the differential

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.339
cross-section, but they
will not interfere anymore

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.570
in the total cross-section.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.260
Each partial wave contributes
to the total cross-section.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.670
That's why it's important to
calculate this phase shift.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.560
So you say, oh, just a phase.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560
Phases don't matter.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.060
No.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.910
The relative phases
matter a lot.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.430
Those are the phases
that enter here,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.500
and the cross-section
is expressed

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.730
in terms of those phases.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.350
There's one more result
that is famous in scattering

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.900
and has to do with
the optical theorem.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.460
The optical theorem
is something you

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.180
may have seen already
in electromagnetism

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.190
or in other fields.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.710
It's a statement
about probability

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.520
of conservation of flux.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.740
And it's fairly non-trivial,
and it's a constraint

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.320
on the scattering amplitude.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.290
Basically-- and we may
discuss it in a problem.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.480
It's the statement that
when you have an object,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.490
the thing that you detect as
the scattering cross-section

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.020
is all these particles that
were deflected from the object.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.410
And they were deflected
from the object

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.050
because the object
creates a shadow.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.790
At least in the
electromagnetism,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.100
that intuition is very clear.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.330
You have a sphere here,
maybe a conducting sphere,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.100
an observancy.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.040
You shine light.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.660
You create the shadow.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.250
And that is the light that
if you didn't have here,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.690
it would have gone through.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.840
But if it's here, the
shadow is responsible.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.860
What you lost from the shadow
is what you got scattered.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.440
So whatever you get--

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.040
in the forward direction
here, you get nothing--

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.430
you get a shadow--

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.400
carries the information about
the wave that scattered.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.230
It's a little more complicated
than that mathematically

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.750
when you do it, because
the total wave function

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.440
in the forward direction
is a combination

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.570
of the incoming
wave function that

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.780
has some forward direction and
the scattered wave function

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.920
that has a forward direction.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.870
So the theorem is quite
interesting to prove,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.430
and we prove it with
flux conservation

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.710
that gives you enormous
insight into the physics.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:01.110
But here is the power of algebra
and the power of phase shifts.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.700
You don't have to be brilliant
to discover the optical theorem

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.140
in this setup.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.690
The physics has already done--

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.590
the mathematics
of the phase shift

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.830
has already done all
the work for you.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.292
Let's see it happen.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.300
Let's figure out how
does the forward--

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.650
the scattering cross-section
look in the forward direction.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.570
So you have your object here.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.160
You send in your waves.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.800
They get scattered.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.410
But there is something
in the forward direction.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:49.852
That is fk at theta equals
0 is the forward scattering,

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.540
the word "scattering."

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.990
And now this forward
scattering is--

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.490
we can calculate it.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:11.650
For that, we need to know
that yl 0 of theta equals 0--

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:20.990
well, yl 0 of theta
is actually 2l

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:26.930
plus 1 over 4 pi pl,
the Legendre polynomial

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.180
of cosine theta.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:37.820
So yl 0 at theta equals 0
is just square root of 2l

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.090
plus 1 over 4 pi.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:47.660
And the Legendre polynomials are
defined always so that pl at 1

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.010
is equal to 1.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:56.820
All pl's at x equals
1 are always 1.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.140
So that's the spherical harmonic
in the forward direction.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.320
So you have here from that
formula on the right 4 pi

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.660
over k sum from l equals 0.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.340
This is an investigation
of what happens

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.830
to the forward
scattering amplitude.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:21.650
The yl 0 gives you another
square root of 2l plus 1

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:27.570
and a square root
of 4 pi as well.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.665
And then you get e to
the i delta l sine delta.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:48.670
So look here, here, and
these factors simplify.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:10:01.870
So fk of theta equals 0 is 1
over k sum of l 2l plus 1 e

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.450
to the i delta sine delta.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.500
That's a nice formula.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.330
Maybe something-- it has
to do with a cross-section.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:18.400
f in this forward
direction has that formula,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.855
and the cross-section
has this formula.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.160
So how do I get to relate them?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:41.490
I get to relate
them if I set now--

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.450
I ask for the imaginary
part of this fk.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:52.460
Because the imaginary part
of this fk at theta equals 0

00:10:52.460 --> 00:11:01.410
is equal to 1 over k sum
over l, this 2l plus 1.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.540
And the imaginary part of
that turns it into sine

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.510
squared delta, because the
imaginary part of the e to i

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.760
delta is sine delta.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.010
So I get the sine
squared delta there.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.690
And you say, look at this sum.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.930
It's identical to the
sum of the cross-section.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:26.750
You have discovered a relation
between the total cross-section

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:33.390
and the imaginary part of the
forward scattering amplitude.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.860
So what is the final formula?

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.540
The final formula
is that sigma--

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.550
maybe I can do it here.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.600
Sigma is equal to--

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.010
well, it differs at
least from a 4 pi

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:15.860
over k imaginary part of f of
theta equals 0, fk of theta.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:27.150
This is the optical
theorem, which

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.210
was discovered in
the context of optics

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.350
by thinking of the
physics of shadows.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.740
Whatever-- basically, the
shadow contains all that kind

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.840
of information
about all that was

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.690
lost from the incoming beam.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.580
So that's a nice--

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.300
it's not absolutely
obvious how it

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.700
works, the process
of interference

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.120
between the incoming wave
and the scattered wave

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.370
and what they do.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.540
And you have to look
carefully at this thing.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.420
So that explains why you
need the imaginary part

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.340
and why these factors show up.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.901
But the intuition is
nevertheless simple.
