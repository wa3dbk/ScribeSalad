00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.270
PROFESSOR: Let us consider the
anharmonic oscillator, which

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.940
means that you're taking the
unperturbed Hamiltonian to be

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.710
the harmonic oscillator.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.600
And now, you want to
add an extra term that

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.900
will make this anharmonic.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.300
Anharmonic reflects the fact
that the perturbations are

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.200
oscillations of the system
are not exactly harmonic.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.190
And in the harmonic oscillator,
the energy difference

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.374
between levels is
always the same.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.240
That's a beautiful property
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.140
That stops happening in
an anharmonic oscillator.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.150
The energy differences can vary.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.490
So the things, if you have
a transition from one level,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.090
first level to the ground state,
or second level to the ground

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.450
state, one is not the
harmonic of the other

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.740
because they're not exactly
twice as big as each other.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:19.280
So let's try to add an x to
the 4th perturbation, which

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.320
is intuitively very clear.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.840
You have a potential.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.870
And you're adding
now an extra piece

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.960
that behaves like x to the 4th.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.310
And it's going to make this
potential blow up faster.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.600
Now, in order to
get the units right,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.280
we need the length scale.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:53.080
There's a length scale d
in the harmonic oscillator.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.050
We're going to use it.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.360
One way to derive
that length scale is

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.210
to recall from units that p,
a momentum, has units of h

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.530
divided by length.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.789
So b squared has units of
h squared over d squared.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.870
There's an m.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.640
So that's an energy.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.610
And this is an energy too.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.100
So we can set it equal to
m omega squared d squared.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.850
From where we get, for
example, as 1 over d to the 4th

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.890
is equal to m squared omega
squared over h squared.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.630
And d squared is equal
to h over m omega.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.060
So that's a length
scale, something

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.960
with units of length in
the harmonic oscillator.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.700
So if we want to add
the perturbation that

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.640
is x to the 4th, we'll
add a lambda delta

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.030
H that is going to
be a lambda, which

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.070
is unit freedom, something
that has units of energy.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.710
So you can put h bar
mega has units of energy.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.410
And then you can
put the operator x

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.860
to the 4th divided
by d to the 4th.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.310
It's a perturbation
with units of energy.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.900
This is good.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.570
So there's a couple of
ways of thinking of it.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.560
You may remember that in
the harmonic oscillator

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.070
x, the operator x, was given
by the square root of h

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.855
over 2m omega, a plus a dagger.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:06.450
So this is d times a plus a
dagger over square root of 2.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.790
So this perturbation lambda
delta H is equal to lambda.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.769
H bar omega would be here.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.050
H bar omega.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.210
Now x/d is this a plus a dagger
divided by square root of 2.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.750
So you have a 4a plus
a dagger to the 4th.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:47.060
So that's lambda delta H.
That's your perturbation.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.830
So what do we want to do
with this perturbation?

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.710
It's a nice perturbation.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.840
We want to compute
the corrections

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.290
to the energy,
corrections to the states,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.075
and see how they go.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.115
We can do that easily.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.340
Let's compute first that
corrections to the ground state

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.080
energy.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.340
These are calculations
that are not difficult,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.440
but they take some care.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.900
As any calculation,
it's based on just

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.010
getting a lot of numbers right.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.790
So what is the ground
state energy correction?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.250
So we had a series of
formulas that I just erased.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.730
But this index k0
for our state, we

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.080
can think of k as being the
eigenvalue of the number

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.960
operator.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.760
So we'll get n.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.540
And remember in the
harmonic oscillator,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.440
we label states by 0, 1, 2, 3.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.150
And that's the eigenvalue
of the number operator

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.810
in the harmonic oscillator.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.720
So the ground state energy
would correspond to 0,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.000
has a first order
correction that

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.030
would be given by the
unperturbed ground state

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.660
and delta H 0.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.240
So what is that?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.790
Delta H is h omega over 4.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:54.330
And we have 0 a plus
a dagger to the 4th 0.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.350
Easy enough.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.750
That's what we have to do.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.410
Now, the evaluation
of that matrix element

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.770
is a simple exercise,
the kind of things

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.840
you've been doing before.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.490
You have to expand and just
use the aa dagger computation

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.435
relation that this aa
dagger is equal to 1.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.360
You said repeatedly
a kills the vacuum.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.000
a dagger kills the other
vacuum on the left.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.620
Please do it.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.840
If you feel you're
out of practice,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.110
the answer is the number 3 here.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:42.875
So e01 is equal to
3/4 h bar omega.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.170
So how does that
tell you anything?

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.750
Well, better use
the full formula.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:08:01.480
So e0 of lambda is supposed to
be equal to the ground state

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.670
energy unperturbed,
which was h omega over 2

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.360
plus lambda times the first
order correction, which

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:19.200
is 3/4 h bar omega plus
order lambda squared.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.530
So e0 of lambda
is h omega over 2,

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:31.210
1 plus 3/2 lambda plus
order lambda squared.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.370
That's what we got.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.890
And that makes nice sense.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:40.049
Your ground state energy you
knew used to be h omega over 2.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:42.730
If you introduce
this perturbation,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.960
you don't expect it
to jump abruptly.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.790
It's going to grow
up with the lambda

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.790
to the 4th term with the
x to the 4th term into 3/2

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.330
lambda here, a small correction.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.730
So far, so good.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.540
What takes a bit more work
is doing a higher order

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.380
correction.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.430
So let's do the
next one as well.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.810
So for this second order
correction, we have a formula.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.090
And let's see what it tells us.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.885
It tells us that the second
order correction to the energy

00:09:30.885 --> 00:09:36.880
is minus the sum over all states
that are not the ground states.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.360
So it's k different from 0.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.250
That's good enough.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:49.860
Delta H 0k squared
over Ek0 minus e00.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.900
So potentially, it's
an infinite sum.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.750
And that's the kind of thing
that is sometimes difficult.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.420
In many examples, you
have infinite sums.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.350
Sometimes you can
do an approximation,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.180
say a few terms is
all you need to do.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.350
But in this case,
happily, it's not

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.700
going to be an infinite sum.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.310
So what do we have?

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.680
Delta H0k is what we
need to calculate.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.040
The energy differences, we know.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.740
These are the unperturbed
harmonic oscillator energy

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.730
differences.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:43.560
What we need is this object,
which is h bar omega over 4.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.560
Remember, what is delta H there
in that box formula there.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:11:00.395
And we have 0 a plus a
dagger to the 4th K, where

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:03.800
K is a state with number K.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.600
If you wish, you could
say K is a dagger

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.000
to the K over square root of K
factorial acting on the ground

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.500
state.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.560
But sometimes you
don't need that.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:25.120
You actually don't need
to put the value of K.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.935
So our challenge here is to
see which values of K exist.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:37.820
For that, you can
think of this part

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.440
of the term, the a plus a
dagger to the 4th acting

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.760
on the vacuum.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.750
This is like, in
a sense, this term

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.560
is nothing else but in saying
what happens to the wave

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.950
function when you
multiply it by x to the 4,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.780
to the ground state
wave function.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.620
That's physically what
you're doing here.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.980
You're multiplying an x to
the 4th times the ground

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.720
state wave function.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.130
So it should give you
an even wave function.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.930
So you would expect that x
to the 4th multiplied by 5 0

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:26.400
should be proportional to 5
0, but maybe 5 2 and 5 4th.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.620
Should not have the odd ones
because this function is not

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.120
odd.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.760
It's even.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.260
So as you express x to the 4th
5 0 in terms of the other ones,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.670
it should be that.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.350
So indeed, again, I ask you
to do a little computation.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:53.535
If you do 0 a plus a dagger
to the 4th, this is equal to--

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.860
you can show.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.550
It gives you 4 factorial
square root the state 4

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:10.350
plus 6 square root of
2 times the state 2

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.230
plus 3 times times
the ground state.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.840
OK.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:30.860
So we have that look
let's continue therefore.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.280
Given that [INAUDIBLE] has
given us three states--

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.850
one proportional to the
vacuum, one proportional

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.380
to the state with occupation
number 2, and one with a state

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.170
of occupation number four--

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.840
the values of k
that are relevant,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:06.600
since k is different
from 0, are only 2 and 4.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.890
0 doesn't matter.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.200
And only 2 and 4
can couple here.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.240
So what do we get?

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:20.650
Delta H0 4 would be, from
this formula, h omega

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.570
over 4 times this inner
product when k is equal to 4.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:31.940
So you get here square
root of 4 factorial,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:38.130
which is h omega over 2
times square root of 6.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:46.290
Delta H02 is equal
to h omega over 4.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.230
And the overlap of
this state with 2,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.260
which is 6 square root of 2.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.490
So this is h omega 3
square root of 2/2.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.590
OK.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.140
So that's your first step.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.180
When you have to
compute a perturbation,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.650
you have to compute all the
relevant matrix elements.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.290
And you have to think
what you can get.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.680
And only k equal 2
and 4 happen, so this

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.780
is the sum of two terms.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.490
So the second order
correction to the energy

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:31.110
is minus delta H0 2
squared divided by E2 0

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:44.310
minus E0 0 minus delta H0 4
squared over E4 0 minus E0 0.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.270
So what is this?

00:15:52.270 --> 00:16:02.210
It's minus delta H0 2 squared
is h bar omega squared.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.470
9 times 2/4.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.380
9 times 2/4.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.540
And you divide by
this difference.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:16.230
And the difference between
E2 and E0 is 2 h bar omega.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.010
There's an h bar omega
difference every state.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:23.040
So you go from E0 to
E1 to E2, two of them.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:36.490
Minus delta H0 4 squared, which
is H omega squared times 6/4

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.880
over 4 h bar omega.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.465
Well, this gives you
minus 21/8 h bar omega.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.740
And therefore, the
energy, this is the E0 2,

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:05.560
so you can go back here
and write E0 lambda is

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.619
equal to H omega over 2.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.220
1 plus 3/2 lambda.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.109
And then the next term
that we now calculated

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:20.859
is 21/4 lambda squared.

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.819
Very good.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.990
We work hard.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.859
We have lambda squared
correction to this energy.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.930
Now, this is not really trivial.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.310
There's no analytic way
to solve this problem.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:37.190
Nobody knows an analytic
way to solve this problem.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:43.540
So this is a nice
result. It's so famous

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.080
the problem that people have
written hundreds of papers

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.870
on this.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.730
The first people that did
a very detailed analysis

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.320
was Bender and Wu.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:04.170
And they computed probably
100 terms in the series or so.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:12.220
The next term turns out
to be 333/8 lambda cube.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:23.060
Followed by 30,855/64 lambda
to the 4th plus ordered lambda

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.840
to 5th.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:36.060
Funnily, these people also
proved that this series

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.180
has no radius of convergence.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.400
It never converges.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.060
It just doesn't converge at all.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.310
You would say, oh,
what a waste of time.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:52.950
No, it's an asymptotic
expansion, this series.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.760
So it can be used.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.140
So it's a very funny thing.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.810
Series sometimes don't
converge so well.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:10.340
And this one is a peculiarly
non-convergent series.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.660
So what does it mean only that
it's an asymptotic expansion?

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.010
Basically, the expansion
for the factorial

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.890
that you use in statistical
mechanics all the time,

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.330
Sterling's expansion, is
an asymptotic expansion.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.950
Quantum electro dynamics
with Feynman rules

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.070
is an asymptotic expansion.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:39.140
Very few things actually
converge in physics.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.720
That's the nature of things.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.330
What it means is that
when you take lambda,

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.730
for example, to be 1 in 1,000,
a very small number, then

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.870
this is 1.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.290
This will be very small.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.650
This will still be small.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.700
This will be small.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.150
And eventually, the terms go
smaller, smaller, smaller,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.970
smaller, smaller, smaller.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:06.030
And eventually,
start going up again.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.420
And if you have an
asymptotic expansion,

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.940
you're supposed to
stop adding terms

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.770
until they become the smallest.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.730
And that will be a good
approximation to your function.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.350
So this can be used.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.330
You can use it.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.550
You can do numerical
work with the states

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.220
and compare with
asymptotic expansion.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.530
And it's a very nice thing.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.570
Another thing is that you can
compute the first correction

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.580
to the state.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.470
I will leave that
as an exercise.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.520
And in the notes, you
will find the expression

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.920
of the first correction
to this state.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.190
It's not much work
because, after all, it

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.920
involves just this kind
of matrix elements.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.060
So it's basically using
the matrix elements

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.630
to write something else.
