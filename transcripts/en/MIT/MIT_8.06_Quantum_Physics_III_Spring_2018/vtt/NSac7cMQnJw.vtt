00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.910
PROFESSOR: The story
begins with a statement

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.222
that we will verify to some
degree in the homework that

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:17.450
is due on Wednesday
of vector operators.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.135
This operator Sz,
the one-line summary

00:00:23.135 --> 00:00:27.680
is that this
operator is a vector

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.770
operator under
angular momentum--

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.090
under the total
angular momentum.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.650
And as such, its matrix
elements will behave

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.910
like the matrix elements of Jz.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.630
So how is that true?

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:58.650
What does it mean to say that
S is a vector operator under J?

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.550
It is to say that for
J, S is like a vector.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.610
And that is a concrete
statement that you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.000
should check whether it's true.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.525
The statement is that Ji Sj--

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.900
here, this i and j
run from 1 to 3--

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.890
is equal to ih bar
epsilon ijk Sk.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.610
That is the statement that
S is a vector operator.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.880
You may have seen this
in a previous course,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.690
in 805, where you might have
proven that X and P are vector

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:05.440
operators for L.
And here, the proof

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.920
is not all that
difficult. In fact,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.260
it's almost obvious
this is true, isn't it?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.802
Ji is Li plus Si.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:20.040
Li doesn't talk to Sj.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.810
But Si with Sj satisfy the
algebra of angular momentum

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.270
that is precisely this one.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.360
So this is almost
no calculation.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.940
You will check-- you'll
remind yourself--

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.250
that if you have a
vector, that L-- for L--

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.720
X and P are vector operators.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:51.100
So for example, Li Pj is
ih bar epsilon ijk Pk.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.820
And this, you do by
calculating the commutator.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.160
But after you calculate
the commutator a few times,

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.600
it's better to just remember,
oh, it's a vector operator.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.680
That's a good way of
thinking about this.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.370
OK.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.500
If you have vector
operators, they

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.000
have very peculiar
properties sometimes.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.540
One that may sound a
little unmotivated,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.730
but it's very useful,
is the following.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:32.960
Suppose you form the double
commutator of J squared

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.310
with the vector operator S.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.380
Here, you will find an identity.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.600
And to make it fun for
you, I will not tell you

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.260
the number that appears here.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.320
It's some number.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.260
But with some
number here, this is

00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:02.880
identical to the following
SJ times J minus 1/2

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.600
J squared S plus SJ squared.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.420
Well, it's important to
look at this equation,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.120
even to make sure
everything is in order.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.430
This is a vector equation,
so it's three equations.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.770
So J squared, despite all
this arrow, is a scalar,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.070
has no indices.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.380
It's J1 squared plus J2
squared plus J3 squared.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.920
S, on the other hand, has
an arrow, and it's a vector.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.780
So you could look
at this equation

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.450
for the third component,
for the first component,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.870
for the second.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.480
So here is a vector,
the three things.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.760
Here is also a vector.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.020
It's S dot J and J.
So the vector index

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.960
is carried by the J here.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.790
The vector index is
carried by S here--

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:04.850
once to the left of J squared,
once to the right of J squared.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.050
Also, maybe you
should notice that SJ

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.050
is the same thing as JS, not
because these operators commute

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.490
but because SX and JX commute.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.560
Sy and Jy commute.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.460
And Sz and Jz commute.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.500
Different components
would not commute.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.230
But here, these ones do commute.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:38.610
So this is a formula you
will show by computation.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.990
I don't think there's a simple
way to derive this formula.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.780
But it's true and
false by computation.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.460
This formula implies a
result that is quite pretty.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.990
It's sometimes called
a projection lemma.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.690
So all we're doing is trying
to compute a matrix element,

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.080
and we're forced to
consider a lot of structure.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.660
We're just trying to
show this simple matrix

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.580
element, with an Sz here,
is proportional to mj.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.270
This is our goal.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.700
And we're going to do that.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.120
So suppose you take that
interesting equation

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.260
and find its expectation
value on a state that

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.930
is an eigenstate of j.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:49.320
So suppose you take a j mj and
put this whole equation inside

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.230
this-- left-hand side,
then right-hand side--

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.030
a state that is an
eigenstate of j.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.540
Now, that state may be an
eigenstate of other operators,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.940
as well.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.910
It doesn't matter.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.985
Now, look at your
left-hand side.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.940
It's a commutator.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.320
You have a j squared on
the left, a commutator

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.760
on the right minus
commutator on the left, j

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.490
squared on the right.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.070
In both cases, there will be
either a j squared near the bra

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.530
or a j squared near the ket.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.980
Those two terms come
with opposite signs.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.720
Since those are eigenstates with
the same eigenvalues, that's

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.210
what we're doing-- an
expectation value here,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.970
the left-hand side is 0.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.700
So the left-hand side
contributes nothing.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:57.930
So left-hand side is
0, on this thing, is 0.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.570
And let's look at
the right-hand side.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:14.960
It's equal to j mj S
dot J J jmj and minus--

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.730
so that was the first term.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:28.940
Now, we have to compute this
thing on this Jm Jm state.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.360
Again, a J squared is either
to the left or to the right.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.320
Therefore, this
gives a number which

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.809
is h squared j times j plus 1.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.500
This gives the same number,
as I showed you, on the bra.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.970
You have two terms.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.190
The factor of 1/2 cancels.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.210
And you're left just with the
expectation value of S, which

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.090
is kind of what we wanted here.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.440
So this is minus h
squared j times j

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.880
plus 1, which is the
expectation value of J

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:12.270
squared times the expectation
value jmj of S on the jmj.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.640
OK.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.040
You have this term minus
that term equal to 0.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.470
So what have we learned?

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:31.110
We have learned that this term
that we can call expectation

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:37.740
value of S vector
on a j eigenstate

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.420
is equal to the expectation
value of this quantity,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:54.770
S dot J J on the eigenstate
divided by this number, which

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.470
turns out to be the
expectation value of J

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.850
squared on that eigenstate.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:07.460
This formula looks like a
projection formula in which you

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.930
say the expectation value
of S is the expectation

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.970
value of the projection of
the vectored S onto the vector

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:25.430
J. Remember, if you have,
for example, projection

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:32.890
of a vector a into
a unit vector n,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:39.940
what is the projection of a
vector a into a unit vector n?

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:45.660
Well, the projection
is a dot n times n.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:51.000
That's the component of
a along the vector n.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.430
But if n is not a unit vector,
the projection of a along b

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:06.675
is a dot b times
b over b squared.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.770
Because, in fact, the
projection along a vector

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.270
or along a unit vector
is the same thing.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.980
It's just a projection.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.290
And here, you have unit vectors.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.800
So this is the projection lemma.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.400
It's a very nice result--

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.030
pretty striking, in fact.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:42.510
This result is also
mentioned in Griffiths.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.160
It doesn't give a derivation of
this result. It's just quoted.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.210
But it's a beautiful
and important result.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.160
It's conceptually interesting.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.040
It's valid for any
vector operator under J.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.850
And this will
answer our question.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.760
Because now, we can
use this formula

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.250
to compute the matrix element.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.010
So what do we have for our case?

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:25.670
We have that nljmj
Sz nljmj is what?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:31.820
Well, we have the expectation
value of Jz on this state.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:39.310
So it's going to
be h bar mj over h

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.100
squared j times j plus 1.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.950
That's the denominator.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.600
And you still have here what
may look like a small challenge,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.710
or a big challenge--

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.830
happily, it's a small challenge.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.550
S dot L mljmj.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:14.770
Here, this is called
the scalar operator.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.770
This is a variant
on the rotations.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.280
And scalar operators
are independent of mj.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.090
We got the mj dependence here.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.270
We want to claim
that this expectation

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.220
value is proportional to mj.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.420
And we have the result here,
unless there is mj dependence

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.300
here.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.520
But there is no mj dependence
here because, as I said,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:45.900
this has to do with the fact
that this is a scalar operator.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:51.110
So let's calculate this part to
finish this whole computation.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.410
How do you do that?

00:13:52.410 --> 00:14:05.130
Well, you have to remember
you have J equal to L plus S.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:12.780
So in here, we'll
do the following.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.640
I'm sorry.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.380
I had the confusion here.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.946
S dot J-- it's S dot J here.

00:14:19.946 --> 00:14:23.840
It's starting to look wrong.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.930
So I mean the dot
product of J and S.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:34.060
So here, I'll take l
equals to J minus S.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.290
And L squared is equal to
J squared plus S squared

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:44.030
minus 2S dot J.
Here, it's important

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:50.120
that S dot J and J
dot S are the same.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:15:00.080
And therefore, this S dot J is
1/2 of J squared plus S squared

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.670
minus L squared.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.680
So with S dot J being
this, you see immediately

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.950
what is this number.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:18.810
This is h bar mj h
squared j times j plus 1.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:26.280
And now, 1/2-- so I have a 1/2
here, I'll put it in front--

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.570
J squared-- so this
is j times j plus 1,

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:35.570
there's an h squared
that's in addition--

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:42.065
h squared here--
j times j plus 1

00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:46.040
S squared, which
is 3/4, for it's

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:52.290
been 1/2, minus L squared,
which is minus l times l plus 1.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.520
OK, almost there.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.380
Wow, this takes time.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:14.270
But we have a result.
So what is the result?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:23.930
The matrix element nljmj lz--

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:29.390
oops, I'll put the whole
thing together-- lz plus 2Sz--

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.300
back to the whole
matrix element.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.115
Remember, we had one piece--

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.140
hmj and, now, this part.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.270
So adding the hmj
to this new part,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:53.300
we have hmj 1 plus j times
j plus 1 minus l times l

00:16:53.300 --> 00:17:01.520
plus 1 plus 3/4 over
2j times j plus 1.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.690
Phew.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:04.460
OK.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:04.970
I'm sorry.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.099
It's all here.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.690
I just copied that term,
hopefully without mistakes.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.660
So we have our matrix element.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.569
And that matrix element
in the top blackboard

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.720
there gives us the splitting.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.470
It's probably a good time
to introduce notation.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.830
And there's a
notation here where

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:34.560
this is called g sub J of l.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.130
And it's called
the Landé g-factor.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:50.710
It's a g-factor in the sense
that affects the energy

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.430
levels as if you were
modifying the magnetic moment

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.080
of the particle.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.670
So this number tells
you how the level split.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.940
They split proportional to mj--

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.450
all the various levels.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.410
And for the full
multiplate, the multiplate

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.770
is an eigenstate of j
and an eigenstate of l.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.740
So throughout all the
states in the multiplate,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.690
this is a single number.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.620
And just, you have the hmj.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.030
End result is the
weak Zeeman splitting

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:36.550
nljm is eh bar over 2mc times
B times gJ of l times mj.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.430
And this number is
about 579 times 10

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.640
to the minus 9 eV per Gauss.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.240
It's small.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:58.970
So wow.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.320
It took us some effort.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.070
But here we are.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:09.790
We have the weak-field Zeeman
splitting completely computed.
