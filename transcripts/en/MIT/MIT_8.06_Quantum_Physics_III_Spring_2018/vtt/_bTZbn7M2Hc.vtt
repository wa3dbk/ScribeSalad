00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:01.880
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.850
So let's get now the state n1.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.570
So I want to make
a general remark.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.655
You have an equation like this.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.980
And you want to solve it.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.880
It's a vector equation.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.430
Operator and a vector
equal number and a vector--

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.450
a more operator and a vector.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.320
To make sure you
have solved it, when

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.480
you have a vector equation
you must make sure

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.720
that every component-- you
can write a vector equation

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.670
in the form vector equals zero.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
And then you must make sure that
every component of the vector

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.650
is zero.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.890
What we did here
is we found what

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.680
happens when I look at
the component along n0.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.620
And I figure out that,
whoops, this equation,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.530
when I look at the
component along n0,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.140
tells me what the energy is.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.560
So the rest of the
information of this equation

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.090
arises when I look at
it along the components

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.940
on the other states, not n0 but
the k states that we introduced

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.950
from the beginning, the k0's
that run from one to infinity.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.660
So what we're
going to do is take

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.960
that original--
this second equation

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:54.040
and form k0 h0 minus Em0 m1 1
is equal to k0 Em1 minus delta H

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.540
n0.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.860
So I now took the same equation
and I put it in a problem

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.790
with k0.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.400
And I say, look, k
will be different

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.300
from n, because
when we put k equal

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.760
to n that already we've done.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.250
And we've learned all about it.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.760
And, in fact, n1 didn't appear.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.490
The state that we wanted
didn't appear at all.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.340
So now we do this
with arbitrary k.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.170
And we need to figure
out what this gives.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.170
So you have to look
at these things

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.410
and try to remember a little
of the definitions with both.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.090
So h0, we know what
it gives from k0.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.040
It gives you a number,
the energy of that state.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.410
So this is another number.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.300
So that's great.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:03.810
This simplifies this
to ek0 minus En0

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.375
times the overlap of k0 with n1.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.150
That's the left hand side.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.595
How about the right hand side?

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.160
All right.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.480
Let's see what this is.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.500
First term.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.620
The En1 is a number,
so I must ask

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.930
myself is what happens
when k0 meets n0?

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.980
Well, those are our
original orthonormal states.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.040
And we said that k
is different from n.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.850
So this term is 0 with an En1.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.960
This is a number.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.220
And these two states
are orthogonal.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.040
So this term gives you a 0,
not because this number is 0,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.700
but because the overlap is 0.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.820
And I get here
minus k0 delta H n0.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.030
And it's good
notation to call this,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:24.560
to save writing, delta Hkn
It's a good name for it.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.960
It's the matrix k--

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:35.610
the kn-th element of the matrix
delta H. And this is a number

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:44.520
so I can solve k0 n1
is equal to minus delta

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.580
Hkn divided by Ek0 minus En0.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.990
And this is true for
every k different for n.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.275
And here we find, for the first
time, our energy denominators.

00:05:04.275 --> 00:05:06.950
These energy denominators
are the things

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.080
that are going to make life
interesting and difficult.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.870
And it answers the
question already

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.710
that if you had
degenerate states,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.890
there would be some
k state that have

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.250
the same energy as this one.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.090
And this blows up.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.870
And this is unsolvable
for this component.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.810
So you start
getting difficulties

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.210
if you have degeneracies.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.090
As long as every k state--

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.580
all the other states
of the spectrum

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.000
have different energy from En,
nevermind if the other states

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.630
are degenerate.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.820
They're not degenerate
with the state you care.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.530
You care just about one
state now, the n-th state.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.840
And if that's nondegenerate, all
these denominators are non-zero

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.600
and you're OK.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.660
So here is the solution
for this thing.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:18.470
Now I can write the expressions
for the state and the energy.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.500
So let me do it.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.730
So I have this n1 like that.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.820
Now you can say the following.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.500
Let me do this very
deliberately first.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:41.400
n1 is equal to the sum
over all k of k0 k0 n1.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.580
This is the resolution
of the identity formula.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.360
That's the unit operator.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.220
You can always do that.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:03.780
And now you know that the
state n1 is orthogonal to n0.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.660
So this becomes the sum
over k different from n,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:22.120
because for k equal to n, these
are orthogonal of k0 k0 n1.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.090
And that's what we
calculated here.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.170
So what did we get?

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:45.760
Therefore, the state n1, I can
substitute what we had there.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:08:02.570
It's the sum from k different
from n of k0 delta Hnk over Ek0

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.520
minus En0.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:07.970
That's n1.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.550
I should have a minus sign.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.200
The minus sign is
there at the state n1.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.460
So the state n1 is a
complicated correction.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.990
It gets a little component
from every other state

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.610
of the spectrum.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.380
And the coefficient depends
on the matrix element

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.919
of your state with the state
you're contributing with.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.660
So you have the state n and
all the other states here.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.430
The amount of this state k
that enters into the correction

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:55.930
is proportional to the matrix
element between n and k.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.350
If the matrix element is 0, that
state does not contribute here.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.610
And then there is the
energy denominator as well.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.910
So we're getting to the
end of this calculation.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:14.620
There's one more thing one
can do, which is to find--

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.070
so I'm starting to
wrap up this, but still

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.900
an important step
what we have to do.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.500
I'll get the second
order energy correction.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.040
What is our second
order energy correction?

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.480
Our second order
energy correction

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.345
can be found from the formula
on that blackboard, En2.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.170
We already found the first
order energy correction,

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.560
which I happened to have
erased it right now.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.550
It was there.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:10:00.500
En2 is obtained by doing
n0 delta H times n1, which

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.350
we already know.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.740
So I must do n0 delta H on that.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.120
So look what you get.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.540
You get minus the sum
over k different from n.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:23.020
Think of putting the n0 and the
delta H, they're all together.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.100
It's a [INAUDIBLE] so far.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.750
It's a delta H and n0.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.520
IT should go into n1.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.160
But the only state in n1 is k0.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.020
So here we have k0.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:44.930
And then we have delta
Hnk over Ek0 minus En0.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.920
OK.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.290
A little bit of work.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.436
So what is this?

00:10:52.436 --> 00:10:58.930
This is another matrix element.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.370
This is the matrix--

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.300
OK.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.080
I'm sorry.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.540
Here do I have a mistake?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.860
Oh, yes, I have kn.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.460
I copied it wrong.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.650
It's kn.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.110
Yes.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.370
Yes.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:24.910
So here I have delta Hnk.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:32.740
but delta Hnk is this.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.220
If you complex conjugate--

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.690
if you complex
conjugate delta Hkn,

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:49.810
complex conjugate is k
delta H n complex conjugate,

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.790
which changes the order.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:57.600
n delta H, which
is her mission k.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.480
And that's delta Hnk.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:08.240
So delta Hnk is equal
to delta Hkn star.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.480
And therefore the second
order energy correction

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.330
has a nice formula.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:25.730
En2 is equal to minus the
sum over k different from n.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:31.160
Delta Hnk, which is the
star of that times this one,

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:39.825
so you get delta Hnk absolute
value squared divided by Ekn.

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.510
Ek0 minus En0.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.090
So we've done a lot of work.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.330
We've written the perturbation.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.730
Here is the answer.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:09.220
So far we have n of lambda
equal n0 plus lambda n1.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.520
n1 has been calculated.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.360
Energy is En0 plus lambda En1.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.640
That was calculated
what was just

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:26.320
delta H in this state
plus lambda squared

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.840
En2, which we have calculated.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.800
So this is as far as we will do
for nondegenerate perturbation

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.300
theory.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.750
But we have found rather
interesting formulas.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.870
And we're going to spend
half of its lecture trying

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.380
to understand them better.
