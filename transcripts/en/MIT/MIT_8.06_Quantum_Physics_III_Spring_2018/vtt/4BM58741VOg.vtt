00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:11.070
PROFESSOR: So,
WKB approximation,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.370
or semiclassical approximation.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.580
So this is work due
to three people--

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.810
Wentzel, Kramers,
and Brillouin--

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.080
in that incredible year,
1926, where so much of quantum

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.760
mechanics was figured out.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.390
As it turns with many
of these discoveries,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.900
once the discoveries were
made, people figured out

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.720
that somebody did them before.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.860
And that person was a
mathematician, Jeffreys,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.070
who did it three years
earlier, in 1923.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.710
The work had not
become very popular.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.440
So some people write JWKB.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.170
But we will not do that.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.290
We'll note Jeffreys, but
we'll follow this more

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.290
standard notation.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.220
So these people were dealing
with differential equations

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.790
with slowly-varying
spatial coefficients.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.740
That was the main thing.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.260
So we're continuing our
approximation methods.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.700
We've done perturbation theory.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.090
We will add little pieces
to the Hamiltonian.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.020
Now we consider things that
are slowly varying in space.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.090
You might have a very
simple Hamiltonian

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.100
where nothing varies in space--

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.200
a constant potential.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
But as soon as the potential
starts varying slowly,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.610
you have approximation methods.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.480
Those are the methods
we're considering now.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.180
We will also
consider, after we've

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.070
finished WKB, time-dependent
perturbation theory, where

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.930
still things start
slowly varying in time.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.910
So we'll have many,
many things to do still.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.110
So this is called, also, the
semiclassical approximation.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.450
Because classical physics gives
you intuition about the quantum

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.190
wave function.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.480
So it is a lesson in which
you want to learn something

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.210
about the quantum wave
function, and you learn it

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.300
by using classical physics.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.720
A quantity that is relevant
here is that the Broglie

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.050
wavelength of a particle.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.640
This is the Broglie.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.270
And many people say that
semiclassical approximation

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.520
has to do with the fact that
the quantum mechanic effects are

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.270
not that important.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.110
That may happen.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.770
The Broglie wavelength
is much smaller

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.550
than the physically relevant
sizes of your apparatus.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.370
So you have a particle
like an electron.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.610
And if the Broglie
wavelength is very small

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.490
compared to the
aperture in the screen,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.970
the letter will go almost
like a classical particle.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.720
When the Broglie wavelength
is comparable with the size

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.670
of the aperture
in the screen, you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.980
will get diffraction
effects, and the electrons

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.410
will do quantum
mechanical things.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.540
So the semiclassical
approximation

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.050
has to do with
lambda being smaller

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.650
than the length scale, L,
of your physical problem.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.320
We will refine this.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.620
In fact, the whole
search of understanding

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.570
the semiclassical
approximation is

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.300
all about understanding
this better.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.440
Because it's a little subtle.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.060
We will end up deciding
that what you need

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.710
is that the Broglie wavelength,
suitably generalized,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.230
varies very slowly.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.650
We'll have to generalize
the concept of the Broglie

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.149
wavelength.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.040
We might get to it today.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.160
Mathematically, you
can say, OK, I want

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.460
this to be sufficiently small.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:36.890
So semiclassical limit was
just take h going to 0.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.680
You should complain, of course.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.295
h is a constant of nature.

00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:44.510
I cannot take it equal to 0.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.900
But on the other hand, they
could imagine other universes,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.320
maybe, where h has different
smaller and smaller values

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.250
in which quantum mechanical
effects don't set in

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.820
until much smaller scales.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.790
But at the end of
the day, I will

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.300
try to consider h to be
small as an idea underlying

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.410
a semiclassical approximation.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.330
And the intuition is
that for h small--

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.710
we cannot tune it,
but we can say it--

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.715
h small lambda becomes small.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.810
The lambda, the Broglie, dB.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.630
You're taking a
quantity with units--

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.240
h bar is units.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.770
And saying it's small.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.560
It goes against lots of things.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.410
Things with units are
not supposed to be small.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.660
You should compare it with
the situation we had before.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.300
We had a very nice
and clean situation

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.500
with perturbation theory,
where we had a unit-free thing

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.110
that we consider it to be small.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.920
This time, we're going to try
to consider h to be small.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.540
And it's going to be more
delicate because it has units.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.890
It's going to be a
more complicated story.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.860
The physics is
interesting, and that's

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.090
why this approximation
is harder in some ways

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.430
to understand than
the ones we've

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.380
done in perturbation theory.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.920
So how does this begin?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.150
It begins by thinking of a
particle in a potential, V

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.030
of x.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.480
And the particle
has some energy, E.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.340
And then, if it's classical,
as we're imagining now,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.100
it could be a
three-dimensional potential.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.370
My sketch of course is
just for one-dimensional.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:03.130
This is E. And you can
solve for p squared, 2m, E

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:23.370
minus V. This is a
notion of local momentum

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.530
because it depends on x.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.950
It's the momentum the
particle would have.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.250
When it is at some
position, x, you

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.260
will have momentum, p, of x.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.440
And now, nobody forbids
you from declaring

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.430
that you're going to define
a position-dependent Broglie

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.650
wavelength, which is
going to be h over p

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:03.080
of x is your definition, which
is equal to 2 pi h bar over p

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.020
of x.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.550
And it's going to be
local the Broglie.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.900
You see that the Broglie
wavelength, when you first

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.390
started in 804, was considered
for a free particle--

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.450
always the [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.140
You have a free particle
with some momentum it

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.150
has at the Broglie wavelength.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.060
Why was the Broglie
wavelength important?

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.710
Because when you write
the wave function,

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.760
it's a wave with wavelength
equal to the Broglie

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.720
wavelength.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.610
The wave function with
the Broglie wavelength

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.289
solves the Schrodinger equation.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.020
That's sort of how
it all came about.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.780
But it was all defined
for a free particle.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.270
The Broglie defined
it for a free particle

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.370
with some momentum, p.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.420
And it all made sense, because
you could write a wave function

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.940
using the Broglie momentum.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.660
It was in fact E to
the ipx over h bar.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.530
That was your wave function.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:11.480
But here, you have a particle
moving with varying momenta.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.400
And we don't know how to write
the solution of the Schrodinger

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.210
equation, but there's
classically this concept,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.730
and we could define the
local, the Broglie wavelength,

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.130
and we will have to
discover what it means

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.960
or how it shows up.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.980
But it probably
shows up in some way.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:34.230
So there's two cases that
probably we should consider.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:40.050
But before that, we looked
at the Schrodinger equation--

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:46.510
the time-independent
Schrodinger equation.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.630
So it's minus h squared
over 2m Laplacian

00:09:50.630 --> 00:10:01.230
of psi of x is equal to
E minus v of x, psi of x.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.060
All these vectors-- that's
why I'm Laplacian, not

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.890
second derivatives.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.270
But the right-hand side--

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.800
well, if I put the
2m to the other side,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:24.180
I get minus h squared
Laplacian of psi of x,

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.710
is equal to 2m E minus vx.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.780
That's p squared of x, psi of x.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.110
That's the local
momentum squared.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:41.190
Maybe it's a curiosity, but
it's now nice that the left-hand

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.490
side is the momentum
operator squared--

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.150
so it's p hat squared
on the wave function--

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:57.860
is equal to p squared of
x times a wave function.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.870
Kind of a nice result.
Nice-looking Schrodinger

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.560
equation.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.070
I don't know if you've
seen it like that before.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.560
It's an operator on the left.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.080
And on the right, almost
like an eigenvalue.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.820
It's an illegal eigenvalue.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.440
If it were a real
eigenvalue problem,

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.130
there should be a number,
not a function here.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.610
But it's a function that acts
a little like an eigenvalue.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.790
It's a nice way of thinking
of the Schrodinger equation

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.110
in the semiclassical
approximation.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.710
Well, no.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.850
No approximation here so far
in the semiclassical language,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.440
in which you call this
the local momentum.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.870
And thus defined, it certainly
is an exact statement--

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.700
no approximation whatsoever.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:02.220
OK, now I want to know these
two circumstances of course.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.470
If you have E greater than v,
you're in an allowed region.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:19.740
And p squared is really
2m E minus v of x.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.900
And it's convenient to
define h squared k squared

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.400
of x, the wave number.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.080
You remember that p equal
hk was good notation.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.630
We use the wave
number sometimes.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.160
We'll have here a local
wave number as well.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.750
And if you're in the
forbidden region,

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.480
which energy is less than v--

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:56.780
forbidden region--
then minus p squared

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:06.210
is positive, is 2m v
minus E. That is positive

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.390
this time, because
v is greater than E.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:14.940
And that, we always used
to call the penetration

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.810
constant, the kappa,
for wave functions

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:19.240
that decay exponentially.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.960
So we call this h squared
kappa squared of x.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.060
A local decaying
factor wave number.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.050
It can be thought as an
imaginary wave number.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.920
But that's notation.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.170
So, so far, so good.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.890
We will need one more
piece of intuition

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.930
as we work with this
semiclassical approximation.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.360
We have not done any
approximation yet.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.390
The approximation
will come soon,

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.930
as we will begin solving
the Schrodinger equation

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.900
under those circumstances.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.270
And we will take h bar as
an expansion parameter--

00:14:09.495 --> 00:14:15.400
will be fine and correct,
but a little subtle.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.130
So the thing that will
help us many times

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.680
to understand these things
is to write the wave function

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.210
as a complex number.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.245
So suppose you have
a wave function.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.710
We will write it as a complex
number in the polar form--

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.900
radius times face.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:41.960
So the radius is
going to be rho of x.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.440
The probability density,
I claim, is this.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.530
And there is a phase that
I will write as E to the i

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.660
over h bar, S of x and t.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.680
It looks a little
like an action.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.370
And it's, to some degree,
the beginning of the path

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.690
into rule formulation.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.810
It has lots of connections
with the action principle.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:14.020
So here, rho and s
are going to be real.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.840
So this is truly
scale factor in front

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.010
that determines the value.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:23.230
This is a pure phase, because
it's an imaginary number

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.560
times a real thing.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.350
S has units of h bar,
or angular momentum.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:40.620
And indeed, psi squared is
equal to rho of x and t.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.210
If you loop psi squared.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.970
The reason we focus
on this wave function

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.060
is that our solutions
of WKB are going

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.190
to have exactly that form.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.330
So we need to have an
intuition as to what

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.660
the observables of
this wave function are.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.640
So the other observable
is the current density.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:15.270
If you remember, it's h bar over
m, imaginary part of psi star

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.510
gradient psi.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.190
So this must be calculated.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.090
So what is this?

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:33.270
Gradient of psi-- we must
take the gradient of this.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.680
Gradient's a derivative, so it
acts on one, acts on the other.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.510
When it acts on
the first, it first

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:45.690
acts as the relative 1 over
2 squared of rho of x and t,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:59.840
times the gradient of rho,
times the phase factor, plus now

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.890
I have to take the
gradient on this quantity,

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:12.740
and this will bring down an i,
an h bar, the gradient of S,

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.630
and then multiplied by
the whole wave function,

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.449
because this factor remains
and the exponential remains.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.560
Now we can multiply by
psi star to form what

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.140
we need to get for the current.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:45.040
So psi star [INAUDIBLE] psi.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.570
If I multiply by that, I'm
multiplying by the top line.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.995
For the first factor, I
get 1/2 gradient of rho.

00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:58.820
The exponentials cancel.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.140
And for the second
part, we get plus i

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:10.620
over h bar, gradient of S,
times psi squared, which is rho.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:17.920
The imaginary part
of this is equal 1

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.430
over h bar, rho gradient of s.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.880
So finally, the
current, which is

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.020
h bar over m, times
that imaginary part,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.420
is rho gradient of s, over m.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.770
A very nice formula.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.810
Basically, it says that the
phase factor in the wave

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.230
function determines the
probability current.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:58.020
And it also says that if
you want to think of this,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.340
here are the surfaces
of constant phase.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.880
Here is our space.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.210
And S constant.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.104
So here is one
valley of the phase,

00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:10.270
another valley of the phase.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.650
Those are surfaces in
space of constant phase.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.510
The current is
orthogonal to that.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.880
So the current is
proportional to the gradient.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.260
The gradient of a function
is always proportional.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.360
It's a normal vector to the
surfaces of constant values.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.570
So the current is orthogonal to
the surfaces of constant phase.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.140
If you have a fluid
mechanics interpretation,

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.130
J is rho v in fluids.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:53.680
So, so far, everything I've said
could have been said in 804.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.370
These are properties of
a general wave function.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.870
This is how you
compute the current.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.930
The useful thing is
that our WKB wave

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:06.200
functions are going to be
presented in that language.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.680
So if you think of the
analogy with fluid mechanics.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.140
The current is the charge
density times the velocity,

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.060
and therefore the velocity
would be identified

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.990
with gradient of S over m.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:31.110
Or the momentum would be
identified with gradient of S.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.990
That's not a quantum mechanical
rigorous identification.

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.440
Because gradient
of S is a function.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.830
And therefore, p there
would be a function.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.920
And a function of momentum--

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.280
momentum in quantum
mechanics is an operator,

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.950
and it has eigenvalues,
which are numbers.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:53.000
They're not functions.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.480
But we already have
seen the beginning

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.360
of some momentum function.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.890
So that analogy is
actually quite nice.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:07.880
Let me give you an example,
and conclude with that.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.920
If you have a free particle,
you have a wave function psi

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:23.020
of x and t, which is E,
to the ipx over h bar,

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.800
times minus iEt over h bar.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:37.230
So in this case, rho
is equal to 1, an S--

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:43.350
remember, S is read by having
an i over an h bar out.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:48.080
And that gives you
p dot x minus Et.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:56.223
So for a free particle,
the gradient of S

00:21:56.223 --> 00:22:00.460
is indeed just the momentum.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.400
You take this gradient,
and it's that.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.620
And therefore, that's a
rigorous interpretation

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.880
when you have a free particle,
that the gradient of S

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.040
is going to be the momentum.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:17.100
Interestingly, the derivative
of S with respect to time

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.390
is minus the energy.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.750
What will happen in the
semiclassical approximation

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.900
is that this S over
there will depend on x,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.400
and this p will depend
on x, and it will be

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.800
this p that depends on x here.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.890
And we will see how
to solve this equation

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:45.560
in an approximation scheme where
the changes are a little slow.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.630
And the notation S
here is also motivated

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.020
because actions in
classical mechanics

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.620
actually have this property.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.300
The gradient of
the action-- if you

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.340
think of the action as a
function of coordinates,

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.060
which is something you don't
usually do, but if you do,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.560
in somewhat advanced
classical mechanics,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.380
you see that the derivatives
of the action-- spatial

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.120
derivatives are the momentum,
and the time derivatives

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.745
are the energy.

00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:20.900
It's a nice relation
between classical mechanics,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.400
and justifies once more the name
of semiclassical approximation,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.290
which we will continue
to develop next time.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.140
See you then.
