00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.800
PROFESSOR: So far, so good.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.030
We've really calculated.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.310
And we could stop here.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.000
But there is a
nice interpretation

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.460
of this Darwin term
that gives you intuition

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.610
as to what's really happening.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.110
See, when you look at
these terms overall--

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.740
these interactions
with this class--

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.610
you say, well, the kinetic
energy was not relativistic.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.860
That gives rise to this term.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.280
There is a story for
the spin orbit as well.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.490
We think of the proton--

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.020
creates an electric field.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.170
You, the electron,
are moving around.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.680
As you move inside the
static-electric field,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.370
you see a magnetic field.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.080
The magnetic field interacts
with your dipole moment

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.950
of the electron.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.060
That's the story here.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.140
So what's the story
for this term?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.910
Where does it come from?

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.240
What is the physics behind it?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.970
That's what I want
to discuss now.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.270
So the physics interpretation
of the Darwin term

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.120
is that the electron
behaves not as

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.970
if it would be a point
particle but as if it would be,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.430
kind of, a little ball where
the charge is spread out.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.240
We know that any mechanical
model of the electron, where

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.490
you think of it as
a ball, the spinning

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.930
doesn't work for the spin.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.060
But somehow, here, we can see
that this extra correction

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.220
to the energy is
the correction that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.710
would appear if, somehow, the
electron, instead of feeling

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.790
the potential of the
nucleus at one point,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.350
as if it would be
a point particle,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.960
it's as if it would be spread.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.490
So let me make a drawing here.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.330
Here is the proton.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.610
And it creates a potential.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.655
And we will put an
electron at the point r.

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:24.300
There's the electron.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.940
But now, we're going to think
that this electron is really

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.190
a cloud, like this.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.980
And the charge is
distributed over there.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.340
And now, I'm going
to try to estimate

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.460
what happens to the
potential energy

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.970
if it's really
behaving like that.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.600
So for that, I'm going to
make another coordinate system

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.710
sort of starting here.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.330
I'm going to call
the vector that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.760
goes to an arbitrary
point here vector u.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.600
So from the origin or center
of this charge distribution,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.460
we put the vector u.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.870
And then I have this vector
over here, which is r plus u.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.840
And this u points to a little
bit of charge, a little cubit

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.725
here, for example.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.250
So this is our setup.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.275
Now, the potential--
due to the proton--

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.360
proton-- we have a
potential V of r,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.740
which is equal to minus the
charge of the electron times

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.340
the scalar potential, phi of r--

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.060
it's minus e times e over r,
which is our familiar minus e

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.070
squared over r.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.110
So the potential energy--

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.911
this is the potential energy.

00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:27.320
And so if you had
a point particle--

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.610
for a point particle--

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.040
you have that the proton creates
a potential at a distance r.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.870
You multiply by the charge.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.670
And you get the
potential energy.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.500
So how do we do it a
little more generally?

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.555
I'm going to call
this V tilde of r.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.140
The true potential energy--

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:19.010
potential energy-- when the
center of the electron is

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.640
at r--

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.090
electron at r.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.765
So what is the true
potential energy

00:05:34.765 --> 00:05:36.980
when the center of
the electron is at r?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.490
Well, I would have
to do an integral

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.240
over the electron of the
little amount of charges

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.205
times the potential
at those points.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.990
For every piece
of charge, I must

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.430
multiply the charge times
the potential generated

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.990
by the proton.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.770
And that would give me the
total energy of this electron

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.500
in this potential, V of r.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.900
So let me use that
terminology here.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.100
I will describe the
charge density--

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.310
density-- rho of u--

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:42.040
the density of charge at a
position given by a u vector.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:49.160
I'll write it as minus
e times rho 0 of u--

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.690
a little bit of notation.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.610
I apologize, but it's
necessary to do things cleanly.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.820
The charge density
of the electron--

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.750
electron-- is given by
rho of u minus e rho 0.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.340
And then it should be
true that the integral

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:21.740
over the electron of d cube
u rho 0 of u is equal to 1.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.240
Look at that integral.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.870
Why should it be equal to 1?

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.820
It should be equal to 1, because
then the integral of the charge

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.960
density--

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.630
the integral of this over all of
space would be minus e times 1.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.830
And that's exactly
what you expect.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.380
So rho 0 is a unit free--

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.390
well, 1 over length cubed
is a charge-free quantity.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.600
The charge is carried by
this constant over here.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.340
So what happens then
with this V of r?

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.910
This V of r is the charge--

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:19.090
little charge q is d cubed
u times rho of u times phi

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.900
at r plus u.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.700
Look, the charge is this
at some little element.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.919
And then the potential there
is the potential at r plus u.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.510
So one more step--

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:51.560
V of r-- if you take from
rho this extra minus e,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:57.290
minus e times phi
of r is what we call

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.400
the potential energy due to r.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.780
So take the minus
e out and append it

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:13.900
to the capital Phi here, so that
we have integral d cube u rho

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.240
0 of u V of r plus u.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.065
OK, this was our goal.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.530
It gives you the new energy--

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:39.320
the true potential
energy of this electron

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.270
when this center is
at r as the smearing

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.920
of the potential energy
of a point particle

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.650
smeared over the electron.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.230
So this is a formula that
represents our intuition.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.780
And moreover, it
has the rho 0 here

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.770
that tells you the weight that
you should apply at any point,

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.370
because this rho 0 is
proportional to the charge--

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.420
very good.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.680
We have a formula.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.030
But I was supposed
to explain that term.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.260
And we have not
explained it yet.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.470
But now, it's time
to explain it.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.350
We're going to try to
do a computation that

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.330
helps us do that.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.890
The idea is that we're going
to expand the potential

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.830
around the point r and treat
this as a small deviation

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.330
because, after all, we expect
this little ball that I drew

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.970
big here for the
purposes of illustration

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.900
to be rather small.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:11:02.430
So let's write V of r plus u
as V of r in Taylor series--

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.710
plus the next term
is the derivative

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.390
of V with respect to
position evaluated

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.030
at r multiplied by the
deviation that you moved.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:27.160
So sum over i dv dx i
evaluated at r times u i.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.610
This is the component
of this vector u.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.030
That's the first term
in the Taylor series.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.130
And we need one more--

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:49.625
plus 1/2 sum over i and j,
d 2nd V vx i vx j evaluated

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:52.820
at r ui uj.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.640
And then we have
to integrate here.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.190
We substituted in
here and integrate.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:09.560
So V tilde of r--
let's see what it is.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.210
Well, I can put
this whole thing--

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.180
we don't want to write so much.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.280
So let's try to do
it a little quick.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.470
We're integrating over u.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.800
And here, let's think
of the first term here.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.300
When you plug in the first
term, this function of r

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.830
has nothing to do with u.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:38.380
So it goes out and you get V of
r times the integral d cube u

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.800
rho 0 of u.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:49.160
For the next term in
here, these derivatives

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.490
are evaluated at r-- have
nothing to do with u.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.660
They go out.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:13:05.770
So plus sum over I dv dx
i of r integral d cube u

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.210
rho 0 of u, ui.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.720
Last term-- these
derivatives go out.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.910
They're evaluated at r.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.450
They have nothing
to do with you.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:29.140
So plus 1/2 sum over i
and j d second V dx i dx

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:40.430
j evaluated at r integral
d cube u rho of u ui uj.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.985
OK-- all these terms!

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.480
Happily we can interpret
much of what we have here.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.445
So what is this first integral?

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:10.070
V of r equals--

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.050
this integral is our
normalization integral.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.520
Over here, that's equal to 1.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.050
So this is very nice.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.110
That's what you
would expect that

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.450
to first approximation, the
total energy of the electron,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.200
when it is at r--

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.680
as if it would be a
point particle at r.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.670
Now, let's look
at the next terms.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:44.970
Now, we will assume that
the distribution of charge

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.720
is spherically symmetric.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.850
So that means that
rho of u vector

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:54.690
is actually a
function rho 0 of u,

00:14:54.690 --> 00:15:00.560
where u is the length
of the u vector.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.837
So it just depends on the
distance from the point

00:15:04.837 --> 00:15:05.670
that you're looking.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.280
That's the charge.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.390
Why would it be
more complicated?

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:17.450
If that is the case, if this
is spherically symmetric,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:25.880
you can already see that
these integrals would vanish,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.350
because you're integrating the
spherically symmetric quantity

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.450
times a power of a coordinate.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.700
That's something you
did in the homework

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.760
as well for this Stark effect.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.150
You realized that integrals of
spherically symmetric functions

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.610
then powers of x, y,
and z-- well, they get

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.030
killed, unless those
are even powers.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.340
So this is an odd power.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.810
And that's 0.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.500
So this term is gone.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:02.420
And this integral is
interesting as well.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.060
When you have a spherically
symmetric quantity

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.440
and you have i and j different,
the integral would be 0.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.320
It's like having a power
of x and a power of y

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.860
in your homework.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.710
So if that integral would be 0,
it would only be non-zero if i

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.030
is equal to j-- the first
component, for example--

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.600
1 u1 u1.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.940
But that integral would be
the same as u2 u2 or u3 u3.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.630
So in fact, each
of these integrals

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:41.630
is proportional to delta
i j, but equal to 1/3

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:47.390
of the integral of
d cube u rho of u--

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.600
I'll put the delta ij here--

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.840
times u squared.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.510
u squared is-- u1 squared plus
u2 squared plus u3 squared--

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.270
each one gives
the same integral.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:08.380
Therefore, the result
has a 1/3 in front.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.940
So what do we get?

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:20.430
Plus 1/6-- and here,
we get a big smile.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:20.970
Why?

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:25.079
Because delta i j,
with this thing,

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:30.195
is the Laplacian of
V evaluated at r.

00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:33.390
They have the same
derivative summed.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:34.830
So what do we get here?

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:41.920
1/6 of the Laplacian
of V evaluated

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:51.100
at r times the integral d
cube u rho 0 of u u squared.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.700
Very nice-- already starting
to look like what we wanted,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.040
a Laplacian.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.720
Can we do a little better?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.120
Yes, we can.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.260
It's possible.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:17.070
Let's assume the charged
particle has a size.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:30.330
So let's assume the
electron is a ball of radius

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:35.290
the Compton wavelength,
which is h bar over mc.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:50.020
So that means rho 0
of u is non-zero when

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.050
u is less than this lambda.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.940
And it's 0 when u is
greater than this lambda.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.860
That's a ball-- some
density up to there.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.280
And this must integrate to 1.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.710
So it's 1 over the volume of
that ball, 4 pi lambda cubed

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.415
over 3.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.385
Do this integral.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:34.750
This integral gives you,
actually, 3/5 of lambda

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.320
squared with that function.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:47.540
So the end result is that V
tilde of r is equal to V of r.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:59.270
Plus 3/5 of this thing
times that is 1/10 h

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:08.080
squared m squared c
squared Laplacian of V.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.410
The new correction to the
potential, when this mole came

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.930
out to this 1/10--

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.600
that's pretty close, I must say.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.720
There's an 1/8 there.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.670
We assume the electron is
a ball of size, the Compton

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.970
wavelength of the electron.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.830
It's a very rough assumption.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:35.170
So even to see the number not
coming off by a factor of 100

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.300
is quite nice.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.510
So that's the interpretation.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.910
The known locality--
the spread out

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.070
of the electron into a little
ball of its Compton size

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:51.330
is quite significant.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.290
The Compton wavelength
of the electron

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.010
is fundamental in
quantum field theory.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.020
The Compton wavelength
of an electron

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:05.980
is the size of a photon whose
energy is equal to the rest

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.430
mass of the electron.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.050
So if you have a photon
of this size equal

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.010
of wavelength equal to Compton
length of the electron,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.680
that photon packs
enough energy to create

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.520
electron-positron pairs.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.790
That's why, in quantum field
theory, you care about this.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.670
And the quantum field
theory is really

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.290
the way you do relativistic
quantum mechanics.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:35.500
So it's not too surprising
that, in relativistic analysis

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.990
such as that of
the Dirac equation,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.910
we find a role for the Compton
wavelength of the electron

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.364
and a correction
associated with it.
