00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.640
PROFESSOR: Einstein's argument,
we consider again our atoms.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.900
And this time we're going to
use the thermal equilibrium.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.460
We're going to really
make use of that fact.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.870
So, again, we have
level b and level a.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.280
And this is Einstein's argument.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.310
And we're going to
have no populations.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.450
If we discuss equilibrium, we
can consider a system in a box.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.300
And there's a few billion atoms.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.150
And there's some
atoms whose electron

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.160
is going to be in state b.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.880
Some atoms whose electrons
are going to be in state a.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.270
Let's call these
numbers Nb and Na.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:11.090
And we also have
photons at temperature T

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:20.440
and have a beta parameter 1 over
the Boltzmann constant times T.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.450
So this is the process
we're going to consider.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.335
So what's going to happen?

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.460
If we came up from the edition
that we've built from 806,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.320
we would think,
OK, there's going

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.800
to be absorption process and
stimulated emission process.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.770
And between the
two, they're going

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.060
to be able to reach equilibrium.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.800
We don't believe this is not a
process that can equilibrate.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.760
So this would be our intuition.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.640
The intuition for
people that lived

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.250
at the beginning of last
century was rather different.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.810
They felt that there would
be absorption process

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.590
and there was
spontaneous emission.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.010
The thing that you probably
intuitively would think,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.000
if you are at a high level,
you spontaneously decay.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330
So the thing that
was not known to them

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.660
was this stimulated emission.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.700
That is what Einstein is
credited for discovering here.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.090
People felt, and I think the
paper finds that makes clear

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.460
that the intuition,
is that you have

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.990
spontaneous emission,
in which spontaneously

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.570
by some kind of instability,
the higher state goes

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.890
to the bottom.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.860
And you have absorption.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.410
But then Einstein figured
out that you couldn't achieve

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.222
equilibrium in that way.

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:57.680
Well, the way we're
going to do it,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.650
we're going to put the
two things we know--

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.440
the absorption
and the stimulated

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.380
emission-- and see
that we don't get it

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.450
to work, the equilibrium.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.210
But then when we add the
spontaneous emission, we will.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.260
And as it turns out,
the spontaneous emission

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.080
is a little harder to calculate.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.500
If we were to do it
in 806, it probably

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.120
would be a matter of
two lectures involving

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.470
an electromagnetic field.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.370
So we will not do it.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.140
But the good thing is that
Einstein's argument tells you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.160
the speed of spontaneous
emission, the rate

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.310
of spontaneous
emission, in terms

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.660
of this rate of stimulated
emission or absorption.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.300
So it does the
calculation for you

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.750
by some other
thermodynamical means.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.285
So we're going to
use here three facts.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.580
One is that the--

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.960
three facts-- one is the
populations are in equilibrium.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:26.430
So Na dot is they stop
changing is equal to 0.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.690
And Nb dot is equal to 0.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.040
They don't stop changing
because nothing happens.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.010
All the time there
will be emission,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.450
and there will be absorption.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.020
But if you reach equilibrium,
the number of atoms

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.810
remain the same on every state.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.370
So that's our statement
that the populations

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.610
achieve equilibrium.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.040
The second statement is that the
equilibrium is thermodynamical.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.510
So it's thermal equilibrium.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.540
That is Nb over Na, for example,
is the Boltzmann factor e

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.990
to the minus beta, Eb over
e to the minus beta Ea.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:35.430
And this is equal to e to the
minus beta h bar omega ba.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.600
You get e to the minus
beta, eb minus ea.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.700
But eb minus ea
is h bar omega ba.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.690
So that's thermal equilibrium.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.370
And the last thing
that we need is

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.590
a statement about the photons.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.860
What do they do when
they have equilibrium?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.340
And that was known already
due the work of Planck

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.070
and others, black
body equilibrium.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.510
So we need to know something
about the thermal radiation.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.620
And the way one describes
this is in terms of a function

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.420
U of omega d omega.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.240
In the black body
radiation, there

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.725
are at a given
temperature, there

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.920
are photons with
very little energy.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.280
There are some largest
number of photons

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.740
with some energy associated
with temperature,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.790
and then it decays.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.040
So you have photons
of all energy.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.290
So if you want a description of
what's going on in black body

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.730
radiation, you can
consider the energy

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.270
in the photons in
the frequency range.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.490
But you even must
be more precise.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.550
It is the energy per unit
volume in a frequency range.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.740
Because if it's different,
the energy of the black body

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.600
cavities, this room
or it's a little box.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.340
So it's an energy per
volume per frequency range.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.085
And that's what
this quantity is.

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:20.220
So let me write it.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:41.450
Energy per unit volume in
the frequency range dw.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.610
In other words, it's kind of a
proxy for the number of photons

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.270
available.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.950
All the photos have at some
value of the frequency,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.030
of energy e omega.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.850
So if you know the
energy, you basically

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:01.550
are getting here the number of
photons with frequency omega

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.805
in that range per unit
volume, all that stuff.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.750
So this has a formula.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.290
And the formula that
was known to people

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:25.680
was this quantities and then
omega cube, d omega, over e

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.230
to the beta h bar omega minus 1.

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:40.390
So this is the basis
of the calculation.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.070
What do we do?

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.670
We have to consider
the possible processes.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.120
OK, so our processes
are absorption.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.700
And in this case,
we go from a to b.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:10.320
And let's try to
write a rate for them.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.700
So what would the
rate depend on?

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.060
Well, here's some
little assumptions.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.890
Certainly, if you don't have
particles in the a state,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.470
you cannot have this process.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.780
So this process, the total
rate that we observe in the box

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.820
will depend on an Na.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.760
The more particles
you have in this state

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:45.240
a, the larger the probability
that you get the transitions,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.435
and the larger the rate.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.240
It will also be affected
by the number of photons

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.090
available at that
frequency that can

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.360
produce a transition in
proportional to that.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.200
And finally, the quantity
that our study of perturbation

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.910
theory will tell us
about, but at that time,

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:23.380
finds that was not known, it's
a transition coefficient, Bab,

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.940
he called it.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.780
And this is the unknown one.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.890
And this is what we don't know.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.430
We know U. We assume we know Na.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:41.640
This is the transition
rate per atom

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.560
and then multiplied by
the number of atoms.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.340
So this is transition
rate per atom.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:05.750
Then we have the process
of spontaneous emission.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:11.480
And then we will be
another coefficient, Bba.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.230
And it would depend on
the number of particles

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.580
that are in the state b,
because spontaneous emissions

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.040
that transition from b to a.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.940
We call it-- oh, not
spontaneous stimulated.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.870
I'm sorry-- stimulated emission.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.150
This is the one
we're considering.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.790
It's stimulated
by the radiation.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.670
So it's also proportional
to the number

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.960
of photons present
and proportional

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.210
to the number of
atoms that can be

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:54.470
convinced to do the transition
times another coefficient, Bba.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:12:02.660
So this is, I think,
what we in 806 would do.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.570
We would consider
this two processes

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.190
and attempt to make it work.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.116
And let's see what we get then.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.800
We're trying to get equilibrium.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:24.160
So we want the transitions to
equilibrate and, therefore,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.490
the populations not to change.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.350
So let's look-- for example--

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:36.460
you could look at either one,
but you can look at Nb dot.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.300
It should be 0.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:49.590
But it's equal to the
rate of absorption

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:56.800
minus the rate of
stimulated emission.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.350
You see because the
number of particles in b

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.800
change because you get
some new particles in state

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.500
b due to the absorption process.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.840
And it happens with this rate.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.670
And you lose some particle
because some atoms

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.660
do the transition from the
higher level to the lower

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.910
level.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.060
So what is the
rate of absorption?

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.250
We have it here.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:37.946
It's this one, Bab
U of omega ba Na.

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:44.900
And this one is Bba, the
same U of omega ba Nb.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.700
And we can factor the U out.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.900
And this is the wrong
calculation, I must say,

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.560
because we're missing
that extra process that

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.600
was intuitive to
Einstein, but to us it's

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.050
a little less clear--

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:10.700
Nb times U of omega ba.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.500
OK, I can do a one
more little thing.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.970
I can factor an Na.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:35.330
And this becomes Bab minus Bba
to the minus beta h bar omega

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:41.020
Ba U of omega ba.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:50.140
OK, I use the ratio of Na
over Nb being thermodynamical.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:56.080
So Nb over Na was used
from point two to get this.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.930
And this should be equal to 0.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.270
But this equation
can't be satisfied.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.840
What do you have here?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.730
You should be able to
equilibrate at any temperature.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.820
On the other hand,
what is our intuition

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.320
about these quantities,
Bab and Bba?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.690
They should be
temperature independent.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:29.200
These are properties of the
geometry of those states

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.510
and the overlaps of
the wave functions.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.350
These are atomic
physics properties

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.030
of the levels of the particles.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.590
We will calculate them.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:44.440
And here is the input of
how many photons there

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.480
are, how many atoms there are.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.300
And the number of
photons certainly

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.560
depend on the temperature.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.780
The number of atoms
for equilibrium

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.260
depend on the temperature.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.220
But this is a factor
that says, well,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.210
how likely is the transition
once you have a photon

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.890
and once you have an atom?

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.990
And that depends like we did
for the ionization, calculated

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.450
some matrix elements
that are totally

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.800
independent of temperature.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.830
So these numbers are totally
independent of temperature.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.740
And we're asking
this to be 0, which

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.655
requires this factor to be 0.

00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:26.300
And this depends on temperature.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.510
So you cannot attain
equilibrium with this way.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:43.600
So it's impossible to satisfy
for all temperatures given

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.990
that Bab and Bba are constants.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.589
So we're missing a process.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:12.700
This is the process that
Einstein thought was intuitive,

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.214
the process of
spontaneous emission.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:24.490
So we add one more process.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:29.745
It's called
spontaneous emission.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.795
And it's a process
also from b to a.

00:17:45.373 --> 00:17:48.670
And it's going to have a rate.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.120
But it's not going
to depend, that rate,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.570
on the number of photons,
because it's happening

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.940
independently of the photons.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.420
So we don't have this U factor.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.790
We do have the Nb because
each of the b atoms

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.160
can spontaneously decay.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.330
But we don't have the U factor.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.710
So what do we have?

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:23.320
A rate, which is the
term by a coefficient

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.940
that Einstein called it a,
that's why the name a and b

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:32.440
coefficients of
Einstein, a times and b.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.310
So that's the
spontaneous emission rate

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.510
per atom multiplied by
the number of atoms.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.630
So we go back to our equation--

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.130
rate of absorption minus
rate of stimulated emission

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:57.470
minus the rate of
spontaneous emission.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.020
So I'll write it here.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:07.310
0 is equal to Nb dot
equal minus A Nb--

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.240
that's the spontaneous emission.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.900
We write it first.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.990
And then we'll write
the other two--

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:30.520
Bba and Nb U omega ba
plus Bab U of omega ba Na.
