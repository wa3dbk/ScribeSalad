00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
PROFESSOR: A new way
of thinking about this

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.485
is based on integral equations.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.070
So it's a nice method.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.540
It's less complicated than
it seems, suddenly leads

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.060
to some expressions for
the scattering amplitude.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.625
We'll find another formula for
this quantity, f of k of theta,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:32.056
when we cannot calculate
it with phase shifts.

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:34.380
But phase shifts
is very powerful

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.755
if your problem has
spherical symmetry.

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.825
It's probably the
first thing you try,

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:42.960
because there's nothing to
prevent you from finding

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.656
a solution, in that case.

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:51.720
OK, so integral equations,
so integral scattering

00:00:51.720 --> 00:01:05.630
equation, OK, integral
scattering equation.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:13.810
So what are we solving?

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.588
We're solving minus h
squared over 2m Laplacian,

00:01:22.588 --> 00:01:32.170
plus v of r of potential, that
is not necessarily spherical,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.810
equals or acts on a psi of
r, to give you h squared,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.546
k squared over 2m, psi of r.

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:49.905
So it's an equation for
eigenstates, the Schrodinger

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:51.830
equation.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.860
It's good.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.940
It's nice.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.100
And this is what
we've been solving.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.170
We've been solving if for
some particular cases.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.640
The case of physical
interest for us

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.370
was when there was a
plane wave coming in

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.505
from infinity and this spherical
wave going out at the infinity.

00:02:11.505 --> 00:02:13.710
Now, at this moment,
it's probably

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.600
convenient to clean up the units
from this equation a little.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.930
So I'll use a notation
in which V of r

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:33.535
is equal to h squared
over 2m, U of r--

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:36.040
U still reminds you of
a potential, I think.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.720
And it's a good thing.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.720
It's a definition of U of r.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.760
It's a definition.

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:49.635
And in that way, I
can get rid of the h

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:52.875
bars, in this
scattering equation.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:54.170
And what do we get?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:07.331
We get minus Laplacian plus
U of r, acting on psi of r,

00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:12.420
is equal to k squared,
acting on psi of r.

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.450
OK, that looks nice.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.200
It probably is nicer
if you put it in a way

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.665
that the left hand side is
kind of a nice, simple operator

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:38.570
and the right hand side
involves the potential.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.030
So I'll move it
along, so that I can

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.035
pass the now left
squared to the right,

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.420
but then make that
the left hand side.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.700
So this will be
Laplacian squared plus k

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:03.180
squared on psi of r is
equal to U of r, psi of r.

00:04:06.714 --> 00:04:11.815
OK, so we've done
nothing so far,

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:18.301
except put the equation in a way
that stimulates our thinking.

00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:21.550
We kind of think
of the right hand

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.125
side as a source and
the left hand side

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.865
as kind of the equation
you want to solve.

00:04:29.865 --> 00:04:33.450
Sometimes you have an
equation like that.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.160
Then you can get this zero here.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.410
Well that's when the
potential is zero.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.420
But sometimes there's
a bit of potential,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.430
so the solution
feeds back into this.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.540
Whenever you have an equation of
this form, some nice operator--

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.730
so this we call nice operator.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:05:03.330
Acting on psi, giving your
something that depends on psi--

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.170
maybe it's not that
nice or not that simple.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.380
We can try to solve this
using Green's function.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
That's what Green's
functions are good for.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.265
So let's try to use
a Green's function.

00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:23.146
So what is a Green's function?

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:27.840
It is basically a
way of understanding

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.780
what this operator is.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.450
So nice operator must
have a Green's function.

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:41.890
So what is your
Green's function here?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:50.780
It's called G. And
we'll say it's depends

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.810
on r minus r prime.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.400
r prime is an arbitrary point so
far, but here is what it does.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.520
It's basically a solution.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.420
You want this Green's
function to be almost zero,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.920
except they're not
quite equal to zero.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.760
You want it to be equal
to a delta function.

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:34.790
So that's the definition
of the Green's function,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:41.565
is that thing which is the
solution of a similar equation,

00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:45.005
where you have the nice operator
acting on the Green's function

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.830
being just a delta function.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.150
It's almost saying that
the Green's function

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.080
is the thing that solves
that equation with zero

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.810
on the right hand side.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.220
Except that it's
not really zero,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.305
it's a source in
the right hand side,

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:03.406
it's a delta function
of this point.

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:08.690
So you would say maybe,
OK, I don't know.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.805
Why would I care
about this equation?

00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:14.566
You care for two reasons.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:18.600
The first reason is that
this equation is easier

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.150
to solve than this
one, doesn't involve

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.116
the potential, which
is complicated.

00:07:25.116 --> 00:07:27.420
It just involves
a delta function.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.630
So we can have this
G and solve it once,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.830
because it doesn't
involve the potential.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.645
And then the great thing
about this equation

00:07:40.645 --> 00:07:43.135
is that it allows you
to write the solution

00:07:43.135 --> 00:07:48.025
for the top equation without
having to do any work anymore.

00:07:48.025 --> 00:07:52.510
Once you have the Green's
function, you're done.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.340
So let's assume you have
the Green's function.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.650
How would you write the
solution for this equation?

00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:09.350
So maybe a superposition,
basically, and we'll

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.100
do it using that.

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:24.140
So our aim is to use
this Green's function,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.105
if we had it, to write a
solution for this equation.

00:08:28.105 --> 00:08:30.010
So here is the claim.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.600
You write psi of x.

00:08:35.215 --> 00:08:42.954
It's going to be given by a
beginning one, psi zero of x.

00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:44.770
That is going to be a funny one.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:58.068
This one solves Laplacian plus
k squared on psi zero of x or r

00:08:58.068 --> 00:08:59.330
is equal to zero.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.170
0.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.400
So whenever you have an
equation of this form,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.490
you can add any solution.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.810
Anything that is killed
by this, can be added

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.555
to whatever solution you have.

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:25.200
So let's assume that we have a
solution of this form psi zero,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.044
of this form.

00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:34.605
Now, here I'll add one more
thing, the important part.

00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:38.505
It's going to be an
integral over r prime,

00:09:38.505 --> 00:09:40.460
here is the superposition.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.280
I'm going to think
of this potential, U

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.490
of r, as kind of existing
at every point r prime.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.335
So I'm going go
write the solution

00:09:53.335 --> 00:09:57.390
as a superposition that
involves the Green's function.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:06.940
So this will be G of r minus
r prime, times U of r prime,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.130
times psi of r prime.

00:10:15.442 --> 00:10:23.350
I claim that this is equivalent
to this equation that we have.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.475
That this psi provides--

00:10:27.475 --> 00:10:28.900
more than equivalent.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.060
I think the precise
way to say, this

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.440
provides a solution of this
equation, the way I've written.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.345
So let's try.

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:42.430
Suppose I calculate
Laplacian plus k

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.815
squared on psi of x here?

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:52.735
OK, the first term,
it's already zero.

00:10:52.735 --> 00:11:00.240
So Laplacian plus k squared on
psi zero, it's already zero.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.930
And then I come here and I
say, OK, I'm a Laplacian.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.270
I care about r, because
I'm a Laplacian.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.660
I don't care about r prime.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.146
So I come in here.

00:11:14.146 --> 00:11:17.560
And I ignore r prime,
ignore r prime.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.620
I cannot ignore this thing.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:29.590
So we have plus integral
dr prime, Laplacian plus k

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:44.330
squared, acting on G of r minus
r prime, times U of r prime,

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:45.760
psi of r prime.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:57.210
And now because the
Green's function

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:05.940
was designed to give you a
delta of r minus r prime,

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.950
this is an integral that can
be done, the integral over r

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:20.530
prime, and just set the rest of
the integrand at the point r,

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.855
because you integrate
over r prime.

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:27.950
And this delta function fires
when r prime is equal to r.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.950
So this gives me
U of r, psi of r.

00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:41.420
And that is the equation
I wanted to solve,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.570
the equation that we have here.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.306
So we have turned the problem.

00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:52.100
This cannot be
called the solution,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.125
because we have not solved it.

00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:58.680
We have turned the problem into
a different kind of problem.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.010
It might even seem
that we've made

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:10.430
the problem worse by turning
this into an integral equation.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.830
There's no derivatives here.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:17.495
But the function that
we're looking for

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:21.025
appears outside and
inside the integral.

00:13:21.025 --> 00:13:24.530
So these things are
called integral equations.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:29.945
And the power of an
integral equation

00:13:29.945 --> 00:13:39.000
is the insight it can give you
once you have an idea of what

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.325
the Green's function is.

00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:47.550
And also it's a good place to
do recursive approximations.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.625
In that, you can
essentially begin

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:57.285
and say, OK, I know the wave
function is this plus that.

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:01.890
But maybe in some sense,
I can think of this thing

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.730
as the leading solution.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.835
I could substitute the
leading solution in here

00:14:07.835 --> 00:14:09.675
and try to make
an approximation.

00:14:09.675 --> 00:14:12.330
That's going to give you
a nice approximation,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.970
the Born approximation.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.460
We'll see that soon.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.030
That should be all psi r's.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:22.791
I think I'm using
r's, so I please--

00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:33.796
so r's and r's everywhere, yeah,
no difference at this moment.

00:14:33.796 --> 00:14:40.901
OK, so the next step is solving
for the Green's function.

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:42.565
We need the Green's function.

00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:45.700
Otherwise, we can't make
progress with this equation.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.740
So I'm going to do a simple
solution of the Green's

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.900
function, basically by
doing a couple of checks

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:59.696
and saying that is the
answer we're interested in.

00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:06.495
And there are several
possible Green's functions.

00:15:06.495 --> 00:15:09.360
And depending on the
problem you're solving,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.985
you choose the right
Green's function.

00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:16.875
And we'll choose the one
that is suitable for us now.

00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:19.230
This is something
that can be done.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.615
The general solutions
can be obtained

00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:24.380
by counter integration.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.020
And there's all kinds of
nice methods to do this.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.670
But in fact, in this
case, it's really simple.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.230
You don't need any of
those complicated things.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.800
You can just pretty
much write the solution.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.230
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.200
So what do we need for
the Green's function?

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.520
So we have a Green's
function that

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.280
depends on r minus r prime.

00:15:59.385 --> 00:16:04.330
And so it depends on a vector.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.710
So let me simplify
the matter by saying,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.375
OK, since it
depends on a vector,

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:15.855
I'll just first
calculate what this G

00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:21.810
of r, the Green's function
of r, when the vector is r.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.380
Or you can think it's when
r prime is equal to zero.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.910
Whatever I find for
G of r, this one

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.370
is obtained by
whatever I find here,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.130
put in instead r minus r prime.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.176
So G of r is enough
for what we want to do.

00:16:40.176 --> 00:16:49.500
So it should have
Laplacian plus k squared.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:58.540
And G of r should be for,
not for, but it's delta of r.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.349
So we've looked at that
in fact at the beginning

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.335
of this course, not of this
course, of the discussion

00:17:07.335 --> 00:17:08.700
of scattering.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.314
We looked at this equation.

00:17:11.314 --> 00:17:15.030
In fact, we wanted to solve
it when the right hand

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.440
side was zero, to find solutions
of this scattering equation.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:25.140
And we found that these
G's could be of the form

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.420
e to the ikr plus,
minus ikr over r.

00:17:33.979 --> 00:17:39.980
Those were the spherical waves
that solved this equation

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.375
with zero potential.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.200
Those are our solutions.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:52.565
Now, it's easy to see that
Laplacian plus k squared

00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:58.664
on this G, that has
a plus or a minus,

00:17:58.664 --> 00:18:03.546
is equal to zero for
r different from zero.

00:18:03.546 --> 00:18:07.220
The formulas for the Laplacian
that you can us for r

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.080
different from zero, you
can check that is true.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.740
And it's easy.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.690
You can use that
formula, for example,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:19.620
that the Laplacian is one
over r the second-- well,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:20.965
it should be partial.

00:18:20.965 --> 00:18:28.550
The second dr squared r,
so psi, psi, like that.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.190
That formula in
one 30 seconds, you

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.222
can see that that works
for r different from zero.

00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:41.300
But then there's also
a formula that you

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.850
know that Laplacian of one
over r from electromagnetism

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.550
is minus 4pi pi times
the delta function of r.

00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:58.960
It comes from Poisson's
equation in electromagnetism.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.885
So that's saying
Laplacian of the potential

00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:05.100
is the charge density.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.590
This is the potential
for a charge.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.430
The charge that r equals
zero is a singularity.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.500
It's something you study.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:22.570
So here if I put a minus
one over 4pi for G plus,

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:30.160
minus, a minus one over 4pi, the
Laplacian of this whole thing

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.835
is zero.

00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:36.475
But when you approach zero,
the Laplacian of this function,

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:39.340
this function approaches
just one over r.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.570
That's how it goes to zero.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.250
This goes to one.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.580
And the Laplacian of
one over r gives it

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.150
this minus 4pi
cancels with that.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:52.065
And it will give you
a delta function.

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:58.510
So the delta function will arise
correctly from this quantity.

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:05.580
So I've argued without
solving this equation,

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.890
that this does give you a
solution for the Green's

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.146
function.

00:20:13.146 --> 00:20:17.770
It's Laplacian plus k squared
is zero away from zero.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.150
Unless you approach zero,
it has a right singularity

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.285
to give a delta function.

00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:27.880
So this is your
Green's function.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.550
As I said many
ways to derive it.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:35.290
If you want to see
griffiths, see other ways

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.020
in which it can be
done, then you can also

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.850
check this by doing properly
the vector calculus.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.815
You can think of Laplacian
as divergence of the gradient

00:20:47.815 --> 00:20:49.780
and calculate every step.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.515
And it's fun to do it as well.

00:20:53.515 --> 00:20:55.095
You check that this works.

00:20:55.095 --> 00:20:57.190
So this works.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.900
And now we have to make choices.

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:07.310
And our choices are going to be
adjusted to the problem we're

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.845
trying to solve.

00:21:08.845 --> 00:21:11.690
We're trying to solve
a scattering problem.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.650
And psi zero
represents a solution.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:20.495
And from the way we
thought of our waves,

00:21:20.495 --> 00:21:27.920
we had psi equal e to the ikz
plus f of theta and phi, e

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.670
to the ikr over r.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.390
So it's reasonable
to try to set.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.120
And we're going
to find solutions

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:44.120
by setting psi zero
to be e to the ikz.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.560
It does solve the equation
Laplacian squared plus k

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.652
squared equals zero.

00:21:51.652 --> 00:21:58.910
And then we're going to set the
Green's function to be G plus.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.540
With a plus here, because we
want solutions of the type

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.410
e to the ikr.

00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:09.710
We've already decided those
were the solutions we need.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.410
And a Green's function
with a plus in there

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.988
is going to generate that.

00:22:15.988 --> 00:22:21.455
So those are fine.

00:22:21.455 --> 00:22:24.410
You could have chosen another
thing here, an arbitrary

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.115
solution.

00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:27.950
And you could have
chosen a G minus as well.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.910
And you would get a solution
of the scattering equation.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.420
It would not have much to
do with the solution we're

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.556
trying to get.

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:42.710
So let's show that this gives
us this kind of solution we want

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.010
to get and gives us
already a formula

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.965
for the scattering amplitude.

00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:51.290
So let's do that.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:57.710
For that we just need to write
what the Green's function is

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.020
and approximate.

00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:07.620
So it will be a first step.

00:23:10.752 --> 00:23:13.665
OK, so what do we have?

00:23:13.665 --> 00:23:19.485
Psi of r is equal
to e to the ikz.

00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:23.140
I'm writing up
this stop equation,

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:28.140
but we now write it with the
right boundary conditions,

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.580
which correspond to psi
zero on a particular choice

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:40.740
of the Green's function, v
cubed r prime G of r minus r

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:48.255
prime, U of r prime,
all those are vectors,

00:23:48.255 --> 00:23:52.530
and psi of r prime.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.350
All those are vectors,
except G, which

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:59.655
is pretty in that it is
very spherically symmetric.

00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:07.165
This G plus, minus of r just
depends on the magnitude

00:24:07.165 --> 00:24:09.655
of r, which is very nice.

00:24:09.655 --> 00:24:14.080
OK, so a couple of things
that we can do here

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.975
and most everybody would do.

00:24:16.975 --> 00:24:22.760
Let's G plus of r
minus r prime is

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.945
equal to minus one
over 4pi, e to the ik,

00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:31.735
length of r minus r prime--

00:24:31.735 --> 00:24:34.420
that's what this
is supposed to be.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.910
Over the length of
r minus r prime.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.780
Remember I said to
you that whenever

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.460
we have G of r, then
to get the one we need,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.840
we'll just have to replace
the r by r minus r prime.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:56.110
And here this little r
or r without the vector

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.080
is the magnitude of this vector.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.088
So we've put the magnitude
of those vectors there.

00:25:03.088 --> 00:25:06.715
Now, people look for
approximations in here.

00:25:06.715 --> 00:25:08.440
So here is what we need to do.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.390
Imagine you are the origin.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.460
Here is the potential.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.325
And you have your
system of coordinates.

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:23.080
You are integrating over places
where the potential exists.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.190
So the r prime that
you're integrating

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.000
remains inside the
range of the potential.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.326
Here is zero.

00:25:33.326 --> 00:25:39.530
And then there is a r, which
is where you are looking at.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.880
And there is an angle
between these two.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:52.191
Maybe I should make the angle a
little bigger, smaller, I mean,

00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:52.690
r.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:01.115
And in general, we
look always far enough.

00:26:01.115 --> 00:26:06.570
This is an exact solution,
but we might as well

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.506
consider looking
at psi's that are

00:26:10.506 --> 00:26:13.860
located far from the potential.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.585
So we have the idea of what
should we do with this terms.

00:26:19.585 --> 00:26:24.735
One thing you can do is to say
that in the denominator here,

00:26:24.735 --> 00:26:30.990
r minus r prime is
good enough to set it

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.620
to r in the denominator.

00:26:37.455 --> 00:26:42.390
And for the numerator, however,
it's a lot more sensitive,

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.660
because you have a k here.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.560
And depending on whether
k is large or small--

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.370
a small difference
in r minus r prime,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.350
if you're estimating
this and you

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.380
make an error comparable
with the wavelength

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.780
of your particle, you
make a big mistake.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:06.150
If you're far way, you're 100
times farther than the range

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:10.685
of the potential, here you're
making a 1% error, no problem.

00:27:10.685 --> 00:27:16.560
But if you're making a 1%
error in the estimate of this,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.750
that might be still comparable
to the wavelength of this k.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.910
So you have to be a lot
more careful in the phase,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:26.595
than you have to be
on the other one.

00:27:26.595 --> 00:27:34.200
So for the phase,
phase, we will take

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:44.940
r minus r prime equal
to r minus n, r prime.

00:27:47.592 --> 00:27:53.870
So what is n? n is a unit
vector in this direction.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:28:00.630
And indeed, approximately,
this distance

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:05.370
here is approximately
equal to the distance

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.720
r minus the projection
of r prime into this one.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.390
So that is your
approximate distance.

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.970
So here is the final formula
we're going to write today.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:20.076
I'm running out of time.

00:28:20.076 --> 00:28:27.315
But that's what we
wanted to end up with.

00:28:27.315 --> 00:28:31.590
So here is what we get.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:42.000
So G plus of r minus r prime
has become minus one over 4pi r.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.980
The denominator is r.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:56.200
There's an e to the ikr and then
e to the minus ikn dot r prime.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.950
So that's-- and the
arrows are crucial here.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.710
If I don't put an
arrow somewhere,

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.540
it probably means something.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:15.935
So psi of r is equal to e to the
ikz plus minus one over 4pi r.

00:29:15.935 --> 00:29:18.380
The integral over
r prime doesn't

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:25.940
care about this, the cubed r
prime, e to the minus ikn dot

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:34.970
r prime, times U of r prime,
times psi of r prime, all

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.476
that multiplied by--

00:29:39.476 --> 00:29:41.630
let me take the r out.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.750
e to the ikr over r.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.260
So look at what we obtain.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:54.065
I just rewrote,
finally, this expression

00:29:54.065 --> 00:29:55.970
for the Green's
function over there,

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.260
with the integral over r prime
and the Green's function here.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.455
You have this
quantity in brackets.

00:30:03.455 --> 00:30:06.770
This quantity in
brackets here is

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:13.295
nothing but the f of theta phi
of the scattering amplitude.

00:30:13.295 --> 00:30:18.465
You have this equal to that,
plus e to the ikr over r.

00:30:18.465 --> 00:30:23.180
So we'll continue that
next time and finish up

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.980
with scattering probably in the
first half of the next lecture.
