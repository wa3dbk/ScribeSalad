00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.770
PROFESSOR: With this, we
can phase the construction

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.990
of the operators that
are going to help

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.400
us build totally symmetric
states and totally

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.820
anti-symmetric
states, and understand

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.230
why we solve the problem
of degeneracy, exchange

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.010
degeneracy.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.870
So let us look into that.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.560
So this is called
complete symmetrizers

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:54.010
and anti-symmetrizers,
complete symmetrizers

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.157
and anti-symmetrizers.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.740
Permutation operators
don't commute.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.320
So there's no hope ever of
simultaneously diagonalizing

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.950
them.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.680
There's some of them
are not even Hermitian.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.470
So even worse, you
cannot find that, oh,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.840
I'm going to get a
complete basis of states,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.110
simultaneously diagonalizing,
some permutation operators are

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.330
Hermitian.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.490
The majority are a unitary.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.080
The transposition operators
are the Hermitian ones.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.480
Those you could
try to diagonalize.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.780
But if you have the
whole permutation group,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.570
you cannot diagonalize it.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.200
It's just too many things
that don't commute.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.470
But while you cannot
diagonalize these things,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.530
you can find special states
that are eigenstates of all

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.850
of the elements of
a permutation group.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.140
So you remember, when you say--
this is a very important point.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.220
Whenever you say you cannot
simultaneously diagonalize two

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
operators, it means that you
cannot find a basis of states

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.060
that are simultaneous
eigenstates.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.640
But it may happen that
you have one state that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.060
is an eigenstate of all
these other things that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.680
don't commute.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.990
It is possible to
have operators that

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.810
don't commute and
have one state that's

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.830
an eigenstate of all of them.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
You cannot have a basis that is
an eigenstate of all of them,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.680
because they don't commute.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.870
But one state is possible.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.315
So we can find special states.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:11.950
Special states that are
eigenstates of all permutation

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.642
operators.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.362
So let's assume we have n
particles, each living on v,

00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:33.750
in v, so that the n
particles live on v tensor n.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.320
People write it like
that, v tensor n,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.800
which is supposed to
mean v tensor v with v

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.255
appearing n times.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.950
So here is a claim
that we're going

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.440
to postulate the existence
of symmetric states.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.050
Those are the states
that eventually will see

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.550
are the ones physics ones.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:27.160
So postulate that there are the
existence of symmetric states,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.000
psi s, n v tensor n.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.680
In the whole big space,
there's symmetric states.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.070
And what is the characteristic
of a symmetric state?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.290
The p alpha, any permutation.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.040
Remember, alpha means all
these set of indices on psi

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:56.170
s is equal to psi
s for all alpha.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.080
So the state is invariant.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.720
So we want to see that there
is such a thing, states that

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.950
are invariant, under all
the permutation operators

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.510
that we've constructed.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.540
This state would be eigenstates
of all the permutation

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.860
operators with
eigenvalue equals to 1.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.550
So it's a simultaneous
eigenvector

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.620
of all these operators.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.730
But since the permutation
operators don't commute,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.830
you cannot expect the basis.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.040
So if there are
symmetric states,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.780
they cannot form a basis
in the full Hilbert space.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.480
There must be some
smaller space.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.070
So we should be able to
reach them by a projector

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.310
into a subspace of
symmetric states.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:14.245
How about defining now
postulate anti-symmetric states.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:33.895
Psi A. P alpha on psi A
should then be equal to--

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.770
what should I put?

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:49.810
Negative psi A.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.640
Well, yeah, that's the
first thing we would put,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.050
but that's pretty
problematic actually.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.620
So even when you
postulate things,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.880
you know, postulate means,
OK, we think they exist,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.460
then we'll try to build them.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.650
Here, we're trying to
postulate that there

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.300
are states that do this.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.510
There's a little bit
of problems with this.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.450
First obvious problem,
you say, oh well, this

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.820
is a mathematical technicality.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.850
The identity element is supposed
to be a permutation p 1, 2, 3.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.090
And the identity element is
not going to change this one.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.420
So that's not good.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.220
So suppose you have one
transposition, and changes

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.430
the state, a transposition
should produce a minus sign,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.680
because it's anti-symmetric.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.530
But suppose you have
now two transpositions.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.950
You act on them with
two transpositions.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.540
One will change its sign.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.830
The other will change its sign.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.060
Now the total
double transposition

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.070
is a permutation operator.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.040
Shouldn't change the
sign of the state.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.690
So in fact, this is untenable.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.870
We're not even-- so even
if we postulate something,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.750
we'd have to postulate
something that makes some sense.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.140
And so far, it
doesn't make sense.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.360
So what can we use?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.870
We can use the fact that
there's some even permutations

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.920
and some odd permutations.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.210
So we'll put the
sign factor here,

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:38.280
psi A. This is the only
way to solve this problem

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.919
is to put the sign factor
epsilon sub alpha associated

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.220
to the permutation.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.680
Sometimes it's
going to be a minus.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.050
Sometimes it's
going to be a plus.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.680
For example, for the identity
operator, it should be a plus.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.320
For a transposition,
it should be a minus.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.740
So what is this epsilon alpha?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:05.880
Epsilon alpha is
equal to 1 if p alpha

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:14.490
is an even [? transpose ?] even
or minus 1 if p alpha is odd.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.740
So an odd permutation
is one that

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.150
has an odd number
of transpositions.

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.295
So that makes sense.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.550
This is a way to do
this consistently.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.260
If you have a single
transposition,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.410
and we'll put the minus, but
if you have two transposition,

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.350
it will put a
plus, as it should.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:48.710
And the identity element
is an even permutation.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.870
Therefore, it works as well.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.740
So this is a nice thing.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.990
This is the only
way you can define

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:02.430
this anti-symmetric states,
even before we construct them.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:11.030
So here are the names, and we'll
stop and build them next time.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:23.270
So the symmetric
state, symmetric states

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:43.540
form a subspace of VN
called sym N V. Symmetric

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:51.790
in N states of V. The
anti-symmetric states

00:10:51.790 --> 00:11:07.070
form a subspace of VN
called anti N of V.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:14.450
And our task for next time is
to construct the projectors that

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.200
bring you down to
those spaces, analyze

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.300
what are the properties
of these spaces,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:25.340
and show that it solves the
problem of exchange degeneracy,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.180
and that requires an
extra postulate in quantum

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.570
mechanics, a postulate
for identical particles.
