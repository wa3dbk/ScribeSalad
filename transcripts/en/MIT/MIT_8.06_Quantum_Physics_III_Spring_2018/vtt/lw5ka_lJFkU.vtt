00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.080
PROFESSOR: So here it
is, connections formula,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.890
connection.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.400
So we'll take a
situation as follows.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.490
Here is the point of x equals a.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.790
I'll put just a here.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.230
Here is the x-axis.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.550
And I will imagine that I
have a linear potential.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.290
So we have a linear
potential here.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.810
Why do we imagine
a linear potential?

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.610
It's because the thing we
would really kind of want

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.090
to think about is what is called
the turning point, energy,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.050
and a potential.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.820
There's a turning point.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.110
But it's clear that near
enough to the turning point,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.600
this is linear.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720
And the problem for
the WKB approximation

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.650
fails, as we discussed, is
precisely in this region.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.780
Now, I will make one
claim that this is really

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.970
what's going to connect here.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.130
These two asymptotic expansions
that we've found here

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.950
are in fact WKB approximations
of our calculations.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.620
So our whole procedure
here is going

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.290
to be assuming that we have
a linear potential here,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.420
and I will take the linear
potential seriously.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.670
So I will imagine it
even goes forever.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.960
And what we're going
to do is find a way

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.470
from the turning point.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.115
So the energy is
going to be here.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.474
Here is v of x.

00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:10.190
x v of x, the energy.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.850
And then we have this region,
which is a WKB region.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.030
And we have this region over
here that is also WKB region.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.900
And the region in the
middle is not a WKB region.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.290
It's a region where
all solutions fail,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.830
WKB solutions fail.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.580
They're not valid
in this region.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.370
So let's assume, we have here,
therefore, a potential that

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.290
is linear, and, therefore
v of x minus the energy

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.402
is going to be a
number times x minus a,

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:13.200
where g is a positive constant.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.090
It has some units.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.040
v minus e is a linear function
that vanishes at x equals a.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.910
So this is a nice
description of the situation.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:37.390
And then you could
write a WKB solution.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.170
So what is your WKB solution?

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:50.910
Let's write the WKB solution,
psi WKB on the right,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.130
and then we'll write a WKB
solution on the left, the right

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.860
and left.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.040
So here is what we.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.260
Typical WKB solution
on the right.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.080
That is a forbidden region.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.860
Square root of kappa
of x, you would

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.990
have a decrease in
exponential, e to the minus a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.130
to x kappa of x
prime, d x prime.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.350
And then you have b over square
root of kappa of x, e to the a

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.650
to x kappa of x prime, dx prime.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.100
So this is what you've
been told is supposed

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.950
to be your WKB approximation.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.350
Decay in exponential,
a pre-factor,

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.960
growing exponential,
a pre-factor.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.830
And kappa of x is something that
you know from this potential.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.650
So this you would write for
any potential on the right

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.590
or on the left as well.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:19.180
And here, your kappa of x
squared is 2m over h squared,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.480
v of x minus e.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.480
That's the definition
of kappa squared.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.100
You're in the region
where v is greater than e,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:44.400
and therefore, this is equal to
2m g over h squared x minus a.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.650
So our next step is
a little calculation.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.600
We should simplify all
these quantities here.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.110
We should evaluate them,
because we have a kappa.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.450
You have a linear function.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.010
We can do the integrals.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.140
We can put what kappa is.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.160
So everything can be done here.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.590
So if we do it, what do we get?

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.600
So evaluate.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.070
We get the following.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.130
Now, I will introduce some
notation to write this.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:34.020
So first, I'll write
it, psi write of x WKB

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.020
equals 1 over
square root of eta.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.930
That's a symbol I haven't
defined yet, u to the 1/4,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:50.820
e to the minus 2/3,
u to the 3/2 plus b

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:58.290
square root of eta 1 over
u to the 1/4, e to the 2/3,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.280
u to the 3/2.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.300
OK, that's what you get.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.210
You'll recognize
the a and the b's.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:14.880
And here is what we need to
introduce a couple of variables

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.150
to make sure we know
what every symbol is.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.800
And here, they are.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:26.190
u is eta x minus a.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.840
And eta is 2m g over
h squared to the 1/3.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.890
Just roughly k squared
is proportional to u.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.730
So k is proportional
to u to the 1/2.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.810
And therefore, square root of
k gives you the u to the 1/4.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.420
The integrals also
work that way.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.440
And you see already
here, things that

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.600
look like the array function.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.790
And that will become
even clearer soon.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:20.990
So this is our solution for the
WKB expression on the right,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.500
but let's do also the WKB
expression on the left.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.540
The WKB expression
on the left would

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.680
be another wave of this
kind, but with cosines

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.260
or with exponentials
that we've done before.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.370
So what did it
used to look like?

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.060
It used to look like
k of x and integrals

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:19.210
of plus minus i integrals
of k of x prime dx prime.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.140
That was the way the WKB
solution looked like.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:33.580
I'm now trying to write this
expression for the WKB solution

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.390
on the right.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.580
Now, I want to make a
remark that even though I'm

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:46.150
using the linear
potential, in general,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.110
if your potential,
even eventually

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:59.740
becomes something different
in this region, I'm good.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.660
So I'm moving away
from the bad point

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.190
sufficiently so that the
WKB approximation is good.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.790
But I don't want to
move away so much, so

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.480
that the potential fails
dramatically to be linear.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:24.290
I have to straddle
limited region in fact.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.610
I don't want to go too far.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.300
So these were your
solutions before in a region

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.470
where you're in the
classically allowed region.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.210
Now, this form of the solutions
will not be practical for us.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.010
So I will write them, instead
with sines and cosines.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.185
It will be better
for us to write it

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:50.360
with sines and cosines.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.940
So let me write it
with sines and cosines.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:08.520
Psi left now WKB of u or x.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.320
Sorry.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.160
It's going to be c over
square root of k of x,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.830
and I will write the cosine
of integral from x to a.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.210
You see, I'm on the left.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.740
So it's natural to write
integral from x to a.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.330
On the other hand, on the right
was natural to write integrals

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.430
from a to x.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.760
And that's what we did,
cosine from x to a.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:48.900
We'll have here k of x
prime vx prime plus d

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:58.660
over square root of k of x
sine of x to a k of x prime dx

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.130
prime.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.050
And you could say
look, that's good.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.370
You just traded the exponentials
for sines and cosines,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.820
and that's fine.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.890
Still, for what we're
going to do later,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.790
it's convenient to write
our WKB approximations still

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.010
in a little different way.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:28.350
I can add a phase here
and a phase there.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.230
And that still is the
most general solution,

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.490
because they're both
sines and cosines.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.530
And unless I would put a
phase that differs pi over 2,

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.230
and one becomes equal
to the other, no.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:49.350
I'm going to shift
both by pi over 4,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.520
and therefore, these are
still different functions,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.660
and it's convenient to do that.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.350
So this is our onset
for the WKB solution.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.720
We have to do the
same thing with it

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:19.200
here in which we expand and
evaluate in terms of and eta

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.380
in this quantity.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.570
So what do we get?

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:31.770
We get c over square root of
eta u to the 1/4 cosine 2/3 u

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:40.800
to the 3/2 minus pi over 4 plus
d over square root of eta u

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:52.250
to the 1/4 sine of 2/3 u
to the 3/2 minus pi over 4.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:14:01.095
So this is our
psi left WKB of x.

00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:08.070
OK.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.600
We're in good shape.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.930
I'm going to raise this up.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:31.290
And now you could say, all
right, you've done the WKB.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.960
But on the other hand, how
about the exact solution?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.920
What is the exact
solution to this problem?

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.620
You've written the
WKB approximation

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.550
for the linear potential,
the WKB approximation

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:48.600
for the linear potential.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.880
Now, what is the exact
solution for the problem?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.250
Well, your Schrodinger
equation is

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.780
minus h squared over
2n psi double dot

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:07.775
of x plus of x minus the
energy on psi is equal to 0.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.890
Well, we've written this
already a couple of times.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.690
So this is minus h
squared over 2m psi

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:25.780
double dot plus g x
minus a psi equals 0.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.900
That is our v minus e.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:42.090
And in terms of the u variable,
the differential equation,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:49.275
of course, becomes the second
psi, the u squared equal u psi.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:56.830
That's why the area
function is relevant here.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.960
We get back to that equation.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:06.950
That is the equation for
the exact linear potential,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.810
and those would be
the exact solutions.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:18.530
So our exact solutions are psi
being some linear combination

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:24.010
of the array function and
the other array function.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.810
And now let's do one case first
before we get into something

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.840
that is more complicated.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:48.850
Let's take psi to
be the solution

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:54.310
to be the array
function ai of u.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.520
That's your solution now.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.310
If that is your
solution, you would

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:09.310
have this behavior,
the behavior we've

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.105
noted here for this solution.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.320
And now you compare and
you look at what you got.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.110
You say, all right,
I have a solution,

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.600
and I know how it
looks rigorously,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.840
how it looks to the
right and to the left.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.620
That's how it looks, and
this is the exact solution.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:52.040
This is the WKB solution, and I
know how it looks to the right

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.770
and how it looks to the left.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.460
And I see the correspondence.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:08.410
We see this term in
yellow is a solution

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.520
that this a decaying
exponential,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.590
and we see it here.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:25.520
And we have the red
term, the oscillations.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.430
And we see it also here.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.380
So here is that
connection condition.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.630
In fact, when you derive
this asymptotic expansions,

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.080
you did the true
connection condition,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.850
because you connected a
single function from the left

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.710
and from the right.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.130
Here it was to the right.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.630
Here it was to the left.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:03.010
And it's a connection formula
because it's the same function.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:09.030
So here, we see that if
we wrote the WKB solution,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:15.540
and we were aiming at
maybe this solution,

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:24.210
we would have that this term
goes, connects with this term.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.710
And the coefficients
differ by 1/2.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.440
That 1/2 has no
other explanation

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.470
than the asymptotic expansions.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.470
There's the square root
of pi, these things,

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.750
and there's the two functions.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.550
So if you put the 1/2 is
there in the exponential,

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:54.800
so you could put the 1/2
here, and 2a, if you wish.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.390
So you realize that in
order to have a connection

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.275
2a would be equal to c.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.620
The two coefficients here
are related in that way.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.740
There's a number here
and a number here.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.790
It happens to be 2a
and c in this case.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.920
So 2a is equal to c.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:27.670
So if we choose a equals
1, we would have c equal 2.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.680
So here is a matching
condition therefore.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:39.070
We have that a WKB
solution that has

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:46.240
the c factor with c equals 2, so
it would be 2 overs square root

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:53.080
of k of x in here
times cosine of this x

00:20:53.080 --> 00:21:03.250
over a k of x prime, dx prime
minus pi over 4 is connected--

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.170
we'll see more on that--

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:09.970
with 1 over square
root of kappa of x,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:20.170
this solution with a equals
to 1, what we have here,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:27.040
e to the minus a over x
kappa of x prime dx prime.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:43.170
So that is the first
connection condition.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.010
We will discuss it further
in a couple of minutes,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:52.150
but this is how
you connect things.

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.860
A single solution of the
differential equation

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.150
looks like this term and
like that term on the left

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.200
and on the right.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.260
Here is your WKB solution.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:06.280
This general solution
looks like this term,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.740
and it then should
match to something

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.850
that looks like that if you
have the array function.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:20.240
So in general, for
not linear potentials,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.310
this is the term that
gives rise to that,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.180
so we take that
this term in general

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:31.930
is matched to the top term
in the blackboard here.
