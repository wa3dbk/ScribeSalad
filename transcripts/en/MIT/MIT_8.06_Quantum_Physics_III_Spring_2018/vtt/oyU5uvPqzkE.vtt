00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.970
PROFESSOR: So here is
a problem example based

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.620
on Griffith's problem 9.3.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:32.479
So it's a two-state system, and
we'll call the states a and b,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.820
with energy's Ea and Eb.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.410
And we'll call omega 0
the difference Ea minus Eb

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.535
over h bar.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.970
So those are energy
eigenstates, which

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.790
means that H0 is really Ea Eb.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.945
We represent the first
column vector by the state a.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:16.170
The second state is the
second column vector

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.360
with entry 0 and 1--

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.500
is the state b.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.620
That's why the matrix
looks like that.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.290
And then you put a perturbation.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.400
And the perturbation,
delta H, is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.880
going to take the form U delta
t, where U is a matrix that

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.540
has Uaa, Uab, Uba, Ubb--

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240
the matrix elements.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.820
And they're simple enough.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.800
It's a 0 here and an alpha
here, and an alpha dagger here.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.450
It should be a Hermitian matrix,
and that's the way it is.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.800
The letter U, I
guess, is not great,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.520
because it suggests unitary.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.070
But maybe I should put a v.
I'll leave it, to not create

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.600
problems with my notation.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.150
So here is the question.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.610
This is your
perturbation Hamiltonian.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.040
Actually, I wrote it wrong here.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.800
It's a delta function of t.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.740
That's delta H. So in terms
of H0 applies everywhere,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.530
H0 applies everywhere,
and in the middle

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.320
there is a delta H for
one little instant.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.810
So what happens here?

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.310
We're going to try to
figure out what's going on.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.860
But the question will
be posed as follows.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:10.630
Assume the system is in the
state a for t less than 0.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.800
Let's ask the probability
to be in the state

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.610
b for t greater than 0.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.250
Find the probability to
be, and be greater than 0.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.600
So what's going on?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.330
Here are the states a and b.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.150
They were eigenstates of H0.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.050
If you had the system in the
state a-- that's an energy

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.040
eigenstate--

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.800
it would stay in
the state a forever.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.110
It wouldn't do anything.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.000
Indeed if whoever
prepared that state,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.960
ever since he or she prepared
it, it has stayed in the state

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.210
a until time equals 0.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.450
But then the system
is kicked and it's

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.260
kicked with some delta
function strength,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.990
and in the off-diagonal terms.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.670
That's pretty important.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.250
It's not kicked on the diagonal
terms, it's kicked here.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.110
So these terms suggest a
transition from state a

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.390
to b here.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.890
And presumably, due to this,
the system will transition.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.100
And when it transitions, it
must transition instantaneously

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.940
in a sense.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.080
Because if it takes
time to transition,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.420
the delta function
asks for zero time.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.450
If it takes time to transition,
then it would not transition.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.010
Because after the delta
function has come and gone,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.050
the system doesn't
change anymore.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.870
So it really has to
transition instantaneously.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.450
So at time equals
0, you must generate

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.115
a probability or an amplitude
to be in the state b already.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.640
So there must be an
immediate transition

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.740
in which the state,
originally, at time less than 0

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.620
was the state a, but at
time a little bit after zero

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.340
must be a little bit of
a plus a little bit of b.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.080
So this is t0 minus,
0 minus, and 0 plus.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.080
At 0 minus, it's
a, and at 0 plus

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.920
must be something like that.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.910
Because if at 0
plus it's still a,

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.800
it's going to stay a forever.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
So it must have some amplitude
to be at b at 0 plus.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.650
So you're having your first
transition amplitude problem--

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.270
how does an interaction make you
jump from one state to another?

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.750
Now my letters here, alpha
and beta, are pretty bad--

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.790
U and V maybe--

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.810
because I have an alpha
there in the interaction.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.090
And maybe, if you
think perturbatively,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.540
you would say, look,
if alpha is very small,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.130
there must be a small
transition probability.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.830
If the perturbation
is of order alpha,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.030
maybe I expect the perturbed
state to be of order alpha.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.470
So maybe, after all,
this is like alpha times

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.960
b, or proportional to alpha
times b, a number here.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.790
And this one-- well,
if alpha is very small,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.660
that's probably
roughly about 1 still--

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.690
a little bit less,
alpha squared less,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.580
for probability conservation.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.040
But I expect an alpha b here.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:25.030
So OK, when you're given
a problem like that,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.000
under normal conditions
it's a good idea

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.510
to think about it before
trying to solve it.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.630
And I think we've done a
little bit of thinking.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.740
We've realized the state
stays in a after a while,

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.775
and immediately must transition
into some other state.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.390
And once it's in that
other state, its going

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.960
to remain in that state forever
because those are energy

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.425
eigenstates, so you're going
to get exponentials of E

00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:56.860
to the minus iEt.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.580
But this is going to be that.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.620
OK, so let's solve this.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.350
Here is our equation.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.580
Let's try to write
it for this case.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:15.660
So I would have i
h bar C a dot of t.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.240
We have two states--

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.850
1 and 2-- but here is a and b.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:29.160
So you would have i omega a
then something, t and delta H

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.320
a with something.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.000
Well, the delta H is
clear that it can only

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.100
be a delta H from a to b.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.140
Because there's Uab.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.750
There's only that
transition amplitude.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:51.420
And then it would
be an i omega ab,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:09:06.900
which was defined as omega 0,
delta Hab of time, cb of time.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.970
And that's the only term that
exists here from the sum.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.420
You could sum over a and b, but
we saw that over a, you get 0.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.570
So there's just this term.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:25.235
And then we have i H
bar Cb dot of [? t ?]

00:09:25.235 --> 00:09:28.560
is equal to E to the i.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.410
And now you're
going to have ba--

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:38.910
so delta Hba of t Ca of t.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.990
And here I would
have omega ba, which

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.180
is the opposite sign as
omega ab, which we anyway

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.840
call omega 0.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.850
So here's minus i omega 0 t.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.260
Yes.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
perturbation disappears?

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.134
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.912
AUDIENCE: Does the
perturbation vanish?

00:10:03.912 --> 00:10:04.620
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:14.480
Because delta Haa is equal
to 0, and therefore there's

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.840
no coupling to Ca.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:24.200
And delta Hbb is 0 from
that matrix element.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.750
And therefore, you
cannot couple b to b.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:40.690
And now I'll just write
it i H bar Ca dot of t,

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:49.030
i H bar Cb dot of t is
equal E to the i omega 0t.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:55.150
Delta Hab was alpha
delta of time--

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.820
Cb of t.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.850
And this is E to
the minus i omega

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:06.400
0t, alpha star delta of time--

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.450
Ca of t.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:15.411
Hba was Uba, which is alpha
star times the delta function

00:11:15.411 --> 00:11:15.910
of time.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.020
Here I have a delta
function of time.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.390
It says that this only matters
when time is equal to 0.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.080
So things are a
little delicate here.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.610
But let's see.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.530
Can I write here--

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:44.340
well, if I have f of
x times delta of x,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.170
we know this is f of
0 times delta of x.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.600
Because anyway, only
zeros [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.840
So I can put time equals
0 here, and forget

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:02.850
about this exponential-- have
alpha delta of t, cb of t,

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:09.960
and here have alpha
star delta of t Ca of t.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.130
Everybody happy so far?

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:28.200
But here, I have Cb of t
and Ca of t, and a delta t.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:34.800
So I should put alpha
delta of t Cb at 0,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:42.401
and alpha star
delta of t Ca at 0.

00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:42.900
Right?

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:46.365
Yes?

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.860
People look less convinced,
which I congratulate you

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.110
for doubting this.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.030
This would be bad.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.880
It seems like I'm just
following the logic,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.720
but I've gone too far now.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.260
Why did I go too far?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.190
First, this is going
to be a disaster.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:22.000
Because in many ways, we don't
know what these numbers are.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.190
You see, we are argued
that this is going

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.850
to change this continuously.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.910
Those numbers are going to
change this continuously.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.950
At time equals 0--

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:38.290
before time equals 0,
Ca was 1 and Cb was 0.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:42.010
But after time equals 0, Cb
is going to be a number--

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.070
something that we don't know.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.040
So the delta function,
which does it

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.250
hiy-- the one before 0, the
one after 0, the average?

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.240
What does it do?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.440
This is a case where you
have a delta function that we

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.400
don't know what it's doing.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.600
So this is totally wrong.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.940
So I will just stop there.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.600
And I will consider,
however these two equations.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:23.070
So we have the equations
now in a nice way.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.390
I'll reconsider them.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.090
And we are facing a
difficulty, the difficulty

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:35.120
of the delta function not
allowing us to treat nicely

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:46.510
the transition of i h bar Ca dot
is equal to alpha delta of Cb,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:55.250
and i h bar Cb dot equal
alpha star delta of t Ca.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:08.880
Well now, the only way to
resolve this difficulty

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.270
is to think about
this physically,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.740
and introduce a regulator
that is physical.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:22.070
You see, no signal in the world
really is a delta function.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:27.720
Nothing becomes infinite, and
nothing lasts for zero time.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.910
So this interaction,
this delta function,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.120
represents a function of time--

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.940
delta of time.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:44.880
It's a spike, but we can think
of it as a regulated thing.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.970
You've regulated delta
functions in all kinds of ways.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.330
It might be useful to
regulate it as follows,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:57.720
as a function of time that
is 0 before time equals 0,

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.980
it's 0 after some
time, t star, and it

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.620
has height 1 over t star.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.705
That's a picture of
a delta function.

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.640
It has the right area at least.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.060
And we're going to
think of this system

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:28.770
as exactly doing that
in between, for t,

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:33.910
in the interval 0 to t star.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.850
The delta function
is going to be

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.090
replaced by this function,
this constant function.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:46.170
So it will have i
h bar h Ca dot is

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:53.645
equal to alpha over t star Cb.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:10.089
And i h bar Cb dot is equal
to alpha star over t sub star.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.780
Now the star doesn't mean
complex conjugation for t.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.040
It's just a number, a glyph
called t0 or something

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:18.970
like that.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.569
And this is true for
this time interval.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:29.740
And then you would say, look,
I have two problems with this.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.980
First, you've entered
this at t star,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.170
and now your calculation is
going to depend on t star.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.090
And then the answer is
going to depend on t star.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.780
And what are you going
to put for t star?

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.720
Well, that better not happen.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.210
We have to go on a limb.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.490
Many times when you do a
calculation of something,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.540
you go on a limb.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.540
You say something,
and see if it works.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.220
This seems reasonable.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.040
And what we expect
is that we will

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.710
find an answer that this
independent on this t star.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:11.870
So that we can take this star
to 0 and make sense of it.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.240
The other question
that could come

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.330
is that, oh, that was
your delta function.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.420
So one seconds, you used
delta function for this.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.460
Maybe we have to put back these
terms, these exponentials.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.580
We set them to 1.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.520
But then you could
say, look, I don't

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.630
think I have to put them back.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:37.760
Why?

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.850
Because I can choose t
star as small as I want,

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.980
such that omega t star,
which is the possible value

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:54.470
that this can get, at most,
is like 10 to the minus 60.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.805
And therefore, this phase is
going to be 0, essentially,

00:18:57.805 --> 00:18:59.300
and that's going to be 1.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.890
So I claim that I don't have
to worry about this anymore.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.180
So what do we have?

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:12.320
We have two simple differential
equations, like this.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:19.940
With the conditions that
Ca at time equals 0 is 1,

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:25.600
and Cb at time equals 0 is 0.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:32.120
The state before the delta
function hits is given by that.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.240
And now what we want
to know is, how much is

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.810
Ca after the delta function and
Cb after the delta function?

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:53.020
So for that, we have
all the tools needed.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.910
I can take this equation.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.745
This is a coupled
system of equations.

00:19:57.745 --> 00:19:59.290
It's a simple system.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.150
I could differentiate
again here.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:10.250
And I get a Ca double-dot, Cb
dot, and use this equation.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:17.740
So you get the equation-- if you
differentiate again, take a dot

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:25.180
to form Ca double-dot, you
get that Ca double-dot is

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:35.875
equal to minus alpha over
h bar t star squared Ca.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.090
You can see that you put the i
h bar here, take the derivative,

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.090
you get an alpha times
an alpha star, which

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.880
is length of alpha squared.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.230
And the h bar appears two
times, t star appears two times.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.140
This is an oscillating solution.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.860
So that's simple enough.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:16.430
So what happens here is that
Ca will oscillate in time,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.440
and you will have a
solution of the form

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:31.850
Ca is equal to a constant, beta
0 cosine of alpha h bar t star

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:42.390
t, plus beta 1 sine of
alpha p, over h bar t star.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:53.090
And if you wish, Cb
from the first equation

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.230
is proportional to Ca dot.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.570
And Ca dot is going
to be of the form beta

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:14.570
0 sine off this thing, plus
beta 1 cosine of this thing.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.120
OK, so we've turned this into
a tractable problem because

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.270
of flattening the
delta function.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:36.050
And your initial conditions--
again, Cb must vanish at time

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.910
equals 0.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:44.000
So if Cb must vanish at time
equals 0, beta 1 must be 0.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.260
If beta 1 is zero,
this term is gone,

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.480
and Ca was 1 for time equals 0.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.820
So beta 0 is 1.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:18.570
Therefore, Ca is equal to cosine
alpha t, over h star t star

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.900
Ca of t.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:31.150
And Cb of t, you can calculate
it from the top equation.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.450
You take the derivative
of Ca, and divide

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:38.080
by alpha multiplied by t star.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.730
I'll let you do it.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:54.460
You get minus i alpha,
over alpha, sine, alpha t

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.930
over ht star.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:05.740
OK, we solved for the functions.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.160
We know what's going to happen.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.640
And now, what did we want?

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.020
We wanted to know what are
those things for later times,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.350
for times t star or more.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.340
Now you cannot use this
equation beyond time t star,

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.470
because they assumed the
delta function is there.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.230
So what you have
to figure out is

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.690
what are these coefficients
at time t star.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.150
And those would be the
coefficients at any later time,

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.100
because there's no
more Hamiltonian.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:45.800
So Ca at t greater than
t star is, in fact,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.840
equal to Ca at t star.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.850
And Ca at t star,
happily, is a number

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.640
that doesn't depend on t star--

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.570
cosine alpha over h bar.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:11.900
And Cb at t greater than
t star is Cb at t star.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.710
It doesn't change any
more after the delta

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:18.500
function has turned off.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:27.740
And Cb at t star is minus
i alpha over alpha--

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:40.235
alpha over alpha, like this,
times sine of alpha over h bar.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.290
And this is really
what you wanted.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:54.130
Now you know what the state
is doing after the delta

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.810
function has turned on.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:02.240
It has this amplitude
to be in the b state.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.950
And it is, as we
predicted-- remember,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:11.100
this is like the face of alpha,
because the alpha is alpha

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.720
times its face--

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.690
length of alpha times it
face, and it will cancel.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.270
And here you have
sine of this quantity.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.380
So it is proportional.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.020
Cb is proportional to alpha.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.900
And that's exactly
what you would expect.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.785
So just to complete the
story, let's write the answer.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.410
And what is the answer?

00:26:52.410 --> 00:27:02.490
Phi of t for t greater than
0 is the coefficient Ca

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:09.630
of t, which was cosine,
alpha over h bar,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:17.850
times E to the minus
iEat, over h bar a.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:23.400
Remember, the solution is
Ca E to the minus iEta.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:32.490
And then the other one, which
is minus i alpha, over alpha,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:47.280
sine of alpha over h bar, e to
the minus iEbt over h bar, b.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:54.160
That is the state after the
delta function has turned on.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.090
And what is the
probability to be

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:01.935
found in the state b, time t?

00:28:01.935 --> 00:28:09.870
It would be b times
the state squared.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:20.370
So you get-- b will couple just
to that. b with b gives you 1.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:21.940
This is a phase.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.730
This is a phase.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.240
Sine squared of
this thing is sine

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:33.570
squared of alpha over h bar.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.730
What is the
probability to be in a?

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.420
It's a psi of t.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:48.460
And in this case, it
will be cosine squared

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.370
of alpha over h bar.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.910
And it's very handy
that cosine squared

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.180
plus sine squared is
equal to 1, because it

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:02.680
has to be either in a or on b.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.490
And it's kind of
interesting, if you

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.890
were doing this in
perturbation-- we solved it

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:09.610
exactly.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.680
If you were doing this
in perturbation theory,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:19.300
we would have found P of b
proportional to alpha squared.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.840
Because the first term
in the expansion here,

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.020
in terms of the interaction.
