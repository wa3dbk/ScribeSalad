00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.260
PROFESSOR: So this is
our adiabatic change.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.890
So now we can say
several things.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.340
OK, if omega is changing slowly,
the energy is changing slowly,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.420
but do we have something that
changes even more slowly,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.390
something that really
almost doesn't change?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.990
What you need here
is basically--

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.254
this was a very
important discovery

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:34.130
in classical mechanics.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
You need like two
things that change.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.070
Everything is going
to change slowly,

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.180
but then there's going to be
one thing that changes slowly

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.580
and another thing
that changes slowly,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.600
and they change kind of in
the same way in such a way

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840
that the ratio or some
combination of them

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.400
doesn't change almost at all.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.930
That's what we're trying to get.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.700
Anybody knows in classical
mechanics what quantity here

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.035
doesn't change much?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.340
Nobody.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.220
No clue?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.990
It's not obvious what
doesn't change much,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.260
but here is the claim.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:54.570
Claim is that the quantity
that doesn't change much

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.945
is, in fact, the energy
divided by omega.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.680
The energy will change slowly.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.690
Omega will change slowly.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.560
But the ratio is almost
not going to change at all.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.780
So here is the claim.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.840
There is an I of t called
adiabatic invariant, which

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.090
is basically H of t
divided by omega of t,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.690
and it's almost constant.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.520
And this quantity has the
units of energy times time.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.160
I don't want to give
away the whole story.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.760
But I think it's good
if you, at this moment,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.190
think a second, well, what
could it mean, or do I even have

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.310
a clue why this could happen?

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.280
And you think oh,
quantum mechanics.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.040
The harmonic oscillator,
what happened?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.130
The energy was equal to
h omega times the level.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.160
So kind of energy
divided by omega

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.090
is kind of a nice quantity.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.020
It's a quantum number.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.290
Quantum numbers are
quantized, and they

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.250
don't like to
change, because how

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.950
could an integer change slowly?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.290
As soon as it changes,
it changes big.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.810
So a little bit of
what we're getting at

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.300
is the resistance of a system
to change quantum level.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.050
When something is quantized,
it cannot change slowly,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.290
and the adiabatic invariant is
exploiting in classical physics

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.940
that quantum
property, if you wish.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.740
So let's look at that.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.730
So the claim is that the name
i is for adiabatic invariant,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.130
and we can verify it, and get
some intuition as to why those

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.130
very slowly.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.050
Now, I cannot prove that
thing doesn't change.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.150
That would be too much, but it's
going to change very slowly.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.960
You will appreciate that.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.220
Let's see.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.780
Let's compute the
derivative, di dt.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.250
So it's a ratio.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.630
So I have omega squared.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.320
Omega.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.330
I'm going to use
dots, and I'm going

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.770
to stop writing the
factor, the key dependents.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.730
Omega H dot minus H omega dot.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.910
So what do we have here?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.790
Omega, H dot was calculated
up there, m omega,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:21.810
omega dot x squared minus
H p squared over 2m minus--

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.220
no, minus.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:38.330
Plus 1/2 m omega squared
x squared times omega dot

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.730
over omega squared.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.490
And well, I still remember
when I first saw that.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.770
I probably wanted the numerator
to cancel and to do something

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.830
very nice and simplify a lot.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.850
But it doesn't happen.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.545
So let's see what
really happens.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.650
Well, you have this
term, omega squared,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.000
omega dot, x squared
m, omega squared,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.650
omega dot, x squared m.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.700
But the factors of 2
don't make it cancel.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.130
So it's there.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.925
So let me write what we
get when we simplify this.

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:30.080
di dt is equal to omega dot
over omega squared times

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.680
1/2 m omega squared x squared
minus p squared over 2m.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.870
That term is clear.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:51.080
The p squared is that, and
here, we cancel the 1, partially

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.700
with a 1/2.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.940
So we've got this.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.110
OK, so it doesn't look
like it wants to be 0.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.780
But it's still very good.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.940
Let's see why that
result is nice.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.200
Well, one thing you realize
here is that it actually

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.680
gave you kind of
back the Hamiltonian

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.410
with a different sine there.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.090
This is negative, and
this will remain positive.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:28.360
So let's write this, this
omega dot omega squared.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.420
And this is the kinetic energy
minus the potential energy,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.330
well, the potential
energy v of t

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.860
minus the kinetic energy k of
t in the harmonic oscillator.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:53.730
Moreover, this quantity
is already very small.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.880
So this thing is very
small, but the fact

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.940
that the adiabatic
invariant is adiabatic

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.290
that it's really good,
should go beyond this.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.490
There should be something
suppressing about this factor,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.640
because you know, this
came from just the fact

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.260
that things vary with omega dot.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.090
So what is happening?

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.805
This is small and
slowly varying.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:44.120
This is neither small, nor
slowly varying, in fact.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.120
Why?

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.610
Potential minus kinetic energy.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.400
The potential energy
in an oscillator

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.450
goes up when the
kinetic energy is 0.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.130
I see the oscillator goes
to the end, stretches

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.900
[INAUDIBLE] potential energy is
large, the kinetic energy is 0.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.810
As it goes through the
center, the equilibrium point,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.950
the kinetic energy is larger.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.280
So this is oscillating.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.030
And it's very large,
but now, you probably

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:22.330
remember this fact about
the harmonic oscillators.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.740
While the potential and
kinetic energies oscillate,

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.350
their averages are the same.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.240
So that's how this term
is going to help you.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.230
The average of this quantity
is roughly 0 over any period.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.660
And a period over a period,
this quantity changes little.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.500
So this is going to help us.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.800
Let me remind you here, suppose
you have an oscillation,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:07.770
an x equals sine omega t, then
the momentum would be m x dot,

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:17.730
so m omega cosine omega
t, and the kinetic energy

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.900
minus the potential energy, if
you do this little calculation,

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:28.710
will go like omega
squared cosine of 2

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:34.200
omega t, the v minus k.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.680
I leave for you that
little calculation.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.450
But it will go like cosine of
2 omega t, twice the period.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.790
And that thing tends
to have a 0 average.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.660
So let's see what happens now.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.110
The idt to see
what happens to it.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:11:04.900
Let's calculate I at t plus
the period minus I at some t.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.410
So let's see how much
I changes in a period.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.810
So from here, we
have the derivative.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:27.830
So we must do the integral
from t to t plus t of the dI dt

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.240
prime dt prime.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.340
So this will be the
integral from t to t

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:42.250
plus capital T of this whole
thing, omega dot over omega

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:47.610
squared of t times v of t--

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:54.075
it's all t prime, actually-- vt
prime minus kt prime dt prime.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:00.550
Let's see that.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.070
You have the
derivative of I, so you

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.400
can calculate the change in I by
integrating with the derivative

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.580
of I over mep.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.650
We've done that, and we've
asked how much does this thing

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.020
change over a period.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:24.220
Then we have that I of
t plus t minus I of t,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.460
we have an integral
over a period.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:33.110
We set this quantity very slowly
and very little over a period,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:40.060
so roughly speaking, this is
equal to omega dot over omega

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.330
squared at t.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.900
It didn't change much
over the integral.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.080
And then we have the
integral over a period

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.340
of the potential energy
minus the kinetic energy.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.430
And for a normal oscillator
that is time independent,

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.690
this quantity is strictly 0.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.780
If omega was not changing,
this would be identically 0.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.630
So if omega is changing
slowly, this quantity

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.750
must be very close to 0.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.660
It's identically 0
when it doesn't change.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.190
Therefore, you see you got
an extra suppression factor.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.650
The change in the adiabatic,
so-called adiabatic invariant

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:48.460
over time was already small,
because everything goes slow.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.280
But there is an
extra suppression

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.060
due to the fact that
these two energies have

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.940
the same average over a period.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.480
So you gain something.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:08.180
If the energy changes slowly,
this energy over omega

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:13.340
changes even much
more slowly than that.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:36.820
So this is really exactly 0
for time independent omega,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:49.470
approximately 0 for slow
omega, slowly changing omega.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.500
So that's the extra
suppression factor,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.870
and that's what makes this an
adiabatic invariant, something

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:03.030
that really changes
dramatically slower

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:08.300
in a system in which everything
is already changing slowly.
