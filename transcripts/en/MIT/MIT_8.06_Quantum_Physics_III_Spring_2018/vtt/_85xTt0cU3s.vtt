00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.250
PROFESSOR: So let's
attempt to solve something.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.550
And that first step is going
to be nice and simple and very

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.020
illuminating, as well.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.790
So we're going to do a
three step procedure.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.856
Three step procedure.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.520
Three step procedure.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
And basically,
we're going to use

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.220
this equation, the
ordered lambda equation,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.340
to find the energy corrections.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.260
One, ordered lambda equation
for energy corrections.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:03.600
Two, ordered lambda equation
to find the component of n1k

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.820
in v hat.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.280
And three, we're going to
look at the ordered lambda 2

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.260
equation to find the
component of that same state

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.670
in the degenerate subspace.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.730
So let's do the first step.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.200
And for that, we're going
to overlap that equation,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.885
this ordered lambda equation.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.740
So for step one, we're going
to hit the equation with n0l

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.580
from the left.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.790
OK.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.850
n0l from the left.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.910
Here it comes.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.560
Boom.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.700
It's here.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.450
What happens now?

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.570
Well, h0 on that
state, n0l, that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.770
is part of the
degenerate subspace.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.870
So it has energy n0 with respect
to the original unperturbed

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.980
Hamiltonian.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.450
So you get n0 minus n0, it's 0.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.090
So the left hand side vanishes.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.250
Kills left hand side.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.090
So we just look at
the right hand side.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:48.260
And we got n0l Enk1 minus
delta H n0k equals 0.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.330
That was the right hand side.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.710
So far, so good.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.350
Nice and simple.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.220
From here, what do we get?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.180
Let's write it just by moving
one term to the left and one

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.050
term to the right.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:14.780
n0k Enk1 delta lk.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:28.010
And this should be true for
all k and l in 1 up to n.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.460
Because those
equations are for all k

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.510
and we could have
hit with all l.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.385
And now this is an
amazingly nice equation.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.450
It tells you a nice story.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.740
What is this story?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.210
The story is that look at this.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.310
This equation says that if you
want this to hold it better

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:05.440
be that delta H is diagonal on
the basis that you're using.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.590
Because for k and l
running in n by n.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:22.420
So this says that delta H
is diagonal in the chosen

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.700
basis of the subspace vn.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.430
Delta H is not
diagonal elsewhere.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.210
On the big space, it
may not be diagonal.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.360
But on the little degenerate
space, it better be diagonal.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.470
So what it says is that, if you
want to start your perturbation

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.790
theory, you cannot use an
arbitrary basis of states.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.530
Maybe you chose it wrong.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.830
You have to start in
the degenerate subspace

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.910
with a basis that makes
the perturbation diagonal.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.360
And that's what our
little example had.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.100
It says, even to
begin with, you should

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.520
have started with the basis
that makes the perturbation

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.510
diagonal.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.830
In that case, you will find
the formulas giving you

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.570
the right answers.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.090
And then, once you have
the matrix being diagonal,

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.580
you can take l equal to k.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.860
And then you'll find
on the right hand

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.400
sides Enk1 is equal to n.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.210
l is equal to k,
so n0k delta H n0k.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.400
So the energy corrections
are the diagonal elements

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.450
of this matrix.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.900
What you would expect.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.770
So we will write this as
delta H. We could put kk,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.710
but to remind you,
its degenerate.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.330
You put nk nk.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.630
So we've done the
first step and we've

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.440
realized that this
perturbation is a little funny.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.220
You really have to get
started with the right basis.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.930
And what is the right basis?

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.460
The basis that makes
delta H diagonal.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.740
We'll see that everything
is much simpler

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.310
if the eigenvalues of this
matrix are all different.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.290
So the degeneracy is broken.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.260
Then things are easier.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.250
If the degeneracy is not
broken, then the degeneracy

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.850
may be broken to
order lambda squared,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.690
which is more interesting
and it will be something

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.500
we'll study next time.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.940
So that's all.
