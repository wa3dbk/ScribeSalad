00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.280
PROFESSOR: How do we think
of the Born approximation?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.059
Well, we can imagine a
diagrammatic expression

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.940
when we use propagators.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.540
Propagators are things
that take a signal

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.960
and propagate it
in some direction.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:36.190
So think of your scattering
center here, and, of course,

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.320
we were supposed
to look far away

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.650
but I don't have enough
room on the blackboard.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.090
I'll take this point
to be far away.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.310
And now what does it
say, this equation?

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.080
It says that the first Born
approximation, you get that r,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.490
the incident wave.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.040
The incident wave has reached r.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.230
This is the incident wave of r.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:13.980
So I will represent this as a
wave that reaches the point r.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.390
That's the first term
on the right hand

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.700
side, a line reaching r.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.280
Because a wave has come in
that direction and reached r.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.890
On the other hand, this
is a little different.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.010
What is the physical
interpretation of this term?

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.160
This is a wave that
reached r prime.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.100
And this wave was
shaken by the potential

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.830
and created the source, as
if the potential of r prime

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.740
was a medium.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960
The wave reached r prime, shook
the potential, and then a wave

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.880
appeared that was propagated
by the propagator, the Green's

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.380
function.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.680
It took it from r
prime, it took it to r.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.730
So our interpretation
of this diagrammatically

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.690
is that another part
of the incoming wave

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.950
came here and got to
the point r prime.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.930
At the point r
prime, it interacted

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.440
with the potential,
which is a medium,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:53.230
and out came a wave
in the direction of r

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.860
and reached there.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.230
And r prime is supposed
to be integrated.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.250
But that's kind
of in the figure.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.960
So this is the
zeroth order term,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.080
this is the first order term,
wave that reaches r prime,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.970
wave that reaches [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.250
Now I can include
the second term.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.870
I could include
it in this diagram

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.580
but I would confuse things.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.860
So let's draw another one.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.315
[INAUDIBLE] thing
doesn't look the same.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.370
I won't get them
to look the same.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.460
Doesn't matter.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.030
Here is r still, and what
is our second wave doing?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.390
Our second wave, we
could put it here

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.750
and imagine that you have
here the e to the ikr.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:09.580
So here you would have e to
the ik dot r double prime.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.130
So the wave reaches the point
r double prime, which is here.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.320
And from the point
r double prime,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.450
it interacts with the medium--

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.340
that's that heavy dot--

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.090
and gets propagated
into r prime, which

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.980
is also inside the material.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.345
So another wave,
and here is r prime.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.990
And once it's
propagated into r prime,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.050
it interacts with
the material u--

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.570
that's the heavy dot--

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.815
and gets propagated into r.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.040
So that's the second
order Feynman diagram.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.940
The zeroth order first, Feynman
diagram, the wave just reaches.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.180
First order, the wave
comes, interacts once

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.170
with the potential, and
re-emits a wave over here.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.130
Second order comes here,
interacts with the potential,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.970
emits a wave, interacts
at another point,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.180
emits another wave,
and gets to you.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.530
That's a pictorial description
of a Born approximation, which

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.470
makes it intuitive,
makes it clear.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.230
It is like Feynman diagrams of
field theory, in which you have

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.350
some set of initial state,
some set of final state,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:54.820
and you sort of find the
ways the particles arrange

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.090
themselves.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.080
If you have an electron
and a photon scattering,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:07.090
you have an electron here and
a photon scattering, and then

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.860
photon and electron
out scattering.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.130
What do they do?

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.370
And then Feynman method,
you think, OK, they

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.620
do all what they
can possibly do.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.120
They get the photon, interacts
with electron, electron

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.940
propagates and
re-emits a photon,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.420
or it may be that the
photon gets emitted first

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.020
and then the incoming
photon hits the other place

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.240
and it goes that way.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.170
All these things can happen.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.980
And here you have
all the ways in which

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.060
the waves can scatter
and re-scatter back

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.040
to reach the observer.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.890
Basically, you're
finding all possible ways

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.550
the waves interact with
the medium and reach you.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.100
And that's a very intuitive way.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.440
You think of it,
there the material,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.540
you're there, what do I get?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.500
Well, you get the waves
that just hit you directly.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.890
And then you get the waves that
hit the material and scatter

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.532
to you.

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:10.990
And then you get
the waves that hit

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.830
the material, scattered, hit
the material again, and then got

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.400
to you.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.430
And then you get the waves
that did that several times.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.680
A very nice, simple picture.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.990
So that is the
Born approximation.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.860
We can do one example.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.580
Let's do one example.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.480
And assume, simplify
this formula.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.010
So we did this formula.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.480
And if the potential is
not spherically symmetric,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.460
you can't do more with it.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.080
But if the potential is
spherically symmetric,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.890
that first Born formula,
which is a very famous result,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.370
admits simplification and you
can do some of the integral.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.030
You can do the angular
part of the integral

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:10.110
because the potential is
spherically symmetric,

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.410
and you know how
things depend on angle.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:19.590
So it's a nice thing to have a
boxed formula that already does

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.030
for you this calculation when
the potential is spherically

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.760
symmetric.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:33.900
So if v of r is equal to v of r,
which is spherically symmetric,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:41.220
we go back to that formula and
we would have f of k of theta,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:49.350
we claim, we'll see if that
is true, minus 1 over 4 pi.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:55.020
Now this u there, remember,
this u was just the scaling of v

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.670
in order to make the Schrodinger
equation look simple.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:06.690
So that involves a factor
of 2 m over h bar squared.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:15.360
You still have the cube r prime,
e to the minus i k dot r prime,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.590
v of r prime.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:31.770
So what is the intuition
of such formulas?

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.150
I think it's important
for you, maybe

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.590
you haven't seen
these formulas before,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.900
if you look at the
formula like this.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.910
What do you expect the
answer to depend on?

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.900
What is that integral
going to depend on?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.650
Any opinion?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.710
Well, it certainly will
depend on the potential,

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:24.030
but now if it's very symmetric,
I might as well delete that.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.830
Is that right?

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.710
We said it's
spherically symmetric.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.980
So it will depend
on the potential.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.220
That's, of course, true.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.750
But will it depend
on the vector k?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.420
Yes, it better depend
on the vector k.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.980
But all of the vector k
or some of the vector k?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.325
It's good to think about that
before doing the integral.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.920
Well, the interesting
thing is when

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.340
you have an integral in this
form in which this doesn't

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:17.960
depend on the direction
of r, this is our prime,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.140
but in fact, you
see, there's nowhere

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.310
in this formula anything
to do with r and r prime.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.720
This is an integral
all over space.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.910
So in fact, I can also
delete now the primes,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:38.690
integrate them
over all of space.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.860
There's no r on the left
hand side, there's no r left,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.400
so what for carrying primes?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.380
No need for that.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.290
Now what I want to explain here
is that this integral can only

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.640
depend on the magnitude
of the vector k.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.000
Cannot depend on the
direction of the vector k.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.100
And because it depends on the
magnitude of the vector k,

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.910
it only depends on theta,
which is what we wanted to say.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.590
So if before, you write

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.230
For theta, you could have
asked, well, how do you know?

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.100
This interval can depend
on phi, k dependent on phi,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:26.090
but no, this integral doesn't
depend on the direction of k.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.380
And it doesn't because
you can choose your axis

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.840
to do this integral
whichever way you want.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.480
This is a dummy
variable of integration.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.790
So if vector K points
in this direction,

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.140
you could choose the z-axis
to go there, and that's it.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.640
It's only going to depend on
the magnitude of that vector.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.080
So that's an important
concept in here.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.380
Oh, and you can
think it another way.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.780
This answer, if I would have
put another vector k prime here

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:10.220
that is obtained by
rotation, think of k prime,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:18.370
I put here k prime, which
is obtained by a rotation,

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:23.980
acted by a rotation matrix on
the vector, say, from the left.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.610
Well, you would say, OK, if
it's acted by a rotation,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.620
I could instead make the
rotation act on the vector r.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.890
This potential doesn't
change on the rotations

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.560
and this measure is
invariant on the rotation.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.490
So at the end of the
day, this integral

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.010
does not depend on
the rotation you did.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.550
So bottom line,
this integral just

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.780
doesn't depend on
the direction of k,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.310
and we can do it by putting k--

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.700
or saying k is
here and now making

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:06.651
it explicit by putting r prime
here and calling this angle

00:14:06.651 --> 00:14:07.150
theta.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.990
And we just do it.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:17.760
So if we call it that
way, this integral

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:28.370
is, you have minus m
over 2 pi h squared,

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.600
and you have the
volume integral, which

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.030
is 2 pi for the phi integral.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:43.400
So we'll have a theta and a phi
that you integrate with respect

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.690
to k, and the phi integral
will always give you 2 pi

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.400
and will leave the
theta integral here.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.510
So 2 pi.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.510
And the r integral
is r squared dr.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:02.315
The theta integral in spherical
coordinates is v cos theta.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.820
And you have here e to the
minus i length of this,

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.340
length of that, cosine
theta times v of r.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.690
So things simplify even more.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:35.280
So the 2 pis can [INAUDIBLE]
minus m over h squared.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:46.380
The radial integral, it's 0 to
infinity, r squared vr, v of r,

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:51.380
and you have the
angular integral,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.870
and that angular integral
is easily doable.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.285
It's that and this.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:05.140
You can [INAUDIBLE] cosine theta
u and just do the integral.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:14.030
That integral gives you
2 sin of Kr over kr.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:32.320
And our result, therefore,
is, you shouldn't confuse

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.750
the capital K with
the lowercase k, which

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.920
is the magnitude of the momentum
or the magnitude of the energy.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.540
So we're done, basically.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:57.780
And what do we have
for fk of theta?

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:06.970
We have minus 2m
over K h squared,

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:14.740
integral from 0 to infinity
of r, dr, one r got cancelled,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:23.750
the k went out, r dr,
v of r, sine of Kr.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.710
So the Fourier transform
got partially done.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:44.240
And here, K, as you remember,
is 2 k sine theta over 2.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.340
So there we get the Born
approximation simplified

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.470
as much as we could.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.770
We couldn't do
much better anymore

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.800
without knowing what
the potential is.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.710
But once you know
the potential, it

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.830
has become just the
simple integral.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:15.270
So while the concepts that led
to this result are interesting,

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.820
and they involve
nice approximations,

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.430
by the time you have this
result, this is very useful.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.870
You can put an arbitrary
potential v of r,

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.110
calculate the
integral, and out you

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.600
get the scattering amplitude.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.320
So this is done, for example,
for Yukawa potential,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:44.640
v of r minus 1 over r--

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.800
well, we will put the beta--

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:56.370
e to the minus mu r.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.530
That's called a
Yukawa potential.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:11.810
It's the kind of modification
of the electromagnetic potential

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.460
in the limit in which the
photon would acquire a mass.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.190
That was sort of the
intuition of Yukawa.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:26.250
If you see-- this has
units of [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.560
physically mass and h
bars and things like that.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:36.420
But if you let this thing
go to 0, if mu goes to zero,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.200
you recover coulomb potential.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.870
So that's the relevance
of the Yukawa potential.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.060
Yukawa invented it
while thinking of pions

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.750
and thinking of the forces
transmitted by pions, who

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.940
are light hadrons and strongly
interacting particles,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.660
but with low mass,
relatively low mass

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.820
compared to a proton, one
fifth of it or even less,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.030
maybe, one seventh, one eighth.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.850
And then you would have
a potential of this for

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.100
and you can study
scattering when

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.900
you have this kind of formula.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.430
So this is solved in many books.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:29.150
It's also in the textbook,
and in this case, f of k,

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.670
the integral can
be done exactly.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.680
You can plug v of r there.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.660
And the answer is
that fk of theta

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:53.171
is equal to minus 2 m beta over
h squared mu squared plus K

00:20:53.171 --> 00:20:53.670
squared.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.540
And K squared would
be this quantity.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.410
So there is a theta
dependence, and you

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.830
can look at this formula,
compare with the Coulomb k,

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:16.350
[? take ?] limits, plot it,
it's kind of interesting.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:21.150
So it's easily done, and you
can play with many potentials.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:26.440
All right, so we're
done with scattering.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.420
Done like three lectures
and a half on this subject,

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:34.960
and I'm going to now turn into
a new subject, our last subject,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.720
which is we're going
to try to explain

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.760
some of the basics of
identical particles.
