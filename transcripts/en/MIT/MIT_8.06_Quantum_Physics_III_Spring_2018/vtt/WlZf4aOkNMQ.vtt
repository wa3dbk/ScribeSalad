00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.740
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.450
Today's lecture will
deal with Zeeman effect.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.530
And then we'll get started with
a semi-classical approximation.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.640
So Zeeman in effect
is the last topic

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.310
we do with respect
to the hydrogen

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
atom and the corrections
of perturbation theory

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.690
and with WKB or the
semi-classical approximation,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.040
we begin a new chapter in 806.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.640
Zeeman effect.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.030
So this is an
effect having to do

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.600
with an atom in
a magnetic field.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.580
It was discovered by a Dutch
physicist, Peter Zeeman,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.110
who lived from 1865 to
1943, who was a Dutch.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.730
The work was
actually done in 1896

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.080
at a time where there was
very little idea of quantum

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.880
mechanics to be, and
he got a Nobel Prize

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.550
for in the year 1902.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.120
So what he discovered
was the spectral lines

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.150
seemed to split in the
presence of a magnetic field.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.000
It's an old result,
therefore, 100 years old.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.880
Its explanation
and understanding

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.660
took about a couple of decades,
because you couldn't do it

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.120
without quantum mechanics.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.360
So nobody could
quite figure out what

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.380
had happened, but was very,
very important in its time.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.560
It still remains very important.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.050
People use the Zeeman
effect all the time.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.500
In fact, it's used
nowadays in studies

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.330
of astrophysics, studies
of the sun, the sunspots.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.400
You know, there are
places in the sun,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.280
where the temperature
is a little lower,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.060
and that's places where the
magnetic field lines in the sun

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.820
sort of breakout from the
interior to the exterior.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.700
And it's interesting,
because the sun produces

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.140
this cycle of
solar spots, and it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.710
happens, because the sun
doesn't rotate uniformly,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.830
has a different rotation
speed in the equator,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.940
faster than in the poles, so
the magnetic field lines that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.080
go from north to south in
the sun get tangled up,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.630
and they start breaking up
and doing all these things.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.040
So people want to know
what is the magnetic field

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.320
in the solar sunspot.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.210
And in fact, they observe
the weak magnetic fields away

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.370
from the solar
sunspots, and then they

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.440
see the spectrum of an atom.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.380
And suddenly, as you move
inside the spot, the field,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.980
the spectrum, the lines split.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.940
And they can measure
the magnetic fields

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.080
very accurately.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.720
They're of the order of 3,000
Gauss, 2,000, 3,000 Gauss.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.680
And it's pretty
interesting work.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.060
So this Zeeman effect
remains very important.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.910
So what is the Zeeman effect?

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.430
We have Zeeman effect here.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.940
We have the magnetic field
interacting with the electron,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.600
and the electron now has
two magnetic moments,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.215
a magnetic moment associated
with the orbital motion.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.870
This looks completely
like the classical formula

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.150
of the magnetic moment due to a
particle that goes in circles.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.410
It produces a current,
and that current

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.660
is proportional to the angular
momentum of the rotating

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.710
particle.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.990
And of course, there
is the magnetic moment

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.580
due to the spin that
has a factor of 2 here.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.490
This g factor, we've
discussed before.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.810
S.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.220
So H Zeeman, you put an
external magnetic field

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.450
into the atom, a constant
uniform external magnetic

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.890
field, and you have
a minus mu dot b,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:43.360
so you have a interaction
mu l plus mu s,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.170
dot B. So this is e over 2mc.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.750
That's the typical factor here,
and a recognizable l plus 2s.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.540
So it's not l plus s.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.600
It's l plus 2s times b.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.720
And many times, we think
of B, align the axis

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.200
so that it is in
the z direction.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:28.220
So this turns out to be e
over 2mc lz plus 2sz times

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:36.822
B. So this is the
Zeeman Hamiltonian.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.410
But this is part of
a story of an atom.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.580
So if we want to think of
the hydrogen atom properly,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.970
we must consider and reconsider
what was the Hamiltonian there.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.270
And we had an H for
the hydrogen atom.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.540
That was an H 0.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.820
That was the familiar
one, p squared

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.410
over 2m minus e squared over r.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.760
Then we had a fine
structure Hamiltonian,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.790
delta H, fine structure.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.630
Let's put fs for fine structure.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.580
Those were the relativistic
terms, the Darwin term,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.950
and the spin orbit coupling.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.620
The three of them
constituted what we call

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.110
defined structure Hamiltonian.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.410
And now we have a Zeeman effect.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.730
I probably should
go delta H Zeeman,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.670
because it's an addition here
to the term we had before.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.700
It refers to what I
call just H Zeeman.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.160
But in the context
of the hydrogen atom,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.100
we should call it
delta H Zeeman.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.400
And now, we have to rethink.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.630
And the reason the Zeeman
effect is non-trivial for us,

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.570
and it's a very interesting and
somewhat challenging example

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.690
of what we have to do
in perturbation theory,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.900
is that we cannot forget
about the fine structure.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.960
So if it would be just this,
it would be kind of simple.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.190
But we have the whole thing.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.990
So we have to make an
approximation sometimes.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.110
And we're going to consider
two interesting cases,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:48.640
the very weak Zeeman effect and
the very strong Zeeman effect.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.850
I will not consider the
intermediate Zeeman effect,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.580
not because it's
not interesting,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.470
but because there's very little
you can do to simplify it,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.590
and to think about it.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.720
You basically have to
go ahead and diagonalize

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.160
the large matrix.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.930
So while it's important, and
if your life depended on this,

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.020
and your research dependent
on this, you would do it.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.220
For us, we have a lot to
learn from the weak case

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.880
and the strong case,
lots of concepts,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.850
and we'll leave the
intermediate one for later.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:31.190
So how can we decide how
to treat these terms?

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.659
Well, we should look
physically at what's happening.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.659
We have a magnetic field,
an external magnetic field.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.940
But the fine structure
constant taught you

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.480
that there is something like
an internal magnetic field

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.770
in the atom.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.370
It's that magnetic field
responsible for spin orbit

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:56.740
coupling is that magnetic field
that the electron sees when

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.170
it's going around the proton.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.370
There's a static electric field,
but whenever you are in motion,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.590
a static electric
field in the lab

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.740
also has a magnetic
field by relativity,

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.140
and you do see a magnetic field.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.960
You could also imagine it
as you are the electron,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.850
and the problem is
going around you,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.880
and creates at the center of
the loop, a magnetic field.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.970
In any case, you've looked
at that magnetic field.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:28.930
And we can call it the
internal magnetic field

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.145
due to spin orbit.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.700
As one exercise in
the homework, you've

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.651
been asked to estimate the
value of that internal magnetic

00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:40.150
field.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.430
Is it a Gauss, 1,000
Gauss, 10,000 Gauss?

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.650
How much it is for
a typical level?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.630
So there's a number
here that this interest.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.020
And now we can decide
whether we have a weak Zeeman

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.990
effect or a strong
Zeeman effect,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.010
by looking how your external
magnetic field compares

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.090
with this little magnetic field.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:10.820
So we'll have a weak
Zeeman effect, A. Zeeman.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.760
When B is much smaller
than B internal.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.130
And therefore, the
effects of Zeeman

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.280
is going to be smaller
than fine structure.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.060
So really, when you
look at this line,

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.050
and you have the
first two terms,

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.250
you should think
of these two terms

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.490
as your new known Hamiltonian.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:57.020
And the Zeeman term,
at its perturbation.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.110
Yes.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.470
You've solved for
the fine structure

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.290
coupling and the shift.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.600
So this is the known thing.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.040
These are going to be the known
states with known energies.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.930
You only know them the first
order, but you know them.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.900
And then the Zeeman
effect will be

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.170
a perturbation theory on this.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.970
This is the weak Zeeman effect.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.710
How about the strong
Zeeman effect?

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:38.495
So B will be strong Zeeman.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.340
This time, the magnetic
field associated

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.000
with the Zeeman effect, the
external magnetic field,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.060
is much smaller than
the magnetic field

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.020
responsible for
spin orbit coupling.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.470
And this time, what
are we going to do?

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.406
Well, we will take
the Hamiltonian.

00:12:06.406 --> 00:12:08.295
It will be H 0.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:18.730
The strong Zeeman effect
means this Zeeman Hamiltonian

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.090
is a lot more important than
the spin orbit coupling.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.365
So we'll add delta
H Zeeman here.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:39.650
And we hope this will be
our known Hamiltonian,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:43.520
because anyway, the Zeeman
stuff is much stronger now

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.760
than fine structure.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.450
So this should be
our non-Hamiltonian.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.000
You should complain,
no, this is not known.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.580
I haven't done Zeeman,
but we'll look at it.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.410
And once we have our
known Hamiltonian here,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.040
spin orbit has to be rethought.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.122
Fine structure has to be
rethought as a perturbation.
