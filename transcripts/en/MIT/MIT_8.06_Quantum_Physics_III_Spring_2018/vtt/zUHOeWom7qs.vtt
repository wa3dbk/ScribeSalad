00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:11.410
PROFESSOR: This also solves the
exchange degeneracy problem.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.710
It kind of seems clear
that it solves it.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.680
But since we made
such a fuss about it,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.630
let's see it in more detail.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.280
So in what sense it solves it?

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.980
It solves it in the
sense that you basically

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.740
don't get degeneracy once
you have this postulate.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.930
Before this postulate,
for example,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.810
you had the two electron state.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.500
You said, well, it could be
this, or it could be that.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.480
And which should I choose?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.840
If they're equivalent,
we get into mistakes.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.780
So which one is the state
of the two electrons?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.130
Now we seem to have an answer.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.690
It's the antisymmetric
combination.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.810
The last part of the
answer is to say, well,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.270
there should be just one
antisymmetric combination.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.700
And when you have two
particles, it's kind of obvious.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.940
But if you have more,
you can think a little.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.670
And you will conclude that
it's kind of obvious as well.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.460
But let's just check it.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.790
So this would be
comment number 5,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.995
which is solving the
exchange degeneracy problem.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
So this is the way we solve
this problem, we discuss it.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.600
Suppose we have a state u
that belongs to V tensor N.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.540
Now I should be a little tongue
tied when I say this thing,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.030
a state u belonging to this.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.430
This is not a physical state.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.509
We already declared that
arbitrary states in V N

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.880
are not physical states.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.850
What should they call this?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.360
Maybe a mathematical state or
a state, and then the others,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.670
call them physical states.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.270
You get the point.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.710
Assume you have this
u that belongs here.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.590
Then you can define V u,
a vector space associated

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.720
with u, which is
the span, all you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.160
get by applying permutations,
the span of P alpha u for all P

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.330
alpha in the permutation
group S N. You see,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.500
that was the idea of
the degeneracy exchange.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.570
You got one state.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.720
And you produce all these
other ones by permutation.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.340
And then you don't
know which one to use.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.090
So we're going back
to that situation.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.610
You have one state.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.880
You produce all you
can by perturbations.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
And now you've got
a big vector space.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.040
And which one to use?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.460
Well, you know that you should
use the states that are totally

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.050
symmetric or antisymmetric.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.100
But let's first
just get the idea

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.430
clear of what we have here.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.260
Notice, that depending
on u, which u you choose,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.510
this vector space may be
1-dimensional, 2-dimensional,,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.180
3-dimensional, very
large dimension.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.350
Could be of arbitrarily high
dimension, up to n factorial.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.210
So let's take an example.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:10.000
Suppose u is the state a
a b with tensor N equal 3.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.620
And you choose this.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.010
Well, if you apply
permutation operators,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.330
you can also get
the state b a a.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.420
You flip the first
and the third.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.791
Or you can get a b a.

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:30.880
And that's it.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.370
So in this case, you get three
states in V u, for example.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920
And here is the claim.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.020
The claim is that
there's just one

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.600
state that is symmetric in V u.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:09.650
Up claim, up to
scale V u contains

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:39.440
at most a single ket in Sym N
V and a single ket in Anti N V.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.530
That is the claim that we
have solved the problem.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.980
Now there's one state.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.410
You produce the whole list
of states by permutation.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.450
There's just one.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.745
I said at most, because
sometimes in the case of Anti--

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.140
I should say here
actually, up the scale

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:19.760
V u contains a single ket and at
most a single ket in Anti N V.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.990
For example, the one we
did up there, that example.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.460
If you wanted to produce a
totally antisymmetric state,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:34.070
you would not be able to do
it because of the a here.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.760
You cannot and antisymmetrize
with states a and a.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.640
If you have a state
of three fermions,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.760
they must each be different.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.570
And then you antisymmetrize.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.950
You cannot antisymmetrize
states that are the same.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.610
So that's the statement here.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.600
Let's say a couple
of words about it.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:15.980
So the first thing we can say
is that, yes, this is clear.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:27.840
You can get a state
in Sym N V by doing

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.060
the symmetrizer acting in u.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.780
So it's clear you
can get one state.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.850
And you can get a
state in Anti N on V

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.350
by applying the
antisymmetrizer on u.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.410
And you know.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.440
You can get those
states directly.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.470
Now, it may happen
that Anti of V

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.480
vanishes, because in
Anti, when you apply a,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.140
you have some permutations
with plus, some with minus,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.180
and there could
be a cancellation.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.110
In this case, there
would be a cancellation.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.050
In the symmetrize case,
there's no cancellation .

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.620
Possible So we'll see that.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.470
So here it is.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:24.690
The argument for not getting
more is kind of simple.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.900
Let me go through it.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.820
It's almost kind of obvious.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.080
You could say, OK, I got one
state applying the projector.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.929
So that's it, there's one state.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.320
Well, you could say,
well, maybe somebody

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.909
hands you another state.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.210
And then you would claim, oh,
it must be the same as this one.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.450
So let's see that
that is the case.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:09:05.650
Suppose psi is also in Sym
N V and belongs to V u.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:11.380
So it would be a claim that
there's another state that

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.530
is symmetric.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.810
So since it belongs
to V u, psi would

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:23.710
be the sum of C alphas
times P alphas on u.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.610
What was V u was the
span of this state.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.300
So if it's in that
vector space, it

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.660
would have to be in that space.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.150
But since psi is
symmetric, psi is also

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:46.360
equal to S psi by
assumption or S

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:55.670
acting on C alpha P
alpha u, which is psi.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:01.910
But the S comes in and
multiplies the P alpha.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:10.310
And you'll recall that S times
P alpha is S. So you get this.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.050
How nice.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.720
If you get that, this is a state
that this independent of alpha.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.230
So you get it out
here, S u times

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.830
sum over alpha of C alpha.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.390
So what have you proven?

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.750
If you hand out
another state that you

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.350
claim is in the
symmetric subspace,

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.670
it is proportional to the one
you obtain with the projector.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.055
There's no other
state you can find.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.980
You're done with these things.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:52.630
So I want to make
yet another comment,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:11:00.550
comment 6 and comment
7, and we'll be done.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.810
Comment 6 is a
construction for fermions.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.850
It's a famous construction.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:20.400
6, for fermions,
suppose you have

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.440
a state u this time,
which is phi on 1,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.475
chi on the second, and
omega on the third.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:48.540
This time, we have to build
an antisymmetric state.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:55.450
So the state A on u, the
antisymmetric projector,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:07.800
ti is 1 over 6 sum over alpha
E alpha times the permutation P

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.430
alpha acting on this state.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.200
So this will be a sum
of six terms in which

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.490
this these states are
scrambled, sometimes with pluses

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.990
and sometimes with minuses.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.840
There is a nice construction
in mathematics that does that.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.000
Moreover, you find that if
you have two states that are

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.400
the same, if phi
would be equal to chi,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.590
you cannot antisymmetrize here.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.360
You will get 0.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.070
This is kind of like a
statement that the two columns

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.910
of a matrix have 0
determinant if they're

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.810
proportional to each other.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.090
So the claim is that
this construction

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.860
is nothing else than
1 over 3 factorial,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.570
the following determinant in
which the three states are

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:28.750
written like that, phi,
chi, omega, phi, chi, omega,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:35.360
and phi, chi, omega
into the determinant.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:49.245
And then you'll put 1, 2,
3, 1, 2, 3, and 1, 2, 3.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.830
The determinant of the
states written in that way--

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.050
I would recommend any
one to just write it out.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.620
For three particles, you
have all the six elements.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.560
Write them out.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.080
Do the permutations.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.350
And check that this
product produces that.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.110
You know, for example,
that the determinant

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:24.670
will produce this product along
the diagonal with a plus sign,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.870
this and that with a
plus sign, this and that

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.720
with a plus sign, then the
other ones with a minus

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.680
sign, but each one 3.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.980
So for example,
this, this, that is

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.900
the one in which you have the
identity acting on the states.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.670
And the reason this works
is the general formula.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.740
I will put it in the notes.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.270
But here, I think I don't
want to get into more of it.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.070
It's a general formula
for determinants.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.710
It's a well known formula.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.540
If you have a
permutation P alpha,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.770
remember permutation
P alpha, alpha

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:15.130
was supposed to be a list, alpha
of 1, alpha of 2, up to alpha

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:24.170
of n, which is a permutation
of the list 1, 1, up to n.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:30.710
So if you have a matrix, the
determinant of a matrix B,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:36.530
of any matrix, can be written
as the sum over permutations

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:40.850
of the sign of the
permutation times,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.310
essentially, the
permutation acting

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:49.280
on the elements of the
matrix, that is B of alpha 1

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:59.230
1, B of alpha 2 2,
up to B of alpha n n.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.520
This is like saying
in the matrix,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.370
you will select
the alpha 1 element

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:16.360
from the first column,
the alpha 2 element

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.600
from the second column, all
of those, and multiply them.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.340
And that's the determinant.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:29.430
And that formula is the
reason this is true,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.960
because this sum of
epsilons times Ps

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.370
really is the formula that
calculates the determinant.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.590
You almost see the P here.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:46.350
The P is the thing that took
the element 1, 1, to 2, 2

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.900
and and n, n and replaced
the 1 by alpha of 1, P of 2

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.250
and replaced them that way.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.310
So I almost made the connection.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.380
But we probably
need a few minutes

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.560
to make sure you
understand why it happened.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.504
Last comment, seventh,
is occupation numbers.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:19.740
If we're trying to describe
states in V tensor n,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.720
and suppose you have a
state with n particles,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.329
and that is V tensor n.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:34.830
But suppose that this vector
space V has a basis of basis

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:41.250
vectors u 1, u 2,
up to u infinity.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.360
It just goes on forever.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.620
Then if you have
that, then there

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.205
is a way to think of all the
states that you can build.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.220
And the way to think
of them is follows.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.460
List the vectors here,
u 2 up to all those.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:20.360
And you imagine that little n
1 particles are in this state.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.200
Little n 2 particles
are in this state.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.120
And it goes on like that.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.420
So you write your state with
occupation numbers, n 1, n 2,

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.010
n 3.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.840
And what is that state?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.630
Well, there's n 1 of this one.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:43.580
So u 1 for the first
particle up to u 1

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.060
for the and n 1 particle.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.700
And then you have u 2 for the
next particle up to a u 2.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.520
And you have n 2 of those.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.700
And you have all the others.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.190
And then you must apply into
it the symmetrization operator.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.070
But this is the list of states.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.040
This describes what you have.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.320
Symmetrizing is a lot of work.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.950
But listing the
occupation numbers

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.150
is really all there is
to it, because the rest

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:24.980
is a complicated algebraic
manipulation of symmetrization.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.170
But now you know what
you must symmetrize.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:32.390
You have n 1 times the state
1, n 2 times the state 2.

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.550
When you have fermions,
this is the same,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:39.950
except that the n 1s, n
2s, n 3s can be 0 or 1.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.820
And finally here, if it's
a state of n particles,

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:49.460
then and n 1 plus n 2 plus
all of those must add up to n,

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.010
because you have n particles.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.670
So that brings us
to the end of 8.06.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.050
Occupation numbers is where
quantum field theory begins.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:05.330
You start constructing operators
that add particles and subtract

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.060
particles.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:11.360
So it's a fitting place to end
your undergrad with quantum

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.420
mechanics education.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.940
I wish you all the best.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.900
I hope the course lived
up to your expectations.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.030
It's an awesome
responsibility to teach

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.010
such an interesting course.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.620
And we try to do it well.

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.200
And we wish that all of
you have enjoyed this

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.510
and have been motivated.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.420
And many of you will understand
this subject, one day,

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:43.190
better than your teachers and
will help move it forward.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.050
So take care.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.710
Good luck.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:46.730
And see you soon.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:47.230
Bye.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.980
