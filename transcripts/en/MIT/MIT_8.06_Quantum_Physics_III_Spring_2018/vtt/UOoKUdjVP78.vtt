00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.060
PROFESSOR: We began
our introduction

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.730
to molecules last
time and tried to get

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.270
a picture of the scales
that are involved.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:19.100
In these objects we spoke of
a lattice of nuclei and clouds

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:27.080
of electrons in which a
molecule had some scale,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.879
A. Then we had electronic
energies E, electronic.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.855
We had vibrational energies.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.350
This is from the nuclei.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.480
And we had rotational energies.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.060
And they were one
bigger than the other

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.490
and bigger than the last.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.560
In fact, the electronic
energies were

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.000
bigger than the vibrational
energies of the nuclei

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.460
and bigger than the rotational
energies of the whole molecule

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.900
when it rotates as a solid body.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.920
In fact, the ratio was like 1 to
square root of little m over M,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.670
where little m represents
electron mass, and capital M,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.710
the nuclear mass.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.750
And so this number could
be 10 to the minus 2,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.910
and then you have m over M.
So that's the proportions.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.530
So this is larger than
the second one, like 1

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.410
is larger than that, and
the ratio between these two

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.010
is this.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.010
So that's what we've discussed.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.430
And we said that,
in some sense, there

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.370
was an adiabatic approximation
in the vibration of the nuclei.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:14.460
As the nuclei vibrate, they pull
the electronic clouds with it

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.690
in an adiabatic way.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.700
That is, if you solved
for the electronic cloud

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.550
as a function of
position, that would

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.600
be a family of eigenstates.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.300
Say the ground state
of the electronic cloud

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.350
is a function of position, this
would be a family of states.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.650
If the positions of the
nuclei change in time,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.310
you could use those as
instantaneous eigenstates.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.100
And there is a sense in which
this is a good approximation,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.100
given that the
timescale associated

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.320
to the vibrations
of the nuclei is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.440
much bigger than the
timescale associated

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.000
to any variation in the
electronic configuration.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.140
This is just because of
the scales of the energies.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.360
So let's implement this idea
in an approximation that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.470
is used to solve molecules.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.980
And we'll discuss
it in all detail.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.500
I'll skip one step
of the derivation.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.720
One calculation will
be in the notes,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.180
but I don't want to go
through the details in class.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.620
And we will appreciate the form
of the nuclear Hamiltonian, how

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.150
it behaves.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.010
So this is going to be the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.410
And we will consider
the situation

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.250
where we have N, nuclei--

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.750
capital N, nuclei-- and
little m, electrons.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.090
So it's a many-body wavefunction
and a many-body situation.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.820
In such cases, your
notation is important.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.940
You have to define
labels that help

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.720
you distinguish this situation.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.140
So here are the
labels we're going

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:38.430
to use for the nuclei, P
alpha and R alpha, where alpha

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.950
denotes which nuclei
you're talking about.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.820
So it goes from 1
up to capital N,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.350
because there are
capital N nuclei

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.420
for each nucleus, the first,
the second, the third.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.540
There is a momentum operator
and a position operator,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.410
each one of which is three
components, because molecules

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.890
live in three dimensions.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.100
So this is one vector
and another vector

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.900
for each value of alpha.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.740
In fact, these are operators.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.080
We're doing quantum
mechanics, so these

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.970
are our canonical
pairs for the nuclei,

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.620
canonical pairs for the nuclei.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.850
We need similar variables
for the electrons,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.610
and we'll use little
p and little r,

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.000
both vectors, both operators.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.030
And this time this i runs
from 1 to lower case n.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.730
And these are the canonical
pairs for the electrons.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.640
So when we write
the Hamiltonian,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.990
it should be a Hamiltonian that
depends on all those variables.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.540
And we can write
the Hamiltonian,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.920
because we know the
physics of this situation.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.840
We think of this is
a lattice of nuclei,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.075
and there is the cloud
of the electrons,

00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.790
and we have a coordinate system.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:30.740
Here is maybe capital
R1 and capital R2.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.880
They're all there.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.350
And well, when we
write Hamiltonian,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.700
we think of the electrons at
some points and write things.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.920
So let's write the Hamiltonian.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.200
So this is going to be
the total Hamiltonian.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.240
What should I include?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.390
I should include kinetic
terms for each of the nuclei.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.670
So I should put sum over alpha.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.380
I don't have to repeat
here from 1 to capital N.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.300
You know already
what alpha runs over.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:10.120
P alpha vector
squared over 2M alpha.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.666
M alpha is the mass
of alpha nucleus.

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:20.400
It could be a collection
of protons and neutrons.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.470
Then there's going to be--

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.550
and we get a little more
schematic-- a potential that

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.830
depends nucleus with nucleus.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.110
So the nucleus,
among each other,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.280
have a Coulomb potential.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.970
So there's going to be a
potential that represents here,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:46.690
and it will depend
on the various R's.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.630
I could write--
this looks funny.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.680
You say, which R?

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.080
Well, it depends on
all the capital R's.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.430
So I could write
depends on this set

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.140
that, but it's a
little too cumbersome.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.480
I'll just write V
of R, like this.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:09.680
And this is, if the nuclei
lived alone, that would be it.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.370
This would be the kinetic
energies and the potential

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.300
between the nuclei.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.930
Then there's going to be what
we can call a Hamiltonian that

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.310
only involves the electrons.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.260
In some sense, that gives
dynamics to the electrons--

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.580
not only involves
electrons, gives

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.490
dynamics to the electrons.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:40.690
And this Hamiltonian, H
e, is going to depend on--

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.800
well, this big Hamiltonian
for all the molecules

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.560
depends on the two
canonical pairs

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.650
for times N times little n.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:58.330
This Hamiltonian for
the electron will depend

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:04.780
on the p's, will depend on the
r's, and it will also depend

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.360
on the capital R's.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.600
And you can think of it,
and that's reasonable.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.820
Suppose you're an electron.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.480
Who affects you?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.540
Well, you get affected
by your electron friends,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.610
and you get affected
by the nuclei

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.000
and therefore, by the positions
of the nuclei, as well.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.850
So this is the electron
part of the Hamiltonian.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.250
And it would be given by a sum
of kinetic energy, as usual.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:45.010
So i, sum over i this time,
little p, i squared over 2m.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:50.380
Let's assume, of course, all
the electrons are the same mass.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:58.090
And then we would have, just
in this shorthand, a potential

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.890
that represents the
interaction of the electrons

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.630
with the nuclei.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:10.420
And that potential would
depend on the R's, on the R's.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.810
And finally-- my picture maybe
should be moved the little

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.410
to the right--

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:29.760
there's a term, the electron
potential that just depends

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.550
on the R's.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.340
So all these potentials
are Coulomb potentials,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.800
Coulomb from nucleus-nucleus,
nucleus-electron,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.890
electron-electron.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.890
So here it is.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.290
You've written the Hamiltonian.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:56.770
And if you have three
nuclei and five electrons,

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.390
you could write
all the equations.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.180
And it's a nice thing that
you can write the Hamiltonian,

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.570
and you could dream of
putting it into a computer,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.210
and it will tell you
what the molecule is,

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.630
and that's roughly true.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.950
But even for a good computer
nowadays, this is difficult.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:21.400
So you have to try to think how
you can simplify this problem.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.240
So one way to think about
it is to think again

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.980
of the physics of the situation.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.900
We'll have a
separation of scales.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.170
It's lucky we have that
separation of scales,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.620
very light electrons,
very heavy nuclei.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:43.180
So let's think of a
fixed nuclear skeleton,

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.770
and consider electron
states associated

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.590
to that fixed nuclear skeleton.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.320
The nuclear skeleton
is not fixed.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.520
In principle, the nuclei
are not classical particles

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.230
with fixed positions.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.490
They're going to vibrate.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.740
But we're trying to
understand this problem,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.440
and to some approximation,
we can roughly

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.570
think of them localized.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.660
So let's exploit that
and use the vibrations.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:18.340
So for large M alpha, this
[INAUDIBLE] to large M

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:27.970
alpha, consider a
fixed nuclear skeleton.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:41.250
So that means fixed R alpha,
all the R alphas, and fix.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:54.000
And now calculate
the electron states

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.670
as a function of our alpha.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.820
So you simplify the problem.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.340
Ignore all this
dynamics of the nuclei,

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.740
all this nuclear-nuclear
interaction.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.560
Focus on the electrons
as if the nuclear

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.810
are completely fixed, and try
to figure out the dynamics.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:31.070
So there are going to be
many electronic states.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.070
This is electrons in
some fixed potential.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.830
Any particle in quantum
mechanics in a fixed potential.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.730
There are many
energy eigenstates.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.650
So these electrons are going to
have many energy eigenstates.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:48.020
So let's try to decide on a
name for this wavefunction.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.030
So I will call them
phi for electrons.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.600
If there are wavefunctions
that are wavefunctions

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.170
of the electrons,
naturally, they just

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:05.765
depend on the electron
positions, nothing else.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.870
A wavefunction for a particle
depends on the position.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.381
Now, this r hides a little of--

00:14:16.381 --> 00:14:16.880
thing.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.400
This really means that
phi of r1, r2, r3, r4,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.230
because they're
little n electrons,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.470
so it's not just one variable.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:37.760
So I can say this is r1,
r2, all of them, r little n.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.410
That's a wavefunction.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.170
Now, we said there are
many of those states.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.040
So there will be the
ground state, the next one,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.550
the next one, the next one.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.200
So we should put an i in this.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.450
Maybe an i in this
is the wrong letter,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.780
given that they have i there--

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.890
k in this.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.690
But there is more
dependence here.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.445
There is implicit dependence on
the positions of the lattice,

00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:12.680
because these wave
functions depend

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.560
on what lattice square
did you place the nuclei.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.950
At this moment, you're
placing them arbitrarily.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.390
So this means that this
wavefunction really

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.750
depends, of course, of how
did you build the lattice?

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.850
Did you build the
lattice this way,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.120
or did you build it this way?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.180
It makes a difference.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:43.230
So it depends on the
capital R's, as well,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.360
which is the position
of the lattice.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.410
So here is our wavefunction.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:52.160
I will simplify the
writing by writing

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.760
phi of capital R, little
r, and k here, see.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.270
So what equation do
we demand from this?

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.300
Well we have the
electron Hamiltonian.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.960
So that's what we should solve.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:23.060
We should solve H
electron, on phi R, k of r.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.680
We'll have some energies,
and those energies

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.500
will be electronic energies.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.580
That's for electronic energy.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:42.030
It will depend on k-- those are
the various energies, as well--

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.650
and what else?

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.650
Certainly the energies
don't depend on r.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.300
That's your eigenstate.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.840
But they can depend
and will depend

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.320
on capital R. Capital R
is the parameters that

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.670
define your lattice.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.230
Clearly they should
depend on that.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.549
And then you have phi k, R, r.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.200
So this is the equation
you should solve in order

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:25.690
to find electronic states
associated with a skeleton.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:35.830
And now suppose you wanted
to find a complete solution

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.840
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.450
You say, ah, approximations.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.960
Why should they
do approximations?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.900
I can solve things exactly,
which is almost never possible,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.530
but we can imagine that.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:57.190
So what would be a possible way
to write an [? n-set ?] would

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.100
be the following.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.680
You could write a psi for the
whole thing now that depends

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.050
on the R's.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.820
And the R's wavefunction for
the whole degrees of freedom

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:17.460
of the molecule could be
written as a sum over k

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:33.300
of phi K, R of r times
solutions, eta k, that

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:41.500
depend on capital R.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.310
That is, I'm saying
we can try to write

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:51.550
the solution in which the full
wavefunction for the molecule

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:56.650
is the sum of states of
this form, a solution here

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.020
and a solution there.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:15.450
This is correct, but then how
do you determine the etas?

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.790
The only way to
determine the etas

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:22.200
is to plug into the full
Schrodinger equation--

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.630
this is the full Hamiltonian.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:29.640
So you would have to plug
this into the full Schrodinger

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.820
equation and see what you get.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.710
So what are you going to get?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.660
Presumably, you did
solve this first part.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.720
So the phis are known.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.390
So if the phis are
known, you're going

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:48.505
to find differential
equations for the etas.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.060
So this problem has become now
a problem of finding solutions

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.010
for the etas.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.360
And there are many etas,
and they are all coupled

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.590
by the Schrodinger equation.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:13.060
So by the time you
plug this into H,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:18.880
the total H, capital
psi Rr equals

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:25.500
sum Eq, sum energy eigenstate--

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.450
I don't have to put the thing--

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:33.940
psi Rr, to find the energy
eigenstates of the molecules.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.840
This equation is going to
imply a set of differential

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.010
equations, a couple differential
equations for the etas.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.730
And that's not so easy to do.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.530
That's pretty hard in general.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:57.050
So this is very difficult.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.300
On the other hand,
there is a way

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.870
to think of this in
a simpler context.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.790
We can try-- and now
we are approximating--

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:19.220
so try to believe that you can
get an approximate solution,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.620
approximate.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:28.290
And I will justify
this solution using

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:39.000
just one term in this
equation, and psi phi R of r.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.890
And this may be the ground
state of the electronic system.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.890
That's why I don't
put an index here.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.190
I could put a 0
there, but let's think

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.990
of this as the ground state.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.060
And then, well, this
would be accompanied,

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:04.526
if there is some
solution, by sum eta of R.

00:22:04.526 --> 00:22:20.050
And I can try to say that
your wavefunction is this,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:24.700
one term in this equation, the
one in which I pick the ground

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.930
state and leave it there.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.320
Now, this is
definitely not going

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.310
to be an exact solution ever
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.440
So you really are--

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:45.340
if you just take
one of these terms--

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.330
out of luck in terms of
solving this exactly,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.230
because this
differential equation,

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:57.580
this Hamiltonian,
has terms mixing

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.500
the two degrees of freedom.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.000
It doesn't separate.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.750
You cannot show that the
Schrodinger equation has

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.680
a solution which is one thing
that solves an equation and one

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.530
thing that solves another
equation that are products like

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.030
that.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.710
It will not happen.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.420
That's why in this
equation when you plug in,

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.300
the various etas get coupled.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:29.080
But this is the spirit of
the adiabatic approximation,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.540
in which we sort of
have an electronic cloud

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.570
and a nuclear state, and when
the nuclear state changes

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.630
slowly, the electronic
cloud adjusts,

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.940
and you don't have
to jump to a state

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.990
with another electronic cloud.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.500
The electronic cloud adjusts.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.960
So this is in the spirit of
the adiabatic approximation,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.280
to try to find the solution
of this kind, in which

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.620
an electronic
cloud is not forced

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.830
to jump, because the coupling
between those states,

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:08.920
saying that if you start
with one eta of one phi,

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.280
you need all the rest, as the
Schrodinger equation tells you.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.520
It is a statement that the
electronic cloud just cannot

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.150
stay by itself where it is.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.700
So here we go.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.840
This is what we're going to try.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.430
And you can say,
well, all right.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:32.580
So you're giving up the
Schrodinger equation,

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.370
because exact Schrodinger
equation is not solved by this.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.500
How are you going to try
to understand now the eta?

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.130
Because we found these
guys, so how about the etas?

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.500
How are we going to find them?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.630
That is our question.
