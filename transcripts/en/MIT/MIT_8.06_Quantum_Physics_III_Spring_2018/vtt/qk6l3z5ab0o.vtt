00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:00.700
Good.

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.880
So let's do, then,
our transitions.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.160
So we do the constant
perturbation.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.200
Constant perturbation.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.300
So as we said, delta
H is equal to V,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.130
and it's time independent.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.900
It just begins at time 0.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.360
And we'll examine what's
going on by time t0.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.680
So what are we going to do?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.720
We're going to
examine a transition

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.210
to go from some initial
state i, initial state,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.110
to a final state f.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.980
So we don't have to say much
about what the Hamiltonian is

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.330
or anything.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.910
For us, V is going
to have a constant.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.280
It's going to have
some matrix elements

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.570
that once we do an
example you can calculate,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.530
but for the time being we
need not know too much.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.940
So I'm going to
use the key formula

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.040
that was derived already
about perturbation theory

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.800
and how you get the
transition amplitude.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.060
So we know that the coefficient
c associated to the m state

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.810
to first order in
perturbation theory

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:47.410
at that time t0 can be computed
as a sum over all n integral

00:01:47.410 --> 00:02:00.580
from 0 to t0 e to the i omega
mn t prime delta Hmn t prime

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.900
over ih bar Cn 0 dt prime.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.940
So let me just say a few words.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.800
You may have seen this
yesterday in recitation.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.030
Here it is.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.970
The state has described
in this usual language

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:35.020
of psi tilde of t was described
as a sum of c ms of ts ms.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.980
And we calculate those
in perturbation theory.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.950
So Cn's, we know them
at time equals 0,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.960
we imagine we know
the initial state

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.490
and we want to
calculate them later.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.700
Well, the first order
in perturbation theory,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
the Cn's are called Cn's 1's.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.740
And they're given
by this formula.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.570
First order in
perturbation theory,

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.210
because we have
a single delta H,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.230
this omega mn is the energy
of m minus the energy

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.037
of n over h bar.

00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:07.620
And that's it.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.105
Those are all our symbols.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.460
So what do we have to do now?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.490
We have a transition from some
initial state to a final state.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.980
So what does that mean?

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.910
It means that Cn 0,
it only exists when

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.320
n represents the initial state.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.700
So I'll just write delta ni.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:50.790
At time equals zero,
system is in the state i.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.670
And at time t0, we're
asking for the probability

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.510
to go into final state.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.600
So instead of using n and
m, we're just using f and i.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.540
And therefore, we'll
have m equal f.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.900
With these two
facts, the formula

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.959
becomes cf the amplitude to
first order in perturbation

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.060
theory to be in the state f
at time t0 is the sum is gone,

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.050
sum over n just
applies for n equals i.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.240
So i will go here.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.670
We'll have one over
ih bar 0 to t0 e

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.490
to the i omega final
state to initial state.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:54.900
That's m and n t prime Vfi,
because the delta H is V,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.350
and we're going from
initial to final.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.430
So fi here.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.150
And then the t prime.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.240
It's all gone.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.710
It's all become
very simple, though.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.370
You would say too simple.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.270
We have this is
time independent,

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.050
so it goes out of the interval.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.770
So we just have the interval
of an exponential here.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.390
That's very, very easy.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.910
What is Vfi case vi?

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.530
So

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.930
This goes out, and we just have
to integrate this function.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.600
I'll write it in a
way that is simpler.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.070
Maybe you skip a line.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.580
I don't want to just
count the factors of is

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.870
and doing the integral.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.260
When you integrate this,
you get another exponential.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.480
You're going to get
the exponential at t0

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.700
minus the exponential at zero.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.020
All right, so we don't
want to do our integral.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.080
So I'll just write the answer.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.790
I was saying we get
an exponential here

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.630
at t0 minus the
value at zero, then

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.490
you take half of the
exponential out the form a sign.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.560
This are simple matters, so I
will not do the integral here.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.690
You get Vfi over Ef
minus Ei e to the i omega

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:44.560
fi t0 two minus two i sine
of omega fi t0 over two.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.530
You can believe that.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.560
I think you can
believe the sine,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:01.230
and I have everything here.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:08.550
The h bar helped turn the
omega fi into Ef minus Ei.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:20.460
So we can now compute the
transition probability

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.950
to go from the initial
to the final stage.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.480
So we'll write it like this.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.100
I to f-- it's a little funny.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.980
I don't know.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.930
You can write it
whichever way you want.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.520
Some people like it like that.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.150
I'm going to do it in the sense
that the initial state always

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.680
appears as a cat, the
final state as a bra.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.480
So you draw the arrow
like that, more or less

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.340
to keep the sense of
order in your brain.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.190
But if it doesn't
help you, write it

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.320
whichever way you want.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:03.300
Pfi at t0 one is
the norm squared

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.570
of this coefficient, cf one.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.870
The probability to be
found in the final state

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.970
has to do with the norm
squared of this thing.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:23.070
So it's this that's part of what
was reviewed yesterday squared.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.020
So what do we get?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.000
That simplifies quite a bit.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.970
We get Vfi squared times
four sine squared omega fi

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:45.220
t0 over two over ef
minus ei squared.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:54.490
And this is unit free.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.890
This has units of energy.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.470
V is a variation
of the Hamiltonian.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.700
It has units of energy.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.420
When you put states,
states are normalized

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.240
so it doesn't change the units.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.020
And this has units of energy
squared, this has no units,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.220
and this is the answer.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.620
A little strange.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:22.140
There's a periodic variation
on the transition probability,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.980
and what does it mean to
have a weak perturbation we

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.210
can ask already?

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.780
And the answer in
general is quite simple.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.020
It's a pragmatic answer.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.000
A perturbation is
weak if this answer

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.400
is very little, very small.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.330
Suppose this probability
comes out to be three,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.490
you know it's already too big.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.060
But if this is 10 to the minus
sixth times this function,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.320
that's reasonable.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.020
You're shining atoms
and one in a million

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.090
goes and gets ionized.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.710
That's a reasonable thing.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.750
So the perturbation theory
is valid for whatever time

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.310
you use this formula as long
as this number is small,

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.410
and this could be arranged by
having Vfi sufficiently small.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.470
I want to understand
this function better,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.170
because this is a transition
from initial state

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.840
to final state that
looks like that.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.250
So let's understand it better.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:31.330
Suppose one, Ef is different
from Ei, then how does it look?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.630
Well, it looks like this.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.840
I brought some other chalk
not that it helps too much.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:45.600
But it looks like this
as a function of time.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:56.970
The height here
is height four Vfi

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:04.350
squared over Ef minus Ei
squared, and it's oscillatory.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.900
It goes to zero again at
time 2 pi over omega fi.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.250
OK, so this is the oscillation.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:23.680
Actually for a small time,
this grows quadratically,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.400
and then it starts blowing up.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.200
So here while the
initial behavior

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.470
would be quadratic
for small time,

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.470
this actually is quadratic
as we will see in a second,

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.480
but you can more or less see
by the expansion of the sine,

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.880
then the initial quadratic
growth gets tamed and becomes

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.630
an oscillation here.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:58.120
This is valid for all times if
this number is relatively small

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.830
so that we believe
perturbation theory,

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.910
and that's that for that case.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.900
It's also interesting
that this gets suppressed

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.010
as the energy of the final
state is different, more

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.810
and more different, from the
energy of the initial state.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.370
So it always oscillates, but
if the state your transition

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.380
is very far away, it is going
to be extremely suppressed

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.040
by the quadratic factors.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.250
So this is an
important suppression.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:36.920
This is saying that transitions
that change the energy

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.540
are not that favored.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.640
A constant perturbation
doesn't supply really

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.590
energy to produce transitions
that change the energy much,

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.390
and they are suppressed.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.450
So they produce them,
but they are suppressed.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.550
The other case
that is of interest

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.420
is the case when
Ef is equal to Ei.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.580
I'm not saying that the state
f is the same as the state i.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.470
Not at all.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.630
It's a different
state but happens

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:16.010
to have the same energy,
and in that case,

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.590
we must take the
limit as Ef goes

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:26.660
to Ei, remember omega fi is
Ef minus Ei so over h bar.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:38.780
So the limit as ef goes to
Ei of this Pif is how much.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.390
I'll kind of do it
in my head here.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:50.750
We have an h bar here that
is going to be left over.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.010
One over h bar,
so h bar squared.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.300
This is going to cancel.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.480
The four is going
to cancel with this,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.640
and we're going
to get vfi squared

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:11.000
over h squared t0 squared.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.750
OK, so here it is,
the quadratic behavior

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.480
when the energy
of the final state

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.390
is the same as the energy
of your original state.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.910
Now, the transition probability
starts to grow quadratically.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:30.590
That cannot be valid
for too long time,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.880
because eventually that
number grows without bound,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.530
and that number could
become as big as 1,

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:46.110
and that transition
is not reasonable.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:59.660
So this is valid
up to some max t0.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.500
And it's up to you,
depends on what Vfi is,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.150
how long you can trust this.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.900
So this is a growth.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.800
This is the same
growth we observe here.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.580
The limit as Ef goes
to Ei go to zero

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.950
is actually the same as the
limit as t goes to zero,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.940
so it's the same
quadratic behavior.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.150
So finally, what's
going to happen?

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.950
What are we aiming here?

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.850
Well, we're aiming
to the case where

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:41.870
we have in the energy line,
we have the initial energy Ei

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:49.070
and then we're going to have
a continuum of final states

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.880
that overlap with Ei.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.040
They're all over there.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.530
That's Ef all over there.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.160
Of course with our box, if
you come with your microscope,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.400
you see lines here.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.850
But they're all there.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.170
There is a continuum
overlapping with this,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.210
and now we're going to attempt
to sum over the continuum.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.755
And what should we observe?

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.640
We should observe that
when we add the continuum

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.310
physically, what do we need?

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:41.430
We need to find what is called
a transition rate, in which you

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:47.160
have the probability of
transition per unit time

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.402
is a constant.

00:16:48.402 --> 00:16:49.860
You see, you have
a phenom-- you're

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.800
shining light on an atom.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.080
OK, you shine
light and you wait.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.640
Eventually the atom ionizes--

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.220
photoelectric effect.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.320
But if you have a billion
atoms, then you can shine light

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.520
and you're going to have a
transition rate, basically how

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.300
many atoms are going
to happen to ionize.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.480
So in order to have
a transition rate,

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.579
the probability
that you transition

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:22.089
has to be proportional
to the time

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.550
that the perturbation
has been acting.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:33.110
So the probability of transition
must grow linear in t.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.660
Therefore, you have
a transition rate

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.320
which is the probability of
transition per unit time,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.770
so you can grow linear
in time, so per unit time

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.720
you have a transition rate.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.050
So somehow look
what's happening here.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:53.630
When Ef is different than Ei,
the transition probability

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.460
is not linear in time.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.110
It does this.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.800
When E approaches--

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.430
Ef approaches Ei, the
probability of transition

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.700
goes quadratic in
time, and what we want

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.080
is a probability of transition
that grows linear in time.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.560
That would define
a transition rate.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.530
So how is that going to happen?

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.940
Well, we'll see it happen
in front of our eyes.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.700
The magic of integration
is going to do it.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.400
And moreover, we're
going to see that

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.480
consistent with this intuition,
most of the transitions

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.100
that are relevant are happening
within Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:43.610
principle of a little energy
interval here around Ei.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.720
So this will be considered to
be at the end of the day energy

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.030
conserving transitions.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:55.280
The Hamiltonian, the delta V
helps the transition happen

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.070
but doesn't supply energy
at the end of the day.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.290
So this is what
we're getting to.
