00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.690
PROFESSOR: Let's then try
to understand intuitively

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.380
some issues with phase shift.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.020
And that, I think,
is pretty valuable.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.380
One shouldn't rush
through these things.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.149
I'm going to erase
this formula already.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.230
It's a little messy.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.210
It's not like you're
going to use it ever.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.320
You could use that
formula if you were

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.330
to compute higher phase shifts.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.500
But at least this homework,
you don't have that.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.970
So let's try to
understand a little

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.340
what phase shifts do for you.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.030
Phase shifts are useful when the
first few phase shifts dominate

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.110
the cross section.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.510
If you have to do this
sum for all values of l,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.210
it can get very difficult.
So if the answer really

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.310
necessitates the tail of l
going to infinity, it's hard.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.850
So in general, we
find that phase shifts

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.920
are useful when the first few
dominate the cross section.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:35.700
So phase shifts are useful if
the first few dominate sigma.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.450
And that will tend to happen
when k a is much less than 1.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.230
And this will
happen in that case.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.270
That will be our argumentation.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.560
We will try to explain why
when k a is less than 1,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.590
this will happen.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.690
So what is k a less than 1?

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.390
Well, it could be
that a is very small.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.530
So one possibility
is short range,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.140
which means a small
compared to other scales,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.180
and maybe there is a problem.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.625
Or the other possibility
is that low energy.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.710
That is, k is small, because
energy goes like k squared.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.410
If k is small, it's low energy.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.440
So these are the
possibilities that

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.660
would allow us to
have a situation where

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.270
only the first few
phase shifts contribute

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.550
to the cross section.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.070
So let's see why
that is the case

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.680
and what is the
intuition for this.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.100
This happens for--

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.065
I think I want to add
here this happens when--

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.240
so the claim above happens
when k a is less than 1.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.680
Let's have a picture of this.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.260
Consider an incident
particle on a potential.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.410
So here is a potential.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.760
Here is r equals 0 and
this is the potential.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.380
Maybe some region-- here's
an incident particle

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.250
coming in with some momentum.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.700
So these ideas are
semi-classical ideas on how

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.210
I'm looking at this particle
coming with some impact

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.170
parameter. b is this distance
to the center, the maximum--

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.190
the closest approach of the
particle to the potential.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.459
That's called the
impact parameter.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.050
And it has momentum p.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:30.220
So b is the impact parameter
and p is the momentum.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.450
And then, what is the angular
momentum of this particle

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.850
with respect to the origin?

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.400
Is r cross p.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:59.785
And so the angular
momentum l is equal to bp.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.290
OK.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.360
So now I'm going to try to
make sense of this equation

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.220
and get an estimate,
considering our situation.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.490
So what is our situation?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.780
In our situation, when we
consider a partial wave

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.480
expansion, we're
considering waves

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.220
with different values of the
orbital angular momentum l.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.910
So when we consider
a little l, we're

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.690
really saying that the angular
momentum is proportional to hl,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.930
where l is the quantum number.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.230
Number.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.200
The number that we're
fixing here each time

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.230
we talk about the partial wave.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.160
Moreover, if we're asking
about the momentum,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.160
we know what is the
typical momentum

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.990
of these waves-- it's hk.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.890
So if I substitute those
two pieces of information

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.130
into the relation of the
angular momentum here--

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:40.730
so l is equal to hl and
b multiplies h bar k,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:47.030
we get that the impact parameter
can be visualized as l over k.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.990
It's a somewhat
classical intuition.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.300
But it gives you an idea.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.640
As you're increasing l, you're
increasing the impact parameter

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.680
intuitively.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.900
A partial wave
scattering process with l

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.600
reflects the input parameter.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.840
If l is equal to 0, you're
hitting the object right on.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:28.820
And now, you can say, all
right, if b is greater than a,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.480
where a is the range
of the potential--

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:45.620
range-- there should be
little or no scattering.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.090
So if b is greater than a,
is little or no scattering.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.950
That's intuitively clear from
the range of the potential.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.840
If the input parameter
is much bigger.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:09.730
So this means l greater than
k a, there is no scattering.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:19.380
And this physically-- this
is classical intrusion

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.550
suggests that the contribution
to scattering from l's

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.330
bigger than k a is negligible.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.340
There's no scattering.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.840
So this is saying that sigma--

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.679
how should I say it?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:41.220
The delta l-- I'll just say
delta l's are small or very

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.929
small--

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:49.080
small-- for l greater than k a.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.280
The delta l, the phase
shifts, enter here,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.540
as sine squared of
the phase shifts.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.680
So they must be very small,
because they just pretty much

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.910
don't contribute.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.980
This is intuition we
were claiming up there.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:17.870
If k a is rather small, very few
phase shifts will contribute.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.080
Because as soon as your
l is bigger than k a,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.050
you get nothing.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:27.830
If k a is much less than 1,
only l equals 0 will contribute.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:36.230
If k a is 1 or 2, it's--

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:39.560
I think I would write here, if--

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:47.350
we don't have to be very
small, but around 1, very few

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.390
will contribute.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:57.970
Or essentially, you could say
that all the l less than k

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.120
contribute.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.070
They contribute.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:10.780
So even if k a, say, was 5, you
could hope that the l's up to 5

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.890
will be a big contribution.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:17.320
And after that, they
start to fall off.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.240
OK.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:25.700
So that's one
intuition into the l's.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:31.830
Second piece of intuition
comes from the solutions

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.410
that you have of
the real equation.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.230
So it's interesting, actually.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.660
Let's look at our
partial waves directly.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.410
Second intuition for this fact--

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:09.520
think of your solution
Jl of kr, Yl of theta.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.830
This is a solution.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.740
Represents a partial wave.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.580
It's the one that doesn't
diverge at the origin.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:24.220
So that makes some sense.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.250
It represents a free
wave, but still is

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.890
giving us an intuition of
how this partial wave is

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.910
supposed to behave.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.890
So I would like to
have an intuition

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.900
of how big is this function
and where it is big.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.200
So this is a solution
of the radial equation.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.830
A radial equation
with no potential.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.310
That doesn't mean zero
effective potential,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.020
because there's always
the centrifugal barrier.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.720
So this is the solution.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:09.350
Solution of the v equals
0 radial equation, which

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:13.220
has a potential,
which is v effective

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:20.120
is h squared, l times l
plus 1 over 2mr squared.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.320
That's the effective potential.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:33.660
And it's a solution with energy
h squared, k squared, over 2m.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.060
So here is r.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.670
Here is the effective potential.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.810
And how does it look?

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.960
Well, it diverges
and then falls off.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:55.650
And you have a solution
with energy equal h squared,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.875
k squared, over 2m.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:08.850
It's a solution of that
problem with that potential.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.530
So here is your intuition.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:18.680
This solution encounters
a barrier here.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.000
So it must be exponentially
suppressed in this distance.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.490
It will be
exponentially suppressed

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.800
as you go below
this turning point.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:35.150
Therefore, this partial wave
will be 0 for some radius

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.050
smaller to a certain
distance here.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.630
And that's back
of our intuition.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.590
If you have some impact
parameter this large,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.880
you have no support
over distances smaller

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.710
than your impact parameter.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.910
There's no wave there.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.270
The wave stays away.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.580
So what we want to show is
that this wave stays away

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:09.350
from the center r equals 0,
again, by a quantity related

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.520
to this thing.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.570
So what do we get?

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.920
Well, we can solve
for the turning point.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:28.400
So h squared l, l plus 1
over 2mr star squared--

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.760
I can call this r star--

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.800
is equal to h squared,
k squared, over 2m.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.940
Lots of things cancel.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.690
2m's, h squared.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:50.030
So you get kr star
squared is roughly equal

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.340
to l times l plus 1.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.530
And here, I can
approximate and I can

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:06.470
say that kr star is roughly l.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:12.090
That's the leading
order square root.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.800
And therefore, the
wave function vanishes.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:24.200
This Jl of kr must be
quite approximately

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:32.730
0 for r less than r
star equal l over k,

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:34.710
which is the impact parameter.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.985
So we know because this must
be exponentially suppressed,

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:46.240
that the wave function
must be very much 0 here.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.590
And that the radial
wave function is this.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.210
So you have derived
that the Jl of kr

00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:00.700
is essentially 0 for r less than
this r star, which is about l

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.990
over k, that we identified
after impact parameter.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.100
So our ideas are consistent.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.030
This partial wave
doesn't reach the origin.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.910
It stays a bit the way.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.740
How much?

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.540
The intuition is
that the distance

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.730
approximate to the
input parameter,

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.160
which is l divided by k.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.100
OK.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.800
So that's another
piece of intuition.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.110
There's one more
classical intuition

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.960
that they think
it's interesting.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.770
It's very surprising,
actually, this third one,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.430
this semi-classical intuition
into what these things are.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:54.410
But they're important because
the subject of phase shift

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.030
seems very technical.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.350
But the phase shifts
have important meaning

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.510
and those partial
waves are interesting.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:12.784
So let's do one more way of
thinking about these matters.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.609
OK.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.754
So I'd say, recall
this equation.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.190
Sigma is given by the total
cross section-- three--

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.050
the total cross section
is given by this sum.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.640
So sigma is the
sum of sigma l's.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.280
And that's a nice notation.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.420
This is the stigma associated
with each partial wave.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.050
No, it's a good thinking.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:18:01.720
And the sigma l is equal
to 4 pi over k squared, 2l

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.660
plus 1, sine squared of delta l.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.110
Now, just from this formula,
when somebody gives you a sigma

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.220
l, you can know whether
they're making sense

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.750
or not, because there
is a test, at least.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:36.210
Sigma l is always less than or
equal to 4 pi over k squared

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.880
times 2l plus 1.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.880
And this just comes
because sine squared

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.400
is less than or equal to 1.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.100
So it's a good test.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.910
People say, oh, I found the
partial cross section given

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.930
by this for that partial wave.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.680
Well, it better satisfy
that, otherwise, you've

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.170
done a wrong calculation.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.850
Some people call this
partial wave unitarity.

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.240
Unitarity has to do with
conservation of probability

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.050
and cross sections
have that thing.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.070
It's a probability to
scatter in some direction,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.350
in some measure.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.580
So this is called
partial wave unitarity.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.415
Wave unitarity.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.080
It's interesting
that these ideas

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.380
have a connection in
classical physics, again, that

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:45.610
allow you to think of,
actually, physically about

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.690
these processes in a way
that illuminates what's

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.910
happening quantum mechanically.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.610
So here is how you
can think of this.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:55.600
We have, again--

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.240
I'll do a nice picture.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.320
I'll try at least.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.740
A source here and
there's a potential.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:16.070
And now I'm going to come
at some impact parameter.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.570
But let me think
of it as coming--

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:26.990
here is the cylinder
of impact parameters.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.720
If you come anywhere on the
surface of this cylinder,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.160
you'll have input parameter b--

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.010
b is here.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.775
Now, let's fit in the cylinder.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.555
I'll fit in the cylinder.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:02.220
To make it of thickness delta b.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.820
Thickness.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.320
So the thickness is delta b.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.850
And you now consider
all these particles

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:19.760
that are going to come
in here and scatter.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.120
Now, in classical
physics, you know

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.380
it's easy or reasonable
to track things,

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.540
because everything
is deterministic.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:37.145
So I can imagine very well
that this shell just goes here.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:50.800
And it becomes a shell
here of particles that

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.330
are going off at some angles.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.360
So, like a trumpet.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.230
This comes like that
and spreads out here.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.860
And all these particles
get scattered.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.870
Deterministically,
that's reasonable.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.927
You have a charge
here, for example,

00:22:09.927 --> 00:22:11.260
and these are charged particles.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.890
They repel and they get
scattered like that.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:26.600
So you could say,
OK, this contribution

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.850
is going to go into a
particular angle, the omega.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.480
So I can think of
this as contributing

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.310
to the differential cross
section at an angle omega,

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:45.620
or some contribution to the
total cross section that

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.470
would come from
integrating and adding up

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:54.590
all these contributions
as you vary this thing.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:58.460
So if I want to compute
how much this contributes

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.680
to the cross section--

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.430
estimate the classical
contribution.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:18.760
Estimate the classical
contribution d sigma to sigma

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.470
from a single partial wave--

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:34.010
single partial wave-- if
I consider a partial wave

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.740
with some value of l.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.370
Think of a partial wave
with a fixed value of l.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:46.340
Then, I have fixed
the impact parameter.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:52.970
If I change l by one
unit, the impact parameter

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.600
changes a little bit.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:01.676
Think of this as
the b of a given l--

00:24:01.676 --> 00:24:04.490
b of a given l.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:08.870
And this delta b or db--

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.310
I'll call it delta
b with capital.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.500
Delta b.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:27.970
As they change in b
for delta l equal 1.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:33.190
You see, each partial wave
corresponds to a different l.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.530
Classically, there's
no quantization.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.640
So I must think of
an impact parameter.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.950
And the partial wave corresponds
to the thickness of this thing

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.820
when the thickness will
correspond to a change of b,

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.220
because l has changed one.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.580
So you can think of
concentric cylinders.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:59.290
The l equals 0 partial wave,
the l equal 1 partial wave,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.850
all of those are cylinders.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.250
And they all contribute areas.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.360
This is the area that
is going to get--

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.310
all the particles
are going to scatter.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:13.210
So this little thin
cross-sectional area

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.200
here is the contribution
to the differential cross

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:26.030
section from this partial wave
in the classical approximation.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.490
So let's do this.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:34.670
So b of l is equal to l over k.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:40.490
And delta b is the change
in b when l changes by 1.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.950
So delta b is 1 over k.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.980
So what is the
differential cross section?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.900
The classical-- classical--

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.090
it's this area.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.550
This is the area
of the beam that

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:03.860
is going to be scattered
in that partial wave.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.670
So it's going to
be 2 pi b delta b.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:15.350
And this is 2 pi l
over k times 1 over k.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.420
And that's not so bad.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:32.800
This is-- I'll write it as 1
over 4, 4 pi over k squared--

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.190
the k squared came
out right-- times 2l.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.250
I wrote it like that because--

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:50.650
here it is-- what the
quantum theory tells you

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.820
the partial wave contribution
to the cross section is

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.610
4 pi over k squared 2l plus 1.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.920
That's pretty much it.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.430
And the classical estimate
gives you one fourth of that.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.330
So pretty nice that
everything works out.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.850
And that there is
a correspondence.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:19.780
And there is a way to
estimate partial contributions

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.470
to the cross section
from classical arguments.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:31.620
So that's our discussion of
the physics of phase shifts

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.200
and the physics of
input parameters

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.530
and l and your intuition
that you must have to them.
