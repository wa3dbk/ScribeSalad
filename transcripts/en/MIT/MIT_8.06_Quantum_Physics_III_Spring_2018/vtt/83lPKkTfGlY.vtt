00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.560
PROFESSOR: So let's do
a connection formula

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.970
and use it to solve a problem.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.430
The derivation of such
connection formulas,

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.200
we'll face it the next time.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.710
And we'll go further
applications of the methods.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.215
So, yes.

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:23.740
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE] that
problem like [INAUDIBLE] where

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.820
the wave function vanished.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
Is that a problem of the
[? our ?] perturbation

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.100
or a classical problem?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.430
Because at that point,
then it means the kinetics

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.860
and the potential are
equals to each other.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.810
So like the potential cannot
be bigger than the energy,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.295
then that's a classical thing.

00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:45.790
That's not a
perturbation problem.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.200
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.040
This is not a problem of
the perturbation theory.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.830
It's just our lack of
knowledge, our ignorance of how

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.080
the solution looks near there.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.920
So there's nice WKB
formulas for this solution

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.010
away from the turning points.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.480
Those are this.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.520
But the solutions near
the turning points

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.560
violate the semiclassical
approximation.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.650
Therefore, you have to find
the solution near the turning

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.560
points by any method you have.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.220
That is not going to be
the semiclassical method.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.310
And then you will
find the continuation.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.330
Now, there's several
ways people do this.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.670
The most down to
earth method, which

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.160
is I think the method we're
going to use next time,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.190
is trying to solve the thing
near there, the solution.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.830
People that are
more sophisticated

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.400
use complex variables,
methods in which they

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.920
think of the solution
in the complex plane,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.170
the x plane becomes complex.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.410
And they're coming
to the turning point

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.540
and they go off
the imaginary axis

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.200
to avoid it and come
on the other side.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.050
It's very elegant,
very nice, harder

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.270
to make very precise, and a
little difficult to explain.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.550
I don't know if
I'll try to do that.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.350
But it's a nice thing.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.450
It's sort of
avoiding the turning

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.490
point by going off the axis.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.500
It sounds crazy.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.870
So here is a connection formula.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.570
Here is x equals a.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.580
Here is v of x.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.520
And here is a solution for
x less than a, little a,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.650
I'll write it like
that, p of x cosine x

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:51.280
to a kappa k of x vx prime
minus pi over 4 minus B

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:02.490
over square root of
p of K of x sine x

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:10.170
to a k of x prime vx
prime minus pi over 4.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.546
So look, this is a general
solution in allowed region.

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:16.920
[INAUDIBLE] no, it doesn't
look like what you wrote here.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.020
But sines and cosines are linear
combinations of these things.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.640
And why do I put this
silly minus pi over 4?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.440
Because that's what
my solutions connect

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.880
to solutions on the other side.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.340
Which is to say that the
solution on the other side,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.760
people that work this
connection formulas,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.710
discovered that takes
this form, a to x

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:58.470
kappa of x prime vx prime plus
b over the square root of kappa

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:12.005
of x e exponential a to x
kappa of x prime vx prime.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.940
So here it is.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.459
Those numbers, a
and b, are things

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.680
you have to keep track now.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.150
They say if your solution
for x greater [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.880
has this decaying exponential
and this growing exponential

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.030
with b an a, your
solution far to the left

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.140
will look like this.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.540
It's a pretty strange statement.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.240
Sometimes you don't
want b to be 0.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.100
Sometimes you do.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.200
Let's do an example
with this stuff

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.510
so that you can
appreciate what goes on.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.410
So that's your first look
at a connection condition.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.020
There's a little bit of
subtleties on how to use them.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.470
We will discuss those
subtleties next time, as well.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.320
But let's use it in a case
where we can make sense of this

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.610
without too much trouble.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.720
So here is the example.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.890
And somebody wants you to
solve the following problem.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.340
You have some slowly
varying potential

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.690
that grows, grows indefinitely.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.830
v of x.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.330
And you wish to find
the energy eigenstates.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.240
In particular, you wish
to find the energies.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.420
What are the possible
energies of this potential?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.700
This potential with have
a infinite wall here.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.000
So the potential
is infinite here.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.390
And it grows like
that up on this side.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.180
We're going to try to write
the solution for this.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:24.860
So we'll do this with
the WKB solution.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.710
And let me do it in
an efficient way.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.160
So what do we have here?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.280
This is the analog of
our point x equals a.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.910
Is that right?

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.310
This is the point where the
turning solution goes funny.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.390
So we will call it, for the
same reason we did before,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.695
this point a will
make matters clearer.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.740
We truly don't know
what that point

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.200
is because we truly don't know
what are the allowed energies.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.740
But so far we can write E as
a variable that we don't know.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.030
And a can be determined if
you know E because you know

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.451
the shape of the potential.

00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:17.950
OK.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.860
So let's think of the region,
x much greater than a.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.420
We are here.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.100
We're in a forbidden region.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.710
And the potential is
still slowly varying.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.850
Let's assume that
slope is small.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.465
So a solution of this
type would make sense.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:46.710
So we must have a WKB solution
on this right hand side

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.450
to the right of x equals a.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.620
And that's the most general
solution we'll have.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.440
On the other hand,
here there's two types

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.670
of solutions, a growing
exponential and a decaying

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.550
exponential.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.040
And we must have only
the decaying exponential.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.940
Because this
potential never turns.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.800
If this potential would grow
here and then turn down,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.430
you might have what is
called the tunneling problem.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.920
And this has to be rethought.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.840
But this problem is
still a little easier.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.520
We have just this
potential growing forever.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.530
And on the right, we
must have b equal to 0.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:42.300
For x greater than a
solution, b is equal to 0.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:49.290
And this solution must
have a different from 0.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.120
But if the solution
has a different from 0,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.840
we now know the
solution on this region,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.090
x significantly less than a.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.640
In this region we
know the solution is

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.170
given by that formula up there.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:13.590
So our solution for x much
less than a, the solution

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.340
must take the form
whatever a is.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.440
1, 2, 3.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.320
I kind of normalized
these things yet.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.780
So the solution, I'll write it,
psi of x, will be of the form 1

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:36.450
over square root of
k of x cosine of x

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:43.900
to a k of x prime vx
prime minus pi over 4.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.080
All right.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.850
That's what WKB predicts because
of the connection condition.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.080
On the forbidden region,
you know which wave exists.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.220
And therefore, far to the
left of the turning point,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.390
you'd also know
the wave function.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.750
It's the term within a.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.550
So have we solved the problem?

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.332
Well, I don't think we have.

00:10:13.332 --> 00:10:18.020
We still don't know the energy,
so we must have not solved it.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:22.880
In fact, it doesn't look
like we've solved it at all.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.580
Because at x equals 0,
these wave functions

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.870
should vanish because
there's a hard wall.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:40.590
And I don't see any reason
why it would vanish.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:49.350
So let's do a little
work here expanding this

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.150
and orienting it
a little better.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:59.820
So I want to write this
integral from 0, x to a.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.140
You're having an integral.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.220
You have 0, x, and a.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.430
Because we are in the
x less than a region,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.300
this integral is the
one that we have here.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.750
I'll write it as
an integral from 0

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:20.220
to a minus an
integral from 0 to x.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:26.280
So integral from x to
a is equal to integral

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:33.220
from 0 to a minus an
integral from 0 to x.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.155
This will make things
a little clearer.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:12:02.270
In fact, we could do things
still a little easier.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.620
So what do we have here?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.690
We have this exponential,
the wave function.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.270
Not an exponential, a
trigonometric function.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:21.400
1 over square root of k of x
cosine of minus the integral

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.105
from 0 to x of k of x dx prime.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.570
This integral gives
rise to two integrals

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.555
and I wrote the first.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.560
Then I come with
the other [? sine ?]

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.590
plus the integral from 0
to a of k prime of x dx

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.960
prime minus pi over 4.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:58.555
And let's call this thing delta.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.130
So let's explore this wave
function a little more.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.460
So things have
become kind of nice.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.280
There's no x dependence here.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.280
That's very nice about
this part of the formula.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.070
This is an angle.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.210
No x dependence.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:29.000
And the x dependence is
just here from this term.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.710
And it's a nice x dependence
because it's an integral from 0

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.290
to x.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.030
So it's kind of nice.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.750
The upper limit has the x.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.520
It's all kind of elegant.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.830
So trigonometric
function of this cosine

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:55.986
of a difference of things
is equal to its cosine

00:13:55.986 --> 00:14:10.710
of the first term, 0 to x k of
x prime dx prime cosine delta

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:21.311
plus sine of the first term 0
to x k of x prime dx prime sine

00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:21.810
delta.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.420
You have this quantity
and this delta.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.440
So I use this trigonometric sum.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:38.940
OK.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.275
But now you can
see something nice.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.000
What did we say about
the wave function?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.305
It had to vanish at the origin.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.870
And let's look at
these two functions.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.080
Which one vanishes
at the origin?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.530
You have cosine of
the integral from 0

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.480
to x when x is equal to
0 at the origin is cosine

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.490
of 0, which is 1.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.630
On the other hand, when
x is small, x goes to 0.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.720
You get 0 for the integral
and the sine vanishes.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.640
So this is the right term.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.300
So this wave function
would be correct

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.310
if this term would be absent.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.335
This is a term that
you must make absent.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.250
Psi of x without that term
would be a valid wave function.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.780
It is the wave function.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.530
Therefore, the
right wave function

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.420
if we demand that cosine
delta be equal to 0.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.250
So now we're imposing a
very non-trivial condition.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.030
This wave over there.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.490
This contribution to the
argument, to the angle

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:12.940
here, this delta must be
such that cosine delta is 0.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.510
In which case, this
term would disappear

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.700
and we would have a
good wave function.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.350
Psi of x, if this is true,
is 1 over square root

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:29.890
of k of x times sine times
the sine delta, which

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:30.960
is another number.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.945
Sine of 0 to x k of
x prime dx prime.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.560
So we need cosine
delta equal to 0.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.680
You know, this
argument gives you

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.440
this wave function in a nice
way here written what it is.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.840
But we would have been able
to find this even faster.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.730
If you just demand that
Psi at x equals 0 is 0,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:09.310
you must have that this thing,
the integral from 0 to a

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:14.319
of this quantity minus pi
over 4 must have 0 cosine.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.440
And that's the
condition we did fine.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.599
The advantage of
our rearrangement

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.480
is that when that happens,
the whole wave function

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.950
looks like that.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.329
And that's kind of nice.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.840
That gives you the picture
of the wave function.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.665
A fairly accurate picture of the
wave function in this region.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:41.050
Not very near the turning
point, but you got that.

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.970
So what is this cosine
delta going to 0?

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:57.160
Well then delta must be
2n plus 1 times pi over 2.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.410
So the places where the
cosine is 0 is pi over 2.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.330
That's for n equals 0.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.185
3 pi over 2.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.420
So for n equal 1.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.560
And it just goes.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.720
The vertical axis
and the unit circle.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.730
So this is for n equals 0,
1, 2, 3, goes on and on.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:27.100
And this is a very
wonderful condition.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:35.110
This says that the integral
from 0 to a of k of x prime dx

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.500
prime minus pi over 4.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.880
So actually, we have here
you can multiply the 2 here.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.010
You get an n.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.510
And then you have pi over 2.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.830
And the pi over 4 that
comes from that term

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:58.770
becomes n plus 3/4 pi.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.990
It's a Bohr-Sommerfeld
quintessential condition.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.290
Look, I box that equation
because that really

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.650
gives you the answer.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.170
Now, why?

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:13.590
Because you know what k is.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:20.040
k p of x is equal to
h bar k is square root

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.745
of 2n E minus v of x.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.770
And if you know E, you know a.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.430
So you have now an integral.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.160
And you take, for
example, n equals 0.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.890
So you want the integral
to be equal to 3/4 pi.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.400
But you will have to
start changing the value

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.030
of the energy with your computer
if you cannot do the integral

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.480
analytically and find, oops,
for this value of the energy

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.670
the integral of what I know,
this is a known function,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.870
gives me this value.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.460
So this is a very practical way
of finding the energy levels.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.120
It does give you the
approximate energy levels.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.560
And it's remarkably
accurate in many cases.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.600
It also has a little
intuition this

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.820
is for n equals 0 would
be like the ground state.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.650
n equal 1 first take
on excited states.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.570
And indeed, that makes sense.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:31.780
Because this integral
from 0 to a of k

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.680
is the total phase
of the wave function

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.160
as you move from 0 to a.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.360
And that wave is a
number of factor n

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.670
times pi plus a little bit.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.210
So it has time for m 0s.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:55.000
The phase as you move from
0 to a in the wave function,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.830
the sine function will
have n 0s if this condition

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.330
is satisfied consistent
with that solution.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.550
So that's it.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.170
We'll continue next time.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.840
Find the solution
of WKB exactly.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.770
All right.
