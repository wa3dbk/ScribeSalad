00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.530
PROFESSOR: For a
couple of lectures,

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.130
we're going to be discussing
now the hydrogen atom.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.520
So you've seen the
hydrogen atom before.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.190
You've seen it in 804.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.560
You've seen it in 805.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.190
Why do we see it again in 806?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.710
Well, the hydrogen atom is a
fairly sophisticated example.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.190
It's the harmonic oscillator
of atomic physics.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.760
If some of you are going
to be doing atomic physics,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.110
eventually, you have to
understand the atom perfectly

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.090
well, the energy levels, the
degeneracies, why are they,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
how do you separate
the levels, how

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.850
do you split the degeneracies.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.520
It's a fantastically
good example

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.240
of perturbation theory,
our degenerate perturbation

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.360
theory, non-degenerate
perturbation

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.190
theory in some cases.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.150
But overall, it's a very
important physical system

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.239
that affects many
areas of physics,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.770
astrophysics with
hyper fine splitting,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.210
all kind of processes in
atomic physics and lasers,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.880
and things like that.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.570
So it's something we really
want to understand well.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.150
And this time in 806, it's
the right time for you

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.140
to understand the fine
structure of this atom.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.940
Bits and pieces of this
have been done before.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.670
But now, we're going
to do it in detail.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.010
So let's start with hydrogen
atom fine structure.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.500
Hydrogen atom fine structure.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.650
That is the main topic
for a couple of lectures.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.220
So in terms of
Hamiltonians, we've

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.960
been talking of an unperturbed
Hamiltonian, an H0.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.830
This Hamiltonian is known.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:16.370
It's the momentum squared over
2m minus e squared over r.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.690
Here, this is the momentum
in three dimensions.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.860
It's a three-dimensional
system, of course.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.230
This m is the mass of the
electron times the mass

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.130
of the proton, divided by
the mass of the electron

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.570
plus the mass of the proton.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.280
And that's the reduced
mass of the system,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.730
but it's approximately equal
to the mass of the electron.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910
So we will--
whenever we write m,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.410
it will be the mass
of the electron.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:06.960
Now, if you happen to have a
nucleus with z protons, what

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:14.660
you have to do is replace
this e squared by z e squared.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.760
And this is because
the factor of e

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.280
squared comes from the
product of the charge

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.340
of the electron times the
charge of the nucleus.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.320
So if the charge of the
nucleus becomes z times bigger,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.945
this e squared is
replaced by this quantity.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.890
What important length
scales exist here

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.520
is the bore radius is the
most important length scale,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.530
and it's constructed with
the quantities that appear

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.150
in this Hamiltonian and H bar.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.990
So in particular, doesn't
involve the speed of light.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.570
There's nothing in this
system that is relativistic.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.920
So this quantity is h
squared over m e squared.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.940
And that this has
units of length

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.700
is something that you
should be able to derive

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.840
from here in a few instance.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.390
Please make sure you
know how to derive it

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.560
without having to count mass,
length, time units here.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.700
This is something you should
be able to do very quickly.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.530
One piece of
intuition, of course,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.150
is that the e appears in the
denominator, which is intuition

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.360
that as the strength
of electromagnetism

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.790
is made smaller and smaller
by letting e goes to 0,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.590
the orbit of the electron
would be bigger and bigger.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:04.030
So this is about 53
picometers, where a picometer

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.220
is 10 to the minus 12 meters.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.960
A nice unit.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.010
It's half an angstrom,
roughly, but picometers

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.020
is the right unit for
people that think of atoms.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.250
Then the energy levels are given
by minus e squared over 2a0 1

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.240
over n squared.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.640
This is a beautiful formula
in terms of quantities

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.510
that you understand.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.890
First, the energy just depends
on n, and this 1 over n

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.550
squared.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.310
And n is called the
principle quantum

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.780
number, principle
quantum number,

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.760
and it goes from
1 up to infinity.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.030
This has units of
energy, and that's

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.160
why this is nice,
because e squared over

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.130
r is the units of potential
energy in electromagnetism.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.460
So when you see this,
you know that this

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.270
has the right units of energy.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.770
And for the ground
state of hydrogen,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:32.050
n equal 1, that energy
is about minus 13.6 eV.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.690
Now, in terms of thinking
ahead for perturbation theory,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.050
some of the
perturbation theory here

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.820
will reflect the fact that
electromagnetism is weak,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.860
and the other fact will reflect
that the electron is actually

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.570
moving with slow velocities.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.210
So let's see these two things.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.730
First, we can write
the energy, or in terms

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.500
of defined structure constant.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.510
So alpha, which is defined
structure constant.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.790
This e squared over [? hc, ?]
the units we're working with.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.390
And it's about 137.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:21.720
So whenever you see
e squared over a0,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.920
which is a unit of energy,
you should realize that--

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.950
if you wanted to change
that, for example,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.850
for the case that you have
a nucleus with z protons,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.420
you cannot just do e
squared going to ze squared,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:44.400
because in fact, a0,
itself, has an e.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.750
So don't think that the
energy depends like e squared.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.540
It actually depends more
like e to the fourth times

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.350
other constants.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.000
So let's do that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.300
So we have here m e
to the fourth over h

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.620
squared, using the value of a0.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.800
And then we can use e to the
fourth from this equation.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.980
So it would be alpha m
alpha squared h bar squared

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.160
c squared over h bar squared.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.850
And it's equal to alpha
squared mc squared.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.880
A nice way of thinking
of the ground state

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:41.010
energy of the hydrogen
as a small quantity alpha

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.820
squared times the rest
energy of the electron.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.930
After all, the system begins
just with an electron,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.350
and it has some rest
energy, and there

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.560
should be a natural
way of expressing this.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.150
Of course, you start
seeing this c squared here.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.220
But the c squared
really is nowhere there.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.010
We've put it for convenience.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.330
But it allows us
to think of scales,

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.840
and in particular, the
rest mass of the electron

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.600
is alpha is much bigger,
because alpha squared is about 1

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.120
over 19,000.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.670
1/137 squared is about that.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:32.820
So the energy, en, can
be written in a way

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:39.830
that we will use often as
minus 1/2 alpha squared

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.675
mc squared 1 over n squared.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:50.870
All right.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:10:02.010
And another observation, the
momentum of the electron, we

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.340
could estimate it
to be h bar over a0.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:16.670
So this is me
squared over h bar.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.110
And we use the e
squared for what it is.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.940
So this is alpha.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:34.950
Well, I'll put m,
alpha hc over h bar.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.260
So this is alpha mc.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.420
It's a nice thing, alpha mc.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.240
It says that the momentum
that you could construct

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.770
relativistically, the
mass of the electron

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.980
times the velocity, you
still have to divide by 137.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.220
But it's clearer if you write
it like m alpha c, and then

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.280
momentum, which is mass
times velocity, at least

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.920
for slow velocities.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.200
Now is mass times alpha times c.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.850
So the approximate velocity
that we estimate on the electron

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:22.460
is c over 137.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.020
So that's very nice.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.010
It's kind of non-relativistic.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:27.690
OK.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.400
So this is the basic things.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.140
But the most important
stuff is really

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.770
getting the table of
how the atom looks.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.100
So this is still review.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.220
Half of this lecture,
in a sense, is review.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:50.720
We put here, not in scale,
n equals 1, n equals 2,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.425
n equals 3, and n equals 4.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:03.940
In reality, the hydrogen
atom, if this is 0 energy,

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.550
and this is the ground state,
the ground state that's here,

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.480
the second excited state
is here, the third is here,

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.700
the fourth is here, fifth,
they all accumulate here.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.640
But that I've
written it this way.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.420
Now, we'll have l
equals 0 here, l

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.490
equals 1, l equals
2, l equals 3.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:31.330
And there is another
notation for this state.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.920
I don't know why, but there is.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.070
A capital l that
is a function of l.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:46.510
So capital l of l
equals 0 is called s.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:52.780
So these states are
called s states.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:58.330
Capital l of l
equals 1 is called p.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.260
So states with l equal
1 will be called p.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.090
Then d and f.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.000
These are names.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.560
We'll use those names.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.390
They're OK.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.860
And here are the states.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:19.570
For n equal 1, there's
just one state here.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.590
And here there's
one state as well.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.670
But for n equal 2, there
is a state with l equal 0,

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.950
and there is a state
with l equal 1.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.160
For n equal 3,
there's 0, 1, and 2.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.045
For n equal 4, there's
0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:42.010
So these are the states in the
spectrum of hydrogen, something

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.340
that we should know very well.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.510
And what are the patterns here.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.070
They're degeneracies.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.640
Why?

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.180
Because when we talk l
equal 2, for example,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.360
that means a multiplet
of angular momentum

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.850
with total angular momentum 2.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.660
And that comes with as
azimuthal angular momentum

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.520
that goes from minus 2 m to
plus 2, that is five states.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.400
So in principle, each bar here
is five states, five states.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.130
l equal 1 has m equal
1, 0, and minus 1.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.040
So three states, three
states, three states.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.730
And here, really zero states.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.420
So there's lots of degeneracy.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.630
That's why we spend
lots of time studying

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.110
degenerate perturbation
theory, because this gigantic

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.210
degeneracies here.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.000
So to determine the
origin or the way

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.180
we parametrize the
degeneracy, there's

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.940
just one formula
that says it all.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.230
And that formula
is degeneracies.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.770
It's the formula
that explains it all,

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.020
and it says that the
principle quantum

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:02.110
number is equal to capital
n plus l plus 1, where

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:14.660
n is the degree of a polynomial
in the wave function.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.400
Wave function.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.130
l is the orbital
angular momentum.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:36.350
So this says, for example, that
this degree of the polynomial n

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.780
can be 0, 1, 2.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.490
It cannot be negative.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:45.870
l can also be 0, 1, and go on.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.280
But here, for example,
you see the main rule

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:59.070
that for a fixed n, you
can have l equals 0 1, 2,

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.750
up to n minus 1,
because by the time

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.010
you take l equals to n
minus 1, this whole thing

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.510
is equal to little n,
and capital n is 0.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.550
And that's as far as you can go.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:19.460
So the angular momentum cannot
exceed the principle quantum

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.260
number minus 1.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.820
That is what we see
here for n equal 3.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.510
You can have up to l equal 2.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:31.770
For n equal 4, you can
have up to l equal 3.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.540
So this is kind of well known.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:42.940
Now, for each l,
each l, you have

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.070
m from minus l all
the way to plus l.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.650
And that's 2l plus 1 values.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:03.260
So the degeneracy at n, at
the principle quantum number

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:11.329
equal n is the sum from l
equals 0 up to n minus 1.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.359
Those are all the
possible values

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:23.000
of l of the number of
states in each l multiplet.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.790
And you've done this one
before, and that actually

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.630
turns out to be equal
to n squared, which

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.960
says there should be
four states at n equal 2,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:39.660
indeed one state for S equals
0, three states here is 4, 1, 3,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.110
5.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:47.630
It's that property that the
sum of consecutive odd numbers

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.730
comes up equal to the
square, a perfect square.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.150
It's a very nice
thing geometrically.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.790
So the wave function--

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.365
we'll write it here-- the
wave function psi mlm.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:11.790
These are our quantum numbers
and principal quantum number.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.560
Once you know n, you know
the sum of capital N plus l.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.850
But l is a little
more physical than n.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:24.290
So we'll use l, and
once you know l,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.740
you still need to know where a
given state, which value of m

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.380
you have.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.400
So those are your
three quantum numbers,

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:39.260
and this wave function goes
like a constant times r over a0

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:47.690
to the l times that polynomial
we spoke about, 1 plus beta r

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:58.590
to the r over a0 all the way
up to a number times r over a0

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:12.370
to the capital N times e to
the minus r over n a0 times

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.370
ylm of theta and phi.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:21.975
So that's your wave function.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.090
Those numbers I
have not determined.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.550
I have not determined
the normalization.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:32.940
But if you're looking
at the wave function,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.450
the easiest place to see
the principal quantum number

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:37.200
is here.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:45.730
The easiest place to see
the orbital angular momentum

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.710
is here.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.400
You identify it from here.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.590
It must be multiplying
a polynomial that

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.790
begins with 1, because the
leading power in the solution

00:19:54.790 --> 00:20:01.330
must be r to the l,
and has degree n here.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:06.220
And the m quantum number you see
it from the spherical harmonic.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.340
So in particular, here
you have a state with l

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.500
equals 0, n equal 1.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.100
So this must have n equals 0.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.570
This must have n
equals 1, because you

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:29.310
must get to 2 with a capital N
and l equals 0 and a 1 there.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.950
So this is n equal 1.

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.430
This would be n
equal 2, n equal 3.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:40.685
Similarly here, n equals
0, n equals 1, n equals 2,

00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:46.970
n equals 0, n equals
1, n equals 0 here.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.650
The n's decrease in this
direction as l increases,

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.930
keeping the sum of capital
N and l constant and equal

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.790
to little m minus 1.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:06.120
Interestingly, this
makes sense as well.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.300
If you may remember, the
quantum number N, capital N,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.940
tells you the number of
nodes of the wave function,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.250
because a polynomial of
degree n can have n zeros,

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.260
and therefore,
this wave function

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.560
has no nodes, one node,
two nodes, three nodes.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.170
The number of nodes increase.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.990
That's another thing that
wave functions should have.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.220
So a couple more
comments and this.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:44.620
We'll write-- I'll write the
ground state wave function.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.540
I'll put it here.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.540
I'm cluttering
things a little bit.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.670
But the ground
state wave function

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:55.190
is one that we can have
and normalize easily.

00:21:55.190 --> 00:22:03.150
Square root of pi over a0
cubed e to the minus r over a0.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.890
That's the ground
state wave function.

00:22:07.445 --> 00:22:07.945
OK.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.390
Comments on this thing.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:19.710
First, there is a very
large degeneracy here.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.700
And it has a nice
interpretation.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.200
This correspond to states with
different values of the angular

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.330
momentum.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:35.520
Semi-classically, if you
were doing Keplerian emotion,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.480
and think semi-classically
of the electron orbit,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.370
all the orbits here
corresponds of orbits

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.780
of the electron with the
same semi-major axis,

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.370
but with different eccentricity.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:59.130
So as it turns out,
the orbit with least

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:03.840
l is the most eccentric
of all orbits.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.210
And as you go in this
direction, the orbit

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.760
becomes more and more circular.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.420
So if you want an
immediate intuition,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.590
as to why are all these
states distinguishable,

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.800
it's because they are orbits
with different eccentricity.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.790
There are ellipses with
different eccentricity,

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.200
all with the same
semi-major axis.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.380
So it could be a
circle like that,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.920
or it could be just
an ellipse like that.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.015
So those are it.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.290
Then, most important
complication we've

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:46.480
ignored here, it's the
spin of the electron.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.800
Electron has spin.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.650
So we know the spin
of the electron

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.680
represents a degree
of freedom described

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.990
by a two-dimensional
vector space.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.730
So there's two states
in every one of this.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.730
So we will have
to consider that.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:10.390
And if I want to put the
number of states on each one,

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.340
here there was
one state we said,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.485
but now we know there
are really two states.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.310
And here, there's two
states is l equals 0, two

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.220
states, two states.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.900
Here is l equal 1.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.440
That's three configurations
of orbital angular momentum.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:35.590
But the electron has, again,
up or down possibilities.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:41.380
So these are six states,
six states, six states.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.510
l equals 2 is five states,
but with the electron,

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:49.600
there is 10 states
and 10 states here.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.400
In this one, l equals 3
is 7 states, 2l plus 1,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.490
but with the electron degrees
of freedom is 14 states.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.815
So these are the right
number of states.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.960
When we'll do the
fine structure,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.430
we'll have corrections due
to the spin and corrections

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.100
due to relativity.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.710
Both things will
make our corrections.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.910
And by the time we
do that, we may also

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.300
want to explore the
atom by putting it

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.680
in an electric field.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.270
That's the stark effect.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.330
It will change energy
levels, and you learn more

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.240
about the energy
levels of a system.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.920
You can put it in
a magnetic field,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.130
and that's a Zeeman effect.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.580
And the magnetic field can
be weak, or it can be strong,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.410
and it's a different
approximation,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:51.080
and there's several things
we have to do with it.
