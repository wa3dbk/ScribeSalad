00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.130
PROFESSOR: I now have that new
n of t that we wrote there.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.800
I have to write
it as what it is.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.680
It's i psi n of r of t times--

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.550
I will write it here
this way-- d dt--

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.900
the dot will be
replaced by the d dt--

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.371
psi n of r of t.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.650
And then, of course,
the gamma n of t

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.280
will be just the
integral from 0 to t

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.740
of new n of t prime bt prime.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.620
So that's the next step.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.370
Well, if you have
to differentiate

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.080
a function that depends on
r of t, what do you have?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.680
Let me do it for a simpler
case, d dt of f of r of t.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.370
This means d dt of a
function of r1 of t

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.830
are all the ones up to rn of t.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.660
And what must you do?

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:37.920
Well, you should do
df dr1 times dr1 dt

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.860
all the way up to
the df dr and drn dt.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.830
You want to find the time
dependence of a function that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
depends on a collection of
time-dependent coordinates.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.280
Well, the chain rule applies.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.980
But this can be written
in a funny language--

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.690
maybe not so funny--

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:21.280
as the gradient sub r vector
of f dotted dr vector dt.

00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:29.770
See, the gradient, in
general, is d dx1 d dx2 d dx3.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.720
It's a vector operator.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.150
The gradient sub r would
mean d dr1 d dr2 d dr3,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.970
just the gradient in
this Euclidean vector

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.690
space times dr dt.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.520
So that's what I want to
use for this derivative.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.950
I have to differentiate
that state.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.470
And therefore, I'll
write it that way.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.580
So gamma n of t is equal
to i, from the top line,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:25.810
psi n of r of t times gradients
of r acting on the state psi

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.310
n of r of t dotted with dr dt.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.450
This is dot product.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.520
So just to make sure
you understand here,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.340
you have one ket here, and
you have this gradient.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.420
So that gives you
capital N components,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.410
the derivative of the ket
with respect to r1 r2 r3 r4.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.090
Then with the inner product,
it gives your capital

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.320
N numbers, which are the
components of a vector that is

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.589
being dotted with this vector.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.750
It's all about
trying to figure out

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.900
that this language makes sense.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.990
If this made sense to you,
this should make sense,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.380
a little more, maybe a
tiny bit more confusing.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.980
But maybe you should
write it all out.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.360
What do you think it is?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.480
And that might help you.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.710
Or we could do that later.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:53.470
So if we have that, we can go
to gamma n, the geometric phase.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.510
So this is 0 2t, the integral
with respect to prime time,

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.630
so new m.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.060
So it's i psi n r of t prime--

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.560
there's lots of vectors
here, gradient r vector

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:29.320
of psi n r of t prime
dotted dr dt prime dt prime.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.310
That's the last dt prime.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.730
And the good thing that
happened, the thing that

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.430
really makes all the
difference, the thing that

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.300
is responsible for
that conceptual thing

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.430
is just this cancellation.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.340
This cancellation means that
you can think of the integral

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.380
as happening just in
the configuration space.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.840
This is not really an
integral over time.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.860
This is an integral
in configuration space

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.070
because now this integral is
nothing else than the integral

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.090
over the path gamma.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.340
Because the path
gamma represents

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.210
the evolution of the coordinate
capital R from 0 to time t.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.480
This is nothing else than
the integral over the path

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.520
gamma of i psi n of r--

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.750
I don't have to
write the t anymore--

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.390
dr psi n of r--

00:06:47.390 --> 00:07:07.460
again no t-- dot dr. And this
is the geometric phase gamma n

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.162
that depends on r on the path.

00:07:12.162 --> 00:07:16.090
I'll write it like that.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.980
You see, something very
important has happened here.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.970
It's a realization that
time plays no role anymore.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.210
This is the concept.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.580
This is what you have to
struggle to understand here.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.160
This integral says
take this path.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:46.520
Take a little dr dot it with
this gradient of this object,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.390
which is kind of the gradient
of this ket, which is

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.480
a lot of kets with this thing.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.140
So it's a vector.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.920
Dot it with this and integrate.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.570
And time plays no role.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.120
You just follow the path.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.800
So whether this
thing took one minute

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.930
to make the path
or a billion years,

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.220
the geometric phase will
be exactly the same.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.990
It just depends on
the path it took.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.300
Time for some names
for these things.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.710
Let's see.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:53.330
So a first name is
that this whole object

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.870
is going to be called
the Berry connection.

00:09:00.114 --> 00:09:12.340
i psi n of r
gradient r psi n of r

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:22.090
is called the Berry
connection a n vector of r.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.780
Berry connection.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.300
OK, a few things to notice,
the Berry connection

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.000
is like a vector in the
configuration space.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.520
It has capital N components
because this is a gradient.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.860
And therefore, it produces
of this ket n kets

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.280
and, therefore, n numbers
because of the bra.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.160
So this is a thing with
capital N components.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.250
So it's a vector in RN.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.800
But people like the
name connection.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.350
Why Connection?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.650
Because it's a little
more subtle than a vector.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.090
It transforms under
Gage transformation,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.720
your favorite things.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.605
And it makes it interesting
because it transforms

00:10:30.605 --> 00:10:31.780
under Gage transformation.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.790
We'll see it in a second.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.340
So it's a connection
because of that.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.220
And there's one Berry
connection for every eigenstate

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.760
of your system.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.780
Because we fix some n,
and we got the connection.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.170
And we're going to get different
connections for different n's.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:11:02.140
So n components,
one per eigenstate,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.640
and they live all over
the configuration space.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.310
You can ask, what is
the value of the Berry

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.330
connection at this point?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.820
And there is an answer.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.340
At every point, this
connection exists.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:26.630
Now, let's figure out the issue
of gauge transformations here.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:35.140
And it's important because
this subject somehow--

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.570
these formulas, I
think in many ways,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.340
were known to everybody
for a long time.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:47.800
But Berry probably clarified
this issue of the time

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.940
independence and
emphasized that this could

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.520
be interesting in some cases.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:12:00.040
But in fact, in most
cases, you could say

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.290
they're not all that relevant.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.910
You can change them.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.205
So here is one thing
that can happen.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.010
You have your
energy eigenstates,

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.620
your instantaneous eigenstates.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.350
You solve them,
and you box them.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.590
You're very happy with them.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.680
But in fact, they're
far from unique.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.280
Your energy eigenstates,
your instantaneous energy

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.830
eigenstates can be changed.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:37.180
If you have an energy
eigenstate psi n of r--

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.460
that's what it is--

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.180
well, you could decide
to find another one.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:51.070
Psi prime of r is going to
be equal to e to the minus

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:57.005
some function, arbitrary
function, of r times this.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.340
And these new states
are energy eigenstates,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.830
instantaneous energy
eigenstates that

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.460
are as good as
your original psi n

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.410
because this equation also
holds for the psi n primes.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.180
If you add with the Hamiltonian,
the Hamiltonian in here

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:27.810
just goes through this and
hits here, produces the energy,

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.830
and then the state
is just the same.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.360
The r of t's are parameters
of the Hamiltonian.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.080
They're not operators.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.650
So there's no reason
why the Hamiltonian

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.860
would care about this factor.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.090
The r's are just parameters.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.987
Yes?

00:13:49.987 --> 00:13:53.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.010
PROFESSOR: No, they're
still normalized.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.740
I should put a phase here--
thank you very much--

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.410
minus i.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.880
Thank you.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.910
Yes, I want the states
to be normalized,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.460
and I want them
to be orthonormal.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.780
And all that is not changed
if I put them phase.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.700
So this is the funny thing
about quantum mechanics.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.510
It's all about phases
and complex numbers.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:25.410
But you can, to a large degree,
change those phases at will.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:30.240
And whatever survives is some
sort of very subtle effects

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.170
between the phases.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:37.310
So here I put the i
and beta of r is real.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.830
PROFESSOR: So you can say
let's compute the new Berry

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:55.645
connection associated with
this new state a n prime of r.

00:14:55.645 --> 00:15:01.400
So I must do that operation
that we have up there

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.600
with the news state.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:11.030
So I would have i psi n of r
times e to the i beta of r.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.460
That's The bra.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:22.700
Then I have dr and now the
ket, e to the minus i beta of r

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.830
psi n of r.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.970
So this is, by definition,
the new Berry connection

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:36.520
associated to your new,
redefined eigenstates.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:45.200
Now this nabla is acting
on everything to the right.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.590
Suppose it acts on the state
and then the two exponentials

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.960
will cancel, and then you
get the old connection.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:02.170
So there is one term here,
which is just the old a n of r.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.320
There's all these arrows there.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.090
There's probably five arrows
at least I miss on every board.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:17.135
Here is a 1, 2, 3, 4 5.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:25.310
OK, so this is the
first one, and then you

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:32.400
have the term for this gradient
acts on this exponential.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.550
When the gradient acts
on the exponential,

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.810
it gives the same
exponential times

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.900
the gradient of the exponent.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.110
The exponentials then cancel.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:48.030
The gradient of the exponent
would give me plus i times

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.475
minus i gradient of beta.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.420
Maybe I'll put the r of the r.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:05.280
And then these cancel, and you
have the state with itself,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.619
which gives you 1.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:12.109
So that's all it is, all that
the second term gives you.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:22.490
So here we get a n of r plus
gradient r of beta of r.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.880
So this is the gauge
transformation.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.280
And you say, wow,
I can see now why

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.900
this is called a connection.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.080
Because just like
the vector potential

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.380
under a gauge
transformation, it transforms

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.450
with a gradient of a function.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:56.530
So it really transforms
as a vector potential, all

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.400
in this space called
the configuration space,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.100
not in real space.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.930
In the configuration space it
acts like a vector potential.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.280
And that's why it's
called a connection.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.350
But let's see.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.470
We have now what happens
to the connection.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:23.830
Let's see what happens to the
Berry's phase if you do this.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:28.885
So the Berry's phase over
there is this integral.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.670
So the Berry's phase can change.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.690
And let's see what happens
to the Berry's phase.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:19:02.200
So what is the geometric
phase gamma n of gamma?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.890
In plain language, it is
the integral over gamma--

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.860
from here, I'm just
copying the formula--

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:20.120
of a n of r, the Berry
connection, times dr.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:28.730
So what is the new Berry phase
for your new instantaneous

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.770
energy eigenstates?

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.140
Now you would say,
if the Berry phase

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.950
is something that is
observable, it better not

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.100
depend just on your
convention to choose

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.740
the instantaneous
energy eigenstates.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.400
And this is just
your convention.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.310
Because if a problem
is sufficiently messy,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:55.700
I bet you guys would all
come up with different energy

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.960
eigenstates because the phases
are chosen in different ways.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.380
So it better not change
if the Berry phase

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.810
is to be significant.

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.780
So what is the prime thing?

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.560
Well, we still integrate
over the same path, but now

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.270
the prime connection--

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:28.330
but that is the old
connection a n of rd r,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.640
the old Berry's phase, plus
the integral over gamma,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.380
or I will write it from
initial the final r.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.120
Maybe I should have ir
and i f in the picture.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.140
If you want to, you can put
this r of time equals 0 as ri

00:20:51.140 --> 00:21:01.370
and r of time equal tf
is rf the extra term,

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:16.750
the gradient of beta dot dr.
So this is the old Berry phase.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:24.150
So the new Berry phase
is the old Berry phase.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.600
And how about the last integral?

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.930
Does it vanish?

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:32.450
No, it doesn't vanish.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:34.110
It gifts you.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.600
But in fact, it can be done.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.500
This is like derivative
times this thing,

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.542
so it's one of those
simple integrals.

00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:47.690
The gradient times the
d represents the change

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.530
in the function as
you move a little dr.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:57.530
So when you go from ri to rf,
the integral of the gradient

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.440
is equal to the
function beta at rf

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.410
minus the function beta on ri.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.520
This is like when you
integrate the electric field

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.980
along a line, and
the electric field

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.930
is the gradient
of the potential.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.900
The integral of the electric
field through a line

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.060
is the potential here
minus the potential there.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:28.710
So here this is plus beta
or rf minus beta of ri.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:35.700
So it's not gauge invariant
in the Berry phase.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:46.050
And therefore, it will mean that
most of the times it cannot be

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:48.090
observed.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.410
It's not gauge invariant.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.100
Whatever is not gauge
invariant cannot be observed.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.460
You cannot say you make a
measurement and the answer is

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.120
gauge-dependent because
everybody is going to get

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.005
a different answer.

00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:03.870
And whose answer is right?

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.620
That's not possible.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:12.330
So if this Barry phase seems to
have failed a very basic thing,

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.790
then it's not gauge-invariant.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:20.160
But there is one way in
which this gets fixed.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.370
If your motion in the
configuration space

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:36.030
begins and ends in the same
place, these two will cancel.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.230
And then it will
be gauge-invariant.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:43.730
So the observable Berry's
phase is a geometric phase

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:50.000
accumulated by the system in a
motion in a configuration space

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.990
where it begins and
ends in the same point.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.910
Otherwise, it's not observable.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.190
You can eliminate it.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.610
And so this is an
important result

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:39.420
that the geometric Berry
phase for a closed path

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:54.045
in the configuration
space is gauge-invariant.
