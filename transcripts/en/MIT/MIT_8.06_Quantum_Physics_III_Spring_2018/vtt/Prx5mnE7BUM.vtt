00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.240
PROFESSOR: We're
finished with WKB.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.470
In recitation, you saw some
transmission across the barrier

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.740
and that's also
included in the notes.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.550
That's an important application
of WKB and should look at it.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.800
And today we're going to
start with a new topic.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.590
It's time-dependent
perturbation theory.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.590
And time-dependent
perturbation theory

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.790
is going to keep us busy
for a number of lectures.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.270
There's a lot of
applications of these ideas

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.010
and the methods
are rather general.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.970
Here is the place where we
will learn about Fermi's Golden

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.660
Rule.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.290
The kind of rule that
is useful for radiation

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.250
problems, ionization
problems, transitions.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.790
It's all very applied.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.530
Nevertheless, we have to develop
the theory carefully and see

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.990
what are the main concepts.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
So time-dependent perturbation
theory is our subject.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:23.670
Time-dependent
perturbation theory.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.650
Again, we will begin
with a Hamiltonian

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.890
that is time independent.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.500
And we know about it.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.730
We call this Hamiltonian H zero.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.670
The same name we used for
time-independent perturbation

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.290
theory.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.030
We have H zero.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.740
This time, however, we
will have a perturbation.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.660
The perturbation will
also be called delta H.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.390
But the big difference is this
time the perturbation will

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.750
be time dependent.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.810
And this will be our
whole Hamiltonian.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.460
So this is the subject
we're trying to understand.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.520
Whenever you have a Hamiltonian,
this time independent,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.670
we already know how we're
supposed to deal with it.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.540
We're supposed to find
the energy eigenstates.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.390
And then we'll have
the whole collection

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.620
of energy eigenstates.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.150
We can solve any problem.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.480
In the initial condition
of the wave function,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.940
you expand it in
energy eigenstates.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.280
You evolve the state in time.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.210
Everything is nice and simple.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.900
In a sense, for the first
time in your studies

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.760
of quantum mechanics
at MIT, we're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.180
going to face very directly
the difficulties of time

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.800
dependence.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.110
And the first difficulty of a
time dependent Hamiltonian is

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.130
that you cannot define
energy eigenstates anymore.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.270
The whole concept is gone.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.920
That's pretty radical.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.690
But it's unfortunately
the truth.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.300
When you first learn
in 804, how to work

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.000
with energy
eigenstates, it was all

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.270
dependent on a factorization.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.330
A possible factorization
of the solution

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.930
in the factor that depends on
position and a function that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.490
depends on time.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.150
And that time-dependence
was always very simple.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.490
E to the minus iEt
over h-bar, where

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.580
E was the energy
which was a solution

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.390
of the time-independent,
spatial part of the problem.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.210
So separating the
differential equation

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.680
was possible because, for
example, the potentials never

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.270
depended on time.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.420
If the potential
depends on time,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.130
imagine the equation
H psi equal e psi.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.529
This supposed to be
time independent.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.570
But H has a time
dependent potential.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.250
It's just impossible.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.280
So we don't have energy
eigenstates, any more,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.120
for this potential,
for the new potential,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.036
for the new Hamiltonian.

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:37.660
And we'll have to
think how we're going

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.870
to face these difficulties.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:54.330
So no energy
eigenstates for H of t.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.190
Of course, there are
energy eigenstates for H0.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.730
H0 is supposed to be your
time-independent Hamiltonian.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.485
So how do we think of this?

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.010
We will think of
time, evolving here,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.460
and typically we will
have an initial time t0.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.550
And throughout this region, the
Hamiltonian, H is equal to H0,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.530
for time less than 10 0.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.490
Then we imagine that the
perturbation turns on,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.250
and suddenly things start
happening, up to time tf.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.917
Here the Hamiltonian
is H0 plus delta H t.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.890
And after, the time tf, the
Hamiltonian, is back to H0.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.770
So that's a nice way of thinking
about the problem, in which we

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.420
imagine, OK,
perturbation is localized

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.890
that some time t
begins there before you

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.140
have the known Hamiltonian,
after you have the known

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.970
Hamiltonian.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.720
That allows you to rephrase
questions in a clearer way,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.490
because there are
energy eigenstates here.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.430
If you sit at that
energy eigenstate

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:48.160
before time equal t0, you will
remain in an energy eigenstate.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.900
There's no reason
why it changes.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.710
That's what time-independent
Hamiltonians do.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.550
The energy eigenstate
changes by a phase.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.200
And that's all it does.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.790
So here, we can speak
about energy eigenstates,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.440
and after time tf, we can
speak about energy eigenstates.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.130
So we can ask the
question, suppose

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.760
you were sitting on this
particular energy eigenstate,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.510
here.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.960
Then the world shakes
for a few moments.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.640
Which state are you
going to find yourself,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.800
after this process?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.480
And this is a question of going
from one energy aide and state

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.510
to some collection of
energy eigenstates.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.590
By the time the lecture
will be finished,

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.040
we will have solved this
problem in principle,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.870
and set up how you would do
it, in practice, for any case.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.900
This is a very physical
way of thinking, as well.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.530
You can imagine, you
have a hydrogen atom

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.600
in its ground state.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.550
So the original system
is a Hamiltonian

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.240
for a particle, an
electron, and a proton.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.690
And it happens to be
in a ground state.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.530
Then you send in an
electromagnetic wave, something

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.130
we will do next lecture.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.240
No, in a couple of lectures.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.770
And then, it's possible
that the atom gets ionized,

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.640
or that the electron is
kicked up to a higher level.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.840
You will be able to calculate
those transition functions.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.610
You will be able to calculate
the probability of ionization.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:43.330
In which, after the perturbation
is all said and done, you ask,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.190
what is the
probability that you're

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.730
in an eigenstate, that
this a higher excited state

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.740
of the hydrogen atom?

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.240
And with a little bit of
flexibility in your mind,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.220
you can think of
the hydrogen atom

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.310
as a system that
has bound states,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.220
and continuum
states, in which you

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.600
have a proton and an
electron traveling a wave.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.350
If you your electron is
far enough from the proton,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.480
it's like a plane wave.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.525
If it's not that
far, it can travel.

00:09:15.525 --> 00:09:17.800
And its wave is
deformed a little.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.470
Those are the continuum
states of the hydrogen atom.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.940
So you could ask, what is the
probability that it's ionized,

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.890
and it's a transition to
a continuum eigenstate

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.640
in the hydrogen atom?

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.690
This sounds more complicated.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.850
It's a little more complicated.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.350
Why?

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.370
Because when you go from
one state to another,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.480
you can count it.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.590
But when you ask what is the
probability that the electron

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.680
goes into the continuum
of plane wave,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.130
you'll have infinitely
many continuum states.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.130
And we will have
to deal with that.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.520
Where we will know--

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.380
we will not be able to
avoid this complication.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:02.680
And that complication makes
for a very interesting result,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.460
transitions to the continuum.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.740
So this is what we want to do.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.750
And if given, that
in general, this

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:18.470
is not a problem of
finding energy eigenstates,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.510
the energy
eigenstates are known,

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:32.300
we want to find the
wave function, psi of t.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.055
That's our real unknown.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.240
And to do that, we
will use something

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.130
called the interaction picture.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.780
Just like we have Heisenberg
picture, Schrodinger picture,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:58.100
we'll have an
interaction picture.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.720
Don't worry.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.220
It's not more complicated
than anything you've seen.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.620
It's, in fact, a
very sensible way

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.770
of doing things, in
which you combine

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.350
good things from the
Heisenberg picture,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.910
and nice things from the
Schrodinger picture, together.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:24.900
So remember, a little
of what was going on

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.790
with the Heisenberg picture.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:35.490
It all began by saying that,
if you have the expectation

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:46.300
value of a Schrodinger operator,
that was the same thing.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.990
A s for A Schrodinger, that
was possible to compute

00:11:52.990 --> 00:12:00.310
as the expectation value of the
Heisenberg operator on the time

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.450
equals 0 states, in the
states that don't vary.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:10.880
You don't need to compute
expectation values of operators

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.060
used in the time
involved states.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.300
You can think of time
involved operators

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.355
and compute in this
expectation value

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:21.280
in the time equals 0 states.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.640
For that, you use
the unitary operator,

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.965
that does time
evolution, u of t psi

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:42.640
at 0 u dagger of t psi at 0.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.630
And this unitary
operator, it's in general

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.310
difficult to calculate.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:54.220
It's a unitary operator
that does time evolution

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.030
and, in our case, it's hard
because the Hamiltonian

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.930
is complicated.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:04.840
But in general, we call this
the Heisenberg operator.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.890
A Heisenberg of t.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.116
That's the definition of
the Heisenberg operator.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:18.180
Another concept that
is kind of useful,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.610
is the idea of operators
that brings states to rest.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:35.720
So suppose you have the
state psi at sum time t.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.530
I want to act with an operator
that will bring it to rest.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.210
That means that this
is time-dependent.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.450
I want to act with
something that

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.190
will make it time-independent.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.480
So the answer is U dagger.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.650
U dagger is a unitary operator,
so it's the inverse of U.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:03.200
So look at this expression,
U dagger on this state

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.850
gives you U dagger.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:11.540
The state is U on the
state at time equals 0.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.990
U dagger U, being
unitary, it's just

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.060
the unit matrix, and your 2 0.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:27.380
So this operator, U dagger,
removes the time-dependence.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.120
The [INAUDIBLE]
uses the expression,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.110
brings the operator to rest.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:39.710
So we can think of doing
something of this kind.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:45.490
You see, the whole Hamiltonian
is H0 plus delta H.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.900
H0 you understand well.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.120
Delta H is complicated.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:58.430
So how about doing the time
evolution through Heisenberg,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.160
with H0, with what you know.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.580
You don't know the
full U, but you

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.430
know the U that
would do the time

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.120
evolution, for the
time-independent Hamiltonian,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.200
H0.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.830
So let's attempt to do
the part that is easy.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.960
You see, there's going
to be time evolution

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.150
as you go from t0 to tf.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.780
Some of that is going
to be generated by H0,

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:32.390
some of that by delta H. Let's
let Heisenberg do the work

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:40.040
for H0, and Schrodinger
do the work for delta H.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.130
That's basically the idea. .

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.120
You see, you know that what is
difficult about this problem

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.940
is the delta H. So you solve
the Schrodinger equation.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.400
Let's solve the Schrodinger
equation that just has delta H,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.480
doesn't have H anymore.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.680
So motivated by this,
we'll do exactly that.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:18.310
Think of for H0, the operator
U is e to the minus i H0

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.900
t over h-bar.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.180
This is the operator
that generates

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.890
time evolution for H0.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:43.400
So we will take
the state psi of t

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:53.810
and remove the time-dependence
associated to H0.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.140
So try to bring
the state to rest.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.650
So we'll put here,
e to the minus--

00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:03.760
I'm sorry.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.540
I'm supposed to put U dagger.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:14.069
So I'll put e to the
I H0 t over H-bar.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.450
And look at that.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.010
This is U dagger.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.849
That's the kind of thing that
brings the state to rest.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:29.510
If the Hamiltonian had
only been H0, only H0,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.480
this would be time-independent.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.420
H0 brings it to rest.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.140
Because the Hamilton
is not just H0,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.800
this will not be, in
general, time-independent.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.790
But it will depend on time.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.370
So this is a kind of a nice
wave function in which you

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:55.850
sort of have removed the time
evolution having to do with H0.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:18:02.360
So we will define this as our
auxiliary variable, psi of t.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.590
That's the definition.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:21.310
It's motivated by the idea that,
if delta H was equal to 0, then

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:27.665
psi tilde is constant in time.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.930
Because if delta
H was equal to 0,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.810
all the evolution
is created by H0.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.585
You would put here, oh, this is
e to the minus i H0 times psi

00:18:42.585 --> 00:18:45.790
of t equal 0, the
exponentials would cancel,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.920
and everything would be simple.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.550
So this is a wave
function that is

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.080
going to be our new variable.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.390
We wanted to find psi of t.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:02.330
Now you can say your task
is find psi tilde of t.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.920
That's your new task.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.310
And it's an equally good
task, because if you

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:16.340
find psi tilde of t, then
you can write psi of t

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.820
as, from this equation,
e to the minus

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.740
i H0 t over H-bar
psi tilde of t.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:37.260
So our task now will
be to find psi tilde.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.350
If we have psi tilde,
we have psi, as well.

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.170
So we haven't lost
any information.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.170
And this is all good.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.510
So let's try to see what
equation is satisfied

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.050
by psi tilde, what kind
of Schrodinger equation

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.050
is satisfied by it.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:09.330
So what is the Schrodinger
equation for psi tilde.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:20.270
I'll just take i H-bar d dt of
psi tilde and see what I get.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.780
OK.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:28.360
If I have to differentiate
this term, i H-bar d dt.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.820
I have to differentiate
this exponential.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.540
And the i is going to
give you a minus sign.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.130
The H's are going to cancel.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.320
And this is just going
to bring an H0 down.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:50.720
So I'm going to get minus
H0 times that exponential.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.740
And that exponential times
psi of t is psi tilde of t.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.870
So the derivative
of the first term

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.670
gives me something with H0.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.090
And the face times that
is still psi tilde.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.050
Now I have to differentiate
the second one so I have plus

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:25.540
e to the i H0 t over H-bar.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.680
And i H-bar d dt of this cat.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.430
But that's the Schrodinger
equation for the original cat.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:42.150
So I should put here the full
Hamiltonian, H0 plus delta H

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.830
times psi of t.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.890
So when the i dd
H hits the state,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.630
you get the full
Hamiltonian time psi of t.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:06.190
But I actually were right for
psi of t e to the minus i H0 t

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.080
over H-bar psi tilde of t.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.480
Because I'm looking for
an equation for psi tilde.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.370
I'm going a little--

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.935
I'm speaking slowly,
but going a little fast.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.100
Now what happens?

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.970
What you wanted to
happen, happened.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.060
H0 is here.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.900
And look, H0 is here.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.480
Well it's accompanied by
these two exponentials,

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.130
but they have H0.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.040
So they commute through
and these two exponentials

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.960
cancel as far as this
first term is concerned.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:56.440
So nice consolation over here.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:05.090
And then we get the
following equation,

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:15.050
i H-bar d dt of psi tilde is
equal to, well, this delta H

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:21.290
sandwiched in these
two operators.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.670
So I'll just copy it.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:36.970
e to the H0 t over H-bar
delta H e to the minus i H0 t

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:42.310
over H-S bar times
pi tilde of t.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.440
So this equation makes
what we wanted manifest.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.310
If delta H vanishes, psi
tilde is time-independent.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.100
But it's more than that.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:07.285
This which we will
call delta H tilde.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.280
So tilde objects
are objects that

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.290
have been acted by H0,
like the tilde state,

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.200
it has an H0 with
respect to the other.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.970
This delta H tilde is because
it has been acted by similarity

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.580
with those things.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.010
But even more, I
think you should

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:47.340
realize that this thing
is really the Heisenberg 0

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:55.830
version of delta H. A
Heisenberg operator is obtained

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.490
by taking the Schrodinger
operator, putting U dagger

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.850
and U. And that's exactly
what you've done here.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:06.790
You've taken the Schrodinger
operator and put U

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:12.360
dagger with respect
to H0, and U for H0.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:18.210
So this is the Heisenberg
version of delta H

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.890
relative to H0.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:29.180
So delta H has been
"Heisenberg-ed" using H0.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:37.300
And then this whole thing
looks like i H-bar d dt of psi

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:43.220
tilde equal delta
H tilde psi tilde.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.285
And this is a
Schrodinger equation.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:01.950
So there it is, for you, the
so-called interaction picture.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.050
The interaction
picture says whatever

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.830
is not an interaction
will make it Heisenberg.

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:14.320
Whatever is purely interactive
will make it Schrodinger.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.140
And therefore, this
state varies in time.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.320
And there are some
operators that

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.510
have acquired extra
time-dependence, as well, due

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.270
to the Heisenberg process.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:32.736
So this is the situation we
are going to try to solve.
