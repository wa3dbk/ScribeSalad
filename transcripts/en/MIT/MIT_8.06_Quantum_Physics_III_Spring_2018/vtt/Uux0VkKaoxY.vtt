00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.900
PROFESSOR: So that's
part of this story.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.680
Let's try to understand
it a little better still.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.440
So what does the
state look like?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:27.010
Well the state looks like
e to the ikxx times a state

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.510
of the oscillator and y.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.010
OK.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.030
So what is happening here?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.920
We could re-solve this problem
using a different gauge.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.625
And you will.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.030
You will solve it at
least once or twice.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.910
Again, this problem
using a different gauge.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.360
And the solutions are going to
be looking a little different

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.820
but, of course, you're going
to find the same Landau

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.970
levels and the same
infinite degeneracy.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.600
The wave functions will
look sometimes a little

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.850
more intuitive.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.240
So in this case,
one calculation that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.250
is interesting to
try to understand

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.830
the physics of this degeneracy
is to work roughly a little

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.160
heuristically on a
finite size sample.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.970
Imagine a material but
it's now finite size.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.440
So let me remark to you what
are the degrees of freedom you

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.460
have here.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.730
Suppose you solve this
Schrodinger equation

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.890
in a different gauge, a
symmetric gauge in which there

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.860
is an ay and an ax.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.290
Solutions then are going
to look a little more

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.450
like circular orbits.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.070
There's a little
more mathematics

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.440
involved in solving
it but they're

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.060
going to look a little nicer.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.460
But how are they
related to this one?

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.570
Well anyone with
a circular orbit

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.950
must be related to this
solution by first forming

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.840
a superposition of
those solutions,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.220
maybe localizing it or doing
something and then doing

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.940
a gauge transformation.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.460
So in order to compare your
solutions in different gauges,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.420
you have to dig into gun, you
have an infinite degeneracy,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.300
and you have gauge
transformation.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.370
So to see what state
here corresponds

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.920
to a particular
state here, it may

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.390
be the gauge transformation
of a particular superposition

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.620
in this side.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.221
So it's, in general,
not all that easy to do.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:36.720
OK.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.395
So let's take a count
state in a finite sample.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.210
So same picture, but now
the material is here.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.490
And we'll put Lx and Ly here.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.860
So finite size in the
Lx, finite size in Ly.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.240
So given our intuition
with quantization,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.760
this suggests that we impose
periodic boundary conditions

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.790
in x and try to
quantize the kx here.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.610
In general, if you're
imposing thinking

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.850
of very large boxes,
which is the case here,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.570
it doesn't matter
much whether you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.460
impose periodic or vanishing
boundary conditions or anything

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.790
essentially at large number of
states it makes no difference.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.090
So we quantize in x.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:03.800
So we want e to the ikx
times x to be periodic

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.670
under x goes to x plus Lx.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.600
I'm almost done with sine.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:20.540
So kxLx will have to be
equal to a multiple with Nx.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:34.740
Since we know that Y0 is
equal to minus kxlb squared,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.270
we should take Nx negative so
that you're within the sample.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.610
You must be in y
positive and therefore kx

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.220
should be negative,
Nx should be negative.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:00.970
And now I have a way to count
because I can take Nx negative

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.850
up to some value minus Nx bar.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.700
And when Nx grows,
kx grows and y grows.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.330
So I can take the
last Nx that I can

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.520
use is the one in which the
orbit is still in the sample up

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.160
to the value Y0.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.210
So this number is
really the degeneracy

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.320
because this is how many
values of Nx I can have,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.880
from minus Nx up to 0,
are the number of values

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.630
that are consistent with a
state still in this sample.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:53.310
So Y0 equal to Ly should
be equal to minus kx times

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.540
lb squared.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.905
So it's minus 2 pi Nx bar
over Lx times lb squared.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.640
And this gives you Nx.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.030
We can solve for Nx there.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:27.750
Nx is LyLx over lb
squared over 1 over 2 pi.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.900
So Nx is the degeneracy.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.690
This is the degeneracy.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.520
And it's equal to the
area divided by lb

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.000
squared, which is h bar c
over qB times 1 over 2 pi.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:59.800
So it's equal to area times b
divided by 2 pi h bar c over q.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.390
So we're back to
the kind of thing

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:11.680
we were saying before in
which the degeneracy is

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.510
equal to the flux divided
by the flux quantum

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.375
that we figured
out earlier today.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:28.250
So this is how much states
you can put on the sample.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.130
So you're given a
magnetic field, a Tesla

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.480
and you have some area.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.690
You find the fi,
you divide by fi0,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.980
and that's the number
of degenerate states

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.210
of each Landau level.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.230
So in particular, given that
we have that number that fi0

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:58.360
is equal to about 2 times
10 to the minus 7 Gauss then

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.330
centimeters squared.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.970
If you have a sample
of 1 centimeter squared

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:16.400
and you put one Gauss, the
value of the flux over fi0

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:24.230
would be 1 Gauss centimeter
squared over 2 times 10

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.750
to the minus 7 same units.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:34.049
So it's about 5 million states.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.190
That's just to give you an idea
of how big the numbers are.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.330
That's the degeneracy.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.350
So this is a classic problem.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.470
Very important in
condensed matter physics.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.770
Is a first step in trying
to understand quantum Hall

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.350
effect on many things.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.970
And it's important to solve it
and think it in several ways.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.980
And I think you
will be doing that

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.510
in homework and recitation.
