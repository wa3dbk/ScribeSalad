00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.280
PROFESSOR: Today, we continue
with our discussion of WKB.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.090
So a few matters
regarding the WKB

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.470
were explained in the
last few segments.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.970
We discussed there would
be useful to define

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.600
a position-dependent momentum
for a particle that's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.760
moving in a potential.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.330
That was a completely
classical notion,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
but helped our terminology
in solving the Schrodinger

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.380
equation and set up the
stage for some definitions.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.585
For example, a
position-dependent de Broglie

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:51.210
wavelength that would
be given in terms

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.410
of the position-dependent
momentum by the classic formula

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
that de Broglie used
for particles that move

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:59.865
with constant momentum.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.150
Then in this language, the
time independent Schrodinger

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.770
equation took the
form p squared on psi

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.290
is equal to p squared
of x times psi.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.810
This is psi of x.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.410
And we mentioned that it was
kind of nice that the momentum

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.900
operator ended up sort of in
the style of an eigenvalue.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.740
The eigenvalue p of x.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.370
We then spoke about
wave functions

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.030
that in the WKB
approximation would

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.130
take a form of an exponential
with a phase and a magnitude--

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.510
so the usual notation we
have for complex numbers.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.360
So the psi of x and p would
be written as rho of x and t

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.050
e to the i over h
bar s of x and t.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.390
That's a typical form
of a WKB wave function

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.460
that you will see soon.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.930
And for such wave
functions, it's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.920
kind of manifest that rho
here is the charge density.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.480
Because if you take the
norm squared of psi,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.950
that gives you exactly rho.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.080
The phase cancels.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.160
On the other hand, the
computation of the current

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.930
was a little more interesting.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.660
And it gave you rho times
gradient of s over m--

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.215
the mass of the particle.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.180
So we identified the
current as perpendicular

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.050
to the surfaces of constant s or
constant phase in the exponent

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.020
of the WKB equation.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.370
Our last comment had
to do with lambda.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.790
And we've said that we
suspect that the semiclassical

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.600
approximation is
valid in some way

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.010
when lambda is small compared
to a physical length of a system

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.780
or when lambda changes slowly
as a function of position.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.540
And those things we
have not quite yet

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.150
determined precisely
how they go.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.190
And some of what
you have to do today

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.570
is understand more
concretely the nature

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.530
of the approximation.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.650
So the semiclassical
approximation

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:03.720
has something to do with lambda
slowly varying and with lambda

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.870
small, in some sense.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.330
And since you have
an h bar in here

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.120
that would make it
small if h bar is small,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.470
we also mentioned
we would end up

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.140
considering the limit as a
sort of imaginary or fictitious

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.140
limit in which h bar goes to 0.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.710
So it's time to try to
really do the approximation.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.930
Let let's try to write something
and approximate the solution.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.550
Now, we had a nice instructive
form of the wave function

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.440
there, but I will
take a simpler form

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.490
in which the wave function will
be just a pure exponential.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.800
So setting the
approximation scheme--

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.885
so approximation-- scheme.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.410
So before I had
the wave function

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.390
that had a norm and a phase.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.820
Now, I want the
wave function that

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.540
looks like it just has a phase.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.670
You would say, of course,
that's impossible.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.630
So we will for all the time
independent Schrodinger

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.510
equation.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.440
So we will use an s of x.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.730
And we will write the
psi of x in the form

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.500
e to the i h bar s of x.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.890
And you say, no,
that's not true.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.230
My usual wave functions
are more than just phases.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.550
They're not just faces.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.180
We've seen wave functions
have different magnitudes.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.660
Here that wave function will
have always density equal to 1.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.370
But that is voided--

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.800
that criticism is voided--

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.500
if you just simply say that s
now may be a complex number.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.620
So if s is itself a complex
number, the imaginary part of s

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.140
provides the norm of
the wave function.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.140
So it's possible to do that.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.680
Any rho up here can be
written as the exponential

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.330
of the log of something and then
can be brought in the exponent.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.850
And there's no loss of
generality in writing something

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.760
like that if s is complex.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.290
Now, we have the
Schrodinger equation.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.530
And the Schrodinger
equation was written there.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:08.000
So it's minus h squared d
second d x squared of psi of x.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:21.020
It's equal to p squared of
x e to the i over h bar s.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.560
Now, when we differentiate
an exponential,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.540
we differentiate it two times.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.230
We will have a couple of things.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.200
We can differentiate the first
time-- brings an s prime down.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.565
And the second time you can
differentiate the exponent

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:46.710
or you can differentiate
what is down already.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.990
So it's two terms.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.170
The first one would be--

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.985
imagine differentiating
the first one.

00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.800
The s goes down and then the
derivative acts on the s.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.210
So you get i over h
bar s double prime.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.330
Let's use prime notation.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.710
And the other one is when you
differentiate the ones here.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.710
It brings the factor
down, again, there.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:20.110
So it's plus i over h
bar s prime squared.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.920
And then the phase
is still there,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.580
and it can cancel between
the left and the right.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.360
So this is equal
to p squared of x.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:45.460
So I took the derivative and
cancelled the exponentials.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.010
So cleaning this
up a little bit,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.610
we'll have this term over here.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.690
The h's cancel,
the sine cancels,

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:09.120
and you get s prime of x squared
minus i h bar s double prime.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.615
It's equal to p squared of x.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.930
OK.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.535
Simple enough.

00:09:22.535 --> 00:09:25.050
We have a derivation
of that equation.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.270
And the first thing
that you say is,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.290
it looks like we've
gone backwards.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.170
We've gone from a
reasonably simple equation,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.930
the Schrodinger
equation-- second order,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.250
linear differential equation--

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.635
to a nonlinear equation.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.510
Here is the function squared,
the derivative squared, second

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.790
derivative, no--

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.790
there's nothing linear
about this equation in s.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.600
If you have one solution for
an s and another solution,

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.750
you cannot add them.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.470
So this happens because we put
everything in the exponential.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.540
When you take double
derivatives of an exponential

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.090
you get a term with
double derivatives

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.950
and a term with a
derivative squared.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.910
There's nothing you can do.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.280
And this still represents
progress in some way,

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.040
even though it has
become an equation that

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.280
looks more difficult. It can
be tracked in some other way.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:41.350
So the first and
most important thing

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.000
we want to say
about this equation

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.470
is that it's a nonlinear
differential equation.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:57.860
The h bar term appears in
just one position here.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.320
And let's consider
a following claim--

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:09.680
I will claim that i h
bar s double prime--

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:20.355
this term-- is small when
v of x is slowly varying.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.230
You see, we're having
in mind the situation

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.290
with which a particle is moving
in a potential-- a quantum

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.190
particle.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.930
So there it s, b of
x is well-defined.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.670
That's a term that goes
into this equation.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.110
So this is partly known.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.320
You may not know the energy,
but the potential you know.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:54.060
And my claim-- and perhaps a
very important claim about this

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.120
equation that sets
you going clearly--

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.800
is that when v of s
is slowly varying,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.670
this term is almost irrelevant.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.940
That's the first thing we want
to make sure we understand.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:26.400
So let's take v of x is
equal to v0 at constant.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.190
So this is the extreme case
of a slowly varying potential.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.050
It just doesn't vary at all.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:41.250
In that case, p of x is
going to be a constant.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.865
And that constant is the
square root of 2m e minus V0.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.630
And what do we have here?

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.190
We have a free particle.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.380
This v of x is a constant.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.560
So the solution of the
Schrodinger equation,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.120
that you know in
general, is that psi

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.080
of x is e to the
i p0 x over h bar.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.280
That solves the
Schrodinger equation.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.100
Now, we're talking
about this equation.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.140
So to connect to that
equation in this situation

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.440
of constant potential
constant, momentum

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.870
in the classical sense,
and a free particle

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:38.510
with that constant momentum,
remember that s is a term here

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.830
in the exponential.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:55.030
So for this solution here,
s of x is equal to p0 x.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.010
That's all it is.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.780
It's whatever is left when you
single out the i over h bar.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.960
And let's look at that thing.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.870
That should be a solution.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.630
We've constructed the
solution of the momentum.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.540
equation for constant potential.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.180
We've read what s of x is.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.730
That should solve this equation.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.860
And how does it
manage to solve it?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:34.030
It manages to solve it because
s prime of x is equal to p0.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:39.010
s double prime of
x is equal to 0.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:44.310
And the equation works out
with the first term squared--

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.110
p0 squared-- equal
to p of x squared--

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.820
which is p0 squared.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.810
So this term, first term
in the left-hand side,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.220
is equal to the right-hand side
This term is identically 0.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.370
So when the potential
is constant,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:06.750
that term, i h bar s double
prime, plays no role, It's 0.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:21.360
So the term i h bar s
double prime is equal to 0.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:30.450
So the claim now follows from
a fairly intuitive result.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:35.820
If the potential is constant,
that term in the solution is 0.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.280
If the potential
will be extremely,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.670
slowly varying, that term
should be very small.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.750
You cannot expect that
the constant potential has

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:46.380
a solution.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.970
And you now do infinitesimal
variation of your potential,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.860
and suddenly this
term becomes very big.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:16:07.855
So for constant v, i h bar
is double prime equal 0.

00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:20.080
So for slowly varying v of
x i h bar is double prime,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.920
it should be small in the
sense that this solution

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.610
is approximately correct.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:35.790
So if we do say that,
we've identified the term

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:41.460
in the equation that is small
when potentials are slowly

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.360
varying.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.880
Therefore, we will
take that term

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.300
as being the small
term in that equation.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.650
And this will be nicely
implemented by considering,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:17:01.100
as we said, h bar going to
0, or h as a small parameter.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:12.930
We will learn, as we
do the approximation,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.579
how to quantify what something
that we call slowly varying is.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.869
But we will take h now
as a small parameter--

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.450
that makes that term small--

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.980
and setup an expansion
to solve this equation.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.380
That is our goal now.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.330
So how do we set it up?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.630
We set it up like
this-- we say s of x,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.505
as you've learned in
perturbation theory,

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:47.280
is s0 of x plus h bar s1 of
x-- the first correction--

00:17:50.620 --> 00:18:01.850
plus h bar squared is s2
of x and higher order.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:07.430
Now, s already has
units of h bar--

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.240
so s0 will have
units of h bar too.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.040
s1, for example, has no units.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.400
So each term has a
different set of units.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.450
And that's OK, because
h bar has units.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:45.120
And this will go like
1 over h bar units

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.390
and so forth and so on.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.150
So we have an expansion.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.980
And this we'll call our
semiclassical expansion.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:01.430
As we apply now this
expansion to that equation,

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:07.760
we should treat h as we treated
lambda in perturbation theory.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.930
That is, we imagine that
this must be hauled order

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.110
by order in h bar,
because we imagine

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:21.330
we have the flexibility
of changing h bar.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.380
So let's do this.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.220
What do we have in the equation?

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.690
We have s prime.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:40.770
So the equation has s0
prime plus h bar s1 prime.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.860
Now, I will keep terms
up to order h bar.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:53.700
So I will stop here-- plus
order h bar squared minus i h

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.930
bar s double prime.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:02.950
So that should be s0
double prime plus order

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.800
h bar equal b squared of x.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.365
So let's organize our terms.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:30.220
We have s0 prime primed
squared on the left-hand side.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.760
Minus p squared of x--

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.940
I bring the p to
the left-hand side--

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.640
plus h bar.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.100
So these are terms
that have no h bar.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:50.530
And when we look at the h bar
from the first term there,

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.140
we square this thing.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.920
So you get the cross
product between the s0 prime

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.310
and the s1 prime.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:03.990
So you get 2--

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.250
the h prime already is there--

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.175
s0 prime s1 prime.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.190
And from the second
term, you get

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:32.275
minus i s0 double prime plus
order h squared equals 0.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.020
So I just collected
all the terms there.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:50.160
So if we're believing
in this expansion,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.720
the first thing we should
say is that each coefficient

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.500
in the power series
of h bar is 0.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.210
So we'll get two equations.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:10.854
First one is s0 prime squared
is equal to p squared of x.

00:22:10.854 --> 00:22:13.260
That's one.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.850
That's this term equal to 0.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.500
And here, we get--

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.340
let's write it in a way that
we solve for the unknown.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.110
Supposedly from this first
equation we, can solve for s0.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:34.110
If you know s0, what do you
want now to know is s1 prime.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.950
So let's write this as
s1 prime is equal to i s0

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:47.120
double prime over
2 s0 zero prime.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.200
So these are my two equations.
