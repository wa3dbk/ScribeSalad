00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.920
PROFESSOR: One of
the things you will

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.080
be thinking about
in the homework

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.060
is the definition of
gauge-invariant observables.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.720
So an operator O is a
gauge-invariant observable--

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.880
gauge environment
observable-- if, see,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.120
under a gauged
transformation, O can change.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.380
The operator can change under
a gauged transformation.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.310
You'd say, oh, but isn't it
supposed to be gauge-invariant?

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.980
But, well, it's not
quite the operator itself

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.080
that is gauge-invariant.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.410
It is its expectation value.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.570
So you should have that
psi prime of O prime psi

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:05.000
prime is equal to psi O psi.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.830
So the operator may change.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.520
And that's OK.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.530
The wave function
will change as well.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.850
So the question is that
if you put the new wave

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.090
function and the new operator
and you find the expectation

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.620
value, do you get
the same thing?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.890
That's what you really can ask.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890
You cannot ask more than that.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.580
And you will see very funny
things when you do this.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.640
You will see that
this operator, P,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.730
the momentum operator
that you like,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.200
that you find has been
intuitive for you so far,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.970
is not gauge-invariant.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.880
You cannot compute the
expectation value of it

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.440
and expect something physical.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.150
It's not gauge-invariant.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.270
The thing that is
gauge-invariant is P minus q

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.510
over c A--

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.190
is gauge-invariant.

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:20.810
So it's some small
calculations you will do.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.120
In order to get the
gauge-invariant operator,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.390
you do, in general, have
to put in a dependence.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.750
That's the funny thing.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.940
So this thing will not
be gauge-invariant.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.950
And, you know,
it's almost obvious

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.500
that P is not gauge-invariant.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.310
Why?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.020
Because P, under a
gauge transformation--

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.850
well, the gauge
transformation, say,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.920
change A, change phi
prime, change psi.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.940
But it doesn't say change P. So
in the gauge transformation, P

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.060
goes to P.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.400
But then let's look at
psi prime P psi prime.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.880
Is it equal to psi P psi?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.270
Well, here you
have that psi prime

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:22.580
is psi times e to the minus
i q lambda over h bar c.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.690
You have P here.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.020
And e to the i q
lambda over h bar c.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.710
Psi prime-- no, psi.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.990
That's the left-hand side.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.640
And this P is such that
it takes derivatives.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.630
And lambda depends on space.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.600
So this is going to
give you something.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.880
This is not going to cancel.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.470
This is not going to cancel,
and therefore the left-hand side

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.010
is not going to be equal
to the right-hand side.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.760
The faces don't go
across each other.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.540
So therefore, there it is.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.010
P is no good.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.360
Not intuitive, not
physical, not observable.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.570
It's a very strange
thing that once you

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.750
put electromagnetic fields,
P, the canonical generator

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.090
of translation, loses
its privileged status.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.590
Not anymore we can
think of P so easily.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.890
And look, however.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.560
If you had here P
minus qA, P minus qA

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.350
is precisely the kind
of thing that you

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.200
can move the face
across, and you

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.590
will see that then it works.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.490
You get something to simplify,
and it's all very nice.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.890
So gauge invariance makes
for funny things to happen.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.800
I want to do an example that
illustrates quantization,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.030
another pretty surprising thing.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:17.480
So we have quite a few
things to do today.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.095
So let me try to do this
magnetic fields example.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.910
Magnetic field on a torus.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.390
So we've talked about
what is a circle.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.720
And we say a circle is the
line with the identification

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.760
x equal x plus L. So the point 0
is identified with the point L.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.140
And that's a circle.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.240
This line on this point
is the same as this one,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.180
so you return.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.240
A torus that we use--
so, this is a circle--

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.100
a torus, which is
something that we sometimes

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.580
think of like this,
is, on the other hand,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.030
an identification of
the following kind.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.440
Here is the x-axis.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.880
Here is the y-axis.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.590
Here is Lx.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.720
Here is Ly.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:34.130
And we say that any point xy is
identified with x plus Ly Lx,

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:43.670
and every point xy is identified
with xy plus Ly, which

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.540
is to say that any point
with some value of x

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.500
is identified with a point
with x increasing by Lx.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.150
So this line is supposed
to be glued to this line.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.010
And this line is supposed
to be glued to that line.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.786
So this is identified
and this is identified.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.760
Perhaps the most intuitive
way of thinking of this

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.320
is take this strip, take
these two sides, glue them.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.030
Now you have a cylinder.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.630
And now you're supposed to
glue this end to the first end.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.530
So you glue them like that, and
you form something like this.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.550
So here is a torus.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.550
Now we try to put the
magnetic field on this torus.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.720
So you could say,
well, this is x and y.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.570
There is a torus.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:39.820
There's the z-direction.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.470
Let's put the
magnetic field that

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.770
goes through the torus
in the z-direction.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.090
B z.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.770
B in the z-direction.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.760
And we'll put a constant
one, B constant.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.280
So it's time-independent
and space-independent.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.800
And then you say, OK, let's
look at my Maxwell's equations.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.330
Divergence of B equals 0.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.190
B is constant.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.600
Good.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.840
Curl of B is related to current.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.070
There's no current.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.920
Plus dE dt,
displacement current.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.160
There's no electric field.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.040
Good equation.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.160
Curl of E is minus dB dt, no E.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.049
There's no problem, obviously.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.280
So B, for any
constant value of B,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.640
it satisfies
Maxwell's equations.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.210
So any constant
value of B should

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.640
be an allowed magnetic field.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.530
Or so we would think,
because it actually is not.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.740
So why does it go
wrong, this intuition?

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.970
We'll see.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.930
But let's put an assumption.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.990
The assumption is that we're
doing quantum mechanics,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:11.755
and there exists a
particle with charge.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.020
And I'll call it this time q.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.670
I'll just--

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.210
So if we're doing
quantum mechanics,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.880
and there exists a
particle of charge q,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.130
I need potentials to describe
the quantum mechanics.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.180
I need an A field
to describe this.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:44.270
So I know B is consistent,
and it makes sense,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.020
and we can use it,
if and only if I

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.800
can find a vector potential.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.230
So our task is to find a
vector potential on this torus.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:14.910
Well, at first sight that
doesn't sound too difficult.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:19.080
You can say, all right, let's
find the vector potential.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:26.220
That's easy to find an A such
that curl of A is equal to B.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:37.080
So B z is dx A y minus dy A x.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.240
So let's simplify my life.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.770
Let's take A y to
be equal to B z,

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:54.300
and let's call this magnetic
field B0, the constant value

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.030
B0.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.640
Constant.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:09.360
So A y would be equal to B0
times x, and A x would be 0.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.080
OK.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.040
That's it.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.930
Look.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.920
A y is equal to B0 x.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.860
So I take the
derivative dx of A y.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.300
I get B0.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.370
dy of A x is 0.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.630
Perfect.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.970
All done, we would say.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.660
You found the A y.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:39.150
But there is a problem with this
[? A i. ?] What is the problem?

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:44.430
If this is a torus,
it means these points

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.550
are the same as these points.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.740
So I should have,
the vector potential

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.220
here must be the same as
the vector potential there.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.970
Because it is, after
all, the same point.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.000
You're gluing the surface.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.760
But, OK, this point and
this point differ by y.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.150
And this vector potential
doesn't depend on y.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.780
So, phew.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.190
That's good.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.560
A is well-defined because it
has the same value anywhere here

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.090
as anywhere there.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:30.990
So I can write it as A y of
x, y plus L y at any point x.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:38.980
And y plus L y is the
same thing as A y of xy.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.090
So that's very good.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.450
But we're going to run
into trouble in the second

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:52.720
now, because the A y should be
the same here and here, too.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:57.610
Because that's also the
same points in the torus.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.860
This line is
identified with this.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:07.130
So when I change x by L
x, A y should not change.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:18.870
And here it seems like A y at x
plus L x, and the same point y,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:24.640
is not the same as A y at xy.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:30.310
And this is a torus, so this
point, x plus L x and y and y

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.820
should be the same.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:39.410
So this vector potential is
not the same here as here.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:42.760
So, actually, this vector
potential doesn't look good.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.830
You thought you could write
the magnetic field in terms

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.470
of a vector potential,
but this vector potential

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.620
doesn't seem to
live on the torus.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.980
It's just not a
well-defined magnetic vector

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.360
potential in the torus.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.690
It doesn't have the same
value here and here.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.440
So in principle,
we're not through.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.330
We're not out of the woods here.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.130
We have not been able to find
a good vector potential yet.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.130
But here, the gauge
transformations

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.220
come a little to the rescue.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.610
When you work with
vector potentials,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:31.130
you don't really need
that the vector potential

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.600
be the same here as here.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.850
It is enough if the
vector potential here

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.730
and here, which
is the same point,

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.440
they differ by a
gauge transformation.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.490
So the vector potential
is a subtle object.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.540
Here is the torus.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.960
In one part of the
torus it has a formula.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.170
In the other part, it may
look like it's not consistent.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.710
But you can use
another formula related

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.520
by a gauge transformation.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.970
So this vector
potential here is OK

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:15.550
if I manage to show that
what I get on this side

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.220
is just the gauge transformation
of what I was getting here.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.790
So physically
these are the same.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:26.230
And yes, you have a unique
configuration on the torus

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.220
if the vector potential here is
gauge-equivalent to the vector

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.430
potential there.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.310
So let's try to do that.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.840
So, gauge transformations
to the rescue.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.630
OK.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.700
A y of x plus Lxy.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.650
I want it to be a
gauge transformation

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.930
of the field at A y xy.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:14.130
So remember, A prime was
A plus gradient of lambda.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:20.760
So I'm going to write this
as A at the same point, which

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.770
is xy--

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.880
it's physically the same point--

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:35.610
plus the gradient of lambda, in
this case would be dy lambda.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.210
OK.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.180
Now we have to find
the gauge parameter.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.740
To show that they're
gauge-equivalent here and here,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.380
I must find the gauge parameter.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.290
That's the lambda.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.640
So let's do the formula here.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.000
This is B0.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.640
There's a formula
here, B0 times x.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:04.109
So x plus Lx times x plus
Lx is equal to B0 times

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.960
x plus dy lambda.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:14.699
So I cancel here and I get
B0 Lx is equal to dy lambda.

00:17:17.005 --> 00:17:17.505
OK.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.210
All right.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.869
So, well, it seems that
we're succeeding again,

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.220
against all odds.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:33.030
And we could take lambda, for
example, to be B0 Lx times y.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.760
And that would be
our gauge parameter.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.420
OK.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.310
So are we happy already?

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.635
Have we shown that
everything is working?

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.150
Well, there's still a problem.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:12.410
This time the gauge parameter
doesn't seem to be well-defined

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.710
on the torus as
well when I change--

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.740
you know, we didn't have
problems with y here.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.980
We had problems with x.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.440
When we tried to fix it with
x, we find the gauge parameter.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.450
But the gauge parameter
doesn't seem to have--

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.760
it does have problems with y.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.540
It's not the same at this
point and at this point.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.610
Because at those points,
y differs by L y,

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.990
and the gauge parameter,
again, doesn't quite

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.000
seem to live on the torus.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.760
It seems like an endless
amount of complication.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.560
But we're near the
end of the road now.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:02.320
The thing that comes to our
rescue is that lambda, in fact,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.140
doesn't quite have to
be that well-defined.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:07.660
Why?

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.190
Because the gauge transformation
of the charged particle

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:23.550
says that you need to do i
Q over hc lambda times psi.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.600
That's how you do
gauge transformations.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.480
And in fact, this, remember,
this is the U thing.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.020
And even though we write
A prime as A D lambda,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.330
this term can be
written in terms

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:45.760
of U. U is the master quantity
that has all the information.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:56.820
In fact, D lambda is roughly
U minus 1 gradient of U,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.770
up to a series of factors.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:02.220
So everything
depends on U. So we

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.210
don't have to worry too
much if lambda is not

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.700
well-defined on the torus.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.610
What has to be
well-defined on the torus

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:17.100
is U, the exponential of lambda.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:25.690
And that, it's a saver, because
U, now, is e to the i q.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:33.990
Lambda is B0 Lxy over h bar c.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:40.830
That's U. And U will be
well-defined on the torus

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:49.120
if, when you change y plus y
plus L y, this doesn't change.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:56.110
And for that, this whole thing,
when you change y by L y,

00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.550
must change by a factor of 2 pi.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.710
So if-- you see, you're
living dangerously with this.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.420
It just doesn't want
to exist on a torus.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:12.430
But if this happens to
be equal to 2 pi n--

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:23.670
so if you have q B0 Lx Ly
over hc equal to 2 pi n,

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.580
everything is OK.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.720
That thing, when you
change y for y plus L y,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.350
this whole exponent
changes by 2 pi n.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.620
And i times 2 pi n is 1.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.940
So U is well-defined
on the torus.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.540
So we're almost there.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.770
Here it is.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.550
B0-- there is a quantization.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:22:05.330
B0 times the area of the
torus is equal to 2 pi n--

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:17.310
pi n-- hc over q n.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:23.670
So you cannot have
arbitrary magnetic field.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:28.760
The magnetic field is such
that the flux is quantized.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.910
So here is the
illustration of an example

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.270
I wanted to mention
from the beginning,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.860
that if you have a magnetic
field that solves Maxwell's

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.570
equations, you're not done.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.310
You have to find potentials.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.900
And sometimes there are
funny things happening.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.200
And in particular,
here is the funny thing

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.470
that has happened
here, is that in order

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:55.790
to have a well-defined vector
potential on the torus,

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.600
you've been forced to
quantize the magnetic field.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:05.960
And B0 times A is
equal to phi, the flux.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.500
And this flux is a multiple
of this quantity, which

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.220
is sometimes called
the quantum of flux,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.400
the least possible flux.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.020
n, the flux quantum.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:36.660
So this flux quantum, it is
a famous number, in fact.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.870
I have it somewhere here.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.160
Somewhere in my notes.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.050
Yes, here it is.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:56.230
Phi 0 for electrons,
for q equal to e--

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.470
phi 0-- these are
units you seldom use.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:12.560
But it's about 2.068 times
10 to the minus 15 webers.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.110
Who knows what a weber is?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:32.420
Or 2.068 times 10 to
the minus 7 Maxwells.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.880
Anybody know what a Maxwell is?

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.310
OK, a weber is a unit of flux.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.590
It's tesla times meter squared.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.040
That's far too big.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:53.070
The Maxwell, it's a
more natural thing.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:59.880
Maxwell is gauss times
centimeters squared.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.460
So, you know, the magnetic
field of the Earth

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.350
is about half a gauss.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.060
A centimeter square
you can imagine.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.230
And that's the value of
the flux quantum, which

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:15.020
will have a role later for us.
