00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.525
PROFESSOR: All
right, spin orbit.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:16.000
We have it still there,
delta H spin orbit, orbit.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.280
Well, we know what V is.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:27.180
So that derivative, dv dr can
be taken care of, the 1 over r.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:37.560
That gives you e squared over 2m
c squared 1 over r cubed S, L.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.960
And you remember that S, L,
from 805, J squared minus S

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.880
squared minus L squared.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.990
The reason that's why you
tend to do addition of angular

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.470
momentum, because S and
L, calculating the matrix

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.140
elements of this
thing is very easy,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.830
in that base is because
every state there

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.940
has a fixed value of S squared,
a fixed value of L squared.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.750
And j squared plus a
couple of possibilities.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.800
So we must work with
the couple basis.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.810
Basis.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:34.500
And therefore, we can attempt to
find E1 of a N, L, J, MJ, spin

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:48.530
orbit, equal e squared over 2m
squared c squared and LJ, MJ,

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.160
S, L, R cubed.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.090
The R cube has to stay
inside the expectation value,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.730
because the expectation
value includes

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.460
integration over space.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.290
So this is a very important.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.270
N, L, J, MJ.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:19.260
And again the useful
question, the couple basis

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.270
will have have degeneracies.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.120
All the states are
degenerate there.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.540
So this time, we fixed n,
because the degeneracies

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.260
happen only when you fix n.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.740
So do we have the
right to do this,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.250
to use the formula
form perturbation,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.560
the non-degenerate perturbation
theory to do this calculation?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.790
And the answer is yes, because
the perturbation S.L over R

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:05.570
cubed commutes with with
L squared, with J squared,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.320
and with Jz.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.360
you need all that because
you can have degeneracies

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.280
by having different L values.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.330
And that would be taken
care by this operator that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.610
has different eigenvalues
when L is different.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.020
You can have the degeneracies
involving different J values.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.220
This would be taken
by this operator.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.120
And you can have
degeneracies when

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.160
m has different value so that
involves the Jz operator.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.290
So you really need
a perturbation

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.340
that commutes with all of them.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.590
And why does it commute
with all of them?

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.090
You can see it in several ways.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.310
Let's do L squared.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.440
L squared is Casimir,
it commutes with any LI.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.350
It doesn't even think
about S because it doesn't

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.660
know anything about S.
So it commutes with S.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.640
So L squared with any
LI and commutes with S.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.980
And L squared is
an invariant, it

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.540
commute with r squared
because r squared

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.100
is rotational invariant.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.740
So everything commute with that.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.440
In order to do the
other ones, you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:35.530
can also think in terms of
this matrix J squared over here

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.160
and S squared and
do all of them.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.430
You should do it and convince
yourself that they all commute.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.870
So we can do this.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.040
If we can do it, it's
good because then we

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.700
can evaluate these quantities.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.306
So let's do a little
of the the evaluation.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:23.740
So this E1nljmj is equal to.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.570
Let's evaluate the S dot L
part by using 1/2 j squared

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.560
s squared minus L squared.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:38.390
So that gives you a factor
of h bar squared over 2,

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.620
with this 2 over there.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.720
So you get e squared
h squared over 4m

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.230
squared c squared, J times
J plus 1 minus l times l

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:03.590
plus 1 minus 3/4, times
nljmj, 1 over r cubed, mljmj.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.590
OK.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.310
That should be
clear from the fact

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.130
that you have a j
squared minus s squared.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.090
That's a 3/4 spin is
always 1/2, and l squared.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.940
This is known.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:43.500
It's equal, in fact, to
nlml 1 over cubed nlml.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.140
Which is equal, let
me discuss that again.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:59.140
It's a little-- a0l,
l plus 1, l plus 1/2.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.960
OK.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.810
So this is a known result. It's
one of those expectation values

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.720
that you can get from
Feynman, Hellman,

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.500
or for other
recursion relations.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.365
And this is always computed in
the original uncoupled basis.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.575
But we seem to need it
in the coupled basis.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.701
So again, are we in trouble?

00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:25.200
No.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.510
This is actually the same.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.780
And it is the same only
because this answer

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.240
doesn't depend on ml.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.050
Because this states involve
various combinations of ml

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.650
and ms. But doesn't
depend on ml,

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.610
so the answer is
really the same.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.580
So these things are
really the same.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.570
Happily, that
simplifies our work.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:08:01.320
And now we have E1
nljm is equal to En 0--

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.140
this is yet another notation,
this is the ground state energy

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.760
here--

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:16.770
mc squared n, j, j plus 1
minus l, l plus 1 minus 3/4,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:23.790
over l, l plus 1/2, l plus 1.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.370
OK this is spin orbit.
