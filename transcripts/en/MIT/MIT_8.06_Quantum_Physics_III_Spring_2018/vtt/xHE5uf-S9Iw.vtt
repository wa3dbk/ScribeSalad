00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.590
PROFESSOR: Let's turn to
our next subject then.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.820
So this is still time
dependent perturbation theory.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.720
We will be doing time dependent
perturbation theory a little

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.380
longer, all of today's lecture
and a little of next time's

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.620
lecture.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.730
So we're going to be talking
now about light and atoms.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.730
So this is a classic
application of what time

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.860
dependent perturbation theory
does, the problem of radiation

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.820
interacting with atoms is more
and more detailed applications

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.650
and their ionization.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:56.810
So light and atoms,
and we think one

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.850
of the situations we
will be considering

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.920
is a collection of atoms and
they're interacting with light.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.930
But the way they
interact with light

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.460
is maybe not as controlled as
we had in hydrogen ionization,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.320
in which you send in a wave.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.410
But rather, it's
interacting with light

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.620
in thermal equilibrium.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.620
So there's black body radiation.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.930
There's all these photons,
unpolarized, in all directions,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.930
coming at the atoms in all ways.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.580
And they can produce
transitions in the atoms.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.000
And for that purpose, we will
consider a collection of atoms.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.890
And we will assume that
relevant to our situation,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.435
we have two energy levels.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.520
This state will be called b.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.750
Still we'll call a, Ea and Eb.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:26.780
So this is interacting
with light or with photons

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.850
at a temperature T.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.600
So a little bit of
statistical mechanics today.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.930
In order to discover
what Einstein did,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.860
basically, we're going to go
through Einstein's argument

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.230
of balance of radiation
rates and emission rates

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.180
and things like that.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.490
And we need to use some
statistical physics for that.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.430
Einstein was very good at
using statistical physics.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.380
And the frequency associated
with this transition

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.970
is Eb minus Ea over h-bar.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.590
And we'll take it to
be greater than 0.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.990
The state b will be considered
to be higher than the state a.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.790
So the question we ask is,
what happens to these atoms

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.530
when light shines?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:42.860
And in particular, suppose
the light contains photons

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.130
with a frequency omega b-a.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.700
That's the frequency
associated with the transition.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.250
So what will happen?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.790
And basically, a couple
of things can happen.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.190
These are things we
already know from time

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.240
dependent perturbation theory.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.710
And surprisingly,
as we will see,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.940
Einstein, when he went
through his argument

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.380
that we're going
to go through soon,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.610
came with a different
angle and saw things

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.780
a little differently.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.020
But let's follow
up the direction

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.920
that is based on the evidence
we've presented so far.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.285
So there will be two
possibilities, two cases.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.430
In the first case,
the atom is initially

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:53.110
with its electron on
level a, electron in a.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.850
So what happens?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.890
Well, we've coupled, a system
with two levels, two harmonic

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.970
perturbations.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.980
And we saw that sometimes the
particle or the system goes up

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.030
and sometimes goes down.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.250
And now we're going to see
the source a little bit more

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.270
realistically.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.340
Before it was a perturbation.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.770
Now we're going to
identify the perturbation.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.930
The electron is in state a.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.220
And here comes photons.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.350
And what's going to
happen is a process

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.145
of absorption of the photon.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.610
And the electron
goes to state b.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:59.490
So we'll draw it here.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.925
So this is before.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.945
And here is after.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.610
So before, you had this
thing and the electron

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.660
was on state a.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.890
There was a photon coming
here with energy h omega b-a.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:30.830
And then after, the
electron has been pushed up.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.070
And there's no photon anymore.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.240
The photon was absorbed.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.660
That's physically
what we would expect.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:47.370
The other possibility is
associated to the process

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.720
of stimulated emission.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.040
This is absorption.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:03.040
And here we have
electron in b initially.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:09.510
And we have stimulated emission.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:26.410
And in this case of
the electron goes to a.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:33.625
And another photon is released.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:43.280
It's a very surprising
thing if you think about it.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:50.210
And here, this is the
absorption process.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.920
Now this stimulated
emission process,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.850
you have the electron
originally in b.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.125
And here comes the photon.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:11.330
And the end result is an
electron in a and two photons.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.305
We notice that, when
we're doing perturbation

00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:29.660
theory between the
two energy levels

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.700
and we have the
harmonic perturbation,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.360
we even notice the probability
to go from the bottom

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.210
to the top or going from
the top to the bottom

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.220
was the same in
perturbation theory.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.040
And you would have
said, look, I understand

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.230
that when you have an
electron in the bottom level,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.380
you need some energy from
the source to kick it up.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.250
But why do you need this
source to make it go down?

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.320
It's just there.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.190
It should go down by itself.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.990
Well, you still need to couple
the system to something.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.440
Because if you are in
an energy eigenstate,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.170
you stay there forever.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.140
The reason it goes
down is because it

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.910
couples to something.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.420
And somehow, the coupling
through the electromagnetic

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.890
field helps this go down.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.280
That's why it's called
stimulated emission,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.850
because it's stimulated
by the radiation itself.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.570
And so this doesn't seem
to play too much of a role,

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.940
but actually does, in
which just by the presence

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.990
of a photon at the
right energy difference,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.450
it stimulates this to go down.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.080
And now you have two photons.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.570
So this is, of
course, something that

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.800
is used in technology a lot.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.780
This is the principle of lasers.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.800
And therefore, this discussion
of stimulated emission,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:11.540
which was a lot due to Einstein,
is the idea of a laser.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:18.230
So laser is Light Amplification
by Stimulated Emission

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.590
of Radiation.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.520
So what do you need for a laser?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:28.040
You need something that is
kind of a little strange

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.970
to begin with.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.925
Because from the viewpoint
of statistical physics,

00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:37.860
if you have a two-level
system, particles

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.440
will tend to be in
the lower level.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.530
So why would they go here?

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.370
Well, they won't go
there by themselves.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.750
That's the term called
population inversion.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.880
You need to get
the electrons that

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.396
are in the bottom to
go up to the next level

00:10:57.396 --> 00:10:59.700
and put them there.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.020
That's a technical
difficulty, of course.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.110
And it's usually solved
by optical pumping.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.460
We are not going to be doing
engineering here today.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:18.600
But there is a third level
here in a typical laser.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.800
And you can send
the electrons, that

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.180
are sitting originally
here, with light

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.280
again into the third level.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.420
And then it turns out
that that third level,

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:44.280
if you have the right atom, has
a transition to this level that

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.530
is rather quick.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:53.400
So the electrons fall
here, fall very quickly.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.690
And the lifetime of this
state here is very long.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.700
So they pretty much stay there.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.840
So this is the principle.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.170
This extra level is sometimes
called the pump level.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:21.840
And so this is done by optical
pumping, so optical pumping

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:31.660
to create population inversion.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.210
That you get more states
in the upper state

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.100
than you would get in
thermodynamic equilibrium.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.780
And then, you now have,
say, the levels here--

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.370
I'm going to draw them this way.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.000
It makes it a little easier.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.200
I think of one electron
here, maybe two here,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.780
maybe four here.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:04.870
And then comes a photon and
stimulates this electron

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.720
to go down.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.790
And now you have two photons.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.100
And they stimulate these
two electrons to go down.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.590
And now they have four photons.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.580
They can stimulate these
four electrons to go down.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.850
Have now eight photons.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.150
And that's the amplification
process of stimulation.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:39.400
Each time you stimulate
one down, you achieve this.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.440
In fact, technically speaking,
apparently in good lasers,

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.100
this transition
doesn't produce light.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.240
You would say, oh, it
produces more photons.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.880
But there's some
energy levels that

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.790
radiate by communicating
vibrational energies

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.790
to the atoms.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:04.030
So apparently these transitions
are not electromagnetic.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.560
And you don't mix more light.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.180
So basically, stimulated
emission of radiation

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:15.050
is the thing that gets
this process going.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.680
And that's what we're going
to try to understand now.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.150
The whole discussion
that follows

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.710
and what we have to understand
about light and atoms

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.190
will make all this
quantitative and allow

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.710
us to produce numbers
and calculate rates.
