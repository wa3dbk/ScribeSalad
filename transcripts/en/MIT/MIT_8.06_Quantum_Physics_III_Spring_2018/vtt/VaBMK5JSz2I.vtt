00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.460
PROFESSOR: So one more thing
let's do with this operator.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.230
So we're getting accustomed
to these operators,

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.120
and these permutation
operators can also

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.090
act on operators themselves.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.830
So that's important.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.926
So consider the
action on operators.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.740
So for example,
an operator B that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.560
acts belonging to
the linear operator

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:53.360
some V, when acting
on V tensor V,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.545
we define two
operators, B1 and B2.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.380
And you define them
in an obvious way,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.705
like B1 acting on
Ui 1 tensor Uj 2.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.380
OK, B as an operator
knows how to act

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.870
on every vector on the
vector space capital V.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.780
So when you say 1, you're
meaning that this operator acts

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420
on the first Hilbert space.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:47.070
So this is equal to B
times Ui 1 tensor Uj 2.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.530
So it just acts on
the first state.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.080
How does it act?

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.740
Via B, that is an operator,
in the vector space V.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:12.060
Similarly, if you have
B2 of Ui tensor Uj 2

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:30.370
you have Ui 1
tensor BUj 2 to OK.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
So these are operators that
act either on the first state

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.080
or in the second state.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.430
So the permutation operators can
do things to these operators,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.030
as well.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.500
So we can ask a
question, what is P21B--

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.540
should I start with one?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.850
Yes, one-- P21 dagger.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.790
Remember, when you ask how an
operator acts on an operator,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.880
you always have the
operator that you're

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.330
acting with come from the
left and from the right.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.240
That is the natural way
in which an operator

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.010
acts on an operator.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.910
You can think of this
thing as your operator

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.360
is being acted upon
as having surrounded

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.970
by a [INAUDIBLE]
and a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.700
And then when the
states transform,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.940
one transforms with U, one
transforms with U dagger.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.720
So always the action
on an operator

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.730
is with a U and a U dagger.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.190
So if you ask how does the
permutation operator act on B,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.470
you don't ask generally what's
the product of P times B.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.640
You ask this question.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.100
This is the question that
may have a nice answer.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.630
Then we'll see that there's
other ways of doing this.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.130
So we want to investigate
this operator.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:13.080
So what I can do is
let it act Ui, Uj.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.399
So what do we get?

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.260
We get P21B1.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.040
Now, P21 dagger, we saw
that it's Hermitian anyway,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.070
so it's just P21.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.615
And now it acts on Ui 1.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.030
I'll put the j here, and Uj 2.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.530
So I let up the
P21 on that state,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.040
and that the moves
the i's and the j's.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.090
Now, B1 acts on the
first Hilbert space.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:13.965
So now we have P21 and we
have BUj 1 and tensor Ui 2.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.940
Now, P21 is supposed to put the
second state in position one

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.400
and the first state
in position two.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:39.784
So this is Ui 1 BUj 2.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.330
I could put this thing--

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.120
BUj 2.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:57.030
And then you see, oh,
this term is here.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:04.110
So this is nothing else than
B2 acting on the same state

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:13.260
of the Ui Uj, which means--

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.020
I guess I could use
this blackboard--

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:28.210
that P21 B1 P21 dagger is B2.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.070
So it has moved you.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.370
The operator used to act
on the first particle.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.940
Two and one changes the first
particle with the second.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.270
It moved it into the other one.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.980
Similarly, you
could do this also.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.640
Would not be a surprise
to you that P21 B2 P21

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.980
dagger is equal to B1.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.510
And you don't have to do
the same argument again.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.780
You could multiply
this equation by P21

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.550
from the left and P21
dagger from the right.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.540
These things become one
and one, and the operators

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.180
remain on the other
side and gives you this.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.920
So this second equation comes
directly from the first.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.670
You don't have to go
through the arguments.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:30.670
So what is the
use of this thing?

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.470
You may have a
Hamiltonian, and you

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.510
want to understand
what it means to have

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.420
a symmetric Hamiltonian.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.160
And these operators
allow you to do that.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:52.930
So for example, you may
have an operator O 1,2.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.150
What is an operator O 1,2?

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.570
It's an operator build on things
that act on one or act on two.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.600
So if you want to
imagine it, it could

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.050
be an O that depends
on the operator

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.640
A acting on the first
label, an operator B acting

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.810
on the second label, an
operator C on the first label,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.530
an operator D on
the second label.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.610
Could be a very complicated
product of those operators

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.610
acting on all kinds of labels.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:39.235
Now suppose you act with
P21 O 1,2 P21 dagger.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.700
Now, the great advantage of
having a P and a P dagger

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.180
acting on a string
of operators is

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.510
that it is the same as
having a P and a P dagger

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.940
acting on each one.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.720
Remember, if you have
like P and P dagger,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.920
and it's a unitary
operator on ABC,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:15.130
it's the same as PAP dagger,
PABP dagger, PCP dagger.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.820
It's like acting on each one.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.410
So when you have this P21
P21 dagger acting on this,

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:28.130
it's as if each one of those is
surrounded by a P21 P21 dagger.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.400
So each label one will
become a label two,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.500
and each label two will
become a label one.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:47.840
And therefore, this operation
is going to give you O2,1

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.260
for an arbitrary operator
acting on these two labels.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.930
Now, it may happen that
the operator is symmetric

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.530
if O is symmetric.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:14.980
By that, we mean O
2,1 is equal to O 1,2.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.550
If that happens--
if that happens--

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:27.940
then from this equation you
would have P21 O 1,2 P21 dagger

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:35.980
is O1,2 is itself.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:42.930
And you could multiply
by a P21 from the right,

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:53.840
giving you P21 O 1,2 equal O
1,2 You're multiplying by a P21

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.090
from the right that
cancels this P21 dagger.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.490
P21.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.990
And there you see that
an operator is symmetric

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.300
if it commutes with the
permutation operator.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.310
So if always symmetric, this
is true, and this is true,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:24.160
and then finally, P21 with
O 1,2 commutator is 0.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:24.700
Oops.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.690
Too low.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.200
Let me see.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.145
It's a commutator.

00:11:30.145 --> 00:11:33.130
It's 0.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:39.760
So that's basically how you
manipulate these operators

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.550
on this Hilbert space.
