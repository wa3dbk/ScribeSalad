00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.200
PROFESSOR: So we
continue today our study

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.220
of electromagnetic fields,
and quantum mechanics,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.980
and particles in those
electromagnetic fields.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.430
So last time, we
described what we

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
must do in order to
couple a particle

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.570
to an electromagnetic field.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.600
And the rule was oddly simple.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.900
You get the
Schrodinger equation,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.400
and the Hamiltonian is now
changed into this form.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.860
If you had a free
particle, you're

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.950
accustomed to have
p squared over 2m.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.880
That has changed, and you
have a new term, with p,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.860
minus q over c, A squared.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.734
Thank you.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.650
So now our task is to understand
how this is compatible,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.350
and what are the implications
of these changes.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.870
They're pretty
significant changes.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.725
This expression,
p, minus q over c,

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.710
A, is what used to be just p.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.230
And that used to be
just the kinetic energy.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.350
And now it looks a little
more strange, in fact.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
So in terms of
electromagnetic potentials,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.790
we know that the
potentials are not unique.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.190
There are this gauge
transformations

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.060
that establish that these
are completely equivalent

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.480
potentials-- so two
potentials, A and phi,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.950
and A prime and phi prime,
are physically equivalent.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.530
They define the same
electromagnetic field

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.780
if they are related in this way.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.510
We then mention
that therefore you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.450
have an issue with the
Schrodinger equation.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.500
You would want the physics
to remain invariant

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.780
in their gauge transformations.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.410
So you could write the
Schrodinger equation

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.820
for the new gauge potentials,
with A prime and phi prime.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.240
And you could compare with
the Schrodinger equation

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.010
with the old
potentials, A and phi.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
And you could ask, OK, is
it solved by the same wave

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:22.790
function?

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.860
And the answer is no.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.560
The wave function must change.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.020
But there is a way to get one
way function from the other.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.670
Here is the formula.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.860
Psi prime and psi are related by
this factor, this function, U,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.890
which involves exponential of
the gauge parameter, multiplied

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.400
by a couple of
physical constants,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.590
including the charge,
q, of the particle.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.480
Now we're going to use the
notation, q, all the time.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.540
Many books put E in there.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.640
And that's the charge
of the electron.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.200
And then you always wonder,
is that E, or minus E,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.300
or which sign is it.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
So here, q is the
charge of the particle.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.010
If you have an
electron, q is minus E.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.810
But let's leave it q open there,
so you can work with arbitrary

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.120
charges in any circumstance.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500
So this Hamiltonian is
what we have to understand.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.040
They want to make a
couple more comments

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.890
about what this Hamiltonian is.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.580
And we must think a little about
the gauge invariance as well.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.570
So there it is.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.560
A Hamiltonian contains
this term squared.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.280
So let's just ask
ourselves, what

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.860
does that term really imply.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.960
Well, there's 1 over 2m.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.310
So for the
Hamiltonian, 1 over 2m.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.200
And we have this factor squared.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.550
So following the
careful things we're

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.680
accustomed to do in
quantum mechanics,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:30.010
I would put P squared here,
minus q over c, P dot A,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:41.920
minus q over c, A dot P, plus
q squared over c squared,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:50.090
A squared, plus q phi.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.010
That's how the
Hamiltonian looks.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.855
But you have to be careful.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.290
Here, this term we kind
of understand what it is.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.530
It's vector potential squared--

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.790
no problem.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.740
Here is p squared.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.070
We're accustomed to that.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.090
That's a Lapacian.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.850
We have two terms that
could be a little strange.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.200
A dot P, probably is all clear.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.500
A is dotted with a vector
momentum, which is an operator.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.770
It's the gradient.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.510
So that's going to differentiate
whatever is to the right.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.740
The question is,
what this P dot A?

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.750
And P dot A must be thought
in the operator way,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.320
that P acts on everything
to the right, including A.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.880
So if this Hamiltonian is to
act in a wave function, that

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.080
doesn't mean that the P
operator just acts on A.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.770
It acts on A and
everything to the right.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:10.200
So P dot A, if you think
of it as a derivative,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:29.650
is h bar over i, divergence
of A, plus A dot P. You see,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.950
this P is h bar over i gradient,
but it's acting on everything.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.730
So you could put up psi
to the right of here,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.010
and it would act on
everything there.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.200
So maybe in order to
justify this equation,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.820
you should just write h bar over
i gradient acting on A times

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.800
a wave function, psi.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.470
And go through this and see
that at the end of the day,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.800
this P dot with
A means act on A,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.720
but then you still have to act
on everything to the right.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.880
So that's this term here.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.000
So this term is
pretty important.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.290
Sometimes your A satisfies what
is called the Coulomb gauge,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.560
in which delta of A is zero,
but in general it doesn't.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.490
So this helps clarify what
the Hamiltonian really is.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.430
It would be a mistake
to say that these two

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.760
terms are the same.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.700
And it would be also a mistake
to say that this thing is just

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.090
the divergence of A.
Both are wrong things.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:54.390
So the whole Hamiltonian,
now, is P squared over 2m.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.270
Then you have twice--

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.430
well, let's have this term.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:05.490
So you have plus, the i
goes to the numerator,

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:14.280
as i h bar q, over 2m
c, divergence of A.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.880
And that's just the
divergence of A, the function.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.550
It's not any more a
differential operator.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.740
It's just acted on it.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.290
Then you have this term twice.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:36.809
So minus q over mc, A dot
P, plus this term, q squared

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:43.279
over 2mc squared, A
squared, plus q phi.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.290
So that's the Hamiltonian.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.990
Let me just make
sure I got it right--

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:57.485
P squared over 2m, plus
[INAUDIBLE],, minus qAP--

00:08:57.485 --> 00:09:00.270
OK, so that's right.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.420
OK, so this is our Hamiltonian.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.450
If you just want to
write it very explicitly.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.660
It's not generally all
that useful to have

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.600
the explicit form.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.560
But in some examples-- there
will be at least one example

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.480
where it is nice to know.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.560
And in fact, the H formula
on the top of the blackboard

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.100
hides, in a nice way, a
little bit the complexity

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.730
of this whole coupling.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.230
Yes.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.530
AUDIENCE: Is this
for scalar particles?

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.010
PROFESSOR: Yes, this is
for a scalar particle.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:42.490
So we're taking a particle,
at this moment, without spin.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.160
For spin particles, there
would be a little extra term

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.060
sometimes.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:57.280
So let's say a couple more
words about this thing,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.320
in particular the
gauge invariance.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.450
So we now have seen
what the Hamiltonian is.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.790
Let's think of the
gauge invariance.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.560
How could you establish
this gauge invariance?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.830
So an identity
that is very useful

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.410
takes the following form.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:27.430
This differential operator--
h bar over i gradient, the p,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:38.310
minus q over c, A
prime, times U--

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.270
and you could put the
psi here if you wish--

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:49.290
is in fact equal to U,
h bar over i gradient,

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:55.020
minus q over c, A, psi.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.345
So I call this a very
remarkable identity.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.200
And look what's happening here.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:25.850
This is useful for
this kind of equation.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.220
If you have a psi
prime which is U psi,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:38.330
the factor U interacts very
nicely with this operator.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:44.200
In fact, as you move U
from the right to the left,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.675
the gauge potential
goes from A prime to A.

00:11:49.675 --> 00:11:53.960
A rather nice thing about
this derivative-- it's

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.680
as if this derivative had
a very special symmetry

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.080
property that U can
be moved across,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.510
almost as if U was a constant.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.190
But of course it's not.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.410
But when you move it
across, the only effect

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.490
is to change the A
prime to A. So a gauge

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.222
transformation on the A.

00:12:17.222 --> 00:12:24.090
That is the reason this
derivative, equipped

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.110
with an extra term, is sometimes
called a gauge covariant

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:29.340
derivative.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.660
That is, it transforms nicely
under gauge transformations.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.840
It does a nice job.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.260
I write this equation because,
in part of the exercises,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.990
you will be asked to show that
this statement about gauge

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:50.790
transformations is correct, that
if this equation-- top-- holds,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.680
the bottom equation holds with
the replacements indicated

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.940
here.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:02.490
And this identity makes the
task of proving the equation--

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.950
the gauge invariance--
very simple.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.500
Because you can imagine
this psi prime--

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.700
put U psi-- and then
getting the U out,

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.000
so the psi prime
just will become psi,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.210
and the U going
through these factors

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.860
and simplifying very nicely.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.160
So this is a simple
equation to show.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.780
For example, I can
take the left-hand side

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.040
and see what happens.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.960
So the first term,
you have a gradient

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.970
acting on the product
of two functions.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.020
And that's just the
gradient acting on each.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:53.070
So h over i, gradient
of U, times psi, plus U,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.690
h over i, gradient of psi.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:59.060
That's the first term.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:11.160
The second term is minus
q over c, A, times U psi--

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.290
because A prime is A
plus gradient of lambda.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.820
So you're going to
have minus q over c,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.470
gradient of lambda, U psi.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.975
So I wrote the first line.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.580
Now we can take the
gradient of U. U is here.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.940
When we take the gradient
of U, what do we get?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.590
h bar over i, now
gradient of U--

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.200
you differentiate
the exponentials,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.150
so you take the gradient
of what is in the exponent.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:15:00.570
So it's iq over h bar
c, gradient of lambda,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.270
times U itself, because
you're differentiating

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.285
an exponential, times psi.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.720
And then you have all
these other terms.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.730
I'll couple this term.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:33.430
These two terms here are plus U
h bar over i, gradient of psi,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.476
minus q over c.

00:15:36.476 --> 00:15:43.050
U and A commute, because A is
a function of x and t, and U

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:47.140
is a function of lambda, which
is also a function of x and t.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.090
So there's no momentum here.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:53.950
These two things commute, so
U can be moved to the left--

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:59.780
A psi minus this term.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.960
And if we've done
the arithmetic right,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.690
the first and last term
should cancel, and they do.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.320
That i cancels,
the h bar cancels,

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.500
there's q over c times that,
and there's minus that term,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.020
so these two cancel.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.110
And this is precisely
the right-hand side.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.435
So this covariant
derivative is very nice.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.210
There's something about the
Schrodinger equation of course

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:44.090
that, in a sense, it's all
made of covariant derivatives.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.080
Let's look at that.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.590
So any version of the
Schrodinger equation--

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.760
here is the typical version
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.550
So recall that the vector
potential in general

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.610
can be thought of
as a four-vector.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.609
You may or may not have seen
this in the literal dynamics.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:11.260
But it's just like time
and x form a four-vector.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:15.640
The scalar potential
and the vector potential

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.460
form a four-vector.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:26.305
So the four-vector with index
mu, 0, 1, 2, 3 form this.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.700
And then, if you look at
the Schrodinger equation,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.710
what do we have?

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:45.000
We have i h bar, d
psi, dt, minus q phi--

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.660
I'm bringing the last term
on the right-hand side

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.680
to the left.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:18:00.980
So it's minus q times phi, which
is minus A0 psi is equal to 1

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:10.040
over 2m, this i h
bar over i gradient,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.080
minus q over c, A,
squared, and psi.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.790
And now look at this.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.250
It can be written as follows.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:48.070
Minus c times h over i, d over d
of ct, minus q over c, A0, psi,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.480
equal the same thing
on the right-hand side.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.500
So I've rewritten
the left-hand side

00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.250
in a slightly different
way, all the terms.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:06.132
So I put an extra
c, this d, dct.

00:19:06.132 --> 00:19:07.570
That canceled the c.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.750
The h bar, the i went
to the denominator.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:17.140
And now this all looks like
this covariant derivative.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.410
Look at this covariant
derivative. h over i, d dx,

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:27.460
minus q over c, A. And here
it is, h over i, d dx0--

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.470
because 0 is component
of the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.110
minus q over c, A0.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.260
So the whole
Schrodinger equation

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.810
is built with this
funny derivatives-- d

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.510
dx minus the vector
potential added in the net.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.820
These are the
covariant derivatives.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.140
These are nice operators.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.260
You see, the
operator P is always

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.580
called the canonical momentum--

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.785
canonical momentum.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:11.090
And this canonical momentum is
a momentum such that x with P,

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.675
if you put the hat, is i h bar.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:27.400
But this canonical momentum,
P, is not mass times velocity,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.380
not at all.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:34.740
This canonical momentum
is a little unintuitive.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.830
It's the one that
generates translation.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.150
The one that is mass
times velocity is really

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.290
this whole combination,
is mass times velocity.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.300
Because if it's mass times
velocity, this term, 1 over 2m,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.030
the mass squared times
velocity squared,

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.560
that gives you kinetic energy.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.640
So we have to be aware that
the canonical momentum is not

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:09.230
necessarily the simplest,
most intuitive object.
