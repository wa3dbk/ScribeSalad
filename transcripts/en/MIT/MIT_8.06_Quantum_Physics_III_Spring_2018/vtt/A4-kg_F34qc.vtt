00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:01.990
PROFESSOR: We have a problem.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.530
The general perturbation
theory, again, end states.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.120
But this time, the
degeneracy is not broken.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:20.070
So degeneracy not
lifted at first order.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.840
Surprisingly, this subject
is, as you can see,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.890
you have to do things with care.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.020
It's not in any of the
textbooks that I know.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.120
In fact, I don't
know of any place

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.360
where it is discussed in
detail or discussed anywhere,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.380
even though this result is
pretty useful and you need it,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.060
and I think people
improvise when they do this.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.120
Even this discussion
that with it here is not

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090
in any of your textbooks.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.930
In [INAUDIBLE],, the
advanced quantum mechanics,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.190
there's some discussion
and mentions this factor

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.570
and how subtle it is, but
doesn't quite do everything

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.010
till the bitter end.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.540
This case is harder.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.440
This is simple compared to
what we're going to do now.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.600
But we're going to sketch it
so that you see the picture.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.120
We're going to do
everything, but we're

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.190
going to try to keep
the picture clear

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.810
because it gets sophisticated.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.700
So what's the situation
that is happening.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.020
Physically, you have lambda
here, and you have the state.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.930
And to first order,
they don't split.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.660
So there are four states.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.590
And what we will assume is
that the first order, they

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.170
don't split.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.880
So they sort of come together.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.480
And then to second
order, they will split.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.400
We will assume that the
second order, they will split.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.110
If they don't split the second
order, things get complicated.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.789
I'm actually curious about that.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.780
But I don't know of
any physics example

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.350
that they don't split to
first nor to second order.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.170
You will have in the
homework things that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.910
don't split to first order.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.010
That really happens often.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.380
Then to second order,
if you have four states

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.840
and then split, means
that the second order

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.190
they'll go like this.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.250
And they'll start
looking like that

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.810
maybe, something like that.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.990
So the slope is the
same to begin with,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.650
but then they split.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.180
OK.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.390
So degeneracy not
lifted at first order.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.340
So what is the problem here
that the degeneracy is not

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.110
lifted to first order?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.588
The problem is physically that
this concept of a good basis,

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:04.170
that basis that corresponds
to the continuous changing

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.790
eigenstates.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.540
You did the perturbation
theory to first order,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.770
and you still don't know
what is the good basis.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.050
Because the good
basis is the one

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.200
that the states
change continuously.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.200
So suppose that we had
an example where we've

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.840
had in two dimensions the
conventional eigenstates,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.600
1 0, and 0 1, but the good
basis was the 1 1 and 1 minus 1.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.190
And you would say,
oh, they jumped.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.710
But you have to choose
the right basis.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.350
You do first order to
generate perturbation theory.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.510
And if the states split,
you have the good basis.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.960
But if they don't
split, you have

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.910
no idea what is the good basis.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.110
So in that sense, you're
trying to go high,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.700
because we did first order.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.930
Now, you have to go to second
order of perturbation theory

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.430
to see if you can find
what the good basis is.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.540
So we will have to diagonalize
something to second order

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.190
to find the good basis.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.990
And once you have
the good basis,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.220
you sort of have to
start from the beginning.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.560
Now, I have a good basis.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.570
Let's do the perturbation
theory nicely.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:28.340
So if the degeneracy
not broken, we

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:41.375
have that n0k delta H
and 0l is en1 delta kl.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.080
It is diagonal still.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.060
You do have a basis that
diagonalizes the perturbation.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.730
You still diagonalize it.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.160
But once you diagonalize it, all
the eigenvalues are the same.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.260
There's no account for ml here.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.810
All of them are the same.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.380
So what is the catch?

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.500
The catch is that you now
need to find good eigenstates.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.150
So what is the good basis?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.680
We'll write it in
the following way.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.440
I will form linear combinations
k equal 1 to n of the n0k.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.600
And I will put
coefficients a, k, 0 here.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.920
And I will say, look, if you
give me some coefficients a, k,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.180
0, I know how to superimpose
now the N states.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.230
And let's hope that that's
one good basis vector.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.050
You know, I've written one
good basis vector if a, k

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.570
it's a column vector of numbers.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.930
It gives me what is the
superposition of those

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.540
degenerate states
that makes one vector.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.650
So I'll call this
a vector PSI 0.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.100
So I think of this a, k
not as unknown numbers,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:34.775
unknown vector that
specifies a good state.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.610
And moreover, if
I do things right,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.960
I should calculate these things.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.390
And I should find that my
equations end up giving me

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.600
N of those good vectors.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.010
You see, if I specify a column
vector of constants here,

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.730
I get one vector here,
a linear superposition.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.600
But I should get n
linear superpositions.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.100
Because at the end
of the day, there

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.250
has to be n good
vectors in that basis.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:32.210
So in some sense, I hope
for an a0 with an index Ik,

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:40.400
with I going from 1 to n,
in which this by varying I

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:48.590
provides me k N column
vectors, each one of which

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.390
gives me a state.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.610
So this gives me one state.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.140
If I had N of
those coefficients,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.370
I would get n state.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.530
So that's my hope.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.530
So suppose we get one
of those good states,

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.420
how should it look in
perturbation theory?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.040
Well, the state PSI lambda is
going to be the state PSI 0.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.160
That's, in fact, the
zeroth order state.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.930
We don't know
those coefficients.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.760
That's our ignorance about
the zeroth order states now.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:29.310
PSI 0 plus lambda PSI 1 plus.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:41.600
And the energy's en lambda
is en 0, the 0 energy,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.140
plus the first order
energy correction

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.910
plus the second order
energy corrections.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.830
And from this, the
Schrodinger equation

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.740
that as usual says that
h of lambda PSI of lambda

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.090
is equal to En of
lambda PSI of lambda

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:18.480
gives you these equations that,
by now, you're pretty familiar.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.720
And we'll need a couple of them.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:27.600
So I will write them again.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:40.750
To order lambda 0, you get H0
minus En0 on PSI 0 equal 0.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.890
That's a trivial
equation because PSI 0

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.780
is made up of states, all
of which have energy En0.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.380
So that's always a
trivial equation.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:59.710
Then to order lambda,
you have H0 minus En0

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.230
on the first state.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.560
We've done this
already a few times.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:13.810
So I'm sure you don't have
trouble believing this.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:22.190
And to order lambda squared,
the last one that I'll write,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:42.980
En0 PSI 2 is equal to En1 minus
delta H PSI 1 plus En2 PSI 0.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.760
OK.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.910
Kind of tire of writing
these equations.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.710
OK.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.740
So let's see what we should do.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.060
So we can start
calculating things.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:09.110
And the way I'm going to do
it, for the benefit of time,

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.230
is that I will
indicate the steps

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.820
and what you do and
skip the algebra.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.370
It will all be in the notes.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.320
And in fact, the whole
calculation will,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.280
if you want to go to
the very end of it

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.950
and exploit it to
a maximum, there's

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.720
lots of things one can do.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.770
And some of that will
be left for homework.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.830
So our idea here is to
give you the road map

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.890
and for you to see how
we're doing things.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:55.610
So let me see here.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.540
We can do a few things
with these equations.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.380
So the first
equation is trivial,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.880
so we don't bother with it.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.320
And the second
equation, it's kind of

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.195
interesting to see what it does.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:25.470
We can find from this
equation a confirmation

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.910
of what first order
perturbation theory does.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:35.910
If we inject here one
of the states in VN,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.840
those N0l's, you get
the statement, again,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:47.410
that delta H should
diagonalize the perturbation.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.490
So I think I'll skip that.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.070
We'll discuss it in the notes.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.150
But let's do the case when
this equation gives something

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.080
non-trivial.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:11.170
So let's calculate p acting
on the order lambda equation.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:18.930
So when we had N0l, say, on
the order lambda equation,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.710
that is kind of familiar.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.210
We've already done it a
few times, so I'll skip it.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:30.820
But let's do the p
acting on this equation.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:49.500
So p0 H0 minus
En0 times PSI 1 is

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:59.980
equal to p0 En1
minus delta H PSI 0.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.240
H0 is a known Hamiltonian.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.210
And this we know the energy.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:24.360
So this gives you Ep0 minus
En0 on p0 PSI 1 is equal to.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.470
Here is a state in v-hat.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.410
And this is a state in
the degenerate subspace.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:37.940
We wrote it up there.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.140
That's our answers.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.960
We don't know even the
zeroth order states.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.730
That's our problem.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.560
But this term is
orthogonal to that.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.590
So across the number,
it gives us 0.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.860
On the other hand,
here what do we get?

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.940
We get minus the sum.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.930
Think of this state
being the sum that we

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.060
wrote in the previous thing.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:20.050
The sum from k equal 1
to n delta Hp nk a0 k.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:26.870
I've substituted this formula
for the state PSI 0 in there.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:36.760
And now, we have
computed these overlaps

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:41.260
because this is in principle
known in terms of a0.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.880
And now we have these
constants, these overlaps

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.030
of the states outside
the general space

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.350
with the first
correction and this part.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.370
So I'll write it this way.

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:05.260
PSI 1 of v-hat is
equal to p ap1 p0.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.100
And what is this ap1?

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.030
It's those coefficients
we're trying to find here.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.220
So this is the component
of PSI 1 along p0.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.130
So that component
should go here.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:36.580
And therefore, it's minus
1 over Ep minus En0 all.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:48.701
And here we have sum from k
equals 1 to n delta H and Hp nk

00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:49.201
ak0.

00:16:57.131 --> 00:16:57.630
OK.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:05.800
So we're pretty close to
our goal, believe it or not.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.089
So what have we achieved?

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.140
Let's see, again, where we are.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.290
We have no idea what
are the good states,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.930
so we introduced a0.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:22.119
a0 parameterizes our
ignorance of the good states.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.349
So we know, however, that
the first order correction

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.630
doesn't lift the degeneracy.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.450
And therefore, I don't
have to recalculate that

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.670
from the second equation.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:39.220
I just find the piece
of PSI 1 that is also

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.810
determined from that equation.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.440
And now, we've done completely
the first order equation.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.890
And what did we learn?

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.990
We learned that the first
order correction to the state

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.930
is known if I know
the good basis.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.740
Because all this first order
correction to the state

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.470
in the outside subspace in the
rest is determined if I know

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.970
the a0's.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.800
But I don't know the a0's.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.740
So we are calculating
things, but we have not

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.570
solved our problem.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.770
But we run out of equations
with the order lambda.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.090
We've finished.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:25.610
No more lambda equation, so we
have to look into this equation

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.045
now.
