00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.180
That is the first step.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.170
But to make things
really clear, we

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.960
have to do the second step that
it involves the Bi solution.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.280
So let me say something
about Bi as well.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.900
So Bi has similar
asymptotic expansions.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.970
A Bi solution, if psi, you
have an exact Bi solution.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.630
When psi on the left would
behave as minus 1 over pi,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.360
this is for u negative.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:02.790
1 over u to the 1/4 sine of 2/3
u to the 3/2 minus pi over 4.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.890
And psi on the right
of x would behave as 1

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.060
over square root of pi,
1 over u to the 1/4, e

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.290
to the 2/3, u over 3/2.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.870
OK.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.730
This is the asymptotic
behavior of B. So

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.890
what's noteworthy about it?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.330
First, that it oscillates
for u negative.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.500
That's to the left.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.310
It oscillates.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.000
Instead of a cosine, a
sine, the same phase shift.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.410
And then that on the other side
for u positive, it blows up.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.630
So it uses the
other exponential.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.020
And this all is reasonable.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.890
And in fact, it allows
you to connect as well.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:11.550
So in this case, we would have
this term looks like this one.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:27.680
And the left one looks like--

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.670
so indeed, if you
had the Bi solution,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.950
the matching requires
that the D term over there

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.070
is matched to the B term
over here because that's how

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.150
the Bi solution is connected.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.090
So we now need to
relate the B to the D.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.470
So I will write down
the relation here.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.380
So in this case,
there's no factor of 2,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.840
but there is a minus sign.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.820
So we have B must
be equal to minus D.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.250
So you can take B equals to
minus 1 and D equals to 1.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:32.690
And we get 1 over square root
of kfx sine x to A. Kfx prime dx

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.500
prime minus pi over 4 connects
in principle to minus 1

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.870
over square root of kappa of x
e to the integral from A to x,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.450
kappa of x prime dx prime.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.120
I think I have it all right.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.660
B is there.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.060
B is minus 1.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.700
It's over there.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.310
D is equal to 1.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.750
That's the D term.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.300
That's the other
connection condition.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.790
OK.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.180
So the technicalities are gone.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.980
But the concept now requires
a serious discussion.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.790
I'll give you a little
time to take it in.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.150
We've connected every functions.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.940
That was the first work
we did at the beginning

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.970
of this lecture.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.190
We did, in the top blackboard
justify, this expansions.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.540
We discussed how the Bi function
would originate from a counter

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.370
integral as well.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.270
And we didn't derive the
Bi asymptotic expansions,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.170
but they're similarly derived.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.655
And then we used those
to connect things.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.590
And now the question is whether
these equations can be used.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.400
If I know the solution
on the left is like that,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.970
can I say the solution on
the right is like that?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.550
Or if I know the solution
on the right is like that,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.280
can I say the equation
is on the left?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.910
And the same thing here.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.640
If I know the
solution on the left,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.070
do I know the
solution on the right?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.320
And if I know the
solution on the right,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.710
do I know the
solution on the left?

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.680
Now it looks like yes,
that's what you derive.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.670
But remember, it's
not quite simple

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:50.120
because our whole discussion
assume that OK, the potential

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.040
is strictly linear.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.760
But in reality, the
potential starts to deviate.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.150
So these things
that were right here

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.610
are not exact
asymptotic expansions.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.360
That is the exact dominant term
of the asymptotic expansions.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.710
But here there
may be extra terms

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.950
because the solution
does not correspond

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.410
to a potential is
exactly linear.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.140
And anyway, this is
not an exact solution

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.120
of the differential equation.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.270
So there is a possibility
of ambiguities here

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.060
that actually indicate
the following.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.820
I claim this connection can
only be done in this way.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:52.420
You can only take this equality
from the right to the left.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.250
That is, if you
know that you just

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.510
have a decaying
exponential, you know

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.060
it connects to this function.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.560
Why?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.440
Because if you know you
have a decaying exponential,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.530
there's 0 chance
there is a growing

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.810
exponential on the right.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.350
You may have a barrier
that extends forever,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.960
and there's definitely only
a decay in exponential,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.010
however the barrier looks.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.440
If there's only a
decaying exponential,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.270
you know that this growing
exponential is just not there.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.610
The coefficient here is 0.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.640
So you don't have the
ambiguity that maybe you

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.310
have a little bit of a
growing exponential that

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.930
connects to this.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:49.240
So you can go from
here to there.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.780
On the other hand, you
cannot quite go from the left

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.890
to the right.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.560
Why is that?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.420
The reason is the following.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.370
If you just know
this is on the left,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.500
you would say, OK, now I predict
a decaying exponential there.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.440
But your calculation
is not totally exact,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.300
so there could be an
infinitesimal wave

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.840
of the other type on the
left, an infinitesimal wave

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.730
of this kind.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.400
But that infinitesimal
wave of this kind

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.950
goes into a growing exponential,
and a growing exponential

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.350
eventually overtakes this
one and ruins your solution.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:46.870
So you cannot really use this
equation from right to left.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.190
The small possibility of
error on the left side,

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.140
because you don't
have exact solutions,

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.400
translates into an
ambiguity concerning

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.230
a positively
growing exponential,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.850
and it would overtake this.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.700
So if you say oh, I
have this, therefore I

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.860
have this decaying
exponential, this

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.710
may be a very inaccurate
thing because maybe you

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.350
have a little bit
of the sine that you

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.290
didn't see because it was
much smaller than this term.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.350
But that would give you
a growing exponential.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.220
So you cannot use that
equation in that direction.

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:27.830
Similarly here, you
have another direction.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.650
The direction is this one.

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:32.880
It's crucial.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.360
You can go that way, but you
cannot go the other direction

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.900
as well.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.610
And the reason is
kind of similar.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.240
Suppose you have
here, you say, OK,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.310
I have this growing exponential.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.010
And say somebody comes in, no,
there's a little bit of cosine

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.090
here.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.220
And you say well, but
a little bit of cosine

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.490
gives me a decaying
exponential that is irrelevant

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.990
compared to this one.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:08.590
So you are safe in going
from this side to that side.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.050
You're going into
growing exponential.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:17.260
Any error on the left
will produce a small error

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.410
on the right.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.840
Of the other hand, you
cannot go, honestly,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:31.430
from right to left because
if you had a decaying

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.490
exponential-- this is
a growing exponential.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.910
If you had the
decaying exponential,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.380
you wouldn't see it here.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.950
This one takes over.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:46.310
But the decaying exponential
produces a nice cosine

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.340
that is quite
comparable to this one.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.970
So a decaying exponential
that you don't see here

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.050
produces on this side a term
that is comparable to this one.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:05.460
So you also cannot go from this
direction to that direction.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.250
So these are the
connection formulas

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.620
and these are the directions.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.750
We've done this for this
configuration in which we have

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.870
a turning point of this form
at the point A, in which you're

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:29.060
allowed to the left and
forbidden to the right.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:37.990
For convenience, it's
useful to have a formula--

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:44.400
let's go here-- where you have
the opposite direction in which

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.250
you have a B here, and you
have allowed to the right

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.710
and forbidden to the left.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:58.200
I will write those formulas
because they are many times

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.750
used and you will
need them in general.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.402
And Griffiths and other
books don't have the patience

00:12:04.402 --> 00:12:05.610
to give you all the formulas.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:16.060
This is kappa of
x prime, vx prime.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:27.040
This is growing or
decaying exponential?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.700
This should be called
the growing exponential

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.840
on the left.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.150
This is the forbidden region.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.420
As x becomes more and more
left, the interval is bigger.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.130
So this is a growing
exponential on the left.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:54.020
1 over k of x sine b to x,
k of x prime, vx prime minus

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.450
pi over 4.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.850
And this one, again,
just like that one,

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.600
you go into the
growing exponential.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.010
So that's that relation.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:13.720
And I kind of write these
things following this picture.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.820
So you're allowed to the right
and forbidden on the left side.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.530
The allowed way
function the right,

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.375
the forbidden way
function to the left.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:29.790
1 over kappa of x,
exponential of minus x

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:39.034
to B. Kappa of x prime
vx prime goes into--

00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:45.040
a decay in exponential you can
follow into the other region.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.580
And that's what we
do here, as before.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.060
The decaying exponential
is safe because if you

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.850
know there's just a
decaying exponential,

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.660
there's no possibility of
having the growing exponential.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:08.440
So these are your conditions
for that turning point,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.570
and that's how you use them.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.130
So one example that we will
not get to discuss now,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:20.620
but will be in the notes, is
tunneling across a barrier.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:24.250
And you will use the connection
conditions in this case

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:31.150
here, and for this case, the
other ones that we've done.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.530
So you need for tunneling
both connection conditions.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.380
It's a very nice exercise.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.660
I recommend that
you play with it,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.370
and we'll put it in
the notes as well.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.980
So let's stop here.
