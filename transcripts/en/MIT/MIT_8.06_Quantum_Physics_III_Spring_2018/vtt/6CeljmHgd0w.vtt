00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.840
PROFESSOR: We spoke last
time of the existence

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.430
of symmetric states.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.530
And for that we were
referring to states

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:25.890
psi S that belonged to the
M particle Hilbert space.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.585
And V is the vector space that
applies to the states of the M

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:32.746
particles.

00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:36.180
And we constructed some states.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600
So within the construction,
we postulated,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.200
there will be some
states that [AUDIO OUT]

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.390
that meant that any permutation
of [AUDIO OUT] state

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.970
will be for the symmetric
state or all alpha.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.590
So that meant the
state was symmetric.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.210
Whatever you apply to
it, any permutation,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.050
the state would be invariant.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.290
So these are special states,
if they exist, in VN.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.445
Then there would be
anti-symmetric states.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.960
And we concluded that an
anti-symmetric state--

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.520
with an A for anti-symmetric--

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.500
also stayed in this
tensor product.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.930
That state would
react differently

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.215
to the permutation operators.

00:01:37.215 --> 00:01:43.130
It would change up to a
sine epsilon alpha times

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.740
psi A. It would be an eigen
state of all those permutation

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.630
operators.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.140
But with eigenvalue
epsilon and alpha

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.920
where epsilon alpha
was equal to plus

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.710
1 if P alpha is an
even permutation.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.540
Or minus 1 if P alpha
is an odd permutation.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.540
So whether this
permutation is even or odd,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.830
we also discussed
depends on whether it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.850
built with an even or odd
number of transpositions.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
With transpositions being
permutations in which

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.870
one state is flipped
for another state.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.610
Within the end
states, you pick two,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.780
and these two are flipped,
that's a transposition.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.250
All permutations can be built
through transpositions--

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.410
with transpositions--
and therefore you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.250
can tell from a
permutation whether it's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060
an even or an odd one
depending of whether it's

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.360
built with even number of
transpositions or odd number

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.680
of transpositions.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.230
Now, the number
of transpositions

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.330
you need to build the
permutation is not fixed.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.460
If we say it's even,
means it's even mod 2.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.230
So you might have a permutation
is built with 2 transpositions.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.580
And also somebody
else can write it

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.040
as 4 transpositions
and 6 transpositions.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.230
It just doesn't matter.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.870
So a few facts that we
learned about these things

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.810
are that all the P alphas
are unitary operators.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:59.050
And we also learned
that all transpositions

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.690
are Hermitian operators.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.490
Now, transpositions, of
course, are permutations.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.570
So they're Hermitian, and
they're unitary as well.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:32.970
And finally, we learned that
the number of even permutations

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:46.300
is equal to the number of odd
permutations in any permutation

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.665
group of n objects.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.470
So these were some of the facts
we learned last time already.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:10.680
We have now that symmetric
states form a subspace.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.690
If you have two
symmetric states,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.400
you can multiply a
state by a number,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.710
it will still be symmetric.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.350
If you add two symmetric
states, will still be symmetric.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.440
So symmetric states form a
subspace of the full vector

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.600
space V tensor N.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.920
And anti-symmetric
states also form

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.180
a subspace of the vector
space, V tensor N.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.180
So let's write these facts.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:54.460
So symmetric states
form the subspace,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:07.600
and it's called sym N of V
of V tensor N. Anti-symmetric

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:30.540
states form the subspace
anti N V of V tensor N.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.230
All right.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.440
So these are the states.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.950
But we have not learned how to
build them, how to find them,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.980
and even more, what
to do with them.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.130
So main thing is if
this form subspaces,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.160
there should be a way to
write the projector that

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.880
takes from your big space
down to the subspace.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.525
So here is the
claim that we have.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.660
Here are two operators.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:12.390
We'll call this S,
a symmetrizer And S

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.540
will be billed as 1 over N
factorial, the sum over alpha

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.840
of all the
permutations, P alpha.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.980
That's the definition.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:41.370
And then we'll have an
anti-symmetrizer, A. This is

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.400
also 1 over N factorial,
sum over alpha.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.700
Epsilon alpha P alpha.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.380
Where epsilon alpha,
again, is that sine factor

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.040
for each permutation.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.020
So here are two
operators, and we're

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.010
going to try to prove
that these operators are

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:10.080
orthogonal projectors
that take you

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.460
to the subspace's
symmetric states

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.620
and anti-symmetric states.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.580
So that is our first goal.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.090
Understanding that these
operators do the job.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.350
And then we'll see what
we can do with them.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.640
So there are several
things that we

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.510
have to understand
about these operators.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.850
If they are projectors, they
should square to themselves.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.780
So S times S should be
equal to S. Remember, that's

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.030
the main equation
of a projector.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.750
A projector is P
squared equals P.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.500
And the second thing,
they should be Hermitian.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.200
So let's try each of them.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:12.070
So the first claim is that
S and A are Hermitian.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:28.170
In particular, S dagger equal
S. And A dagger equal A.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:38.350
So if you want to prove
something like that,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:42.450
it's not completely
obvious at first sight

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.120
that those statements are true.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.500
Because we saw, for
example, that transpositions

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.960
are Hermitian operators.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.980
But the general permutation
operator is not Hermitian.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.070
It's unitary.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.690
So it's not so obvious.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.210
You cannot just say each
operator is Hermitian,

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.010
and it just works out.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.620
It's a little more
complicated than that.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:17.230
But it's not extremely
more complicated than that.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.180
So let's think of the
following statement.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.410
I claim that if you have the
list of all the permutation

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.190
operators.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.790
Put the list in front of you.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.400
All of them.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.130
And you apply Hermitian
conjugation to that whole list,

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.950
you get another
list of operators.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.960
And it will be just the
same list scrambled.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.740
But you will get the same list.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.630
It will contain all of them.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:55.260
And that is kind of obvious
if you think about it a little

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.370
more.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.200
You have here, for example, the
list of all the permutations.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.240
And here, you apply Hermitian
conjugation, HC or dagger.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.340
And you get another list.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:20.830
And this list is the same as
this one although reordered.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.640
In a sense, it permutes
the permutation operators,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.250
if you wish.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.390
And the reason is clear.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.310
If you have two operators
here, and you apply--

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.210
they are different-- and you
apply Hermitian conjugation,

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.350
it should give two
different operators here.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.130
Because if they were equal,
you could apply again

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.410
Hermitian operator conjugation.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.060
And you would say,
oh, they're equal.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.650
But you assume they
were different.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.940
So two different operators go
to two different operators here.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.840
Moreover, any operator here--

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.270
you can call it O--

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.950
is really equal to O dagger.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.700
O dagger.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.430
Hermitian conjugation
twice gives you back.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.890
So any operator here is
the Hermitian conjugation.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.500
Hermitian conjugate of
some operator there.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.880
So every operator
here will end up

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.370
at the end of an
arrow coming here.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.310
Maybe those arrows,
we could put them

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.040
like they go in all directions.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.370
But the fact is
that when you take

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.380
Hermitian conjugation
of all the list,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.825
you get all the list back.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.690
Therefore, that takes
care of the symmetrizer.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.410
When I take the Hermitian
conjugation of P alpha,

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.750
I might get another P beta.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.630
But at the end of the
day, the whole sum

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.360
will become again the whole sum.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:05.315
So that proves the fact
that this map is 1 to 1

00:13:05.315 --> 00:13:12.060
The map Hermitian
conjugation is 1 to 1.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:18.840
1 and surjective meaning
that every element

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.580
is reached as well.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:26.730
Means that S dagger
is equal to S.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:30.750
Because the list doesn't change.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:37.200
Here is a slightly
more subtle point.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.820
This time, the list
is going to change.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.290
But then maybe when this
changes to another operator,

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.930
maybe the epsilon is
not the right epsilon.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.630
You would have to
worry about that.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.780
But that's no worry either.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.600
That also works out clearly.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.700
Because of the following thing.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.960
If a permutation
P alpha is even,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.770
it's billed with an even
number of transpositions.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.070
If you take the
Hermitian conjugation

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.320
of an even number
of transpositions,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.720
you'll get an even
number of transpositions

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.680
in the other order.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.940
That's what Hermitian
conjugation is.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:24.410
Therefore, Hermitian conjugation
doesn't change the fact

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.950
that the permutation
is even or is odd.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:39.260
So if P alpha has a sine
factor E of P alpha.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.870
Let's write it more explicitly.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:51.320
And P alpha dagger has as a
sine factor E of P alpha dagger.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.960
These two are the same.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.330
If P alpha is even, P
alpha dagger is even.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.690
If P alpha is odd,
P alpha is odd.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.410
Therefore, when you take
the Hermitian conjugate

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.200
of this thing, you may map.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.380
You think the Hermitian
conjugate of this sum.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:21.780
You have here a dagger would
be 1 over N factorial, sum

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:29.430
over alpha, epsilon alpha,
P alpha dagger, which

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.230
is another permutation.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:35.430
But this permutation.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.980
For this permutation,
this sine factor

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.660
is the correct sine factor.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.790
Because the sine
factor for P alpha

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.630
dagger is the same as the
sine factor of E alpha.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:50.130
Since we get the whole sum
by the statement before,

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.050
A is also Hermitian.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.060
So OK.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:02.940
Not completely obvious,
but that's a fact.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.740
If you think more
abstractly, this

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.500
is something you
could know on a group.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.880
If you have a group that
has all kinds of elements.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.430
Many of you have written papers
in groups in your essays.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.160
Then if you take
every group element,

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.470
and you replace
it by its inverse,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.950
you get the same list
of group elements.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.750
It's just scrambled.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:35.450
And remember, since this
permutations are unitary,

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.590
taking Hermitian conjugation
is the same thing

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.710
as taking an inverse.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.860
So when you take
a group, and you

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.810
take the inverse
of every element,

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.860
you get back the list of
the elements of the group.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.470
And that's what's
happening here.
