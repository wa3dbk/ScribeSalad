00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.030
PROFESSOR: Let's do adiabatic
evolution really now.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.810
Evolution.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.850
We're going to say
lots of things,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.840
but the take away message is
going to be the following.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.840
We're going to get maybe
even confused as we do this,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.940
but the take away
message is the following.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.130
You sort of begin in
some quantum state,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.540
and you're going to remain
in that quantum state

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.290
as it changes.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.360
All the states are
going to be changing.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.380
The quantum states are going
to be changing in time.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.380
And you're going to remain
on that quantum state

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.380
with an extra
phase that is going

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.840
to have important information.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.650
That's basically all
that's going to happen.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.020
There's a lot of subtleties
in what I've said,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.690
and we have to unmask
those subtleties.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.040
But you're going to remain
in that state up to a phase.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.810
That phase is going to be
called something, Berry's phase.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.220
And there's a
dynamical phase as well

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.000
that is simple and
familiar, but Berry's phase

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.670
is a little less familiar.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.310
So you're going to get the
same state up to a phase.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.710
You're not going to jump states.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.940
After we'll do that, we'll do
Landau-Zener transitions, which

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.720
are an example
where you can jump,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.970
and you will calculate
and determine

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.350
how big is the
suppression to jump,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.070
and so it will
reinforce [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.520
So let me begin with this thing.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.690
Suppose you have an H of t.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.640
And now, you come
across this states that

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.740
satisfy the following thing.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:11.880
H of t, psi of t, is
equal to E of t psi of t.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.080
If this equation doesn't
look to you totally strange,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.170
you're not looking hard enough.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.220
It is a very strange equation.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.420
It looks familiar.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.860
It looks like everything
we've always been writing,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.770
but it's not.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.980
Look what this is saying.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.400
Suppose you look at the
Hamiltonian at time 0.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.180
Then the state at time
0 would be an eigenstate

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.970
of the Hamiltonian at
time 0 with some energy

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.220
at time 0 and some state here.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.180
So this is what's called an
instantaneous eigenstate.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.050
It's an eigenstate
at every time.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.880
It's almost as if you find the
eigenstate at time equals 0.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.310
You find the eigenstate
at time equals epsilon.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.580
You find the eigenstate
at time equal 2 epsilon.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.490
Each time, and
you piece together

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.200
a time dependent
energy eigenstate

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.930
with a time dependent energy.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.790
We never did that.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.830
Our energy eigenstates
were all time independent.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.930
So what kind of
crazy thing is this?

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.430
Well, it has some intuition.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.930
You know how to do it.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.170
You know the Hamiltonian at
every time, and at any time,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.390
you can find eigenstates.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.750
Now, you've solved
at time equals 0,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.594
and you solve it at
time equals epsilon,

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:53.010
and at time equals
epsilon, you're

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.930
going to have
different eigenstate.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.420
But at time equals
0, you're going

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.400
to have lots of eigenstate.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.910
At time equals
epsilon, you're going

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.570
to have lots of eigenstate,
but presumably, things

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.400
are not changing too fast.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.340
You will know which
one goes with which.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.680
Like at time equals 0, I
get all these eigenstate,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.990
and at time equal epsilon,
I'll get this eigenstates,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.690
and presumably, you think,
well, maybe I can join them.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.930
I'm not going to go this to
that, because it's a big jump,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.600
and you can track them.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.390
So this you could
find many of those.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.815
These are called are
instantaneous eigenstates.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.960
They are a little
strange, because suppose

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.800
you find those eigenstates,
this is so far so good,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.360
but maybe this goes like that,
and this crosses that one.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.120
Oh-- then how do you know
which one, should you go here,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.170
or should you go here, which
one is your eigenstate?

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.550
So let's just hope
that doesn't happen.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.555
It's going to be very
difficult if it happens.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.880
Moreover, there's going to be--

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.015
these states are
not all that unique.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.610
I could multiply
this Hamiltonian,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:46.690
this state by phase e
to the i chi of t here,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.870
and a time dependent phase,
the Hamiltonian wouldn't care.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.060
It would cancel.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.570
So these states are
just not very unique.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.760
Now, the more important thing
I want to say about them,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.800
they are the beginning
of our explicit analysis,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:13.390
is that do these psi's of t's
solve the Schrodinger equation?

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.850
Are these the solutions of
the Schrodinger equation?

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.050
We've found the
instantaneous eigen-- so

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.380
are these solutions of
the Schrodinger equation?

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.620
Is that what it means to solve
the Schrodinger equation?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.660
I hear no.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.870
That's true.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.220
Not at all.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.300
These are auxiliary states.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.490
They don't quite solve
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.470
And we'll try to use them to
solve the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.360
That's what we're
going to try to do.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.870
So let's try to appreciate that.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.450
This are psi's of t.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.250
Now, my notation is going
to be a little delicate.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.700
Here is your
Schrodinger equation.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.870
The only difference
is that thing here.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.350
Now, we're suppressing
all spatial dependent.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.560
The Hamiltonian might
depend on x and p,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.100
and the wave function may
depend on x and p, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.060
x and other things,
and spin, other things

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.440
will just suppress them.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.760
So this is the equation
we're trying to solve.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.490
This is the real equation
that we're trying to solve.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.090
And if you just
plug the top thing

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.940
and try to see if that
solves that equation,

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.690
you will find it
very quickly doesn't

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.070
solve this equation at all.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.430
The left hand side,
if you plugged

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.900
in there will appear a psi dot.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.890
If you thought psi of
t solves this equation,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.600
you will have a psi dot, and
here you will have an energy,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.560
and what is supposed to be
a psi dot, it's not obvious.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.000
It just doesn't solve it.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.450
So on the other hand,
we can try to inspire

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.390
ourselves to solve it this way.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.800
You will write in ansatz.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.460
So we'll put a psi of t.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.240
We'll try to build our
solution by putting

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.049
maybe the kind of
thing that you usually

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.750
put for an energy eigenstate.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.049
When you have an
energy eigenstate,

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:44.159
you would put an e to
the minus i et over h bar

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.300
to solve the
Schrodinger equation.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.050
So let's do the same thing here.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:09:01.860
Let's put on top of the psi
of t an e to the minus i

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.960
over h bar energy.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.120
But the energy depends on time
so, actually, the clever thing

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.990
to try to put here
is an integral

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:19.890
of the energy of time,
dt prime, up to t,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.810
because the main
thing of that phase

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.270
is that its derivative
should be the energy.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.620
So that should help.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.700
So maybe this is
almost a solution

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.130
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.320
But that may not be the case,
so let's put just in case

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.310
here, a c of t that
maybe we will need it

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.570
in order to solve the
Schrodinger equation.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:50.410
So our idea is OK, we're
given those instantaneous

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.810
eigenstates, and let's
use them to get a solution

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.220
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.860
Of course, if we
found that this is

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.940
a solution of the
Schrodinger equation,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.960
we would have found that
with some modification,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.240
the instantaneous eigenstates
produce solutions.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.340
And that would be very nice.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.770
We will find,
essentially, that that's

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.470
true in the adiabatic
approximation.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:26.250
So let's do this calculation,
which is important and gives us

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.740
our first sight of
the adiabatic result.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.350
So here is the psi of t.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.840
Now let's substitute into
the Schrodinger equation.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.150
So I have the left
hand side is left

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:49.800
hand side is i h bar dt
t of this psi would be--

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.760
first, I differentiate the c.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:01.290
So c dot e to the minus i
h bar integral to t E dt

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.192
prime, psi of t.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:18.470
Plus-- now I differentiate
this exponent, i h bar.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.415
So I'm sorry, I
have i h bar here.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.890
When I differentiate
this exponent,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.560
the i's cancel with the signs.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:34.910
The h bar cancels.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.090
I get an E evaluated at t.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.060
I'm differentiating with
respect to time here.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.980
So I get here, nicely, E of
t times the [? Hall ?] wave

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.540
function again, psi of t.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:57.215
And then, finally, I get
plus i h bar c of t--

00:12:08.052 --> 00:12:14.690
i h bar c of t times the
exponent and the time

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:29.130
derivative of psi minus i
over h bar t E dt prime times

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.600
psi of t dot.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.145
So that is the dot of the state.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.640
You can differentiate the state,
means evaluating the state at t

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.060
plus epsilon minus [INAUDIBLE]
t divide by epsilon.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.890
So we'll write it as
this psi dot in there.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.790
So what do we get here.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:08.690
Let's see the right hand
side, right hand side

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:17.430
is H on the state
and H on the state

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:22.920
comes here and ignores this
factor, ignores these factors.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.490
Our time dependent factors
come here and produces

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.920
a factor of e of t.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:39.270
So H on psi of t is just
E of t times psi of t.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.465
So what happens, left hand
side equal to right hand side.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.980
This term cancels with this.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.970
This is nice.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.200
That's what the energy and
the instantaneous states

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.460
should have done.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.890
But we're left with two
more terms that then cancel.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.240
These two terms.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.110
c dot is related to psi dot.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:15.570
So indeed, there's no obvious
way of generating a solution,

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.140
because there is a term in the
Schrodinger equation with psi

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.960
dot that must be
canceled or properly

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.430
taken care of by c dot here.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.870
So what is the
equation that we have?

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:36.620
We have this first term, but
the second term should be 0.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.900
So it's a simple equation.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:44.350
You can cancel
everything basically.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.870
The phase can be canceled
the i H can be canceled.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:59.810
So we get c dot of
t times psi of t

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:05.360
is equal to minus c
of t times psi dot.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.390
That's what we have to solve.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.960
OK, we have to solve that.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.280
Let's see how it goes.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.540
Let's see.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.560
OK, let's try to
solve this equation

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:51.390
by sandwiching psi of t,
one of those instantaneous

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:54.450
eigenstates from the left.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.490
So what do we get here?

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.530
Well, this is just a function.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.380
It just doesn't care,
and psi is supposed

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.450
to be normalized state.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.410
Maybe I should have said, these
are instantaneous eigenstates,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:19.850
and psi of t, psi
of t is equal to 1.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.620
They're normalized at
every instant of time.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.090
That should not be
difficult to implement.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:35.130
So we get here c dot
of t equals minus c

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:43.710
of t psi of t, psi dot of t.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.270
That's the kind of
differential equation.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.260
It just doesn't look
that bad at all.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.790
In fact, it's one of those
differential equations

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.830
you can solve.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:02.340
And the answer is c
of t is equal to e

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:14.739
to the minus 0 to t psi of t
prime, psi dot of t prime, dt

00:17:14.739 --> 00:17:15.239
prime.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.150
And that's the answer.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.910
In fact, take the
derivative, and you

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.540
see this is an
equation of the form f

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:32.360
dot is equal to a
function of time times f.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.390
This is solved by integration.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.370
That's what it is.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.416
Yes.

00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:42.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is the base?

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.780
PROFESSOR: We will see that.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.050
That's my next point.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.540
We have here a c of t,
and we have an integral.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.990
Now, it looks decaying,
but it's actually a phase.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.950
Let's see that.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:07.535
So I want to understand
what is psi, psi dot.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:18.710
I claim that this quantity,
in fact, is purely imaginary.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.860
Let's see why.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.850
What is this thing?

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:37.470
This is an overlap intuitively
over x of psi of x and t star

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.806
d dt of psi of x and t.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.700
And this, this is
a dv x integral.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.880
It's a vector
integral in general.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.030
I don't have to put
arrows, I think.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:16.930
I have d dt of psi star psi
minus the psi star dt psi.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:22.530
This is just a little bit
like pre-integration by parts,

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:30.880
is just saying a db
is d of ab minus b da.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.890
That's an identity.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:39.450
Now the first term, it's a d
dt of an integral, so over x.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.870
So the d dt goes out.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.470
And you have the integral
over x of psi star psi.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.300
That's the first star.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:56.630
And the second term
is minus the integral

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:02.890
of dx of d psi star psi.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:12.920
But I will write it as psi d
dt of psi star here with a star

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.510
there.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.790
Lots of stars.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.480
Sorry.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.520
Can you see that?

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.070
The first term they
took out the derivative.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.910
The second term,
the sign is out,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:29.540
and you have the
psi star times psi,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.590
but that's a complex conjugate
of that other integral.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.930
The integral over space is 1.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.790
So this is 0.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:50.680
So this is equal to
minus psi, psi dot star.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.970
That thing in
parentheses is psi dot.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:03.210
So what did you show that
this complex number is minus

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.810
its complex conjugate?

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:10.485
So that thing is indeed a
purely imaginary number.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.080
OK, so we're almost there.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.840
So let's write this nicely.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.200
What did we find?

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.560
Psi of t is equal--

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.520
the psi of t, it's c
of t times this phase.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.800
So I'll put first
this phase here.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.370
I'll call it c of 0 here.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:50.470
I ignored it before, but
I could have put it here.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.360
I don't have to put it--

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.910
there's no need for it.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:03.110
e to the minus i over h bar, the
integral from 0 to t of e of t

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.230
prime dt prime.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.700
That's it.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.980
And then, I have this
factor, this c of t

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.040
that I have to include.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.620
So let's put that
phase here, too.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:25.030
It's e to the-- this minus is
coming in to replace it by an i

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.060
with another i in here.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.620
Why would you do that?

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.600
Well, it's good
notation actually,

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:40.480
psi, psi dot of t
prime, dt prime.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.460
And all that multiplying,
the instantaneous eigenstate.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.760
You see, this thing,
this i in front

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.090
is telling you that if
you're using good notation,

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.540
that this quantity
is a pure phase.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.800
And indeed, it's a pure phase,
because this thing is already

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.390
known to be imaginary.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.360
So with an i, this is
real, and with this i,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.580
this is a pure phase.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.380
So it's just notation.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.370
So here it is.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.300
We did it.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:31.190
But I must say, we made
a very serious mistake,

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:39.790
and I want to know if you can
identify where was our mistake.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.490
Let's give a little
turn to somebody else

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.110
to see where is the mistake,
and then you have your go.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:52.660
Anybody wants to say
what is the mistake.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.790
the mistake is so serious
that I don't really

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.052
have the right to--

00:23:58.052 --> 00:24:00.420
look, if I didn't
make a mistake,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.730
I've done something
unbelievable.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.910
I found the solution of
the Schrodinger equation

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.840
using the instantaneous
eigenstate.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.900
I took the instantaneous
eigenstate,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.250
and now I've built the solution
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:21.730
That is an
unbelievable statement.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.280
It would show that
you will remain

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.580
in the instantaneous
eigenstate forever,

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.770
and I never used slow variation.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.400
So this would be an exact state.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.810
This better be wrong.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.100
This cannot be right.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.975
It cannot be that you always
remain the same eigenstate.

00:24:39.975 --> 00:24:40.475
Yes.

00:24:40.475 --> 00:24:43.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.110
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.200
There's going to be a
problem with that equation.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.870
We did a little mistake here.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.980
Well, we didn't do a mistake,
but we didn't do our full job.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.380
Remember in
perturbation theory when

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.640
you had to find the first order
of correction to the state,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.370
you put from the left a state
in the original subspace.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.000
You put the state
outside sub space.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.400
Here we dotted with psi of t.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.270
But we have to dot with every
state in the Hilbert space

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.380
to make sure we have a solution.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.300
If you have a vector equation,
you cannot just dot with

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.820
something and say,
OK, I solved it.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:32.580
You might have solved the x
component of the equation.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.300
So we really did not
solve this equation.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.790
So we made a serious
mistake in doing this.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:46.640
But the good thing is that
this is not a bad mistake

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.890
in the sense of learning.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.500
The only thing I
have to say here

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.800
is that this is
approximately true

00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:01.890
when the changes are the
adiabatic, if the change is

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:02.780
adiabatic.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.400
And that is what
we're going to justify

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.430
next time with another
detailed analysis of this.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.860
So we did a good effort
to find an exact solution

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.370
of the Schrodinger
equation, and we came close.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.770
And this is a pretty
good approximation.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.890
This is the statement of
the adiabatic theorem.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:30.450
You pretty much follow the
instantaneous eigenstate up

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:36.160
to a dynamical phase
and up to a Berry phase.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.090
But this is not an exact
solution of the Schrodinger

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.670
equation, and in
some cases, there

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.630
will be transitions
between those instantaneous

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.780
eigenstates.
