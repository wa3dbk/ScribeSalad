00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.115
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:05.460
We have this, so let's complete
the Einstein discussion.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.640
And that's practical
formulas that

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.550
are relevant to some
of the exercises

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.980
you will find in homework.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:30.130
So when we set up the rates
in Einstein's argument,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.000
we said that for
spontaneous emission,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.530
Einstein's spontaneous emission,
he put a rate that was--

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.560
he said the number
of transitions

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.980
that occur due to
spontaneous emission

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.350
is proportional to
the number of atoms,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.630
Nb, the number of
photons present,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.710
times some coefficient
that I don't know, Bab.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.670
That's how the rate of
atoms changing and going

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.780
from the top level
to the low level was.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.560
But this is the one per atom.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.070
This is the transition
rate per atom, multiplied

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.700
by the number of atoms present
in the top level gave you

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.030
the rate for
spontaneous emission.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.780
This quantity is the one that
is equal to that omega ab.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.180
So this is equal to
omega ba, like this.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.710
Therefore, if you compare
the Bab of Einstein,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.610
it's all except the
U. So Bab is 4 pi

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.785
squared over 3h squared
dab vector squared.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.759
So Einstein could not
do that because he

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.620
didn't have quantum theory.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.070
But we do, and we now can
calculate from first principles

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.210
this quantity in an
atomic transition.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.630
And the other good thing
was that even though there

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:39.050
was a rate for
spontaneous emission,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.710
that rate was fixed
by Einstein's argument

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.340
to be h bar omega ba
cubed over pi c cubed Bab.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.140
So if you knew
the b coefficient,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.190
you knew the a coefficient for
spontaneous emission-- many

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.230
times were interested
in spontaneous emission.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.750
So we calculate the stimulated
emission coefficient, here,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.640
and that's given in terms
of this matrix element.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.910
We might as well give
the general formula.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.440
So you just substitute
the Bab, and now we

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:31.230
have that A is equal to 4/3
omega ba cubed over h bar

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:47.630
c cubed Bab squared
4/3 omega ba cubed.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.980
There's one h bar in the bottom.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.880
There's the c cubed.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.360
Yep.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.770
So that completes that argument.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.370
We now have combined
our development

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.470
in time dependent
perturbation theory

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.405
with a statistical
physics argument.

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.810
[INAUDIBLE] to
determine those rates.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.339
A little more is
needed if you have

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.390
to compute a practical
rate, as you will

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.820
have to do for the homework.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.200
It's just the concept
of a lifetime.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.400
And a couple of selection rules.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.750
So let me make a few
comments about it.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.180
We get, for example,
a decay rate,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.540
A. It's a rate for
spontaneous emission.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.960
You have an atom.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.460
There's a decay rate, A. So if
you have a population of atoms,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:09.298
N atoms, at t equals 0, and A
being the decay rate per atom,

00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:15.700
it means that the
number of states

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.540
that are changing in a little
time, dt, is minus A times dt--

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.200
the rate multiplied
by the time per atom--

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.090
times the number of atoms.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:38.415
So dN dt is minus AN.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.470
And the number of atoms as
a function of t go N at t

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.200
equals 0 times e
to the minus At.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.150
So since we always
call processes

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:07.290
that go e to the minus t over
tau-- tau is the lifetime.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.040
That is nothing
else than 1 over A.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.220
So you get the decay rate.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.070
It's synonymous to a lifetime.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.780
You just invert it.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.650
No big problem.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.110
Nevertheless, if
you have an object,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.690
sometimes can decay
in different ways.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.390
It can decay maybe
to one type of state,

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.430
another type of state,
a third type of state.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:47.120
So the total A might
be equal to A1 plus A2

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.520
when there are various
decay channels.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.800
You can decay-- a system can
decay from an excited state.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.850
It can go to one state to
another state to a third state.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.330
Each one contributes
a total decay rate

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.470
because a total
disappearance of those atoms

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.840
is because they either go into
one or the other or the third.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.440
So this is true that the
total decay rate is that.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.180
So this gives you a relation.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.320
The total lifetime,
which is 1 over this,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.140
is the sum of the inverses
of the partial lifetimes.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.500
So if you have a process
that can go in various ways,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.950
you may want to combine them
to get a total lifetime.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.530
So the last thing we
should say about this--

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.290
the last thing
we're going to do is

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.870
mention what happens
when you really

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.490
try to calculate these
things for hydrogen levels.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.800
You're going to have
the ability to calculate

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.200
the lifetime of an excited
state of hydrogen now.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.730
That's quite the thing,
to be able to get

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:17.880
a number that is correct up to
factors of 2 and is measurable.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:23.510
So what do you have to consider?

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:28.970
Well, the only thing
we haven't quite done

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:35.630
is computed this matrix
element of the dipole operator.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.320
You see, everything else
that could be done was done.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.660
We integrated over the
incoherent radiation,

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.130
we found the Fermi golden rule,
we have everything simplified.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.730
But still, the matrix
element is something

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.450
that you have to calculate.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.595
So there's some selection rules.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.010
Rules.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.750
And this will be
discussed in recitation.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.880
It's pretty important stuff.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.700
I'll just mention the results.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.860
It's very readable in Griffiths.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.130
And it has to do with
the matrix elements.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.980
So d is the dipole operator,
so it boils down to r.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:36.760
So if you really knew n l
prime m prime, the matrix

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:45.460
elements of nlm, if you knew
all of this, you would be done.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.020
You could calculate anything.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.580
So the question is, when
do these elements exist,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.560
and when are they nonzero?

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.670
You need them to be nonzero to
get a nonzero transition rate.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:09.400
So when do they not vanish?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.380
So the only cases these--

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.330
I'll summarize the answer--

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:24.810
are nonzero, these
can be nonzero--

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.080
there can still be accidents
and they could cancel--

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:39.530
only if delta m, the change
in m from one side to another,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:47.310
which is m prime minus m,
is either equal to 0 or plus

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.940
or minus 1.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:54.300
You cannot change that quantum
state of a system with a dipole

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.590
interaction unless m
changes at most by 1.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.910
And moreover, the one
that is quite interesting

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:11.940
as well is that delta l,
which is l prime minus l,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.870
must only be plus or minus 1.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.630
So those changes have to happen.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.150
So now you can at least get
a qualitative understanding

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.530
of the hydrogen atom stability.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.550
You have the ground
state here, 1S.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:47.530
Here is 2S, 2P, 3S, 3P, and 3D.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.940
Let's see who can go to who.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.760
Well, the ground state
cannot go anywhere.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.700
That's at the bottom.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.750
So OK.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.500
2S going to 1S.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.570
Is it possible?

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.507
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:04.090
PROFESSOR: No.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.350
Very good.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.160
It violates delta l.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.570
So this doesn't happen.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.210
So if this doesn't
happen, this 2S

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:22.130
can almost go nowhere
because it doesn't have--

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.510
it has to go by
spontaneous emission.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.790
Something has to go
to something lower,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.930
so it almost
doesn't go anywhere.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.280
So actually, it has
a long lifetime,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.790
and it can decay via two photons
or more complicated decays.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.110
And we will not consider it.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.120
But this is fairly stable.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:48.970
Now, this one, 2P,
can go here because it

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.210
can go from l equal
1 to l equal 0,

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.715
and it can change
m by some value.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.030
The 3S you would say, oh, it
cannot go here, cannot go here,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:11.060
but it can go laterally in that
direction because it can go

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.030
change l from 1 to 0.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.450
So it's a change of l,
and that is possible.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.060
The 3P can go here.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.990
And my diagram starting
to get cluttered.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.915
And it could go here as
well, all the way down.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.330
And the 3D can only go here.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.460
Cannot go up to here because
that would be l equal 2.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:51.520
So that is your diagram of
possible decays of hydrogen.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.110
And you're going to be
computing a couple of those.
