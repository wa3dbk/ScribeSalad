00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:08.270
PROFESSOR: OK, so this is the
picture you've studied so far.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:16.500
And now we will
consider the next thing.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.410
So basis states.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.660
What's going to happen?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.090
We have to deal
with basis states.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.830
We have electron spin.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.080
We have electron
angular momentum.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.420
What is the total
angular momentum?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.430
The sum of them.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.910
We will have to deal with that.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.200
So we will have to deal with
addition of angular momentum

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.730
in the hydrogen atom.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.680
It's awfully important.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740
That's the key of the matter.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.170
So let's see what we have.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.075
Let's look at our basis states.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.780
So now the spin, the
most important thing,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.270
we take it very seriously.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.120
Recall that when you
have angular momentum--

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.350
in general, we use j and m,
and those are the two quantum

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:32.170
numbers, j squared, the
angular momentum eigenvalues,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.480
h squared, l times--

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.220
j times j plus 1.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.990
And jc over h bar
has eigenvalues, m.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.840
That's a notation
for angular momentum.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.570
So we have the electron spin.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.690
So what is the notation.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.110
It's sms, and it's
always equal to 1/2,

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.889
because the electron
always has been 1/2.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.220
The electron will have many
orbital angular momentum, 0, 1,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.290
3, but spin, it
only has been 1/2.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.810
So s is always 1/2.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860
ms can be plus minus 1/2.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.015
So that's two states.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:44.930
For orbital electron,
orbital, we have l and m.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.760
Those are the names, l and
m is the quantum number.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.510
So how do we define
the uncoupled basis?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.750
The uncoupled basis
is a set of states

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.130
that enumerates the whole
spectrum of the hydrogen atom,

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.350
using those quantum numbers to
distinguish all those states.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.280
So the uncoupled basis are
those states that we have there.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.240
Uncoupled basis are
all these states,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.930
and they're described by n, and
the principal quantum number,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.000
l and m.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.290
This is the orbital.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.520
And you could say,
well, s and ms,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.770
that would be a
correct thing to do.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.550
But as we said, s is always
So copying and copying again,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.940
something that is
always the same value

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.060
and doesn't have
any new information

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.616
is not worth it, so people
don't include the s.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:04.420
And we put ms.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.420
And that's electron spin along
the z direction, electron sz.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.060
And it takes values
plus minus 1/2.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.390
So this is our uncoupled basis.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.960
For any electron
in that table, you

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.740
need to know uniquely
that electron state.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.860
You need to give me
all these numbers.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.930
You have to tell me
where I am horizontally,

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.030
after that, where I am
vertically, I'm sorry,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.730
for m, where I am horizontally
for l, within the multiplate,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.740
which is my value of m.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.610
And once you've done that,
you should tell me up or down.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.040
So all those numbers
are important.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.080
They're one to
one correspondence

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.020
to the basis state.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.740
But now, let's do
the coupled basis.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.510
That's where things
begin to get interesting.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.520
Coupled basis.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.890
So we'll consider the
total angular momentum

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.245
j, which is l plus s.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.800
When we add angular
momentum, we basically say,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.270
you know, you have states
that are representations

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.980
of orbital angular
momentum and spin.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.800
But I want you to express
those as eigenstates

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.970
of the total angular momentum.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.650
That's all adding
angular momentum means.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.420
It's recognizing that we
want to re-express our basis

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.610
states in terms of eigenstates
of the total angular momentum.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.540
It's all you do.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.600
So what do we do then?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.730
We have an l multiplate.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.150
What does an l multiple mean?

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.080
That's a set of
vectors, a vector space.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.760
And we tensor it with
a spin multiplate,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:31.010
and the result is equal
to the sum of j multiplate

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.030
because your states are nothing
else but tensor products

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.880
of these things, even
though we never wrote it

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.490
in the way of tensor product.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.800
Basically, the wave
function has some expression

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.780
having to do with
l and m in here

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.090
and has some value of the spin.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.180
So a given state has
all these properties.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.240
A given state lives
in the tensor product,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.995
and we want to write it
the sum of j multiplate.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:14.770
So I want to say a couple
more things about this.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.320
When we do addition
of angular momentum,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.510
what happens to the
quantum numbers?

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.820
That's, again,
also a thing that's

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.830
sometimes a little subtle,
and I want to emphasize it.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:33.200
So an l multiple it is
described by l and m.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:43.940
A spin multiplate is
defined by s and ms.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:53.950
But when you have a j
mulitplate, you have j and j--

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.041
how do they call it?

00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:57.540
jm.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.710
I think they call it.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:03.520
Yeah, jm.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.775
But actually, you
have a little more.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:17.850
I claim that the states--

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.180
so this is what I'm
meaning my this.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.720
These states have two quantum
numbers you can specify.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.700
You cannot specify any more.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.540
This is the z component of l,
and you cannot specify the x

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.650
or the y component.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.130
Here is all you can
specify of these states.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.789
You certainly can
specify the value of j,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:44.010
and the value of jm, the m
component, the z component

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.100
of j, but can you specify more?

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.350
And the answer is yes.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.070
You can specify a little more.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.660
You can actually specify
here all the states in here

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:07.330
are eigenstates of l,
of s, of j, and of jm.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.680
So you add two more.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:19.730
This may sound a little
funny, but every state here

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.370
had the same l eigenvalues.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.470
They were, for
example l equal 3.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.990
So all the states
have l equal 3.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:33.370
All the states are eigenstates
of l squared, eigenstates.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.190
All these states here are
l squared eigenstates,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:42.270
and all the states here
are s squared eigenstates

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.870
with the same eigenvalues.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.610
So if you multiply them,
and you rearrange them,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.750
because that's all this
addition of angular momentum

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.620
is is just rearranging
the states,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.700
you still have that all
the states that are here

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.330
have the same l squared
and the same s squared.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.960
So l and s are good
quantum numbers here.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:14.250
The things that are not good
quantum numbers are m and ms

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.270
are not good.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.260
They are not good quantum
numbers of this state.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:30.500
They are not
eigenstates of m or ms.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.920
So this is something you've
learned with addition

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.600
of angular momentum.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.050
If this is a little fuzzy,
it will be important

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.010
that you review it and make
sure this becomes clear.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.430
There will be [? stuffed ?]
recitation about these things,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.840
and we'll do more with it.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.680
But now, what is the application
in the hydrogen atom for this?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.370
Well, our multiplates
are multiplates

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.030
of [INAUDIBLE]
value of l that are

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.045
being tensored with spin 1/2.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.730
Orbital l, and
when you have this,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:33.240
you know that the answer is
l plus 1/2 plus l minus 1/2.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:41.215
Those are the two values of j,
j max, and j min in this case.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.640
So in the hydrogen
atom, the notation

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:57.220
is that this is the l state
with j equal l plus 1/2.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:06.440
This is the j value plus the
l state with l minus 1/2.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.720
So this is the capital L
we were mentioning before,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.620
in this case L of l.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.630
And our notation is evolving.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.700
This is the spectroscopic
notation in which we

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.200
will describe states by an nLj.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.410
So that's the
spectroscopic notation.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.910
You put the principal quantum
number, the capital L,

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:43.340
that is for L equals 0, put
an s, a p, a d, and the number

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.300
which is the value of j here.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.420
So let's look at
our spectrum again.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.730
We have to do that.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.370
It's an important thing.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:13:00.100
So we'll do three cases
here, n equal 1, n equals 2,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.865
and n equals 3.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:07.030
We have l equals 0, l
equal 1, l equals 2.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:17.000
And that's s, p, and
D. OK, let's begin.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.920
This state, ground state,
what is the ground state?

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.400
It's l equals 0, tensor with
1/2 for the ground state.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.760
This is just the state 1/2.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.870
So it will be a state
with j equal 1/2.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:44.080
So it should be written as
n, which is a 1, the capital

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.120
L, which is 0.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.250
So it's s and the j value 1/2.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.060
That's the state.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.630
1s 1/2.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.820
Go here.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.080
Well, that's still l equals 0.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.620
So this product source is
2s 1/2, and here is 3s 1/2.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.300
That's the name
of the multiplates

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.190
in the coupled basis.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:16.480
What do we have here?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.550
We have l equals 1.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:32.660
So with l equals 1,
we have 1 tensor 1/2.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:38.090
So we will get j
equals 3/2 and 1/2.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.765
So we must have 2.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.360
What is the value of l?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.000
Remember, the value
of l is preserved.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.240
So if this was l equals 1,
after you do the tensor product,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.120
l is still a good
quantum number.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:07.290
So you have 2p 3/2, and 2p 1/2.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:18.500
Here, you would have two
states, 3p 3/2 and 3p 1/2.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.790
Finally, here l
equals 2, you have

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:33.640
2 tensor 1/2 is 5/2 plus 3/2.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:43.140
So you would have
3D 5/2 and 3D 3/2.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.850
Those are your states.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.640
This is the notation
we will use.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.890
So what is the uncouple
basis at the end of the day?

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.620
The uncoupled basis is n.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.720
You still have n.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.940
What is the coupled basis now?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.550
We have the uncoupled
basis being this.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.910
The coupled basis is still n.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.730
Still l.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.240
We said l carries through.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.200
Still s would carry through,
but we don't have it there.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.720
Now I cannot put m.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.360
m is no good when [INAUDIBLE],,
but I have j and jm.

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:40.665
So these are your coupled
basis states, coupled basis.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.570
And it's represented in
this notation, the n,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.860
the little l is representative
for whatever letter is here,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.550
the j is here, and well,
the jm is not said,

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:00.210
but that's a multiplate.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.470
OK, so we've rewritten the
stating the couple basis,

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.710
because we will need
those states in order

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.700
to do perturbations theory.
