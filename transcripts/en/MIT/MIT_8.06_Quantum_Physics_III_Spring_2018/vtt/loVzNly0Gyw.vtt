00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:00.820
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's try to solve this.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.810
So my classical approximation is
about solving these equations.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.600
So let's see what we get.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.455
Well, the first equation
is kind of simple.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.190
I think everybody has the
temptation there to just take

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.170
the square root, and
that's what we should do,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.970
s0 prime is equal to
plus minus p of x.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:54.200
And therefore s0 of x is equal
to plus/minus the integral up

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.775
to x of p of x prime dx prime.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.630
You see p of x is
pretty much known.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.990
If you know the energy
of your particle,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.680
then it's completely known,
and it depends on e minus v.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.310
So this is a solution
in terms of p of x.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.420
We should think of solving
the differential equation

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.390
in terms of p of x.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.450
Now, as a first order
differential equation,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.340
there's a constant
of integration.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
And we'll pick it up to
be a number here, x0.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.150
So we start integrating
from some place.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.040
If you integrate
from another place,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.710
you're shifting the
constant of integration.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.230
The main thing is
that the x derivative

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.650
here acts as the upper
limit and gives you

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.770
the p of x of that equation.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.260
So this is our solution.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.580
Even the plus minus
should not disturb us.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.280
If you have the p
squared, you don't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.440
know if the particle is moving
to the left or to the right.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.720
So that ambiguity is
perfectly reasonable.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.470
Particle can be moving to
the left or to the right.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.630
Now, we look at the
second equation.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.828
So s1 prime is
equal to i over 2.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:25.910
s0 double prime, if you
have s0 double prime,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.360
you have here s0 prime, so
you take another derivative.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.520
So that's a plus minus p prime
of x divided by s0 prime,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.940
which is plus minus p of x.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.300
That's kind of nice.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.690
The sine is going to cancel.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.500
So we have here i over 2 p
prime of x over p of x or i

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.800
over 2 logarithm
of p of x prime.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.360
The derivative of the logarithm
is 1 over the function,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.200
and then by chain rule,
you get the p prime there.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.550
So if s1, the prime
derivative is the derivative

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.000
of this thing, so
s1 is going to be

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.550
i over 2 log of p of
x plus a constant.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.670
So let's reconstruct
our solution.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.970
That's not hard.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.610
We wrote the answers up there.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.230
So the wave function is e
to the i over h bar times s,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.210
and s is what we had there.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:11.860
So our wave function is
e to the i over h bar s,

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.315
and s was s0 plus
i plus h bar is 1.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.350
There's more.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.980
Is it right?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.840
But we're going to ignore it.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.160
We didn't go that far.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.970
In fact, nobody goes higher
in the WKB approximation.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.535
So what do we have here?

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.160
I'll write it.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.310
This term is kind
of interesting.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:58.860
We have e to the i h bar
of x times e to the i s1.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:08.190
And s1 was i over 2 log
of p of x plus a constant.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:21.450
So look at this items
i is minus 1, 2.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.140
So you have 1/2.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:35.130
This becomes e to the minus
1/2 logarithm of b of x.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.950
And 1/2 the logarithm
of b of x is

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.400
e to the minus log of square
root of b of x, and when you go

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.410
like that e to minus that
is 1 over the function.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:06:01.680
So p of x like that, and then
we have e to the i over h

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.920
bar integral from x0 to
x p of x prime dx prime.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:28.860
This is the classic WKB
approximation, classic result.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:37.110
So as promised, this is of the
form of a scale factor here,

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.050
a rho, the square root
of rho times a phase.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.060
So we did begin with what
looked like a pure phase,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.510
but then we said s of
x is complicit in fact.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.390
s0 was real, but
s1 was imaginary.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:04.140
With s1 imaginary, the rho of
s1 was to provide the magnitude.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.480
And this is an intuition,
this approximation scheme.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.830
The first thing you have
to get right is the phase.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.920
Once you get the phase
right, the next order,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.740
you get the amplitude
of the wave right.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.250
That comes to second order.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.340
That's a next effect.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.910
So this is our solution.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.640
When I began today,
I reminded you

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.350
that we have WKB solutions of
the form square root of rho

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:43.900
e to the is, and we calculated
some things for that.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.580
So because of the
signs, s0, I dropped

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.620
the sign, this plus or minus.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:59.180
Let me write the
general solutions of WKB

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.250
slightly more complete.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.420
Let's be more complete.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.980
It's important to see
the whole freedom here.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:17.240
So if we have e greater
than v, remember

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.790
when e is greater than v, the
p of x is a real quantity.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:31.200
And we wrote, and
we said that p of x

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.190
we would write as h bar k of x.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:43.332
You know, I think I should have
probably, for convenience here,

00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:44.290
let's put the constant.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.970
We're not attempting to
normalize these wave functions.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.980
We could not attempt
to do it, because we

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.350
don't know what p of x is.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.150
And this function may
have limited validity

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.700
as we've spoken.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.250
But I had the constants here.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.180
This constant could have
a real or imaginary part.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.110
It would affect this a.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.360
So let's put it there.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.480
OK.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.370
So if p of x is hk of x, we can
have the following solutions,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:24.930
psi of x and t equal a, another
constant, square root of p--

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.140
let's go simpler--
square root of k.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.456
It's a different a.

00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:38.310
And here, e to the i, since
p is h bar, it cancels here.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.920
So we have a simpler
integral as well,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.920
x0 to x, k of x prime, dx prime.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.900
So that's that term.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.670
I just use the
opportunity to replace p

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.460
for k, which
simplifies your life,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.100
simplifies all these constants.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.560
So the other solution
is the wave moving

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.030
in a different direction.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:10.870
So k of x, e to the
minus i x0 to x,

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.100
k of x prime v of x prime.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:24.190
So that is your solution when
you have e greater than v.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:31.990
If we have e less than v,
we still have a solution,

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:39.190
and we said that p
of x, in that case,

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:47.120
would be equal to
i h bar kappa of x.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.280
We use that notation.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.460
If e is less than v, this
is a negative number.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.580
So p of x is i times
some positive number

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.200
and square root of
a positive number.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.170
And we called it
kappa last time.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.450
So this is the
letter we usually use

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.610
for spatial
dependence in regions

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.680
where the wave function
decays exponentially,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.410
which is what it's
going to happen here.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:27.730
So what is the psi of x and
t is equal to a constant c

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:35.061
over square root of
kappa of x e to the--

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.440
the i will disappear,
and there will

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.650
be two solutions, one
with plus, one with minus.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.640
That's the reason I don't have
to be very careful in saying

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.810
whether this is i or minus i.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.570
There's, anyway, two solutions.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.120
At this stage, we
don't need to worry.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:12:00.060
So this is from x0 to x,
kappa of x prime, dx prime,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:08.590
plus d over square root of
kappa of x, e to the minus x0

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.005
to x, kappa of x
prime, dx prime.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.315
So this is the complete
solution of WKB.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:27.250
If you are in the classically
allowed region top

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.910
or in the classically
forbidden region,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:36.580
it's important to realize that
this function, the second term

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.300
is the decaying exponential.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:45.580
As x increases, the integral
accumulates more and more

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:51.340
value, and the wave function
gets more and more suppressed.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.890
This is a growing
kind of exponential.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.200
In the previous
iteration in your life,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.150
kappa was a constant, if
you had constant potentials.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.440
And this would be e to
the kappa x basically.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.810
But here, you must
think of kappa

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.160
being some positive
number, positive function,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.700
as you integrate and x grows,
your cube-- the integral

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.940
becomes bigger.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.000
And this is a
growing exponential.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.720
So the sign tells you that,
especially because we've

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.790
ordered the limits properly.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.700
So we have a decaying
and growing exponential.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.850
At this moment,
we're pretty much

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:48.290
done with what WKB does for you.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.740
Although, we have a few
things still to say.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.330
So this will be in
terms of comments

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:05.680
about the general validity
of such approximation,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.180
but first even some comments
about the current and charge

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.850
density.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.760
So let's consider
this equation I.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:25.090
Let's just make the comments,
comments for equation I on one.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.260
What is the charge density
or the probability density

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:39.170
in this case, rho
would be psi squared,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:46.525
and in case one, is equal
to a squared over k of x?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.770
You could, if you wish, this
is a perfectly nice formula,

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:59.730
multiply it by h
bar up and down.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.300
And that's the momentum.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:08.240
So it's h bar a
squared over p of x.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:14.146
And you could say
this is h bar over m

00:15:14.146 --> 00:15:20.210
a squared over v of x,
a local velocity, p of x

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.720
is m over a local velocity.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.180
And this is an intuition
you've had for a long time.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:32.830
The probability density or
the amplitude of the wave

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.190
is going to become
bigger in the regions

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.540
where the particle
has smaller velocity.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.510
That's the regions of
the potential where

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.630
the particle spends
more time, and it's

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.990
an intuition that almost
immediately comes here.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.600
This k is essentially
the momentum.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.750
So that's essentially the
square root of the velocity.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.460
And this coefficient,
therefore, becomes bigger,

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.670
as the velocity is smaller.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.240
That's part of the intuition
you've had for a long time,

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.810
regarding these quantities.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.240
The other piece
is the computation

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:18.430
of the current from this
equation I. Remember,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.800
the current is h bar over
m times the imaginary part

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.160
of psi star gradient psi.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.730
So it's a long computation.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.760
But we did it for the
case we had before.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:40.030
We said that the current
is rho times gradient of s

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.060
over m for the case when
the wave function is

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.690
written in rho e to the s form.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.240
So in here, rho is
already determined

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.700
is a squared over k of x.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:04.576
We have the 1 over m,
and the gradient of s--

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:10.880
s is this quantity, e
to the i h bar times s.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:19.009
So the gradient of s is just
p of x, so h bar k of x.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.014
Now, they cancel.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.520
And it's very fast.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.390
They cancel.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:38.470
Would have been a major
disaster if they didn't.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.090
This is a number.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.210
It's a squared over m.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.520
The reason it cancels is
that it would have failed

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.920
the conservation law otherwise.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.910
The rho dt plus the
divergence of j should be 0.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:12.920
In our case, rho has
no time dependence.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.620
The wave function that
we are considering,

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.520
our time independent
Schrodinger equations,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.680
we're considering
energy eigenstates.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.030
And the current
must be a constant.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.260
In an energy eigenstate, the
current cannot be a spatially

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.800
varying constant, because then
the current would accumulate

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.180
in some place, and that's
inconsistent with stationary

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:38.990
states.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:45.560
And in fact, this is 0, and
the versions of j in this case

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:52.370
would be dj dx, and if it would
have had some x dependence,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.340
it would have destroyed
this equation.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:00.690
So dj dx is also 0, and
that's all consistent.
