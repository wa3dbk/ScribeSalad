00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.900
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
write this e to the ikz

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.770
somewhat differently so that
you appreciate more what it is.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.600
So e to the ikz, I'll write it
as square root of 4 pi over k.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.090
You say, where does
that k come from?

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.960
We'll see in a second.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:38.060
Sum over l, square root of
2l plus 1, i to the l, yl0,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.770
1 over 2i.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.790
Basically what I'm going
to do is I'm expanding

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.800
this jl function for large x.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.350
So I'm going to
take this equation

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.120
and I'm going to expand it so
that the argument is large,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.880
which means r is large.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.630
I want to describe for
you those waves that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.560
are really going on here.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.960
So since the argument is
kr and you have a kr here,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
that's the origin of the k
that I pulled out in here.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.900
And then you have e to the i
kr minus l pi over 2 over r,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:34.510
minus e to the minus i kr
minus l pi over 2 over r.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.110
And this is valid for
r much bigger than a.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.190
It's an approximate thing,
because we approximated

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.450
the Bessel function.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.130
This is exact.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.360
This equation is
exact for all r.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.460
But that equation, now, is not.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.570
That equation is
showing you that you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:18.140
have here an outgoing wave
because is e to the i kr times

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.560
e to the minus i et,
the energy terms time.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.450
So that's an outgoing wave.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.090
This is an ongoing wave.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.160
So this is ingoing
and this is outgoing.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.840
So I'm going to say
a couple of things

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.100
about this that are going
to play some role later.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.660
It's a series of comments.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:05.100
Because this is a particular
expansion and due to the fact

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.150
that this is a
general expansion,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.310
you could say that this
is an approximate solution

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.070
of the Schrodinger
equation far away.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.820
But in fact, each
term, each value of l

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.660
is an approximate solution.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.840
This is not an
approximate solution

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.130
because we added over
many ls and somehow they

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.840
helped to create an
approximate solution.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.230
This is an approximate
solution because each l

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.280
is an approximate solution,
because to get a solution,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.370
you could have said
l is equal to 50,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.390
and that's all that
I'm going to use,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.810
and that's an exact solution.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.240
And therefore when
I look far away

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.210
it will look like
that with l equal 50,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.720
and that would be an
approximate solution that can

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.080
be extended to a full solution.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.380
So each l term here is
actually independent.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.420
If you tell me a wave
looks like that far away, I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.630
would say good,
yes, that's possible

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.940
and that comes from a solution.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.040
You're getting an
approximate solution.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.360
And you could make it exact
by turning the exponentials

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.770
into Bessel functions.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.580
Even more, we will show--

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.820
we'll discuss it
a little later--

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.440
I could get a solution that
is approximate by considering

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.260
either this wave or that wave.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.330
Suppose we just have
the outgoing wave.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.490
The fact that the
Schrodinger equation

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.370
works for this one
approximately doesn't

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.360
require the ingoing wave.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.220
The Schrodinger equation doesn't
mix, really, the ingoing waves

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.840
and the outgoing waves.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.590
It keeps them separate.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.300
So this is an
approximate solution

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.840
and this is an approximate
solution as well.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.380
Every term here, independently,
every l and every ingoing

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.880
and every outgoing wave is
a good approximate solution

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.250
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.610
Now this is important to
emphasize because this

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.500
is called partial wave.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:54.330
So the term partial wave,
waves, refers to the various l's

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.560
that work independently.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.300
Now to motivate what
we're going to do,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.020
I'm going to go back to
the case of one dimension

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.740
so that you need the
map to orient yourself

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.140
in the argument we're
going to do now.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.580
So in order to
understand partial waves

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.200
and how they work, let's think
about the one-dimensional case

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.980
for a minute.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.650
I used to do that in 804.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.940
I don't know if that has been
done by other instructors,

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.210
but we've done in
804 that stuff.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.950
So let me tell you about it
and how it works in that case.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:59.750
So this is an aside
1D case of scattering.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.970
So in scattering
in one dimension,

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.040
one usually puts a hard
wall at x equals 0.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:15.046
There is some potential
up to x equals a,

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:17.930
and then there's nothing.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.400
It's a finite range potential.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.520
So even in the case of d equals
1, you look for a solution

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.180
when there is no potential.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.080
This is the v of x.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.070
This is the x-axis.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.100
If v is equal to 0, you
would have a solution.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:54.137
Phi of x would be a
solution, energy eigenstate,

00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:58.170
and would be sine of kx.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.750
This is the analog of our e
to the ikz, that we call it,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.790
phi of r.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:14.850
Here you have a phi of x,
which is the sine of kx,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.680
and it's your energy eigenstate.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.500
That's the solution
if v is equal to 0.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.060
If v is equal to 0, the wave
must vanish at the hard wall,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.530
at x equals 0.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.720
So that's your solution.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.480
On the other hand--

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:41.190
or, well, we can also write it
as 1 over 2i e to the ikx minus

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.870
e to the minus ikx.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.550
And this wave is
the incoming wave,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.600
and this is the outgoing wave.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.530
Very analogous to
above, because this x

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.050
is defined to be positive
and plays the role of radius.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:12.690
In this problem, incoming
means going down in x.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.550
Incoming in spherical dimensions
means going down in r.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.120
So we're doing something
very analogous.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.930
That's why the study of
scattering in one dimension

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.410
is a good preparation for
the study of scattering

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.580
in three dimensions.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.820
So you have an incoming
wave and an outgoing wave,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.960
also because, again, there's an
e to the minus iet over h bar.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.760
So here it is.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.460
What we try to do is to
write a scattering solution

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.730
corresponding to
the same physics--

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:59.660
so the scattering solution, psi
of x, is the full solution--

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:08.810
is going to have the
same incoming wave

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.080
because that's the physics that
we're trying to understand.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.750
We put the same incoming wave
and we try to see what happens.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.700
That's what do we do
when we do scattering.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.000
So if we want to compare
our solution to the case

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.070
when v is equal to 0, we
put the same incoming wave.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.720
But then solving the
scattering problem

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:49.760
means finding the outgoing wave,
which now may be different.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.700
Because, sadly, when
you have a potential,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.800
you have something in, that you
have control what you send in,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.380
but you have no
control what comes out.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.560
That's solving the
scattering problem.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.070
So the thing that
you have here must

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:17.490
be an outgoing wave, e to
the ikx, with the same energy

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.320
because energy is conserved.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.830
We're talking about an
energy eigenstate anyway,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.990
so it must have the
same energy, and it

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.760
must have the same probability
flux as the incoming wave.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.630
So the magnitude of this wave
and the magnitude of this wave

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.600
must be the same.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.100
It almost seems that you'd have
to write the same thing that I

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.840
wrote here, but no.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.830
I can add one more
little factor.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:56.210
It's conventionally
written as 2i delta of k.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:04.760
A phase shift, delta of k,
an extra phase, and that's

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.390
the claim.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.630
That's the whole thing.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.330
You have to solve
what's going on here.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:19.190
But outside-- and this is only
valid for x greater than a--

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.570
outside, where the
potential is zero,

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.960
you must have the
solution is of this form.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.980
Here, this is for 0
potential everywhere.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.170
So this was valid everywhere,
but in particular is also

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.960
valid for x greater
than a, and here we

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.310
compare these two things.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.030
So this is the general
solution for scattering here.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:56.180
And now we can also
add another definition.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.720
We can say that
psi of x is going

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.600
to be equal to phi of x
plus the scattered wave.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:14.360
Our intuition is
that this wave here

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:22.280
has the same incoming component
as the reference wave,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.450
but nevertheless, it has the
different outgoing component

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.570
and that's the scattered wave.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:35.840
It is exactly analogous
to what we did here,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.750
in which we have the total
wave being a reference

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.000
incoming wave.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.710
Well, actually, incoming
and outgoing wave.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.360
The e to the ikz has
incoming and outgoing wave

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.740
and needs a solution when
the potential is equal to 0,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.160
just like this one, this phi.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.020
So psi is equal to 5
plus scattering wave.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.750
Here it is the scattering wave.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:16.010
It's purely outgoing, because
the incoming part is already

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.420
taken care of.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.770
So completely analogous thing.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.940
So let's solve for the
scattered wave here.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.980
The scatter wave.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.120
So in this equation,
we have 1 over 2i,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:46.620
e to the ikx plus 2i delta
k, minus e to the minus ikx

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:55.980
is equal to 1 over 21, e to the
ikx minus e to the minus ikx

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.220
plus psi s of x.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.820
Well, these two terms cancel.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.140
It is the fact that they are
ingoing waves are the same.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.840
And then I can
subtract this other two

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:19.290
to find psi s is
equal to 1 over 2i.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.740
I can factor the e to the ikx.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.580
That tells me it's
an outgoing wave.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:33.030
And then I have e to
the 2i delta k minus 1.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.370
That's a term there.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.990
I think I got everything there.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.790
It's written--
I'll write it here,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.980
there's a little bit of space--

00:15:45.980 --> 00:16:03.790
psi s as e to the ikx, e to
the i delta k, sine of delta k.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:15.190
I factor out 1 times i
delta k, so this becomes

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:20.740
e to the i delta k minus e to
the minus i delta k, the form

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:26.410
together with a 2i in
front, a sign of delta k.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:32.920
So this is your
outgoing scattered wave.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.030
That's the shape of the
outgoing scattered wave

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.460
in terms of the phase shift.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:48.610
OK, so now we have to redo
this in the slightly more

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.900
complicated case of three
dimensions and get it right.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.250
So that is our task.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.040
That's what we have to
figure out how to do.
