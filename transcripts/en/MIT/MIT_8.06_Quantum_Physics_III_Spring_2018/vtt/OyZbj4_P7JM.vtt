00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.450
PROFESSOR: Today, let's catch up
with what we were doing before.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
And last time, we were talking
about hydrogen ionization.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.420
And we went through
a whole discussion

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.400
of how it would happen.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.290
It was ionized
because there would

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.040
be an electromagnetic wave
within the hydrogen atom.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.210
The initial state was the ground
state of the hydrogen atom.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
The final state
was a plane wave.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.119
Our main work was computing
this matrix element,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.720
and that's what
we did last time.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.240
It took us some
work, because there

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.280
is a spatial integral here that
was quite complicated, given

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.010
the various directions
that are going on.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.880
But that was our result.
Here is the formula.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.650
And a few things
to notice here were

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.110
that there's an angle
theta that we recognized

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.100
as the angle between the
electric field polarization

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.890
and the momentum
of the electron.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.000
So k is the momentum
of the electron,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.190
and when k doesn't
have a narrow,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.780
it's the magnitude of
the electron momentum.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.490
As any k-- well, it's a little
bit of an exaggeration. h bar k

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.760
is a momentum.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.790
But we understand when we
say that k's a momentum.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.030
k times a, it has
no units, which

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.350
is appropriate of the
units of this quantity,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.510
our units of energy.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.750
And then another
quantity here, E naught,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.160
is the magnitude of the electric
field defined by this formula,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.450
with a 2 E naught here.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.150
We discussed that the photon
had to have an energy that it

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.300
was not supposed
to be too big, so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.900
that the wavelength
of the photon

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.300
would be smaller,
or much smaller

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.720
than the atom, in which
case the spatial dependence

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.880
of the electromagnetic
field would be relevant.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.300
So for simplicity,
with took photons

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.210
not to be too energetic.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.380
And we also took photons
to be energetic enough

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.740
that, when they would
ionize the atom,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.230
the electron that would go
out would not be too affected

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
by the cooling potential, and
we could treat it like a plane

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.830
wave to a good approximation--

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.900
a free plane wave.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.750
Otherwise, you would have to
use more complicated plane

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.320
waves associated
with a hydrogen atom.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.710
So under this
ranges, these ranges

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.315
translate to this ranges for
the momentum of the electron.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.900
And if the-- as required,
the energy of the photon

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.120
is significantly bigger than a
Rydberg, which is the 13.6 eV.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.420
This is like 10
Rydbergs in here.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.960
Then the momentum
of the electron

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.650
is given by this formula
to a good approximation.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.780
It's essentially the
energy of the photon, then

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.230
the square root of that.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.720
The last ingredient
in our computation

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.740
is the density of states.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.060
This was calculated also
a couple of weeks ago,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.570
so you have to keep track
of some formulas here.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.030
There's some formulas that
they're a little complicated,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.630
but we'll have to box them
and just be ready to use them,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.580
or to spend five minutes
really writing them.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.850
And this was the
formula for the density

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.060
of states with some energy
E. With that energy E,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.390
these were free
plane wave states.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.140
Energy E, momentum k associated
with E, and being shot

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.160
into some solid angle in space.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.750
And this is the solid angle.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.180
So I wrote it as a
solid angle in here.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.100
So this is basically where
we stood and, at this moment,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.170
we want to complete
the discussion

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.600
and get a simple expression,
and simplify it, and get what

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.600
we need to have for the ray.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.050
So, if you remember,
Fermi's golden rule

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.990
expresses a rate
omega in terms of 2

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:55.760
pi over h bar, rho parenthesis
E, times Hfi squared.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.240
So that's Fermi's golden rule.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.820
And this is what
we want to apply.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.560
Well, we've calculated
the matrix element.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.890
This would be Hfi prime here.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.600
That's what we have up there.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.920
We have rho.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.970
We have this quantity, 2 pi
over h bar is just a constant.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.330
So we can simply plug
this here, square that.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.550
There's lots of
h bars and things

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.770
that I don't think
you'll benefit

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.850
if I go through them
in front of your eyes.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.750
So I'll write the answer.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.880
But in writing the
answer, remember

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.970
this rho is a differential,
in some sense.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.060
Some people might
put you in a d rho

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.490
here, because
there is a d omega.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.600
So think of this,
when I substitute rho,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.620
I have the d omega,
and I think of this

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.420
as the d w, a little rate.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.810
So dw, d omega.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.940
So I simply pass from
w to I called it dw,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.620
and substituted the
rho here for d omega.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.310
And here is what we get--

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:22.400
256 over pi, e E naught
a naught squared over

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.690
h bar, m a naught squared
over h bar squared,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:37.480
k a naught cubed over 1
plus k a naught squared

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:44.640
to the 6th, and
cosine squared theta.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.850
OK, it's still a
little complicated.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.040
But it's mainly complicated
because of constants

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.500
that have been grouped
in the best possible way,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.810
in my opinion, to make
it understandable.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.925
This is an energy.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.280
And this is an h bar.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.990
This is actually a Rydberg
with a factor of 2.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.650
So in a second, you
can see that this thing

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.400
has units of 1 over time.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.070
There's also an
important factor here,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.840
and that's an intuitively
interesting fact,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.170
that the emission
of the electron

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.420
is preferentially
in the direction

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.120
that the electric
field is polarized.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.240
There's a cosine squared theta.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.760
There's no electrons
emitted orthogonally

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.260
to the electric field.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.200
And that's kind of intuitive.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.630
It's almost like the
electric field is shaking,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.310
the electron, well,
it kicks it out.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:09.080
OK, this is a differential rate.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:16.840
So the total rate w is the
integral of this differential

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.400
rate over solid angle.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.970
And for that, you need
to know that the integral

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:33.715
over solid angle of cosine
squared theta is 4 pi.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.770
If you didn't have
the cosine squared,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.630
you would have the 4 pi.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.520
But usually cosine squared,
this is multiplied by 1/3.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.790
You can do the calculation.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.570
It just doesn't
take any real time.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.100
But many people remember
this by thinking

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.970
of the sphere, or planet Earth.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.630
Cosine squared theta is
large near the North Pole.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.710
It's large near the South Pole.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.480
That doesn't amount to much.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.340
As opposed to sine
squared theta,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.690
which is large all over
the big equatorial region.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.950
So it's a little bigger, and
it turns out cosine squared,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.380
the average over
the sphere is 1/3.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.250
And sine squared, the average
over the sphere is 2/3.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.040
Well, it's kind of not
a bad thing to know,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.580
because it saves you a minute
or two from doing this integral.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:45.130
And now, I'm also going to
apply something that basically--

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.120
you know, a formula sometimes
gives you more things

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.270
than you should really trust.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:57.640
And I would say here, this 1
is not to be trusted basically,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.350
because k a naught must
be significantly bigger

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.530
than this number probably
for this to be accurate.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:11.230
So under most circumstances,
this 1 is not worth it.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.870
In fact, if you
calculate this thing

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.320
using different approximations,
people sometimes

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.940
don't get this 1.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.130
And you may see that in books.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.010
So let's ignore this 1.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:35.560
And then this answer is 512 over
3 e E naught a naught squared,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:44.650
over h bar Rydberg, 1 over
k a naught to the 9th.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.770
Pretty high power.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.610
And the answer starts
to be reasonably simple.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.870
This 9 arises because
of 12 minus 3 here.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.970
This is still
probably not ideal,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.060
if you want to play intuition
about what's going on,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.040
and the scale of the effects.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.570
You know, once you
have a formula,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.060
and you've worked
so hard to get it--

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.110
this calculation is
doing it reliably

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.660
is a couple of hours of work--

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.170
and you might as
well manipulate it

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.430
and try to make it
look reasonably nice.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.680
And this is what people
that do atomic physics

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.670
do with this rate.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.420
So they write it in
the following way.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:44.050
Again, a short calculation
to get this 256 over 3.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.120
And they put in atomic
units, Ep over E star--

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.670
I will explain what
these numbers are--

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:59.475
squared, 1 over t star, 1
over k a naught to the 9th.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.020
I think it's important to notice
as well that you could say, OK,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:14.510
so how did the photon
energy, or photon frequency,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.450
affect this result?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.320
Well, actually, the
photon omega doesn't

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.660
seem to be anywhere here.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.720
It has disappeared.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.670
But it is implicit in
the electron momentum,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.970
because basically the
momentum of the electron

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:38.180
is what is obtained from using
the energy of the photon.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.740
It ionizes the electron,
liberates electron, and then

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.330
gives it some kinetic energy.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:50.130
And, roughly, k equals like
the square root of omega.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.090
So there is an omega
dependence here.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.330
Now, what are these
other quantities?

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.050
These quantities are simple.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:05.805
Ep is the peak electric field.

00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:13.600
It's peak electric in the
wave that you've sent in.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.580
So it's 2 E naught.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:23.310
E star is the atomic
electric field.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.210
And that's defined
as the electric field

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.800
that the proton creates
at the electron.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.430
So it's equal to E
over a 0 squared.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.346
That's the definition.

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:47.410
Or, if you want, in
terms of Rydbergs,

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:58.000
2 Rydbergs over E a naught,
and it's about 5.14 times 10

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.405
to the 11 volts per meter.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.215
So it's a nice quantity.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.750
It's in the land you're
comparing your electric field

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:19.260
from your laser to the typical
electric field in the atom.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.850
And that ratio is meaningful.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:31.230
And then t star is the
time the electron takes

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.770
to travel a distance a naught.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.380
So it's a naught
over the velocity

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.670
of the electron, which is
roughly the fine structure

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.800
constant times c.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.590
You remember the
electron roughly

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.410
has a beta parameter
equal to 1 over 137.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.540
This is [INAUDIBLE]
alpha equal beta,

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.270
meaning the fine structure
constant in alpha

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.420
is the beta of the electron.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.530
So this is t star.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.850
And it's actually two
Rydbergs over h bar,

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.405
and it's 2.42 times 10
to the minus 17 seconds.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.400
That's the time the electron,
which is not moving that fast,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.480
takes to move a Bohr radius.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.900
So this is the last
form we'll take.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.360
Atomic physics
books would consider

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.215
that the best way to describe
the physics of the problem.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:53.200
And this is really all we're
going to say about ionization.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:58.510
It's kind of a precursor of
field theory calculations

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.470
you will do soon--

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:07.660
not in 806-- in which
you do reasonably

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.550
complicated calculations, matrix
elements, Feynman diagrams.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.120
And, at the end of the day,
by the time you're all done,

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.220
the answer simplifies to
something rather reasonable,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.090
and not complicated.
