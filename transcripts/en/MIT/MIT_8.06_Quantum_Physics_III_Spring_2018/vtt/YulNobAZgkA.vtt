00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:07.760
PROFESSOR: So
atom-light interactions.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.560
So we will focus just on
the electric field, E field.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.890
Magnetic field effects are
suppressed by the velocity

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.570
of the electrons divided by c.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.480
And that you know is the
fine-structure constant.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.570
So magnetic field
effects are suppressed.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.522
Ignore magnetic v
over c corrections.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.330
With v over c,
again, of the order

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.980
of the fine-structure constant.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.560
We will also think of
typically optical frequencies.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.610
Lambda in the optical range.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.990
So from about 4,000
to 8,000 angstroms.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.520
And that's much,
much bigger than a 0,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.680
which is about 0.5 angstrom.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.930
So that's good for
our approximation.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.570
That the wave is
relatively constant,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.700
being the wavelength
so large it's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.100
constant over the
extent of the atom.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.790
So we will think of
the electric field

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.990
of the atom, E at the atom.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.729
Our electric field, a bit of
notation, will depend on time

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.250
and it will be a real function
of time times a unit vector

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.320
to begin with.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.230
This will get more
interesting because we're

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.530
going to be dealing
with thermal radiation.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.900
So eventually, this
vector, n, will be pointing

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.400
and we will average
it over all directions

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.840
because thermal radiation
comes with all polarizations

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.170
and in all directions.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.736
So there will be a little bit
of averaging necessary for that.

00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:50.480
That will happen next time as
we wrap up this discussion.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.210
So this picture is of
an atom sitting here.

00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:06.570
And in particular, its
electron, which is the particle

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.530
that reacts the most
in the electric field.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.260
And there is a unit vector, n.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.850
And there's E of t here.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.110
So the electric
field, E of t, is

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.900
2 E not in our conventions
cosine omega 3 times

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.980
the vector, n.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:45.050
So what is the vector on
the scalar potential r, t.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.900
It's minus r times E of t.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.940
This is the formula
that gives you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.800
E as minus the gradient of phi.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.640
This formula is not true in
the presence of magnetic fields

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.300
in general.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.780
There is a time derivative
of the vector potential.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.080
But again, we're ignoring
magnetic effects.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.840
So this is good enough for us.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.420
If you take the gradient
of this formula,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.570
the only r dependence is here.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.760
There's no r dependence
in this electric field.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.520
And in particular, we consider
the wavelengths to be very big.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.740
And this is good enough.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.760
So what is the
perturbing Hamiltonian

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.140
due to the coupling
of the electric field

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.930
to the charged particle?

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.310
And we'll say atom, and we'll
put an electron or something,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.280
and we'll say the charge is q.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.930
Eventually it will be
minus E for the electron.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.080
But let's keep it at q.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.480
Delta H is q times
phi of r and t.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:18.870
So this is minus q times
r times E of t vector.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:31.200
Or minus q times r
times n times E of t.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.270
So so far, simple things.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.040
We're just considering
the electric field and how

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.950
it adds on a charged particle.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.170
This is, of course,
the simplest situation.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.320
We will be considering in
this course soon, in fact,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.020
starting next lecture,
the general interaction

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.200
of charged particles with
electromagnetic fields.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.690
But for the time being
and in this approximation,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.180
this is enough.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.150
And we will define
now a dipole operator.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.550
It's something that you
should keep in mind.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.540
It's the usual thing
when you define

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.040
dipoles is you sum or integrate
over charges times position

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.420
vectors.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.040
So this is a dipole operator.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.670
And I emphasized the
operator because of the r.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.110
When you have matrix elements,
transitions between states,

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.160
everything will have to
deal with those matrix

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.600
elements of r.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.710
And that's why we'll
have a dipole term there.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.235
So delta H at this
moment has become what?

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.245
Minus the dipole times
the electric field.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.520
So let's do this.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.510
Minus the dipole.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.620
I'll do it here.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.770
Minus the dipole dotted
with electric field.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.690
Vector.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:40.450
Or minus d dot n with
2 times the magnitude

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.990
of the electric field.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:51.820
Or minus v dot n times 2
E not cosine of omega t.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.570
Factors of 2 keep
us busy always.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.460
And we have to get them right.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.070
Remember when we did our
definition of perturbed

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.930
Hamiltonian we said that delta
H was going to be equal to 2H

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.200
prime cosine of omega t.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.630
And our transition,
amplitudes, and everything

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.990
were written in
terms of H prime.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.600
So this was our definition.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.850
So at this moment, we
can isolate H prime here.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.590
So H prime is everything
except for the 2

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.400
and the cosine of omega t.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.054
So H prime, for our
problem of atoms

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:46.190
interacting with
electromagnetic fields,

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.510
is a dipole interaction.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.010
And it's given by this
nice simple formula.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:59.700
That's our kind of
important end result.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.610
So if we have this
Hamiltonian, we

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:18.180
have calculated the probability
for transitions, for example,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.050
from b to a, as a
function of time.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.050
When we have a
harmonic perturbation

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.340
coupled to a two level
system, we have a probability.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.870
We don't have yet a rate.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.180
We just have a probability.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.290
And this is equal to the
other one, to the reverse one.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:51.450
It's 4Hab prime squared
over h squared sine squared

00:09:51.450 --> 00:10:01.500
of omega ba minus omega over
2 t over omega ba minus omega

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.480
squared.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.520
That was the formula we had.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.010
In our case now, H
prime ab is that.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.350
So we'll get the following.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.650
4 E0 squared.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.890
The E0 factor here goes out.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.700
And then we will have
the matrix elements

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.870
of the dipole operator, d.n ab.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:36.240
So it will all be matter
of the dipole operator.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.580
H squared.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.000
And these same factors.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.230
Sine squared omega ba
minus omega over 2T

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:52.420
over omega ba minus
omega squared.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.200
So this is the
transition probability.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.120
We don't have a rate.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.970
But the rate will come when we
integrate over all the photons

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.800
that contribute to this process.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.690
And we'll get an exact
analog of Fermi golden rule.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.230
So that will be next time.
