00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.490
PROFESSOR: We have now expressed
in terms of the energy density

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.890
on this mode omega
I the contribution

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.310
to the transition amplitude.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.120
The fact that all these
modes act incoherently

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.890
means that each one has a shot
in producing the transition.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.210
And the probabilities
now must be added.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.560
So the way to sum probabilities
now is the following.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.240
If you have a sum over I of this
frequency sum I of some energy

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.370
density u of I times
any function of omega I,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.900
you can replace it by
an integral d omega.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.480
Instead of little omega
I's that you're summing,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.470
you now integrate
over omega the energy

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.695
density of your radiation field
times the function of omega.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.510
So instead of having
a sum of these things,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.020
you now integrate over
a continuous variable.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.550
And this represents the
energy density in the range.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.680
This whole thing is
the energy density

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.120
in the range d omega,
which is in that range d

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.430
omega, the energy range.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.460
The energy density is the
sum of the energy densities

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.700
of each of the contributions.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.640
So that's what we're going to
do here to express and to get

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.770
our transition amplitude.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:57.270
So we'll say that we have
the sum over I of Pab I of t

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:14.810
equals 8 pi over h squared
integral u of omega d omega dab

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:26.990
and omega sine squared of
1/2 omega ba minus omega t.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.830
So all the omega I's
have become omegas.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.650
That's the variable
of integration.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.480
And this is information
about your radiation field.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.690
If it's a black body radiation,
we gave the formula last time.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.850
So this is your
transition amplitude.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.030
And we have to try
to do the integral.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.590
This one I that remained here.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960
So what do we have to do now?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.320
Well, is it, again, the
kind of useful story?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.440
We know that this factor
from Fermi's golden rule

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.390
tends to say, basically, you
get only the contribution

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.260
from omegas equal to omega ba.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.110
So whatever else is
being integrated,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.510
nothing varies as fast as this.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.010
And you can take it out of
the integral approximating

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.290
omega for omega ba.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.000
So that is a little
more delicate here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.630
So I'll just write
an equality here.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.850
So it's 8 pi over h squared.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:53.110
I'll take the u at omega ba out
of the integral, this factor.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.690
And I want to take
this one out as well.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.370
But this one is a little funny.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.280
As I change the omega,
the polarization

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.340
of this electric field is going
to come in all directions.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.630
It's going to come at random.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.100
So even for a given
frequency omega,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.400
there might be many
modes of frequency omega

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.570
that are coming at the particle
at different directions.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.060
And that's exactly
what I would expect

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.940
for thermal radiation,
which is truly

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.080
the case we're doing here,
incoherence superposition

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.200
of light.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.630
So when I have this, and
I integrate over omegas,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.885
the various omegas,
even for a given omega,

00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:52.020
there might be many
lines that correspond

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.650
to just a different direction.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.990
Because the field comes
in all directions.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.630
So the interpretation is
that we can take this out,

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.380
but we must do an average
over all directions of omega.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:19.900
So this factor will
go out as dab dot n.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:31.990
But here, we will average
over all directions of n.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.658
And it's a square here.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.550
So this is important because the
field comes in all directions.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.840
We've taken care of this.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.430
Then, finally, we
have the integral,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:03.500
the omega of the sine squared
function a minus omega.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.530
All right.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.415
So a couple of things
still remain to be done.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.030
One thing that I don't think
we need to do explicitly

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.400
again is this integral.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.900
We've done it a couple of times.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.160
You do a change of variables.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.160
The t will go out
linearly, and this

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.880
becomes an integral of sine
squared over x squared,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.520
which is equal to pi.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.060
And so this integral has
been done a couple of times.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:58.030
Let me just write the answer to
this thing is 1/2 t times pi.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.860
It's linear in t.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.690
That we've observed.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.320
And it's pretty important
that it's linear in t

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.790
because that means that
the probability-- you know,

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.310
we've been writing this thing--
the probability of transition

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.660
is linear in time.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.280
Therefore, you
can divide by time

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.370
to get that rate of transition.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.300
So we're almost there.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.540
Let's put this together.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.370
We have this is the sum of P's.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.680
And there's this t there.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:43.330
So the transition
rate, W from b to a

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.850
is this probability
divided by time.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:52.720
So it's going to
cancel this time.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.630
Then the 2 is going to give a 4.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.390
The pi is going to
give a pi squared.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.020
There's going to
be an h squared.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:08.770
There's going to be this
factor dab dot n squared.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.160
And there's going to
be the u of omega ba.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.340
So this is going to be the rate.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.970
We've divided by t, the previous
result. And there we have it.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.820
We're almost finished
with the calculation.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.930
The rate is here.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:37.480
The only difficulty
here is this average,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.169
but it is not complicated,
in fact, doing this average.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.200
It's actually kind of simple.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.540
So let's do it.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.920
So what is it?

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.740
It's all the matter of
writing things properly here.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:10.600
There's the average
of dab dot n squared.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:24.760
So this is the average of dab
dot n complex conjugate times

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.950
dab dot n.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.100
So it's good to do this
thing because, actually, you

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.760
have to face as to what
these symbols really mean.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:46.510
dab is a vector with
complex components.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.420
Electric field is a vector,
but it has real components.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.880
dab is a vector.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.200
Why is it a vector?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.920
Because it has a
vector index here.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:03.010
It really came from this
operator over there d is qr.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.500
So it's x, y, and z.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.760
And each one has matrix
elements between states a and b.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.640
And with matrix elements
between states a

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.900
and b that are complex
wave functions,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.770
this can be complex numbers.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.860
So in general, this dab
is a complex vector.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.110
And the star is necessary here.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.970
So, this is a number.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.140
This, however, is a number.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.020
And I took the number star
times the number and average.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.410
So the dot products
can be written as sums.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.750
So I'll put here a sum
over I and a sum over j.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:56.960
dab, the ith component
times ni, the ith component.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.800
Here, this should be star.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.510
And that's the sum over i
is the first dot product.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:12.415
dabj and j, the sum over j
is the second dot product.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.520
These d's are numbers, so
they don't have anything

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.620
to do with the average
that we're doing

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.280
over different directions.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:40.110
So we have i and j of
di ab star dj ab times

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.350
the average of ni nj.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.380
This average, if you wish,
you could simply do it.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.690
If you don't want to
use symmetry arguments

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.560
to do an average like
that, you take a vector,

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.620
parameterize it
with theta and phi

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.740
and just do the integral
over solid angle.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.380
And divide by 4 pi.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.360
This should give
you the same answer.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.470
If you're uncomfortable with
what we're going to say now,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.870
you should do that
because that average just

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.860
means take the vector
n, integrate it

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:26.150
over all directions, all
solid angles, and average.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:33.810
So what is this ni nj?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.570
I claim this thing
is 1/3 delta ij.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.020
And it's based on
the following idea,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:49.670
that the average
between nx and ny,

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.940
by the time you integrate
over the sphere, is 0.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.740
The average of off diagonal
things don't have averages.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.520
nx with nx, however,
would have an average

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.350
because it's always positive.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.010
ny with ny would have an average
because it's always positive.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.250
And nz with nz would
have an average.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.880
And each one of these
three would be the same

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.550
because there's no real
difference between the x, y,

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.440
and z directions.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.110
And therefore, you
have three things.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.610
And at the end of the day,
this average of nx and x

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:31.190
plus ny and y plus nz
and z is this average

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.170
of n squared, which
is equal to 1.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.520
So it should be equal to 1.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:43.520
So that each one of these
nx, nx, or ny, ny, or nz, nz

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.750
must add up to a total of 1.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.740
Therefore, this is the 1/3.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.900
So that's what this is.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:56.350
And if you find
this a little funny,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.660
you should do the integral and
then think about this argument

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.500
again.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.390
So anyway, that's the answer.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.440
And therefore, we get 1/3.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.830
And the delta ij
establishes a dot product

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.150
between these two things.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:19.470
So this is dab vector star
dotted with the dab vector.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.340
This is a vector complex
conjugated because we said

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.070
the components can be complex.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.380
So that's the answer.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.860
And most people like
to just simply write it

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.620
as dab vector squared like that.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.410
But this is not just the
vector dotted with itself.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:44.590
It's a vector dotted with
its complex conjugate.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.810
So with this number, the
whole formula is now finished.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.010
This is the final form.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.680
The rate for
spontaneous transition

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.690
triggered by
electromagnetic fields,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.060
an incoherent superposition
of electromagnetic fields

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.450
is 4 pi squared.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.570
We get the 1/3 here
over 3h squared.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:20.810
dab vector squared u omega ba.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:35.570
And it's a transition
rate per atom.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.800
We've considered a single atom.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.880
So it's transition
rate per atom.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.930
All right.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:56.350
Long derivation, but a
lot of physics in it.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.050
A transition between
discrete state

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.490
got convoluted with an
integral of the stimuli

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.760
as it comes in and produce
a nice result in the style

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.360
of Fermi's golden rule.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:17.870
Griffiths called that
Fermi golden rule.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.420
He works with Si units.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.860
And there's epsilon zeros
and different numbers of pi's

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.370
there.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.920
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.770
With checked.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:35.920
This is consistent, and we
can't do much about that.
