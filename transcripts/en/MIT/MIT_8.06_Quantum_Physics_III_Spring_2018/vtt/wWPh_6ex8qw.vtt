00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.080
PROFESSOR: Today, we have to
discuss harmonic perturbations.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.700
So we've done Fermi's golden
rule for constant transitions.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.950
We saw transitions from a
discrete state to a continuum.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.470
And by integrating
over the continuum,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.460
we found a nice rule,
Fermi's golden rule,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.510
that govern the transition
rate for this process.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.020
So the only thing we
have to do different

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.620
now is consider the case
that the perturbation is not

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.230
just a step that gets
up and stays there,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.830
but it has a
frequency dependence.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.100
So that will bring a
couple of novel features.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.520
But at the end of the
day, as we will see,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.560
our Fermi's golden rule is
going to look pretty similar

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.930
to the original
Fermi's golden rule.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.580
A nice application of
Fermi's golden rule

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.550
is the calculation of the
ionization rate for hydrogen,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.010
in which you take
a hydrogen atom,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.820
you put it in an electric
field or send a light wave,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.350
and then suddenly the
electron and the hydrogen atom

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.870
from the ground state ionizes.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.530
And we can compute already--
we have the technology

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.460
to compute the ionization rate.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.740
That's a pretty
physical quantity.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.990
And that will be an example
we'll develop today.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.050
Those rates have
the funny situation

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.380
that the calculation
can be somewhat

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.930
involved and interesting.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.230
And the answers, generally,
by the time you simplify them,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.650
are pretty simple
and pretty nice.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.730
So it's a good idea.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.550
You have to have patience
with those calculations

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.150
to simplify it till the end,
and that's pretty instructive.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.270
So we begin with
harmonic perturbations.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.160
So we did constant
perturbations already.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.389
So now harmonic perturbations.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.160
So our situation is
that in which age H of t

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.230
is equal to a known
Hamiltonian plus delta H of t.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.620
And this time, delta H
of t is conventionally

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.900
written as 2 H
prime cosine omega t

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.930
for some t between t0
and 0, and 0 otherwise.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.220
All of us wonder why the 2 here.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.940
One reason for it-- it's
all convention, of course.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.410
You have your perturbation,
and what you call E H prime

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.010
or what you call 2 H
prime is your choice.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.120
But this 2 has the
advantage that when

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.560
you describe the cosine
in terms of exponentials--

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.480
e to the i omega t plus e to the
minus i omega t-- the over 2,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.620
it cancels this one.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.100
And that makes Fermi's golden
rule, that will follow also

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.820
and will be valid for
these perturbations,

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.840
take exactly the
same form as it did

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.030
for the case of
constant perturbation.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.450
So it's fairly convenient to
put that 2, and we'll put it in.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.830
Some books don't, and then they
have different looking formulas

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.190
for Fermi golden rule
depending to which case you're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.300
talking about.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.050
Of course, when we mean that
this is the time dependence,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.490
we are implying that H
prime is time independent.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.190
Because the time
dependence is this one.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.000
That's what we're
interested in considering.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.720
Of course-- this has
been asked sometimes--

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.500
H prime can depend on all
kinds of other thing-- position

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.170
coordinates, some
other quantities.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.960
But we're focusing on time
here, so we'll leave it there.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.030
Moreover, for reasons
of convention,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.480
just let's always thing
of omega as positive.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.690
It wouldn't make a difference
if it would be negative here

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.210
with the cosine function, but
let's just set by convention

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.590
that omega is positive.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.340
Finally, we're going
to do transitions again

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.220
from an initial
to a final state.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.080
So we will consider
the case when

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.440
we go from an initial
state to a final state.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.650
And therefore, we will
work in this language

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.610
with this constant
coefficients Cn's, these

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.190
coefficients that multiply
the states in psi tilde.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:22.180
Psi tilde is equal to
Cn n of t, sum over n.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.930
And these Cn's,
at time equals 0,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:38.090
will be equal to delta ni,
which means that they are all 0

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.500
except when we're talking
about Ci at 0 is equal to 1

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.040
because we start with
an initial state.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.770
We had a general formula for
the transition coefficient.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.702
And Cm of 1 at time equal t--

00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:03.130
or I'll put t0--

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:09.270
is equal to sum over n,
integral from 0 to t0 e

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:22.550
to the i omega mn t prime, delta
H mn of t prime over i h bar,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.110
Cn at time equals 0, dt prime.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.880
This was our general formula
for transition coefficients.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.590
The Cm's is the coefficient
or the amplitude for the state

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.190
to be found in the m
eigenstate at time t0

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.230
to first order in
perturbation theory.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.090
And it depends on
where you started on.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.830
That's why the sum over n
here with initial states.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.010
But this sum is going
to collapse because we

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.950
know we start with the state i.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.430
So when we substitute
Cn equal to this,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.410
the sum only works
when n is equal to i.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.740
So we'll put for ni's.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.640
And, of course, we're going to
also take for the final state

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.140
to be f.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:29.830
So the formula now
reads Cf 1 at t0

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:37.220
is equal to integral from 0
to t0 e to the I omega f--

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.730
m was f-- i t prime.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.250
And now the delta H. The delta
H is this whole quantity,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.610
so we have to substitute it.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.830
So 2 H prime is the only part
that has matrix elements.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.060
The cosine omega t
is just a function.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:12.825
So it's H prime fi cosine
omega t prime, and dt prime.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.455
There's the i h bar.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.150
So I think I got
everything right.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.110
The sum collapsed.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.240
mn is being replaced
by the right labels.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.580
mn here, this is the expectation
value between m and n.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.130
And that becomes
between f and i.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.620
And it affects this
whole thing, but it just

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.570
ends up affecting the
Hamiltonian H prime here.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.240
So I think we're OK.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.530
We have everything there.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:01.560
And Hfi, of course, doesn't
have time dependence.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.900
So we said H prime has
no time dependence.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.440
So that thing can go
out of the integral.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.410
So this will go out.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.890
And the integral is simple
because you have now

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:24.200
Hfi prime over i h bar.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.470
And the 2, we leave
it for the cosine.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.370
So we get two integrals.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:42.100
t0 e to the i omega fi
plus omega t prime--

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.520
from the first exponential
in the cosine--

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:52.930
plus an e to the i omega
fi minus omega t prime--

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.570
from the second
exponential in cosine--

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.400
dt prime.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.830
Well, that's very nice.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.630
This is all doable.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.480
The Hfi doesn't
give us any trouble.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.500
It's a constant.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.660
It's out of the integral.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.300
It's all pretty nice and simple.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.840
So we can do these
two integrals.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.790
They're integrals
of exponentials,

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.900
so it's just an exponential
divided by those coefficients.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:27.860
So I'll just do it and
evaluated it between t0 and 0.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.120
So what do we get?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:37.230
Minus i Hfi prime over
h bar, e to the i omega

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:48.530
fi plus omega t0, minus 1,
over omega fi plus omega.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.440
You can imagine that
e to the i omega

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.710
t integrates to e to the
i omega t over omega.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.430
So that's why that works.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.620
And the two limits are t0 and 0.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:13.540
Plus e to the i omega fi
minus omega t0, minus 1

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:20.080
again, over omega
fi minus omega.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.170
Great.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.470
Our integral is there.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:24.070
It's done.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.730
And now it's time to
appreciate what it tells us,

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.745
because it tells us something
very important, this formula.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.270
So you look at this
and you say, well, OK.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:50.290
This is the transition
amplitude to state omega--

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.810
I'm sorry-- state
f, final state.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.670
And it depends on omega fi.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:09.150
And omega fi just Ef
minus Ei over h bar.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.830
So if I know my final
discrete state Ef,

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:18.440
I can figure out what is
the transition probability.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.750
Now, these denominators are
intriguing because maybe

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.580
if you adjust the
frequency omega--

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.770
suppose you have an initial
state and a final state here.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.660
You may adjust the frequency
omega to match them,

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:43.650
and in that case maybe make
the denominators equal to 0.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:49.960
And that's exactly what
kind of happens here.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.110
So, first of all, if you
look at this expression,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:59.850
it's a sum of two terms that are
added together and multiplied

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.560
by a constant.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.850
As t0 really goes
to 0, completely

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.100
goes to 0, t0, each
factor, actually,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.090
if you see the Taylor
expansion of the exponential,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.990
you cancel the 1 and you
then cancel the linear term

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.410
with the denominator.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.420
This is just i t0.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.440
And this is also i t0.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.980
So they're comparable as
time is really going to 0.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.670
But time going to 0 is
never of interest for us.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.120
For us, we need to be
the time a little big

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.180
already so that
our calculations,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:50.160
as we did in the constant
transitions that had lobes that

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.730
decreases constants over t0--

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.640
we needed the time to
be sufficiently large

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.400
so that the lobes are narrow.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.870
And that, we could guarantee.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.180
So t0 going to 0 is
not very interesting.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.200
We need t0 a little bigger.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.550
Not too big that the
rate of a process

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.640
overwhelms the probability.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.800
But we need a little big.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.610
So, in that case,
the numerators are

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.450
going to be bounded numbers.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.580
You see, you have an
exponential minus 1.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.630
So that varies from--

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:34.570
the magnitude of this thing
varies from 2 to 0, basically.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.400
In fact, in these
numerators, you

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.680
can see, if the phase is 0
for some particular value--

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.020
if the exponential has a phase
that's proportional to 2 pi,

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.090
this is 0.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.500
And then sometimes this
exponential is minus 1,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.820
so it gets to minus 2.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.610
So it's finite.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.890
And the same is here.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:59.710
So these are bounded numerators.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.040
On the other hand, you
may have the possibility

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.400
that these things become 0.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.460
And those are the cases
that are of interest to us,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.500
the cases when those
terms are going to be 0.
