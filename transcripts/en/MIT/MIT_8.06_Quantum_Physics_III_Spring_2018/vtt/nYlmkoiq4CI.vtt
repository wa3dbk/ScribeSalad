00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.880
PROFESSOR: It's not unsuspected,
because in some sense, energy

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.230
eigenvalues, what you need,
the first order energy's then

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.220
split the state.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.880
The hope is that the second
order energy split the states,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.130
so that's why you have
to go to second order.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.400
So going to second order
is something we had to do.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.410
There was no hope to do this
before we go to second order.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.730
So let's go to second order,
and order lambda squared.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.160
And we put n0l state in.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.770
The left hand side,
happily, is 0.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:03.010
So we have n0l from the right
hand side, en1 minus delta h

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.130
psi 1.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.340
But again, psi 1 has two
pieces, a piece in the space

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.550
we had that we just calculated
plus a piece in the space of v

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:34.740
tilde n and 1 minus
delta h psi 1 vn

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.840
plus the energy, which
would be en2 in here.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.030
And we hit with n0l,
so we pick an al0.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.390
OK, that doesn't
look that terrible.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.190
I don't know if you agree,
but it really doesn't.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.440
Especially because a
few things are gone.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.390
This term is zero.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.639
Why?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.280
Because state in the
degenerate subspace orthogonal

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.025
or to v hat.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.060
Here I want to remind
you of what we did.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.190
We did a long
computation to explain

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.360
that even though delta h is
only diagonal in the degenerate

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.850
subspace, when you
have a state here

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.950
in the degenerate subspace,
you can let delta h think of it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.660
as acting as an eigenvalue.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.890
But that's a great
thing, because if this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.970
acts as an eigenvalue, this is
the first order of correction.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.120
But all the first order of
corrections are the same,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.050
so this here, delta
h and this, is

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.650
going to give the same
as en1 on this state,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.840
and therefore this whole
state, happily, is all 0.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.560
So it's again, this delta h--

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.110
we did it with a
resolution of the identity.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.760
Hope you remember that argument.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.430
If you don't, look
at it back later.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.320
But with a resolution
of the identity,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.320
we argued that delta h,
when acting in a state of vn

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.150
on the right, you
can assume that this

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.700
is an eigenstate of it.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.370
So this whole term is zero.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.730
So now we are in pretty
good shape, in fact.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.950
The equation is not that bad.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:57.840
The equation has become
minus n0l, delta h, psi 1,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.800
on v hat plus en2 al0 equals 0.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.660
And this psi 1, we've
already calculated it there.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.050
So this is great.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.470
You see, you should
realize that at this moment

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.990
we've solve the
problem, because we're

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.260
going to get from here something
complicated acting on a 0.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.130
Because psi 1 has this
a1's, but the a1's

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.930
were given in terms of a0.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.890
So something on a
0, something on a 0,

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.970
it's going to be an
eigenvalue equation for a0,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.660
an eigenvector equation for a0.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.090
So let me just finish it.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.680
So I have to do a
little bit of algebra

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.030
with this left hand side.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:18.700
I can put here this ap1
times the p0 states there.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:30.795
So on the left it will be minus
the sum over p, n0l, delta h,

00:05:30.795 --> 00:05:47.640
p0 times ap1 plus en2 al0, 0.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.660
OK, now I just have to
copy that thing there.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.450
And I better copy
it, because we really

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.770
need to see the final
result. It's not that messy.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.345
So here it is.

00:06:07.264 --> 00:06:09.590
I'll copy this thing.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.640
I also can write
this as delta h nlp.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.840
You recognize that thing.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:30.210
So this will be the sum
over p of delta h nlp.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.300
The sine, I will
take care of it,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.900
times that thing over
there, 1 over ep0 minus en0.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.080
That's another minus sign
that cancels this sign here,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:59.843
and I have here the sum over
k equals 1 to n, delta h, pmk,

00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:10.620
ak0 plus en2 al0 equals 0.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.830
OK, so what do we do now?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.690
Just rewrite it one more time
and it will all be clear.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:34.950
So I'll write the k outside,
k big parentheses, p.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.500
For the first term I'm
going to pull the k sum out

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.330
and we'll sum over p first.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.800
So what is it?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:54.000
Delta h nlp delta h pmk.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.390
Those were the two things here.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.100
And then we have
the denominator.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.760
I'll change a sign
of the first term.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.830
I will change its sign so that
the second term looks more

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.660
like an eigenvalue.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.080
So I changed sign
here by changing

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.480
the order of things
in the denominator,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.450
and then I put minus en2.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.750
I don't have a sum
over k here, but we

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:45.360
can produce one by writing
delta kl ak0 equals 0.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.060
Look, we got our answer.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:57.900
If I call-- invent
a matrix mlk2, which

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:13.190
is precisely delta h nlp
delta h pmk over en minus ep

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.990
is sum over p.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.090
This is a-- you see, you
sum over p, n is irrelevant,

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.630
you have a matrix here in lmk.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.340
That's why we call it mlk.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.170
And therefore this
whole equation

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:44.025
is the sum from k equals 1
to n of mlk2 minus en2 ak0--

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:57.110
ml2 en2 delta lk ak0 equals 0.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:05.480
Or, if you wish, it's
just a matrix equation

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:16.220
of the form m2 minus en times
the identity on a vector

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.040
equals 0.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.100
And this is an
eigenvalue equation.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.320
So finally, here is the answer.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.640
Let's say you compute this
matrix of order lambda squared

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.690
with this perturbation
and that is the matrix

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.190
that if you diagonalize, you
find the second order energy

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.240
corrections and you
find the eigenvectors.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.000
And if you found
the eigenvectors,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.860
you found the good basis.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.800
So the problem has been
solved at this stage.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.280
You now know that if
you fail to diagonalize,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.370
to break the perturbation
of the first order,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.350
you will have to diagonalize
a second order matrix.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.400
And once you diagonalize it,
you now have the good basis,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.620
and it will happen that if
all the levels get split

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.080
at second order,
we can calculate

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.070
fairly easily the rest of the
pieces of the [? states. ?]

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.270
So we'll leave it.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.840
There you'll complete some
details, more elaborations

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.330
of that in the exercises, and
we'll go to hydrogen atom next.
