00:00:01.127 --> 00:00:01.710
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.740
Let's turn then to
the Dirac equation

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.550
and motivated, basically.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.250
Through the Dirac equation
is the simplest way

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.930
to do perturbation theory
for the hydrogen atom.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.700
It helps us derive what we
should think of perturbation.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.551
So I'll discuss that quickly.

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:40.530
And there may be some of
that done in recitation.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.140
So we're going to discuss
now the Dirac equation.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.810
So the Dirac equation
begins with the observation

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.370
that we have E squared
minus p squared

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.950
c squared for a free particle
is m squared c to the fourth.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.960
This dispersion relation that
rates E and p for any particle.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.550
So if you wanted to
describe the dynamics

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.780
of a relativistic particle,
you could say, look,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.470
the energy is the square
root of p squared c squared

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.800
plus m squared c to the fourth.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.960
Therefore, I should take the
Hamiltonian to be that thing.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.610
I should take H' to be that.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.760
And work with a
Schrodinger equation

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.850
that has this H with
the square root.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.880
Nobody does that, of course.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.420
But you can do a
little bit with it.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.830
If you notice that this is equal
to mc squared square root of 1

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.415
plus p squared over
m squared c squared.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.540
And then expand.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.910
In small velocities where
this is less than 1,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.440
you get 1 plus 1/2
p squared over m

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.480
squared c squared minus
1/8 of this term squared.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.650
So p squared p squared over m
to the fourth c to the fourth.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.640
And then what do you get?

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.710
mc squared plus
1/2 2m p squared.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.880
That's very nice.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.280
Apart from the rest
energy, you get

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.430
the p squared over 2m
that you would expect.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.270
And the next correction
is minus 18 p

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:59.930
squared p squared over m cube
c squared plus dot dot dot.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.210
You know, that's one way you
could treat the Hamiltonian.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.930
But it's very complicated.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.620
Don't treat the
Hamiltonian too seriously

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.350
because the Schrodinger
equation would

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.460
have infinite number
of spatial derivatives.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.710
p to the fourth, p to the
sixth, p to the eighth.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.890
Never going to get
that understood.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.530
But in terms of
perturbation theory,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.050
we can think of p squared over
2m, your original Hamiltonian.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.290
And here is a relativistic
correction that is small.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.430
But Dirac was puzzled
by that square root.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.180
He basically looked
at it and I think

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.950
he had sort of mathematical
inspiration in here.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.440
He looked at this equation
and that square root

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.990
and he said, how
much would I wish

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.270
I could take that square root.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.910
What can I do to take
that square root?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.610
So he said, well, I could
take that square root.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.460
This has p squared so c squared
plus m squared c to the fourth.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.700
I could take that square
root if that would

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.769
be equal to something squared.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.690
Which it's not because it's
missing the cross product

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.040
of the right amount.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.900
And it's not there.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.710
But if it would be
there, the cross product,

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.610
it would be a linear
function of p and mc squared.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.010
So he says, OK, let me put
a linear function of p.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.840
And the most general linear
function of p is obtained,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.720
I want the c squared,
so c, by doing

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.640
the dot product of a vector
with p, a constant vector.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.350
A constant vector times p is
the most general linear function

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.580
of p.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:08.990
And here I'll output another
constant, mc squared.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.120
And I hope I can
take the square root

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.970
because there will
exist some constants

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.300
and it somehow will work.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.390
As of now, it cannot work
because it's always across

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.890
product.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.930
But just follow these dots.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.290
And then alpha dot p.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.680
This is equal to c alpha
1 p1 plus c alpha 2 p2

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.110
plus c alpha 3 p3
plus beta mc squared.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.470
So let's list all the
things that should

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.380
happen for this to work out.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.496
Well, this square includes
the square of this,

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:48.120
the square of this,
the square of this,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.078
and the square of this.

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:50.530
And those are what we want.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.900
So we should have
that alpha 1 squared

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.990
is equal to alpha 2
squared is equal to alpha

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.990
3 squared is equal to beta
squared is equal to 1.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.260
If that happens, well,
this term will give you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.320
c squared p1 squared,
c squared p2 squared,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.550
c squared p3 squared, and
m squared c to the fourth,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.100
and I get everything to work.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.770
But the cross products
must also work.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.590
So for example, the cross
product of p1 with p2

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.940
should vanish.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.660
And that, well, if you
ride these two factors like

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.840
that here you would say,
oh, what they need now

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.220
is that alpha i times alpha
j plus alpha j times alpha i

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.890
should be 0 for all
i different from j.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.260
So for example, alpha 1,
alpha 2 plus alpha 2 alpha 1,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.120
when you do the
product, should vanish.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.490
And I kept the order
of these things there.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.610
When I'm starting
to think that maybe

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.830
numbers is not going to work.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.600
So i difference from j.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.050
This must happen too
for this to be equal.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.300
And moreover for
all i alpha i beta.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.990
There shouldn't be cross
products between these ones

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.830
and this term either.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.560
Plus beta alpha i is equal to 0.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.690
And that's all
that should happen.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.180
If that happens, we can
take the square root.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.370
But if these things
are numbers, well, this

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.160
could be phases or 1 or minus 1.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.730
And that's never going to work.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.560
This is twice this product.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.620
So [INAUDIBLE] OK,
they're matrices.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.470
But that's not bad,
if they're matrices,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.420
we'll have like spinors,
like Pauli was doing.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.750
And we'll work on spinors.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.710
But it turns out that this
one, the simplest solution

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:58.610
is something with
4 by 4 matrices.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:10.250
So the solution is alpha
is 0 sigma sigma 0.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:17.490
And beta is 1 minus 100.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.370
This is the simplest
solution, 4 by 4 matrices.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:34.890
So that Dirac Hamiltonian, H
Dirac, is equal to the energy.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.240
And the energy was the
square root of this.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.760
So it's just this thing.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.095
So it's c alpha dot
p plus b mc squared.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.900
That's our Dirac Hamiltonian.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:05.100
But we need to deal with spinors
that now are four dimensional.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.950
These matrices,
alpha and beta, are

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.990
four dimensional because
the segments that are inside

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.990
are two dimensional.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.860
And these are 2 by 2 matrices.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:29.790
So when you write the Dirac
equation as i H bar d psi dt

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:39.340
equal H Dirac psi, psi is a
four component thing, a chi

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.252
and a phi.

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:44.070
And what people
discover is that chi

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:49.330
behaves like the Pauli spinor.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.880
And this one is a small
thing, a small correction.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:03.670
So there is a whole analysis of
this system in which, in order

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.900
to put the magnetic
field, you can put in here

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:16.550
for the Dirac
Hamiltonian, H Dirac,

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:23.465
coupled to electromagnetism
has a c alpha p plus e over

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:30.970
ca plus beta mc squared.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.290
And you still have to
add the potential, V

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.720
of r, that comes from
[INAUDIBLE] minus e squared

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.530
over r.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.060
It's the value of
the electron charge

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.280
that is the potential of r.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.390
The scalar potential phi of r.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.380
So this is the
Dirac Hamiltonian.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.250
And you have these things.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.950
And this is something
you can read

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.530
if you're interested
in [? Shankar. ?] There

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:18.390
is a derivation of the Pauli
equation for the electron.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.210
Which is the
spinors that you are

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:26.270
familiar with by eliminating
in a recursive expansion phi.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.850
And it may be that
Professor Metlitski

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.070
is going to go through
that in recitation as well.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.180
So what happens?

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:44.230
What you get is that you
get an H chi equal E chi.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.550
And H is what?

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.990
Here is the grand prize.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:56.600
From the Dirac equation, we
can rewrite the Hamiltonian

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.820
of the hydrogen atom in a more
accurate way, a more complete

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:02.930
Hamiltonian.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:11.370
And it has p squared
over 2m plus V of r,

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:15.080
which is what we've called H0.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.860
It's there.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.150
It's the first term.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.470
That's what you would expect.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.430
Then there is that term
that we anticipated.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.300
Some relativistic
correction here.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:37.960
So it comes like minus p to the
fourth over 8m cubed c squared.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.190
And we call this
delta H relativistic.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.280
And then you get this
term that corresponds

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.850
to spin orbit coupling
that also shows up.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:13:00.960
2m squared c squared 1 over r
dv dr. You've studied this thing

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.560
and you gave a heuristic
explanation for it.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.310
That's another term.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.920
It's kind of difficult
to get the right value

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.170
by a simple argument.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.330
You always get it
off by a factor of 2

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.060
that is associated
to Thomas precession.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.690
But here it comes out directly
with the right number.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.220
This is called spin
orbit coupling.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.290
Delta H of spin orbit.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.240
And there's one more term.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.440
Plus H squared to this
[INAUDIBLE] 8 m squared

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:45.830
c squared Laplacian of V.
Which is called of this V of r.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.290
It's called the Darwin term.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.985
Delta H Darwin.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.610
Not the biologist.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:58.710
Some Darwin.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.550
So the job is set for us.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.520
We have to do
perturbation theory.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.710
Now you remember that all
the terms associated with H0

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:16.740
were of the form energies
with alpha squared mc squared.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.010
This was like H0.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:26.190
If you look at the units
of all of these terms,

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.770
we looked at them in the notes.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:35.250
Delta H. They all go like
alpha to the fourth mc squared.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.720
So there is a difference
of alpha squared there.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.750
1/19000 smaller.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.280
That is the fine structure
of the hydrogen atom.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.590
And our task next time will be
to compute the effect of this

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.860
and see what happens with all
the levels of the hydrogen

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.650
atom.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.450
This is our
[? final ?] structure.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.040
So we'll do that next time.
