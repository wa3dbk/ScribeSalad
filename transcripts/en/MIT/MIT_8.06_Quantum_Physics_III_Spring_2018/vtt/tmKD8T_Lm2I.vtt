00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:01.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.490
Let's do another application.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.880
I leave one thing.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.280
So this is going to be-- but
it's called Landau levels.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.310
And they're pretty interesting.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.740
So it's the problem of solving
for the motion of an electrode

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.805
in a magnetic field.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.900
So it's called Landau levels
for the physicist Lev Landau

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.340
from Russia that discovered
or did this calculation first.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.580
So you have a mass m charge
q, and the magnetic field

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.340
b in the z direction.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.680
We will solve it.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.120
And I think you will find
it pretty interesting.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.590
Well, you will be left with a
little of an uneasy feeling,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.110
I think, at the
end of the lecture,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.240
because the problem
of gauging variance

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.190
is so dramatic that the physics
will look a little strange

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.460
and a bit unrecognizable.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.840
So let me remind you that
in classical physics,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.300
if you have a
magnetic field, b, you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.660
can have electrons that
perform circular orbits,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.230
and the main property
of those orbits

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.100
is that they all run
at the same frequency

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.210
called cyclotron
frequency, qb over mc.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:12.970
So this is just Newton's law,
and the force being v over c

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.360
cross b should be
a couple of lines

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.550
for you to remember that
particle in the magnetic field

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.610
goes in circles with
that angular frequency.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.130
So OK, there's lots of comments
we could make about this,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.920
but let's assume
we're going to solve

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.780
for the motion of this particle.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.820
We're going to ignore spin.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.290
Sometimes spin is important.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.210
And when you have spin,
you have a Zeeman effect,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.040
spin in a magnetic field.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.300
So that can change the energy
levels by some quantities.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.030
Let's ignore it for the moment.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.930
It is sometimes relevant.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.190
Sometimes it's not relevant, and
you can easily take care of it.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.190
So again, we're faced
with having to represent

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.330
the magnetic field.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.176
So you have the magnetic
field [INAUDIBLE] of a,

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:25.540
and we'll take a solution in
which a this time is minus

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.440
by 0 and 0.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:37.990
Remember, that b is
dx ay minus dy ax.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.980
And therefore this works out.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.620
It has an ax component, the
derivative with respect to y

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.570
gives you the magnetic field b.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.020
So what happens to
your Hamiltonian?

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:07.740
Your Hamiltonian is now 1 over
2m px minus q over c times ax

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.495
plus 1 over 2m py squared
plus 1 over 2m pz squared.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.850
I will not consider z motion.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.770
It's too simple.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.360
It's not too interesting.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.620
It's just motion, plane
waves in the z direction.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.290
It's not interesting.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.380
All the physics is really
happening in the plane.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.840
It's the idea that
we can constrain

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.670
ourselves to have
orbits of electrons

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.220
that go like this in circles.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.810
OK.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.060
So our Hamiltonian is here.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.840
Let's write it once
again, 2m px plus

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:07.725
q by over c squared plus
1 over 2m py squared.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.230
In order to solve
a system like that,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:39.700
it's convenient to see what is
conserved, and px is conserved.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.160
px commutes with
the Hamiltonian,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.110
because the Hamiltonian
has no x dependence.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.310
So h commutes with px.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.800
It doesn't commute with py,
because there is a y in there.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.120
And, OK, so if it
commutes with px,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.720
we can hope for eigenstates,
energy eigenstates that

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.100
are also eigenstates of px.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.190
So I will write my wave
function of x and y

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:29.740
as a wave function that depends
on y times e to the i kx x.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.770
And it's already
a little strange.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.210
We're looking for
circular orbits maybe,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.310
and the x dependence is
really a little funny here.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.430
It's almost like plane
waves in the x direction.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.250
OK, well, it's a fact.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.110
It's true.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.480
You could not do that
if you would have

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.872
chosen a more symmetric gauge.

00:06:59.872 --> 00:07:04.060
You see, if you had chosen
a more symmetric gauge,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.820
in which a doesn't have just an
x component, but a y component.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.150
The y component would
have depended on x,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.690
and then x would-- px
and py, neither one

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.940
would have commuted
with the Hamiltonian.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.840
So things would
have been different.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.420
But this gauge is easy
to solve equations.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.000
It's called a Landau gauge.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.450
And let's just explore
what this says.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.910
Trust that if you're
solving the equations,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.740
and you get a legal solution,
it must mean the right thing.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:50.670
So here, in this solution
here, px is just h bar kx,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.390
and though we can restrict
the action of the Hamiltonian

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:02.530
to that subspace of
momentum, px equal h kx,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.600
we can look at the
Hamiltonian, it

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.150
is like looking at the
Hamiltonian for this wave

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.600
function, we already
constrain ourselves

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.190
to have this kind of momentum.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.540
So the Hamiltonian that
acts on the y function

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.150
is the Hamiltonian constrained
to the momentum kx,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:30.850
and it's equal to 1 over 2 m
py squared, the second term,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:39.981
plus 1 over 2 m qb
over cy plus h kx.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:51.420
It's the q by over c plus the
value of px, which is h kx,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.780
and I should square it.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.150
If you look at it
carefully, you see

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:08.380
that this is a simple harmonic
oscillator, Hamiltonian.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.250
There's py squared, and there's
a y where the origin shifted.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.100
It's not just a y
squared, but it's

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.470
some sort of y minus y0
at some point squared.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.660
So let's write it like that.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:33.300
So I have to make it look
like a harmonic oscillator, py

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.000
squared plus 1 over 2.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.420
For a harmonic oscillator,
I should have an m here.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.300
So I'm going to have an m
squared in the denominator,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.580
so m.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:53.600
Let's get the qb mc squared out.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.200
y, I got that out, minus--

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.930
I have to put all these things.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.240
Minus h bar kx over--

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.590
times the c over qb.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.670
Look at all that.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.010
So we factor out qb over c.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.870
With the m squared
here, and the m--

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.060
this is the 1 over m there.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.140
y, and I put two minus
signs, because I always

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.150
like to write y minus some
y0, which is the equilibrium

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.270
position of the oscillator.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.310
Here, as you pull
the c and the qb out,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.500
you get all these things.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:56.130
So this is a p squared y
over 2n, plus 1 over m qb

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:07.950
over mc squared y minus y0
squared with y0 equal minus h

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.190
bar k xc over qb.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.760
That's it.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.280
That's the system.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.540
One good thing happened already.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.550
While this thing is a little
funny or strange, I think,

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.360
at first sight, this
harmonic oscillator

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.900
is resonating with
an omega, which

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.120
is the cyclotron frequency.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.470
So that's nice.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.460
The harmonic oscillator is that.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.320
And therefore, already,
you know you're

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.120
going to get levels that are
going to be separated by h bar

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.520
omega cyclotron.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.120
So that classical
cyclotron frequency

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.660
is going to separate the
levels, and these levels

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.500
are called the Landau levels,
the various Landau levels.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:16.740
OK, so let's see what this
means, or how it looks like.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:26.320
For that, let's
imagine a solution.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.400
So how does a solution look?

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.880
So here is x and y.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:49.910
And suppose I take a
kx, which is negative.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:54.080
This kx is any number
you wish at this moment.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.010
So kx negative
means y0 positive.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.140
So here is the y0 is here.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:12.370
And the wave function is
certainly the probability

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.820
densities independent of x.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.870
So the wave function sort of
has support all over x here.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:30.220
And it represents an
oscillator in the y direction.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.250
In the y direction,
you're oscillating,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.790
and well, you're going
to oscillate a little.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.660
We know, in particular, is
a length scale associated

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.800
with the oscillator.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.660
So let's look at
that length scale.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.430
The length scale on an
oscillator h bar over m omega,

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.280
in general.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.820
But now, we have an
expression for omega.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:04.750
So h bar over m, and
omega is qb over mc.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:13.120
So this is square
root of hc over qb.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.750
And we're going to call
this the magnetic length.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:22.540
So this is for an oscillator,
an arbitrary oscillator

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.690
takes these values.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:31.800
So let's call the magnetic
length hc over qb.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.335
This magnetic length.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.040
So that's a nice definition.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.810
And that's roughly the
width of the state.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.820
Imagine you're in
the ground state,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.990
you oscillate from the harmonic
oscillator, the typical length

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.540
scale, and in this case,
is the magnetic length.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.646
So in the ground
state, this size is lb.

00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:09.460
And that's how your orbit looks.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:15.650
In particular, y0 has a
simple interpretation here.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:27.247
y0 is equal to minus
kx times the square

00:15:27.247 --> 00:15:33.760
of this magnetic length
is a [? right ?] squared.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:41.740
So it's minus kx
times lb squared.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.830
And the units work out because
k has units of 1 over length,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.340
and you have a length squared.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.420
So that's y0.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:58.180
So that's how the orbits look.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.540
Now, you would say OK, so
where are the circular orbits?

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.810
Well, they're not
quite so visible here.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.000
You have to do some
work to find them.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.740
And in particular,
what is happening here

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.370
is a very strange thing.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:21.100
I think-- well, I'll
say one more thing.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.060
If you have this as your
harmonic oscillator,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:33.460
your energies, that may
depend of kx and ny,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.400
those are the quantum
numbers you have already.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.230
Well, this is just a
harmonic oscillator.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.940
So it's h bar, the
cyclotron frequency.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.430
Some people call the
Landau frequency.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:53.140
Occupation number for
the oscillator times 1/2,

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.440
the usual formula for
a harmonic oscillator.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.090
And here is the energy.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:04.440
And well, you had
the plane wave.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:10.420
Why don't we have the p squared
over 2m of a plane wave?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.109
It's nowhere to be found.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.500
That doesn't show and doesn't
contribute to the energy.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.770
The mathematics
was shown for us.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:25.349
So this kind of dependence
doesn't do anything.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:32.590
It's the absolute
degeneracy, the kx.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.240
So you could construct the
superposition of states

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.840
here, using Fourier transforms
in which you somehow

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.310
localize this in
the x direction,

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.080
by superimposing degenerate
energy eigenstate.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.210
So this is the most important
thing about this Landau levels.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.690
The Landau levels are the
different levels of ny,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.860
so ny equals 0 is the
lowest Landau level.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.360
Then you go ny equal 1,
ny equal 2, ny equal 3.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.490
But each Landau level
is infinitely degenerate

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.260
because you can put
different values of kx,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.871
and the energy doesn't change.
