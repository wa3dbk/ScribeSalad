00:00:00.521 --> 00:00:01.020
OK.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.580
So that's our introduction
to the subject.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.820
Now, we have to get going.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.860
We have to explore how to set
up this scattering problem.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.990
So equations that
we need to solve.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.640
Well, what are the equations?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.910
We will have a
Hamiltonian, which

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.280
is p squared over 2m
plus a potential v of r.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.040
Need not be yet a
central potential.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
As usual, we will think
of a wave function that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.060
depends on r and t
that will be written

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.410
as a psi that depends on r times
e to the minus iet over h bar.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.500
An energy eigenstate.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.980
And then the equation
that you have to solve,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.570
the time independent the
Schrodinger equation, becomes

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:21.730
minus h squared
over 2m Laplacian

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:34.730
plus v of r acting on psi
of r is equal to e psi of r.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.260
So these are the equations
that you have seen already

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.020
endlessly in quantum mechanics.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.220
These are equations we
write to get warmed up,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.910
and we just repeat
for ourselves that we

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.310
have a Hamiltonian
in the picture where

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
the particles are scattering
off of a central potential.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.300
Not a central
potential, in fact,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.240
just often of a potential.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.520
Work with energy
eigenstates, and these

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.910
are going to be the equation
for the energy eigenstates.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
Now, let's write the first
picture of the scattering

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.550
process as some
sort of target here

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.810
or potential and
particles that come in

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.690
and scatter off
of this potential.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.350
So we're looking for
energy eigenstates.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.400
And we will try to identify
our energy eigenstates,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.760
and what we're going to
assume is that this potential

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.895
is finite range as well.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:49.395
Range.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.150
Finite range we can
deal with potentials

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.450
that fall off relatively fast.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.640
Already, the coolant potential
doesn't fall off that fast,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.070
but potentials that fall faster
and the cooler potentials

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.840
are potentials that
are just localized,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.430
which is pretty common
if you have an atom

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.730
and you scatter
things off of it.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.810
If it's a neutral atom, the
potential due to the atom

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.770
is zero outside the atom, but as
soon as you go inside the atom

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.270
you start to experience all
the electrical forces that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.060
are due to the nucleus
and the electrons.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.210
So a finite range
potential, and we're

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.260
going to think of
solutions that--

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.940
OK, away from the finite
range our plane waves,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.980
solutions of constant
energy specified

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.960
with perhaps some momentum,
so we will think of e as h

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.460
squared k squared over 2m.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.600
This is a way of thinking of
the energy of a given energy

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.500
eigenstate.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.830
So it's another
label for the energy.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.920
This one, it looks like
I've done something

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.769
but I haven't done much except
to begin an intuition process

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.230
in your head in
which somehow these

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.240
are going to be related
to energy eigenstates that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.440
have some momentum as they
propagate all over space.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.540
So if I write that, I
could just simply put

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.900
this on the left hand
side and get an equation

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.200
that is kind of nicer.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.040
Minus h squared
over 2m Laplacian

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:04.080
squared plus k squared plus
v of r psi of r equals zero.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:25.770
OK, it's not really
a matter scattering

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.090
of solving this
equation at this moment.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.740
There is infinitely many
solutions of this equation,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.250
and most of them may
not be relevant for us.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.640
We're not trying to find every
solution of this equation.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.740
We're trying to
find solutions that

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.200
have something to
do with physics,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.710
and you've done
that when you had

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.760
potentials in one dimension.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.680
And that intuition is
going to prove invaluable.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.440
So when you have a potential in
one dimension, you didn't say,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.170
OK I'm going to find all
the energy eigenstates.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.440
You said, let's
search for things

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.150
that are reasonable and
physically motivated,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.380
so you put in a wave
that was moving in

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.550
and you said, OK, this
wave is a solution

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.630
until it reaches this point
where it just stops being

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.850
a solution and you need more.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.710
If you put in this wave, you
will generate a reflected wave

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.900
and a transmitted wave.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.770
Those two waves are
going to be generated,

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.410
and then you write an
ansatz for this wave,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.750
some coefficient a e to the
ikx, b e to the minus ikx, c

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.690
e to the other, and then
you solve your equation.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:07:00.690
So we need to do the same thing
with this kind of equation

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.280
and this kind of potential.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.540
We have to set up
some sort of situation

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.920
where we have the physics
intuition of a wave that

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.620
is coming in and then whatever
the system will do to that wave

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.365
to upgrade it into
a full solution.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.880
So that's what we want to do
here in analogy to that thing.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.070
This could be called
the incoming wave,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.100
and this whole thing the
reflected and the transmitted

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.100
could be called the scattered
wave, the thing that

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.430
gets produced by the
scattering process.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:48.100
So if you had that there is lots
of solutions of that equation,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:55.720
if v was identical to zero,
if you had no potential,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.680
you could have
lots of solutions,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.880
because in fact if the
potential is not zero,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.950
plane waves are always
solutions without any potential.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.860
Particles that move as
plane waves so if equal

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:25.010
zero, plane waves of the
form psi equal e to the ikx

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:39.779
are solutions with k equal
the square root of k dot k.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.358
Or with k squared
equals k dot k.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.855
Plane waves are always
solutions of this equation.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.440
So if plane waves are solutions
of this equation for v

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.960
equal to zero, this
is the same thing

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.990
as saying here
that ae to the ikx

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.650
is a solution of this
equation as long as you

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.060
don't hit the potential.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.310
So here, we're going to do
something quite similar.

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:35.070
We're going to say that we're
going to put in an incident

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:48.320
wave function, and I will
instead of writing psi,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.760
I will call it 5x.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.895
The incident wave function 5x is
going to be just e to the ikz.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.620
So it's a wave function.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.500
I call it phi to
distinguish it from psi.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.180
Psi in general is
a full solution

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.550
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.450
That's our understanding of psi.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.020
So phi, it reminds you that
well, it's some wave function.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.740
I'm not sure it's a solution.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.710
In fact, it probably is
not the solution as soon

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.540
as you have the potential
different from zero.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.110
So is this common, we
forget that ksv equals zero,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:43.450
and now we put an incident wave
function which is of this form.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.790
This solves the equation
as long as you're away

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.710
from the potential.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:11:00.460
This is true, it's a solution
of the Schrodinger equation

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:07.610
away from v of r.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.960
Away from v of r means
wherever v of r is equal zero,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.900
you have a solution.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.460
Nevertheless, so if we call
the range of the potential--

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.340
let's call the range of the
potential finite range a--

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.430
that is to take that if
there is an origin here

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.530
up to a radius a, there is some
potential and beyond the radius

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.930
a the potential vanishes.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.550
So this definitely works.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:54.960
It's all ks away from vr or
as long as r is greater than a

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.540
for whatever value
of z you take.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:05.650
This is fine, so
here is our wave,

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.380
and now this is just
the incident wave.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.560
This is not going to
be the whole solution.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.860
Just like in the one dimensional
case, there must be more.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.630
So what is there more?

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.670
And our challenge to
begin with this problem

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.700
is to set up what
else could there be.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.390
So looking at it,
you'd say, all right.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.700
So the thing comes in.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.380
If there is
scattering, particles

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.130
are sometimes going to go
off in various directions.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.760
So the outgoing wave, here
there were outgoing waves

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.890
reflected and transmitted.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:53.000
The outgoing wave in the three
dimensional scattering problem

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.910
should be some sort of spherical
wave moving away from r

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.420
equals zero, which
is the origin.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.540
That should be the other
wave that I would write.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.260
So my ansatz should
be that there

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:16.510
is some sort of spherical
wave that is moving away.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:29.750
So to complete this with
a spherical outgoing wave.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:40.910
So while here this is
a plane wave moving

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.880
in the direction
of the vector k,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.420
if I want to write the spherical
wave, I would write e to the i

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.050
just kr.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:59.230
E to the ikr is
spherically symmetric,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.270
and it propagates radiantly out.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.660
If you remember
as usual that you

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:12.220
have e to the minus iet over h
bar, so you have kr minus et,

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.720
that is a wave that
propagates radially out.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:24.150
So maybe this is kind
of the scattered wave.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:29.190
This e to the ikr
moving out everywhere

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.735
would be your scattered wave.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:39.830
If that is the
scattered wave, remember

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.250
the scattered wave should
solve the Schrodinger equation.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.280
In fact, the sum
of these two should

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.450
solve the scattering equation.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.390
On the other hand,
we've seen that this

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.370
solves it as long as you're
away from the potential,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.100
and therefore this
should also solve it

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.290
if you're away
from the potential.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.340
So I ask you, do you think this
solves the Schrodinger equation

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.170
when you're away
from the potential?

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.840
Would e to the ikr
solve the equation?

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.240
Well for that, you would
need that if you're away

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.250
from the potential, do
you have Laplacian of e

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.680
to the ikr roughly equals zero?

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.190
Is that true?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.850
Would it solve it.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.520
No.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.630
It doesn't solve it.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.620
Doesn't even come
close to solving it.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.990
It's pretty bad, but the reason
it's bad is physically clear.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:04.890
This wave as it expands out
must become weaker and weaker

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:09.720
so that the probability
flux remains constant.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.910
You know, you don't
want an accumulation

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:16.110
of probability between a shell
at one kilometer and a shell

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.230
at two kilometers.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:22.190
So whatever flux is going out
from the shell in one kilometer

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:24.930
should be going out
of the bigger shell.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.280
So therefore, it
should fall off with r.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.300
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.320
I didn't write this well.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.090
So if you are going
to have this to be

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.320
a solution of the Schrodinger
equation outside of vr

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.250
equals zero, you should
have Laplacian k squared

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.570
of this thing equal to zero.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:55.210
So if this is equal to zero and
the potential is equal to zero,

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.480
the whole thing
is equal to zero.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.030
So we need this to hold.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.880
But even this one, of
course, is not true.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.010
It is just absolutely not true.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.599
The one that works
is the following.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:23.329
Laplacian plus k squared
of e to the ikr over r

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:28.830
is equal to zero for
r different from zero.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.750
This is a computation
I think you guys have

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.390
done before when
you were studying

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.880
the Hermiticity of p squared.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.310
You ended up doing
this kind of things.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:45.860
This Laplacian produces a delta
function at r equals zero,

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.620
but r equals zero is not the
place we're interested in.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.780
We're trying to find
how the waves look away

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.420
from the scattering center.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.240
So we need this to
hold away from r

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.860
equals zero, in fact,
bigger for r bigger than a.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.630
One way of checking
this kind of thing

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:18.200
is to remember that the
Laplacian of a function of r

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:27.290
is in fact one over r d
second dr squared r times f.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:32.330
That's a neat formula for the
Laplacian of a function that

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.620
just depends on r.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.960
If it depends on theta and
phi, it's more complicated.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.730
But with this function, it
becomes a one line calculation

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.450
to do this, and the r
here is just fantastic,

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.830
because by the time you
multiply by r this function is

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.930
just exponential.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:55.820
You take two derivatives,
you get minus k squared,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.940
and then the r gets
canceled as well

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.490
and everything works
beautifully here.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:09.770
And so this equation holds OK.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:15.890
And then we do have a
possible scattered wave.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.410
So we're almost there.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:29.550
We can write the scattering
wave size scattering

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:45.470
of x could be e to the ikr over
r and then leave it at that.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.120
But this would not
be general enough.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.470
There is no reason why
this wave would not

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.270
depend also on theta and phi.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.130
Here is the z
direction, and there's

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.450
points with angle theta, and if
you rotate it with some angle

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:13.930
phi here, and therefore
this function could as well

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.420
depend on theta and phi.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:24.590
So we'll include that
factor f of theta and phi.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.000
Now you would say,
look, you have

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.090
a nice solution of the
Schrodinger equation

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:45.110
already here, and what
should you be doing?

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.020
Why do you add this factor?

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.100
With this factor, it may
not be anymore a solution

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.537
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:20:53.537 --> 00:20:55.745
The Schrodinger equation is
going to have a Laplacian

00:20:55.745 --> 00:20:59.040
and it's going to
be more complicated.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.140
Well, this is true and we
will see that better soon,

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.040
but this will remain
an approximate solution

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:14.690
for r much bigger than a is the
leading term of the solution,

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:19.385
leaving term of the solution.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:36.660
So if you have a leading
term of a solution here,

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.810
this is all you want.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:44.270
You are working at r much bigger
than a, and your whole wave

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.880
and finally be written.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:53.100
So your full wave psi, or your
full energy eigenstates psi

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.380
of rt, is going to be
equal, approximately

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.740
equal to e to the ik--

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.260
well, I'll write it this way.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:09.680
Phi of r, that incident
wave we wrote--

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.020
I wrote if x there, I'm sorry.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:17.940
Plus psi scattering of--

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.320
I should decide x or r.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.550
Let's call this r.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.870
And I should call this r.

00:22:33.826 --> 00:22:37.930
Psi of r plus psi
scattering of r,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:47.460
and it's therefore equal to e
to the ikz plus f of theta phi e

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:56.160
to the ikr over r, and this is
only valid for r much bigger

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.690
than a.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:59.520
Far away.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:05.430
This had an analog in our
problem in one dimension.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:12.860
In one dimension, you set up a
wave and you put here the wave

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.430
and there is a reflected wave,
and there's a transmitted wave,

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.180
and in setting the problem, say
this is valid far to the left,

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:25.530
far to the left meaning at least
to the left of the barrier,

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.110
this is valid to the right.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:33.300
And these were exact
solutions in this region here.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.470
You can't do that well, but
you can do reasonably well,

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:44.850
you can write solutions that
are leading term accurate

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.370
as long as you are far away.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:54.630
So this is the first step in
this whole process in which we

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:59.830
are setting up the
wave functions that

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.840
is the most important equation.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.810
This is the way we're going
to try to find solutions.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.640
Now, when you try
to find solutions

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.770
at the end of the
day, you will have

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.050
to work in the region
r going to zero.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.410
So sooner or later
we'll get there.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.980
But for the time being, we
have all the information

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.510
about what's going on far
away, and from there we

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.360
can get most of what we need.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.160
In particular, this
f of theta and phi

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.510
is the quantity we
need to figure out.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.160
This f of theta
and phi is called

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.770
the scattering amplitude.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:58.040
F of theta and phi called
scattering amplitude.
