00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.510
PROFESSOR: All right, so
our next thing will be

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.500
getting into the electron spin.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.720
And I want to discuss of
two things, a little bit

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.280
of the Dirac equation
and the Pauli

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.150
equation for the electron.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.660
We need to understand
electron a little better

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.770
and understand
the perturbations,

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.560
the relativistic
corrections so we'll

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.120
consider the Pauli equation.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.280
So the Pauli equation is
what we have to do now.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.490
So what is the Pauli equation?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.910
It is the first
attempt there was

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.450
to figure out how the
Schrodinger equation should

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.580
be tailored for an electron.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.500
So we can also think
of the Pauli equation

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.010
as a baby version of the
Dirac equation, which

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.230
is the complete equation
for the electron.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.800
So it all begins
at the motivations

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:19.630
by considering what is the
magnetic moment of an electron?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.570
So it's a question that
you've been addressing

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.650
in this course for a while,
from Stern-Gerlach experiment

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.270
and how magnetic fields
interact with electron.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:49.080
So classically and
in Gaussian units,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.505
if you have a current
loop and an area a,

00:01:55.505 --> 00:02:04.460
the magnetic moment is
equal to i times the area

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.410
vector divided by c.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.275
You can use that to imagine
an object that is rotating.

00:02:17.275 --> 00:02:22.190
And as the object
rotates, if its charged,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.000
it generates a magnetic
moment, and the magnetic moment

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.740
depends on the amount of
rotation of the orbit.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.060
So it turns out that, with
a little classical argument,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.010
you can derive that the
magnetic moment is related

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:48.150
to the angular momentum by
a relation of the form L,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.320
so the charge of the object,
the mass of the object c,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.730
and the angular momentum.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.730
And that's perfectly
correct classically.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.850
So people thought that
quantum mechanically

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:07.680
they expect that for an electron
or for an elementary particle,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.280
you would get q times 2 mc
times the spin of the particle.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.070
So this would be the intrinsic
magnetic moment of an electron

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:29.140
that it seems to have
times a fudge factor, g

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.610
that you would have to measure.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.640
Because after all, the
world is not classical.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.050
There's no reason why a
classical relation like that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.610
would give you the right exact
value of the magnetic moment

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.200
of the electron.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.170
As it turns out, this g
happens to be equal to 2.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.730
And we get the following.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:08.380
So for electrons g
happens to be equal to 2.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.820
So mu is equal to 2 times minus
e-- the charge of the electron

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.100
is minus 2 mc, and the
spin of the electron

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.100
is h bar over 2 times
sigma, the Pauli matrices.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:39.750
So this thing is minus
eh bar over 2 mc sigma

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.570
mu of the electron.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:54.620
So if you have a magnetic
field, a B external,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.000
the Hamiltonian that
includes the energetics

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.980
of the magnetic
field interacting

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.320
with the dipole moment,
it's always minus mu dot b.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:19.110
So in this case it would be
eh bar over 2 mc sigma dot b.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.900
That's the Hamiltonian
for an electron

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.550
in a magnetic field, something
you've used many, many times.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.530
The most unpleasant part of
this thing is this g equal 2.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.860
Why did it turn out
to be g equal 2?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.920
People knew it was g equal 2.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.600
But why?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.230
And here we're going to see the
beginning of an explanation.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.900
In fact, it comes very close
to an explanation of that

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.290
through the Pauli equation.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.190
The Pauli equation is a
nice equation you can write,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.260
and you can motivate.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.850
And it predicts.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.790
Once you admit the
Pauli equation,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.350
it predicts that g
would be equal to 2.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.320
And that, of course, happens
also for the Dirac equation.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.340
And Dirac noticed that, and
he was very happy about it.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.190
So it's quite remarkable
how these things showed up,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.450
and the G equal to 2
was perfectly natural.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.690
So let's see this
Pauli equation first.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.430
What is it?

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.600
Well, when you do the
Schrodinger equation for a wave

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.260
function, you say
p squared over 2m--

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.850
say a free particle,
and you would

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:57.170
put the wave function is equal
to energies times the wave

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.510
function.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.440
h on the wave function is
equal to energy terms the wave

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.820
function.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:11.000
So for this
electron, you already

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.990
know it's a two-dimensional
Hilbert space, the state

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.610
space of the up and down.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.230
So it's convenient to change
this and to say, you know what?

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.450
I'm going to put here
something I'll call a spinor.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.110
Chi is a Pauli.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.950
It has two things, a chi 1 and a
chi 2, and it's a Pauli spinor.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.250
And this is reasonable so far.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.470
The spin is defined by 2 degrees
of freedom, 2 basis is vectors.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.630
So you've done wave
functions for spin.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.900
And the wave functions for
spin have these things,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.680
and each themself can be
a function of position.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.740
So that's perfectly reasonable.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:11.270
I don't think anyone of you is
very impressed by this so far.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.380
But here comes the funny thing.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:24.440
In a sense here, there is a 2 by
2 identity matrix sitting here.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.290
So Pauli observes the
following identity.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:37.559
If you have sigma dot
8 and sigma dot b,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:50.910
it's equal to a dot b times 1
plus i sigma plot a cross b.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:55.330
Look, these are two
vectors, a and b.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.520
And if you multiply half
this product-- first,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.900
this is a dot product.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.450
It means sigma 1 times a1 sigma
2 times a2 sigma 3 times a3.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.010
So this is a dot product.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.770
This product here
is a matrix product

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.930
because this is
already a matrix,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.590
this is already a matrix,
so this is a matrix product.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.630
And this is the
result. This comes

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:22.740
from properties of the Pauli
matrices you already know.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.070
In particular, their
commutator determines

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.140
this piece and
the anticommutator

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.590
determines this piece.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.960
So here, if you
have, for example,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.900
sigma dot p times sigma dot p--

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.620
see, these two vectors are
the same in this case--

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:51.380
you'll get just p
squared times 1 plus 0.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.110
Because p times P, those are two
vector operators if you wish,

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.310
but still they commute.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.240
So this is equal to 0.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.920
So your p squared can be
replaced by sigma dot p sigma

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.580
dot p.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:15.310
So h, the Hamiltonian-- that
is p squared over 2 m times

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.310
the identity matrix--

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.890
can be perhaps better
thought as sigma

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:29.680
dot p times sigma
dot p divided by 2m.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.310
So this is the first step.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.190
You haven't done
really much, but you've

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.690
rewritten the Hamiltonian
with a unit matrix

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:50.100
here perhaps in a
somewhat provocative way.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:54.240
In quantum mechanics, when we
couple to electromagnetism,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.290
there are simple
changes we have to do.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:04.720
And we will study that in
detail in about three weeks,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.860
but today I will
just bench on what

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.320
you're supposed to do in order
to couple to electromagnetism.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.000
In order to couple
to electromagnetism,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.780
you're supposed to
change p wherever you see

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.070
by an object you can call pi.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.270
It's some sort of more
canonical momentum

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:34.080
in which it's got
to p minus q over c.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.380
The vector potential
is a function of x.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.100
Well, people write it
like this, qp minus q ac.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.290
So you're supposed to
do this replacement.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.260
When you're dealing
with a particle moving

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:56.080
in some electromagnetic field,
that's the change you must do.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.890
We will study that in detail.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.180
But I think an obvious
question at this moment

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.210
is the following.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.690
You say, well, I'm
in quantum mechanics,

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.720
and I work with p and x.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.350
Those are my opera-- what
is a? is it an operator?

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.610
Is it a vector?

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.190
Is it what? p is an
operator, but what is a?

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.950
You should think of
this vector potential.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.950
In general, this
vector potential

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.790
will depend on the position.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.070
So if you put a magnetic field,
you require a vector potential.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.470
It has some position dependent.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.680
So actually, this
a here should be

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.140
thought as a of x,
the same way as when

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.020
you have the potential
that depends on x.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.440
In quantum mechanics, we just
think of that x as an operator.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.270
So the a is an operator
because x is an operator,

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.850
and a has x dependents.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:09.660
So the Pauli Hamiltonian, h
Pauli is nothing else but sigma

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:18.760
dot pi times sigma
dot pi over 2 m.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.790
Because we said p must
be replaced by pi,

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.090
so this is the
Pauli Hamiltonian.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:34.340
And it's equal to 1
over 2m pi squared

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:45.880
pi dot pi times 1 plus i
sigma dotted with pi cross pi.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:04.260
OK, here is the
computation we need to do.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.350
What is pi cross pi?

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.655
You know what pi is.

00:14:08.655 --> 00:14:10.710
It's given by this thing.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.870
So how much is pi cross pi?

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.820
Well, it takes a
little computation.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.740
I'll tell you what
you have to do.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.840
It's a very interesting
computation.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.160
It's small.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.260
It reminds you of
this computation

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.060
in angular momentum, l cross l.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.240
Maybe you've written the
algebra of angular momentum

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.110
in this language.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.350
It's equal to h bar l.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.430
That's your computation in
relations of angular momentum

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.240
written like that.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.730
So pi cross pi,
the kth component

00:14:51.730 --> 00:15:00.620
is epsilon ijk pi i
pi j or 1/2 epsilon

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:06.005
ijk pi I commutator with pi j.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.680
This last step, it
can be explained

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.990
by writing out the
commutator, which

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.650
is pi i pi j minus pi j pi i.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.770
But with this epsilon, those
two terms are the same,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.000
and it becomes this.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.400
So how much is this thing?

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.220
I'll leave it for you to do it.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:39.410
It's simple thing.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.200
You have to commute
these things,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.860
and you must think
of p as derivatives.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:57.680
So this pi i pi j is i h bar
q over c di a j minus dj a i.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.450
You can see it coming.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:05.120
You see, you have a commutator
of two factors like that.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.340
The a with a will commute.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.200
The p with p will commute.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.639
The cross products won't,
but that's just derivatives.

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.180
So therefore, you
get the derivatives

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.390
of a antisymmetrized.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.030
And the derivatives
of a antisymmetrized

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.890
is the curl of a.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.660
And the curl of a is
the magnetic field.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.870
So that's why this happens.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.210
So at the end of the day, when
you'll finish this computation,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:40.700
get that pi cross pi is
just i q i h bar q over c

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.060
times the magnetic field.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.190
Pretty nice equation.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.845
So the Pauli Hamiltonian
includes h Pauli.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:06.250
It includes this term,
which is i sigma over 2m

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:18.520
dotted with i hQ over
cb plus the other terms.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.700
I'm just looking at this term
which has the magnetic field.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.740
And therefore, look at this.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.640
i with i is minus
1, but q is minus e.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:45.020
So this is eh bar over 2 mc
sigma dot b, which is here,

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.260
which came from g equal 2.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:53.530
Nowhere I had to say there
that g is equal to 2.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.890
It came out of this calculation.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.310
The Pauli Hamiltonian
knew of this.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:04.120
And therefore, it's a
great progress, that Pauli

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.960
Hamiltonian, but
it suggests to us

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.290
that we can do things still
even better, as Dirac did.
