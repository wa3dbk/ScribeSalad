00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.140
So time to complicate
the model a little bit

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.990
to get more interesting
physics from it.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.130
So what am I going to do?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.550
I'm going to add an extra term.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.880
So the system goes
now to an H of t

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.940
that is going to have
the alpha t over 2.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.580
And now it's gonna have a
little term of diagonal.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.210
So there's several ways
of thinking about this.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.225
H12 is going to be
constant in time.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.930
So it's a number.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.800
H12 star is it's
complex conjugate.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:10.520
If you're looking at t equals
0, H becomes just H12, H12 star.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.680
And the energy eigenstate
or the energy eigenvalues

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.010
of this matrix are plus
or minus the norm of H12,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.220
the absolute value of H12.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.220
Just put a couple of lambdas,
calculate the eigenvalues.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.850
It involves H12 times
H12 star, which is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.670
the square of the norm of H12.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.650
And the energies are those.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.730
So look at what's happening
in your energy diagram

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.990
as a function of t.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:58.800
At t equals 0, there are two
energies, H12 and minus H12.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.060
Those are the energies
at time equals 0.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.690
We're trying to get the analog
of what was going on there.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.180
And now you could
say, OK, at time

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.950
equals 0, that's what I get.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.800
What do I get at large times?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.560
Well, at large times,
these are dominant.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.040
And these are very small.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.570
So you must get something
similar to these arrows here.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:35.700
So what I'll draw
here is this and this.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.040
And I cannot trust this
here for small time.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.710
But presumably, this is about
right here and about right here

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.370
and about right here
and about right here.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.640
And the states must be
the same one, 0, 1 here;

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.860
0, 1; 1, 0; 1, 0.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.810
So that's what you know just
without doing any calculation.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.140
That's what your system does.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.600
And now, a
Hamiltonian in general

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.230
doesn't get levels crossing.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.000
That requires a coincidence like
having no off-diagonal element.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.190
So actually, what this
will give you is this.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.910
So that's how the system will
look as a function of time.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.510
Those are the energy
levels as a function

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.750
of time, the instantaneous
energy levels.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.360
At every instant of time,
you now have the energies.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.570
These are the energies
of this matrix,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.480
the energies, the eigenvalues.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.360
One line computation, our E
plus minus equal plus or minus

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.430
square root of H12
squared plus alpha

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:25.640
squared t squared over
4, so plus or minus.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.370
So this is E plus
and E minus of t.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.350
All right.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.172
So here we go.

00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:41.950
We have a real system.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.145
And we have something
quite interesting actually.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.340
When you let H12 go to 0,
you're back to that place.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.060
And you just zoom through
like here you did.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.350
You just go through
and go through.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.700
So when the levels
do that, you just

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.260
continue through any
particular state you were in.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.290
You don't start here
and then go here.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.430
You just go through.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.960
That's what you prove here.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.120
And therefore, when you take
the limit of H12 going to 0,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.400
if H12 goes to 0,
these things collapse.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.340
And you're back there.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.660
And you zoom by through.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.170
So when H12 will be
very, very small,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.820
you will be likely,
in fact, more likely

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.750
to make the transition
than not to make it.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.210
So if you have a system for--

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:01.360
this is just a micron separated
here, a milli-electron volt--

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.100
let's be more precise here--

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.660
you're more likely to
zoom through and make

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.680
the nonadiabatic transition
because this will not

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.390
be an adiabatic process.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.670
They're getting to
close to each other.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:25.010
On the other hand,
if you are far away,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.770
you're going to be
very unlikely to make

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.050
the nonadiabatic transition
because you are very separated.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.470
The nice thing
about this problem

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.220
is that it can be
solved analytically.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.850
Not terribly easy.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.330
It involves a little bit
of hypergeometric functions

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.840
and some differential equations.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.030
But it can be solved.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.740
You will solve it
numerically in the homework.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.320
I will say a few words about it.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.020
And we'll discuss the
transition in this case.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.710
And the answer is
known analytically.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.430
It's a very famous result.
In fact, many people

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.970
have written papers trying
to give simple derivations

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.120
of this answer.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.750
So in order to just
write the answer

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.130
and to see how it looks--

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.880
so this is the answer
for a transition--

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.840
we try to discuss the notion
of adiabatic process here.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.470
When is this
transition adiabatic?

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.320
And what we do is this.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:50.150
You can imagine taking a tangent
here and another tangent here.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.370
And when it hits the lines,
the linear lines that we

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.380
plotted here, bring them down.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.290
So you get a rectangle here.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.780
So you hit the
alpha t over 2 line.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:17.740
And you call this 2 tau
d or 2 tau, no, tau d.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.620
OK.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.140
So let's figure out
what that is because I

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:30.080
say that this time is
the time that going up

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.320
on the line, alpha t over
2, this time 2 tau d,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.650
you get the height, H12.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:50.360
That means that H12 is alpha
times 2 tau d divided by 2.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:09:00.630
So tau d is H12 over alpha.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:08.350
So tau d is usually thought
as the timescale associated

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.950
to the change in
the Hamiltonian.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.680
That is you have an
original Hamiltonian, that's

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.660
where this linear [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.460
And over a time 2d,
the shape is changed

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.520
into the final Hamiltonian.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.220
This is the process in
which the original system

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.810
is changed into the new
system within this timescale.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.780
The timescale tau d.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.550
But we have another time
that is interesting here.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.310
You see, while this
change is happening,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:55.230
the separation of the energy
levels is by this distance H12.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.540
So the Hamiltonian
at t equals 0,

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:08.640
the Hamiltonian looks
like 0, H12, H12, here.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.280
And if you have two states
governed by such Hamiltonian

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.380
that is valid near
time equals 0,

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.910
there's going to be oscillations
between states here.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:24.720
You can go from the first
state to the second state

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.800
with some frequency
governed by this number.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:37.420
That is called the Rabi
frequency, Rabi oscillation.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.370
It's something
you've done in 805.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.280
In two-state systems,
you oscillate.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.770
And the frequency of oscillation
between the states 1 and 2

00:10:47.770 --> 00:11:02.240
is H12 divided by h bar or 2
pi divided by the period T12.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.120
That's the definition
of the frequency.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.450
So what do we have here?

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:19.740
The process is
adiabatic if the time

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:29.850
tau d for the change to happen
is much larger than the period

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.190
capital T12 of the oscillation.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.320
So you can think of this
system during the time

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.280
it spends in this box like
a two-level system separated

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.160
by H12 that oscillates
between the two states.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.820
And in that time, 2 tau d,
all the change is happening.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.640
So you should have that
tau d is much bigger

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.100
than the period of oscillation.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.950
And this corresponds
too because T12

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.840
is the inverse of
omega 12 to omega 12

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.350
tau d much greater
than 1, so either one.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:23.420
And that would be
adiabatic condition.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.580
Let's put the numbers here.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:38.200
Omega 12 is H12 norm over h bar.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.240
And tau d-- we often
found it there--

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.475
is H12 over alpha.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.970
So over alpha.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.920
So this is much greater than 1.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.580
I don't know.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.870
This 2 here has nothing
to do with that formula.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.590
So this is the
adiabatic condition.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.790
And this is reasonable.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.510
You see, what is going
to make it adiabatic?

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.770
The more these branches are
separated, the more difficult

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:25.060
the transition, the better
the adiabatic approximation.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.800
And it's this thing here.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.700
The bigger this number,
the better you are.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.020
The slower alpha is,
the lower the slope

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.210
is, the more time
it's going to take,

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.280
the better the
adiabatic approximation.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.900
So this is really the thing.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.540
And the final formula
that I will write here

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:52.420
is the probability for a
nonadiabatic transition

00:13:52.420 --> 00:14:02.080
is exponential of minus
2 pi omega 12 tau d.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.200
So the probability that you
cross the thing and jump

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.100
from this down to here is this.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.850
It's suppressed by
the adiabatic factor.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.780
And that's what you will
check in the homework.
