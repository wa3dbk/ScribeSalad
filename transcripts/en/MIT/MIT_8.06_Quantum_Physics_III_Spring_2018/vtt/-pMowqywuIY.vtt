00:00:00.726 --> 00:00:07.120
PROFESSOR: The left hand side
here is 0 because H0 and N0

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.480
by taking the
eigenstate equation is

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.570
equal to En0 times N0.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.520
So this really evaluates to En0
and therefore the two cancel,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.670
so this thing is 0.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.010
The right hand side,
this is a number, En1.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.880
It's a number.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.630
It's in an expectation value.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.910
N0 has a unit expectation
value, so this is En1.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.970
That's the number.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.500
And then I have
an operator here.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.550
So this is minus N0 delta H N0.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.660
So we get a very famous
and important equation

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:07.210
that En1 is equal
to N0 delta H N0.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.990
The first correction
to the energy

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
is obtained by finding
the expectation

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.160
value of the perturbation
in the unperturbed state.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.090
So you should be
happy to hear that.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
It says that to find the first
correction in the energy,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
you don't need to know
what happens to the state.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.340
I didn't need to know what N1
was, how the state changes,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.530
to know how the energy changes.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.740
The energy changed before,
and I just don't need it.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.720
I just need the original
state and the perturbation.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.330
So it's a very nice result, and
it has a simple generalization.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.270
The simple generalization
is that I'm

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.780
going to use another blackboard,
but let's look at it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.730
The simple generalization comes
from doing the same exact thing

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.620
with the order k equation.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.740
So let's do that.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.710
I put an N0 to the
left of this equation.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.810
Now what do we get?

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.750
From this term, we get
0 for the same reason.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.200
There's an N0 now
here, and the H0

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.990
is killed by this
term, gives you 0.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.800
And then we're going
to continue with this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.250
and see what happens
with this various terms.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.330
Let's look at it.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.770
So I'll put the N0--

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:27.000
0 on the left hand
side was equal to 0.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.660
And on the right hand
side, what do we get?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.770
Well, let me do a
couple of terms.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:50.950
N0 En1 minus delta H and k minus
1 plus all these other terms.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.250
So look what happens here.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.450
Let's do the next
term, for example.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.610
En2, N0, and k minus 2.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.089
Well, from here,
this is a number,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:27.900
so I have here this goes out the
overlap of N0 with nk minus 1.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.320
But we said that all
the higher corrections

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.410
have no component along N0.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.060
So this thing will give you 0.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.230
On the other hand,
here is an operator,

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.200
so there's nothing I can say.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:50.630
So I'll write it minus
N0 delta H and k minus 1.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.100
And then what else?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.860
Well, you have N0
then k minus 2 here.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.440
That's 0 because this
is a higher state

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.520
and all the terms give you
0 until you get here where

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.580
the N0 with the N0 give you 1.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.110
So the only term that
survives is the last one,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.670
and we get enk.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.810
So this gives you
the result that enk

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:37.880
is equal to N0 delta
H and k minus 1.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.480
I box it because it's
another nice formula.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.020
It tells you that
the kth order energy

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.100
is given if you know
the k minus 1 state.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.820
If you have figured out
the k minus 1 correction

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.450
to the state, then you know the
energy of the kth correction.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.360
This formula
certainly works when

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.630
k is equal to 1 in which case
it reproduces the formula we had

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.250
on the blackboard to the right.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.790
When k is equal to 1, you
get the expectation value

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.240
of delta H around zero.
