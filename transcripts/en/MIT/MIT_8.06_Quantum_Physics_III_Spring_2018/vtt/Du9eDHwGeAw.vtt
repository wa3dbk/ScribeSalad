00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.440
PROFESSOR: It's
time for step two.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.180
What don't we know here?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.170
Well, we don't know anything
about the state correction.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.150
So n1, what is n1?

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:28.200
So step two is find the
piece of n1 k, the piece that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.860
is in the space v hat.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.400
So I will use this
notation, a bar here,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.460
saying, of this vector,
the piece in that subspace.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.250
Then we, of course,
need to find the piece

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.160
in the degenerate subspace.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.350
Remember, the corrections
are orthogonal

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.220
to the original state,
but the corrections

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.910
can have a piece on vn.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.940
The vn has more states.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.810
So it can have a piece on vn,
and that's typically the part

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.490
that is a little hard to do.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.590
So what do we do here?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.700
We take the order one
equation, lambda equal 1,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.380
and we hit it with p0.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.815
So we'll hit with p0 on
the order lambda equation.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.590
So think of the p0 vector,
bra, appearing here.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.040
We know the energy of it, so
this will become a number.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:01.245
So we get Ep0 minus En0 p0 n1 k.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.560
And indeed, when you
see here-- you say,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.350
oh, this is my unknown.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.450
I don't know the first
order correction,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.320
and I'm getting the components
of this unknown correction

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.630
along the v hat space.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.600
That's why this calculation
can only give me

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.080
the piece of n1 k along v hat.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.090
And then, what do we have here?

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:44.190
We have p0 Enk1
minus delta H n0 k.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.120
It's just that order one
equation calculated here.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.190
So what is it?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.120
You recognize the
challenge here is always

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.321
sort of trying to remember what
the symbols mean and simplify

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:05.820
things.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.750
So for example, here.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.990
This is a number.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.440
So what you must ask
is whether this vector

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.690
is orthogonal to this
one because you're

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.490
going to get an inner product.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.920
And this is a vector
in v hat, and this

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.210
is a vector in v capital N. So
therefore, they are orthogonal.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.830
So this term vanishes by
orthogonality of these two.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.730
On the other hand, we are
left with this part here.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.500
Now, that's a matrix
element of delta H

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.430
between a degenerate state
and the rest of the states.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.650
So that's something
you have to calculate.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.990
There's no way around it.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.630
So we use our notation.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.190
And in our notation,
this will be delta Hpnk.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.870
All right.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.730
So this gives us--

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.620
we're done with this equation.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.240
It was simple.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.680
No big sweat.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.710
We now have these coefficients,
because these are numbers,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.839
and we can just
divide over here.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.980
And this factor is
nonzero because all the p

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.190
states that are in v hat
have different energy

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.720
from our degenerate ones.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.660
So there are the
components of this.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:49.440
So we have p0 n1 k is equal
to minus delta Hpnk divided

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.680
by this quantity, Ep0 minus En0.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.960
And therefore, we
can write n1 k.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.540
If you have the inner products
of a state with p arbitrary,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.510
the state is the sum of other
p's times that inner product.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.030
So I'll write it as minus
because of that minus here.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:40.050
The sum over p of delta
Hpnk over Ep0 minus En0 p0

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.540
written like that.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.680
This is something-- maybe
it sounds a little fast,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.550
but if you have a basis
vector, alpha i with psi

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.180
being the number
beta i, the state

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:05.600
psi is equal to the
sum of beta i alpha i.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.020
Once you have the
components, the vector

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.320
can be reconstructed as the
components times the basis

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.310
vectors.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.920
So that's what we did here.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.480
We have the components here.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.180
And therefore, the
vector is the components

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.560
times the basis vectors.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.760
You can check that.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.030
If that makes you
a little uneasy,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.110
just put the p0 here,
and recalculate that,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.120
and you will get that answer.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.440
Now, as written it there,
it's really not precise.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.690
You're making,
technically, a mistake.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.660
This equation is technically
wrong because that's not n1 k.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.390
That is only the components
of n1 k along v hat.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.070
So this is v hat.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.240
If n1 k has something along
the degenerate subspace,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.250
we haven't found it.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.550
But this much we found.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.240
We've found part
of the correction.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.070
So degeneracy is always
a complicated thing.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.130
So we're going to try to find--

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.890
we're going to
find, in fact, now

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:25.470
the component of the correction
around the degenerate space.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.460
Now, in nondegenerate
perturbation theory

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.340
we manage to use this equation
to calculate fully the state.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.580
But now we've used this
equation all the way.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.480
We put states in the
degenerate subspace,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.340
and we found the energies.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.460
We put, in the other
part of the space, v hat,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.070
and we found the part
of n1 along v hat.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.990
And we ran out of things
from that order one equation.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.940
It has no more information.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.700
So somehow it must be that the
next equation that we usually

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.150
need to go to second
order in energy

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.470
will tell us something about
the missing part of n1.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.550
So that's the surprising thing.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.040
You have to go to order lambda
square to find the first order

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.830
correction to the degenerate
part of the state.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.220
That's why degenerate
perturbation theory

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.700
is famous for its complication.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.970
You really need to go pretty
high to find the things.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.660
So let's do it.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.745
So this is step 3.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:58.155
You hit the order lambda
squared equation with n0 l.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.680
And therefore,
the left-hand side

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.090
is going to be 0 because that
operator on the left-hand side

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.370
always kills those states.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.010
Now, you could have been
a little sloppy here.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.790
I was sloppy when I first
solved those equations.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.870
I didn't say, OK, this is v hat.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.800
I said, that's the answer.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.540
That's the whole state.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.720
There's nothing along
the degenerate subspace.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.710
But then, if you stop
there, you can live happily

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.160
the rest of your life.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.950
But if you go to
the next equation

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.190
and find that it's
wrong, there was a piece

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.710
along the degenerate subspace.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.430
So let's see that.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.420
So we'll also write,
as we've started to do,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:10:04.170
n1 k being equal to n1 k along
v hat plus the piece of n1 k

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.220
along the vn.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.590
And this one we got.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.080
And this one, well, is it there?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.060
Do we need it?

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.760
Does the state
receive a correction

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.500
in that space or not?

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.540
Well, let's do the work.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.820
Let's hit this
with those states.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.780
So what happens?

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:48.904
We have n0 l Enk 1
minus delta H n1 k.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.820
That's our term there.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.180
Actually, I will write it twice.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.280
So I'll copy it again.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:19.580
n0 k l Enk 1 minus delta H n1 k.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.090
Why do I copy it again?

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:27.610
Because I'll just put
here on v hat and on vn.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.610
So it was one term with an n1 k.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.880
But you know, the
n1 k vector has

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.300
components along two subspaces.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:46.670
And therefore, we might as
well put each one separately

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:52.750
so we can think about
them in a clear way.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.710
Then, what else?

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.610
There's one more
term, the En2 k.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:09.540
And that is relatively
simple because that's Enk 2.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.400
And then we have the overlap
of an n0 l with an n0 k which

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.410
is a delta lk.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.330
So this whole thing must be 0.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.240
That was the right-hand
side of the equation.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.560
But the left-hand side of the
equation was 0, so that's 0.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.920
OK.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.300
So now we have to think
about these terms.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.380
What do we know?

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.060
What is 0 to begin with?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.030
What is not 0?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.550
This term in here,
we know n1 k already.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.800
We found it there.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.530
So that's nice.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.440
We know n1 k.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.940
We know this corrections.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.800
But this is simpler because n0
l is in the degenerate subspace.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.220
This is a number, and this is
in b hat, so that's 0 again.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.500
OK.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.230
So that's a simplification.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.880
Here we have a very
interesting situation.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:26.280
We have the delta H, and
we have this basis state

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.800
of the degenerate subspace.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.290
We know that delta H is diagonal
in the degenerate subspace,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:43.540
but is this n0 l an
eigenvalue of delta H?

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:48.220
Not quite because
being diagonal,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.990
these basis vectors
make delta H diagonal.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.020
So delta H is diagonal
in this subspace,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:59.380
but doesn't mean this thing
is an eigenvector because it

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.060
can give you something outside
the degenerate subspace.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.100
So we cannot quite just say
that the eigenvalue of this is

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.700
the first energy correction.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.240
But actually, we can.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.230
Let me explain that.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.090
So let's look at
this term alone.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:28.510
With this term alone-- now
this time I cannot kill this

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.770
constant because this is
in the degenerate subspace,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.840
and this is in the
degenerate subspace.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.780
So we will have
to deal with that.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.015
So let's do this.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:58.360
So output here.
n0 l delta H n1 k.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.960
We're going to try
to simplify this.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.760
And the way to do it--

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:12.030
this is n1 k, very
important in vn--

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:17.430
is to insert the resolution
of the identity here.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.950
So I'll do it.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:26.410
We'll put n0 l delta
H, and now we'll

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.800
put the whole resolution
of the identity.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:51.350
So we'll put the sum over q n0
q n0 q plus a sum over p p0 p0,

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:59.660
all acting on n1 k of vn.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.570
I actually want
to remark that all

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.500
what I'm doing in this line--

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.880
so let's break this.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.800
The equation was up to
here, and we decided

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.800
to try to understand this term.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.420
So we're trying to
understand this term.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.790
Just that term.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:27.890
Now, delta H here is
acting between degenerate

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.715
eigenstate here and here,
some arbitrary state

00:16:32.715 --> 00:16:34.320
in the degenerate subspace.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:43.090
So we go here and we
say, OK, since this

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:47.410
is in the degenerate subspace,
this inner product with vector

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.210
in v hat, this is 0.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.510
So that part of the
resolution of the identity

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.320
is not relevant.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.450
If that part of the
resolution of the identity

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:12.020
is not relevant, we are
left with n sum over q n0 l

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:30.220
delta H n0 q n0 q times n1 k vn.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:39.620
And now you can use that
this matrix is, indeed,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.830
diagonal in the
degenerate subspace.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.440
And therefore,
this matrix element

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:54.830
is the energy Enl 1, the
first order correction,

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.380
times a delta lq.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.150
And then we can
do the sum over q

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.330
because there is a
delta function here.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:30.900
And this becomes
Enl 1 n0 l n1 k vn.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.510
So this is very nice.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.020
It took us a little bit of work
but look what has happened.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.610
This delta H term is going
to become the same structure,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.150
n0 l n1 k overlap.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.330
So it's great progress.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.970
So what does our
equation become?

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.350
Well, from the first
term, this is the rest

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.420
of the end of the aside.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.540
From the first term
we have minus n0 l

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:18.450
delta H n1 k in v hat.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:22.870
That's all that was left
from that first term.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.000
And this term is
known because n1

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.530
is known along the rest
of the Hilbert space.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.630
The second term over there
that was giving us trouble

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.010
has become something
very simple.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:49.500
It has become Enk
minus Enl, both 1,

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:56.654
multiplied by n0 l n1 k.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:08.050
I could put this vn, or
now I may not put it either

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.830
because I am already
projecting to a state

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.450
in the degenerate subspace.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.140
So I am finding the component
along the degenerate subspace.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.120
So even if n1 k had
a piece along v hat

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.350
it would drop out here.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:29.350
So it's completely legal, and
it's simpler to erase the vn.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:40.830
And then the last term is still
there, plus Enk 2 delta lk

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.565
equals 0.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.270
OK.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.250
This is our master equation.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.880
After thinking of this
equation for a while

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.490
and using our properties,
we got this far.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.210
It's a very nice equation.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.810
It does give you the
second order energies.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:11.880
We were looking for
the part of the state

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.800
along the degenerate subspace.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.415
This was our main unknown.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.810
But still, we can
get the energies.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.310
Why?

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:31.050
Because we can take l
equals to k, in which case

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:37.140
the term that we don't know
drops out, because nl equals

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.530
to k, these things cancel.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:49.580
So when l is equal to k we get
that Enk 2, the second order

00:21:49.580 --> 00:22:07.980
correction to the energy, is
n0 k delta H n1 k in v hat.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.670
That's it.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.260
That's your second
correction to the energy,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.945
and that's very nice.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.900
Why do we say that's it?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.470
Because we actually
have the answer for n1.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.600
So we can find the
complete formula for this.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.490
I'll write it here.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.090
After a couple of
steps of algebra

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:37.580
this gives minus the
sum over p delta H

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:51.220
nkp over Ep0 minus En0 squared.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.185
Look at that formula.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.720
It has the same form as
the second order correction

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.980
to nondegenerate states.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:08.630
Same look, except
that you only sum over

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:12.680
the states that are outside
the degenerate space.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.820
It was exactly of this form the
second order energy correction.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.375
So it's kind of nice and simple.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.020
But let's look at
this equation again.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.560
And here is the thing that
would have been shocking

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.050
if we didn't do this right.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:43.700
If we had set l different from k
here, if l is different from k,

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:48.200
then this term is 0.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.610
If we didn't think--

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.560
if we hadn't suspected
that the state n1 k had

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.180
a piece along with
the generate subspace,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.980
we would have not
introduced it, and we

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.260
would have had not this term.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.700
And the equation
would have become

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.330
this equal to 0, which is 0.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.610
You have there n1 of k.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.190
And you can look at it,
and look at it for hours,

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.170
and it's just not 0.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.220
So unless we have this
piece, the equation

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.170
doesn't make sense.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.300
So this proves that the state
must develop a component

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.480
along the degenerate subspace.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.080
And let's now finally get it.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.130
It's just one line
at this point.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.470
We don't have to do much.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:57.310
So when l is different from
k, l different from k--

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:59.170
so what do we get
for the equation?

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.700
Look at it there.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:10.700
We can solve directly
for the piece n0 l

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:17.710
n1 k is equal to-- solve
for the second term.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.500
The other term goes on
the right-hand side.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:38.440
So n0 l delta H n1 k
over Enk 1 minus Enl 1.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:47.650
And here is another thing
that ended up working well.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.750
If the degeneracy
had not been broken,

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.240
we're doing l different from k.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.200
If some of these
would have been 0,

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.630
this would give you
0 in the denominator.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.470
This wouldn't work out.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.610
So it was urgent here
that all the degeneracy

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.980
had been broken to first order.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.830
Otherwise, you couldn't have
computed this state this way.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:28.570
This means that n1 k, to wrap
it up here, in the subspace vn,

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:33.660
is the sum over l
different from k

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.940
because this inner
product only makes

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:44.100
sense for l different from k of
n0 l times this coefficient, 1

00:26:44.100 --> 00:27:00.375
over Enk 1 minus Enl
1 n0 l delta H n1 k.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.520
It's a lot of work to get here.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.910
But actually, it's good
that we could get there.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.600
If you even want to
write it more explicitly,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.120
you substitute what n1 k is.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.270
And it goes there.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.060
Now, there is something a
little strange at first sight.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.750
If you look at it, you
say, OK, let's see.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.670
This is first order in
perturbation theory.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:45.740
We had to go to the
second order equation.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.910
And that's why we seem to
be counting orders wrong,

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.390
because this is first
order in perturbation.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.310
This is another order
in perturbation.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.560
That's second order
in perturbation.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.430
That's, indeed, delta
H n1 is second order.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.290
Delta H n1 appear
to second order.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.910
So how come we get a
first order term that

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:12.380
seems to depend on
second order stuff?

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.500
Maybe it's wrong
what we did in the--

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.280
we thought we were going to
get the degenerate first order

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.860
piece from the second
equation, but here this

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.824
is hitting us back.

00:28:25.824 --> 00:28:28.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.700
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.390
The denominator is
also first order.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.760
So this is second order.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.990
This is first order.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.000
The ratio is first order.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.350
All is good here.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.510
This is a good formula.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.100
This is a real result.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.440
So this completes our analysis
of degenerate perturbation

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.900
theory when the perturbation,
the first order perturbation,

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.040
splits all the levels.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:03.610
What we're going to do now is
degenerate perturbation theory

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.640
when the first order
correction doesn't

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.650
split any of the levels.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.090
Doesn't split them at all.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.220
What happens?

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.290
What can we do?
