00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
PROFESSOR: Today, we
continue with scattering.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.380
And we begin by reviewing
what were the main ideas that

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.510
have already been explored.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.330
And here they are.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.960
I've summarized the main
results on the blackboard.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.440
And we begin with an
expansion of our solutions

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.770
for the case of
central potentials.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.750
This psi effect
represents a solution away

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.710
from the scattering center.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.880
The scattering
center is this region

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.030
where there is a potential
that the particles fill.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.700
And this solution that
we've written on top

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.810
is a solution written
for spherically symmetric

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.020
potentials in the case
that the potential is 0.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.670
That is, that solution is
valid away from the potential.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.500
We constructed it with the
free particle solutions--

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.260
the jl and the nl of kr--

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.980
of the spherical Schrodinger
or radial Schrodinger equation.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.410
In particular, we
identified these objects

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.570
called phase shifts
that we discussed

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.740
in the process of scattering
with spherical waves.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.480
And the result is that the
way we introduce the phase

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.170
shifts, the tangent
of the phase shift

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.250
is determined by the ratio
of these two coefficients, Bl

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.390
over Al.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.300
So there's a phase
shift for every value

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.530
of l beginning from l equals 0.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.280
Then we have that given that
relation, the solution above,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
when you use asymptotic
expansions for jl and nl,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.880
takes that form with a sine
of kr minus l pi over 2

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.880
plus a phase shift, which
is another way where

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.450
you can read the phase
shift of your solution.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.410
We're going to focus today for
a little while in understanding

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.140
the physics of the
phase shifts and how

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.440
you find the phase shifts.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
But supposing you
find the phase shifts

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.320
and that was the derivation that
was very non-trivial that we

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.010
did last time, we find what
this scattering amplitude

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.570
is in terms of the phase shift.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.690
So this was our main hard work
establishing that formula.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.240
Once you have that formula,
that f of k in preliminary work

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.280
was shown to represent the
scattering solution far

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160
away from the source.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.230
Far away from the source
we have the incoming wave

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.260
and the outgoing spherical
wave modulated by fk of theta.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.090
Now, in general, you can
have an fk of theta and phi,

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.480
but then the phase shift method
is not quite suitable for that.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.260
For that, we will discuss
some other methods today

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.590
that can allow us to do that.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.830
So once you have this f of k,
you know the wave far away.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.270
You know how it contributes
to the cross-section,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.870
and you know how
the phase shifts.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.650
Each phase shift contributes
to a total cross-section,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.850
which is given here.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.280
So these were our main results.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.510
So let's leave this
results here and discuss

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.070
your general computation
of a phase shift.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.880
You're given a problem, maybe
like the problems in the p set,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.620
and you need to find
the phase shift.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.050
So where do you begin?

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.600
There's nothing in
there that seems

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.412
to say, OK, this
is the way you're

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.620
going to find the phase shit.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.738
So let's do this general
computation of the phase shift.

00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:24.060
Computation of the phase shifts.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.820
So I think you all know--

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.050
and there's clear intuition--
that if you want to figure out

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.210
the phase shift,
at some point you

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.810
have to look at this
region, r less than a,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.400
where the potential is.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.350
Because after all, the phase
shift depends on the potential.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.690
So that's unavoidable.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.550
You have to get dirty with
that potential and solve it.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.240
So what is the equation
that you have to solve?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.650
It's the radial
Schrodinger equation.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.220
So you have to solve--

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.350
you set energy in the
Schrodinger equation equal h

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.730
squared k squared
over 2m because we're

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.810
using k from the
beginning to represent

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.190
the energy of the state.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.590
So energy is going to be that.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.940
And the radial
Schrodinger equation

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.770
is minus h squared
over 2m, d second dr

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.220
squared plus the potential.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.450
Finally, the potential shows up.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.190
You have to solve that.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.430
Plus the potential centrifugal
barrier, h squared l times l

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.260
plus 1 over 2m r squared.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:06:01.460
All that acting on
a solution u sub l--

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.730
I will put the k as well of r--

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.820
equal the energy,
which is h squared

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.740
k squared over 2m ulk of r.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.950
So this step cannot be avoided.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.500
You have to solve it.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.870
You have to solve this equation.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.950
So you solve this
for r less than a.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.570
This for r less than a.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.910
You have some hints
of what you're

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:52.630
going to encounter because
you know from solving

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.510
radial equations that ul
behaves like r to the l plus 1

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.550
as r goes to 0.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.370
That's a boundary condition
for the l-th wave.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.180
And well, with that, you're
supposed to solve for this ul.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.030
OK.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.905
So you solve for this ul.

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:19.050
And so what?

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.270
Where are the phase shifts?

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.610
You're done with it.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.300
And you need to know where
are the phase shifts.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.390
Well, remember our
notation is that we have

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.130
a radial function, l of k of r.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.250
In the radial equation you
know that the radial part

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.710
of the solution of the
Schrodinger equation is--

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.850
the full solution
is a radial part.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.870
So ylm.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.820
In this case, yl0.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:54.030
But this radial thing
is ulk of r over r.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.170
That is presumably something
you still remember,

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.740
that the radial
solution was u over r.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:02.400
OK.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.150
So you've solved it.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.990
You've got this quantity.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:13.030
And you say, all right,
what do I do next?

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.070
Well, what you
have to do next is

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.700
to match to the solutions
that lie outside.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.020
There is these solutions that
hold for r greater than a,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.630
where the potential is 0.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.750
So those have to be
matched to this solution.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.002
So let me draw a little diagram.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.820
We have diagram for r.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.830
And here is a.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:58.120
In this region, the
solution is Rlk of r.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.730
That's the solution.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:06.040
And this solution here, this
is for the l-th partial wave.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.180
The solution outside is
the l-th partial wave

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.510
that I've written there.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:26.660
So the solution here is some
Al Jl of kr plus Bl nl of kr.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.740
So this one you've
determined already.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.770
You did solve the
Schrodinger equation.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.940
We cannot help you.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.730
Now it depends on what
potential you have.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.080
You have to solve it each time.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.850
But you now have the
solution up to A.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.690
But you know the general
form of the solution

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:53.810
for r greater than A, and
these two have to match here.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.090
There might be
cases in which there

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.430
is a delta function
precisely here,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.900
like in the p set, in
which case you know

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.540
that with a delta function,
the derivatives have

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.550
to match in a funny way.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.800
There's a discontinuity
in the derivatives,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.770
and the wave functions
do have to match.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.200
So let's assume, in
general, that there's

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.600
no delta function there.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.340
And let's do that case.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.910
If you have a delta function
you could do a similar case.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.210
And the way to do
this is actually

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.770
to match the wave functions
and the derivatives.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:41.860
So matching at r equal a.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:56.410
So you must have Rlk of a is
equal to Al Jl of ka plus Bl

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.240
nl of ka.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.920
The derivatives must also match.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.340
Let me use primes to
indicate derivatives

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.100
with respect to the argument.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.340
Most people use that for primes.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:21.250
So the derivative of this
quantity Rlk a prime--

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.470
so that means the
derivative of this function

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.822
of r evaluated at a.

00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:33.380
And you differentiate
with respect to a in order

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.770
to get the units not to change.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.930
You can multiply by an a.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.860
You have to multiply then by
an a on the right-hand side

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.720
when I take the derivative.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.300
Now, when I take the derivative
here with respect to r,

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.710
I take the derivative of J
with respect to the argument,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.150
and then the relative of the
argument with respect to r.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.610
That takes out the k out.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:13.300
Since I put an a, I get a
ka times Al J prime l at ka.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.460
The derivative of J with
respect to the argument

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:25.205
evaluated at ka plus
Bl n prime l at ka.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.480
So here it is.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.630
I've matched the function
and the derivatives.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.820
So I'm giving you
an algorithm to do

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.000
it any time and all times.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.610
At this point, the
right thing to do

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.410
is to divide the
equations because that

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:53.120
gets rid of a lot of things
that we are not interested in.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.630
We're not interested in
anything except the phase shift.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.490
That's all we want,
the phase shift.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.610
So how are we going to
get the phase shift?

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.910
Well, the phase shift
comes from Bl over Al.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.070
So let's form the ratio here.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:20.600
So I'll form the ratio aRlk
prime of a over Rlk at a.

00:13:24.528 --> 00:13:29.630
And then I have ka.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.650
That's still there.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.400
And then let me divide--

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.180
I'm going to divide
these two things,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.430
but then I can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.080
by Al.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:52.110
So here I'll have the ratio
of Jl prime ka plus Bl

00:13:52.110 --> 00:14:02.840
over Al n prime l of ka over--

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.450
my equation came out
a little unbalanced,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.190
but it's not so bad.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.660
ka.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.570
Let's lower this.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.770
OK.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.700
Numerator.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:27.830
And here you get Jl of ka
plus Bl over Al nl of ka.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:41.380
But this is nothing but ka
and the ratio Jl prime at ka

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:50.230
minus tan delta k-- no, delta l.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.890
That's what the
ratio Bl over Al is.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:14.490
n prime l of ka over Jl of
ka minus tan delta l eta.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.090
Not eta.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.140
It's n, actually. n of ka.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.850
That's it.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.420
Actually, we've
solved the problem.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:27.600
Why?

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.830
Because this number is supposed
to be known because you've

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:36.150
solved the equation.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.060
You did solve the equation,
the Schrodinger equation,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.310
from r equals 0 to r equal a.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.880
It's completely solved.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.640
So that number is known.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.890
The Bessel functions,
spherical Bessels, are known.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.100
And all you need to
find is tangent delta,

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.070
and that equation determines it.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.130
Should I write the
formula for tangent delta?

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:03.630
OK.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.470
Let's write.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.250
Let's write it.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.280
Yeah.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.610
OK.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.830
One minute to write it.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.650
It's just solving from here.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:20.070
Tan delta of l is
equal J prime l

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:34.740
at ka minus Rl prime at a
over kRl of k of a Jl of ka

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:47.790
over nl prime at ka minus
Rl prime of a over kRl of a,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.320
that same constant nl of ka.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.720
So that's solving
for tangent delta

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.220
from this side
equal to this side.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.270
This shows that, in
principle, once you

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:16.829
have the solution
from 0 to a, you

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.890
have solved the problem
of the phase shift.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.780
You know the phase shift.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.170
It's a matter of just
calculating them.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.200
Might be a little messy.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.780
But if your calculation
is important

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.780
and this is a problem
you really want to solve,

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.050
you will be willing to look
at the spherical Bessel

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:42.020
functions, which, in fact,
are trigonometric functions

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.020
times powers.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:49.080
They're not as difficult as
the ordinary Bessel functions.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.910
So these are easy to work with.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.650
And these things are, many
times, done numerically.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.700
For a given potential, you
calculate the first 10 phase

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.730
shifts, and you get a solution
that is very accurate.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:10.740
So there's a lot of power
in this formulation.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.180
So you have a solution.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.770
You have the phase shifts.
