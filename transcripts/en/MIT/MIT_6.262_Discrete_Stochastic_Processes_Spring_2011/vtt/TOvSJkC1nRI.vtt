00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.130
PROFESSOR: OK, I guess it's
time to get started.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.650
Next lecture, I'm going to try
to summarize what we've done

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.160
so that I want to try to finish
what we're going to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.870
finish for the term today.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.740
And that means we have a lot
of topics that all get

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.440
slightly squeezed in together,
including the martingale

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.200
convergence theorem and the
strengthening of the strong

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.870
law of large numbers and the
Kolmogorov's submartingale

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.610
inequalities and stopped
martingales.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.100
So all of these are fairly
major topics.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.610
One thing that it means is that
we certainly aren't going

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.200
to do much with the martingale
convergence theorem.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.300
It's a major theorem
and advanced work.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.130
What we're trying to do
here is just give you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.870
some flavor of it.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.460
The other things, as we move up
the chain there, we want to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.920
know more and more about it.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.070
And the things on top certainly
explain what's going

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.320
on in the things below.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.280
OK, let's review what
a martingale is.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.660
A sequence of random variables
is a martingale if it

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.680
satisfies this funny
looking condition.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.010
When I write it this way, it's
not completely obvious what

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.660
it's saying.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.130
But I think we know now the
expected value of one thing,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.900
of one random variable, given a
set of random variables, is

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.010
really a random variable
in its own right.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.660
And that's a random variable,
which is a function of those

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.160
conditioning random variables.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.310
So expected value of Zn,
given Zn minus 1 to Z1.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.520
It's a random variable.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.210
It maps each sample point to the
conditional expectation of

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.930
Zn, conditional in
Z1 to Zn minus 1.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.710
For martingale, this expectation
has to be this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.450
random variable, Z
sub n minus one.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.280
It has to be the most recent
random variable you've seen.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.810
And then last time, we proved
this lemma, a pretty major

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.870
lemma, which says, for a
martingale, expected value of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.750
Zn is equal to of Zn, given not
all of the past, but just

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.680
a certain number of elements of
the past Zn conditional and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.150
Zi, back to Z1.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.360
That's equal to Zi.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.960
Expected value of Zn is equal
to the expected value of Zi.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.330
We didn't talk about
this one last time.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.150
But this is obvious
in terms of this.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.230
If you take the expected value
of this over all of the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.980
conditioning random variables,
then what you get is just the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.940
expected value of Z sub i.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.070
So that's what this says.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.610
OK, question now.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.610
Why is it that if you condition
on more random

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.390
variables than just Zn in the
paths, if you condition on

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.280
things into the future,
including Z sub n its self,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.480
why is the expected value
of Zn given Zm down

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.720
to Zn down to Z1?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.250
Why is that equal to Zn and
not equal to Zn minus 1?

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.990
If you understand this, you
understand what conditional

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.720
expectations are.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.370
If you don't understand it,
you've got to spend some time

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.910
really thinking about what
conditional expectations are.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.290
OK, how many people can see why
this, in fact, has to be

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.530
Zn and not something else?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.350
AUDIENCE: We know Zn already.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.550
PROFESSOR: What?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.570
AUDIENCE: Isn't it-- don't
you know Zn already?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.640
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.810
Since you know the n already,
then you know it.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.750
That's exactly what it says.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.660
And we'll talk more about this
later because we actually use

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.490
this a bunch of times
when we're going on.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.350
But what it says is that for
any given value of each of

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.910
these random variables, in other
words, for a given value

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.540
of Z sub n, the expected
value of Z sub n--

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.410
I mean, if I just wrote it, it's
what's the expected value

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.190
of Z sub n, given Z sub n?

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.020
What's the expected
value of Z sub n--

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.660
I'll make it even easier.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.920
And you can see it
more clearly.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.300
What's the expected value of Z
sub n, given that Z sub n is

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.620
equal to a particular
value z sub n.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.340
OK, now I hope you can see
why it is that this is

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.780
equal to Z sub n.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.950
That's the only thing
that the random

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.400
variable Z sub n can be.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.540
For this sample point and the
conditioning, we're assuming

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.876
the sample value for which Z sub
n is equal to little z sub

00:05:45.876 --> 00:05:49.060
n, and therefore that's
what this random

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.690
variable has to be.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.370
That's what you said
in one sentence.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.040
And I'm saying it in
five sentences.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.920
It's hard enough that you want
to say it in five sentences

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.170
because this is not
an obvious thing.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.230
It's not an obvious thing until
you really have a sense

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.430
of what these conditional
expectations mean.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.640
And that's part of our function
for the last couple

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.610
of weeks, to sort out what
those things mean because

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.550
that's part of understanding
what martingales are doing.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:28.410
OK, when we go one step further
on this, we've said

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.760
that the expected value of Z sub
n, given Z sub i back to Z

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.460
sub n is Z sub i, so the
expected value of Z sub n,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.720
only given Z sub 1, is
equal to Z sub 1.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.460
That's what this says, an
expected value of Z sub n then

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.670
is equal to the expected
value of Z sub 1.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.350
It says these marginal
expectations are all the same.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.710
Yes?

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.407
AUDIENCE: Why don't you just
say that the expectation of

00:06:57.407 --> 00:06:59.626
the Zs are constant.

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:03.835
I mean, it seems like this is
kind of a roundabout way of

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:06.020
saying that.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in a sense.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.210
But if you want to--

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.790
almost all the examples you
can think of, it's hard to

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.540
figure out what these Z sub n's
are because the Z sub n's

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.450
are given in terms of all of the
previous random variables.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.050
If you want to sort out what a
martingale is, and you can't

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.870
even understand what Z sub 1
is, then you're in trouble.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.720
I mean, it makes the theorem
more abstract to say the

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.770
expected value of Z sub n is
a constant random variable

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.020
rather than saying which
random variable it is.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.630
And it's obvious what random
variable it is.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.290
I mean, Z1 is one
example of it.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.230
So you're right.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.912
You could say that way.

00:07:48.912 --> 00:07:56.660
OK, so we talked about a number
of simple examples of

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.330
martingales last time.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.960
All of these examples assume
that the expected value of the

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.640
magnitude of Z sub n is less
than infinity for all n.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.370
Remember, this does not mean
that the expected value of Z

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.110
sub n is bounded over all n.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.290
I mean, you can have expected
value of Z to the n

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.380
can be 2 to the n.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.780
It can be shooting off to
infinity very, very fast.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.690
But it still is finite
for every value of n.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.550
That's what this
assumption is.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.340
Later on, when we talk about
the martingale convergence

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.480
theorem, we'll assume that
these expectations are

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.729
bounded, which is a much, much
stronger constraint.

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:48.020
OK, we talked about these
examples last time.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.500
All of them are pretty important
because any time

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.460
you're trying to do a problem
with martingales, trying to

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.440
prove something for martingales,
what I like to do

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:05.230
first is to look at all the
simple examples I know and try

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.140
to get some insight from them
as to whether the result is

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.402
true or whether it's not true.

00:09:10.402 --> 00:09:14.650
And if you can't see from the
examples what's going on, then

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.960
you're sort of stuck for the
most part, unless you're lucky

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.340
enough to construct the kind
of proof you would

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.670
find in a math book.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.250
Now math book theorem
proofs are beautiful

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.920
because they're the--

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.710
I mean, mathematicians work to
get the shortest possible

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.960
proof they can, which has
no holes in it at all.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.190
And that makes it
very elegant.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.150
But when you're trying to
understand it, what is often

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.340
done is somebody starts out
understanding a theorem, and

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.190
they write a proof which
runs for three pages.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.580
And then they think about
it for two weeks.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.450
They cut it down to one page.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.620
They think about it for
another two weeks.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.610
They cut it down
to half a page.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.000
And then they publish it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.640
And all they do is publish
the half page.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.050
Everybody is stuck.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.190
Nobody knows where
this came from.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.050
So what I'm trying to do here
is, at least in some cases, to

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.640
give you a little more than the
half page to give you some

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.280
idea of where these things come
from, the extent I can.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.340
OK so the zero mean
random walk--

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:29.080
if Z sub n is equal to some of
Xi, where Xi are IID and zero

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.220
mean , then this zero mean
random walk is, in fact, a

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.440
martingale, just satisfies
the conditions.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.830
This one is probably the most
important of all of the simple

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:50.160
examples because it says if
Z sub n is a sum of random

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.230
variables--

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.370
don't know what the random
variables so are-- the

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.400
condition on the random
variables is the expected

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.345
value of X sub i, given all
the previous ones is 0.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.790
This is a general example
because every martingale in

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:11.460
the world you can look at the
increments of that martingale,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:21.850
namely you can define X sub
n to be Z sub n minus

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.130
Z sub n minus 1.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.010
And as soon as you do that,
X sub n satisfies

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.560
this condition here.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:35.040
And what you've got for sure is
a martingale, so that this

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.890
condition here, that the X sub
is are satisfying, is really

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.300
the same as a martingale
condition.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.730
It's just that when people are
talking about martingales,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.310
they're talking about the sums
of random variables.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.780
Here we're just talking about
the random variables

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.670
themselves.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.950
It's like when we talk about sum
of IID random variables,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.440
we prove the laws of large
numbers and everything.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.090
What we're really talking
about there

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.120
is IID random variables.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.510
What we're really talking about
here is these random

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.430
variables, which has the
property that no matter what's

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.640
happened in the past, the
expected value of this new

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.210
random variable is equal to 0.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.570
People call these fair games.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.720
And they call martingales
examples of fair games.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.710
And martingale, the expected
value of Z sub n, you can

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.710
think of it as you're
expecting that

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.330
worth of time n.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.880
And with these underlying random
variables, the X sub i,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:43.100
the X sub i is, in a sense,
your profit at time n.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.130
And what this says is your
profit at time n is

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.190
independent of everything in the
past, independent of every

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.680
sample value of everything
in the past.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.210
And this is why people
call it fair game.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:04.100
It's really a very strong
definition of a fair game.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.650
I mean, it's saying
an awful lot.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.290
I mean, everybody says
life is not fair.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.150
Surely by this definition, life
is not even close to fair

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.670
because when you look
at all your past--

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.070
I mean, you try to learn
from your past.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.540
This is saying in these kinds
of gambling games, you can't

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.150
learn from the past.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.660
You can't do anything with it
so long as you're interested

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.690
only in the expectation.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:38.000
The expectation of X sub i is
equal to 0, no matter what all

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.450
the earlier random
variables are.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.970
This, I think, gives you a sense
of what a martingale is,

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.140
probably better than the
original definition.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.340
OK, another one we talked
about last time,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.110
this is very specific.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.900
Suppose that X sub i is equal
to the product of two random

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.070
variables, U sub i
times Y sub i.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:05.870
The U sub i here are IID
equiprobable, plus or minus 1.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.780
And the Y sub is are independent
of the U sub is.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.120
They can be anything at all.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.610
And when you take these Y sub
is, which are anything at all,

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.650
but these quantities here, which
are IID 1 and minus 1,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:25.760
when you look at this product
here, any positive number this

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.420
can be is equiprobable with the

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.680
corresponding negative number.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.100
And that means when you take
the expectation of X sub i,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.670
given any old thing in the past,
this U sub i is enough

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.300
to make the expectation
equal to 0.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.630
So this is a fairly strong kind
of example also, which

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.150
gives you a sense of what
these things are.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.370
Product form martingales--

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.110
you use product form martingales
primarily to find

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.210
counter examples of theorems.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.140
If you stated a theorem
and it isn't true--

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.420
almost all the examples I know
of of reasonable martingale

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.620
theorems which are not true,
you look at a product

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:10.030
martingale, and very often
you look at this product

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:17.090
martingale down here, and you
find out either that the

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.320
theorem is not true, which lets
you stop looking at it.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.470
Or it says, well, it still
isn't clear from that.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:31.120
OK, so the product form
martingale, there's a sequence

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.190
of IID unit-mean random
variables.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:41.200
And Zn, which is the product,
is then a martingale, if you

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.940
assume this condition
up here, of course.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:49.870
And this condition here, the
probability that the n-th

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:58.480
order product, namely the
product of n of these sample

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:06.290
values, if you get one
0, the product is 0.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.240
So you're done.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.630
So the only question is,
do you get all 1s?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.140
Or do you get something
other than all 1s?

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.880
If you get all 1s, then the
product of these random

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.160
variables is 2 to the n.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.060
You get 2 to the n with
probability 2 to the minus n.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.070
And you get zero with all the
rest of the probability.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.660
The limit as n goes to infinity
if Z sub n is equal

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:42.360
to zero with probability
1, namely eventually

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.600
you go down to 0.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.380
And you stay there
forever after.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.220
And with this very small
probability, you get to some

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.110
humongous number.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.555
And you keep going up until
eventually you lose, and you

00:16:56.555 --> 00:16:57.950
go down to 0.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.290
So the limit for the expected
value of Z sub n--

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.900
for every n the expected value
of Z sub n is equal to 1.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.609
That's what makes this
example interesting.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.625
The limit of the expected
value of the Z sub

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:13.680
ns is equal to 1.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.190
But the Z sub ns themselves go
to 0 with probability 1.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.200
And the reason for that is that
you had this enormous

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.540
growth here with very
small probability.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.390
But it's enough to keep the
expectation equal to 1.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.060
OK, then we started to talk
about sub and super

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.900
martingales.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.050
And I told you if you can't
remember what the definition

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.290
of a submartingale is in terms
of is it less than or equal or

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.570
greater than or equal, just
remember that it's not

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.020
what it should be.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.430
It's the opposite of
what it should be.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.810
So the expected value of Z sub
n given the past is greater

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.220
than or equal to Z
sub n minus 1.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.270
That means it's a
submartingale.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.620
In other words, submartingales
grow in time.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.300
Supermartingales
shrink in time.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.540
And that's strange.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.080
But that's the way it is.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.870
If this quantity is a
submartingale, then minus Zn

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.150
is a supermartingale
and vice versa.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.280
So I'm going to only talk about
submartingales from now

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.660
on because supermartingales just
do everything the same,

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.400
but just look at minus signs
instead of plus signs.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.350
So why bother yourself
with one thing

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.450
extra to think about?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.870
So for submartingales, the
expected value of Z sub n

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:48.270
given the past, given part of
the past from i down to 1, is

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.940
greater than or equal
to Z sub i.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.850
That's essentially the same as
that theorem we've stated

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.980
before, which said that for
martingales, the expected

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:02.780
values of Zn given Zi down to
Z1 was equal to Z sub i.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.160
You remember we proved that in
detail last time because that

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.680
was a crucially important
theorem.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.080
You take that proof and you
put this inequality in it

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.640
instead of a quality, and it
immediately gives you this.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.080
You just follow that proof
step by step, putting an

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.200
equality in in place
of a quality.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.900
And same thing here, the
expected value of Z sub n is

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.440
greater than or equal to the
expected value of Z sub i.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.172
That's true for all i.

00:19:35.172 --> 00:19:39.700
So the expected value of Zn is
also greater than or equal to

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.400
the expected value Z1.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.500
In other words, the expected
values of these random

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.740
variables, in fact,
always grow.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.970
Or if they don't grow, they
at least stay the same.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.220
They can't shrink.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.620
OK, we started to talk about
convex functions last time.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.420
I want to remind you
what they are.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.950
A function which carries the
real numbers into the real

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.940
numbers is convex, if each
tangent of the curve lies on

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:13.870
or below the curve.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.450
Here's a picture of it.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.410
Here's a function h of x, a
one-dimensional function.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.880
So you can draw x on the line.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.280
And h of x is something which
goes up and down.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.680
And here's another example.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.030
H of x is equal to the
magnitude of x.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.590
You're usually used to thinking
of convex functions

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.580
in terms of functions that
have a positive second

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.510
derivative.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.460
Taking the geometric view, you
get something considerably

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:49.900
more general because it includes
all of these cases,

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.490
as well as all of these cases.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.770
And this idea of tangents lying
on or below the line

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.520
gives you the linkage here.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:06.390
You have something which comes
down, goes to 0, and

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.610
then goes up again.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.300
Think of drawing tangents
to this curve.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:17.270
Tangents have to have a slope
starting here and

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.160
going around to here.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.820
And all of those tangents
hit at that point there.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.800
So this is a very pathological
thing.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.770
But all the tangents indeed
do lie below the curve.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.885
So you've satisfied
the condition.

00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:35.390
The lemma is Jensen's
inequality.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.560
It says, if h is convex and Z
is a random variable with

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:45.220
finite expectation, then h of
the expected value of Z is

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.090
less than or equal to the
expected value of h of Z. This

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.400
seems sort of obvious,
perhaps.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.700
It's one of those things which
either seems obvious or it

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.860
doesn't seem obvious.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.580
And if it doesn't seem obvious,
it doesn't become

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.270
obvious terribly easily.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.390
But what I want to do here is
to convince you of why it's

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.290
true by looking at a little
triangle here.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.230
I can think of the random
variable Z as having three

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.450
possible values--

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.790
one over here where we get
this point comes into the

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:29.140
curve, one here, and one here.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.440
Now if I take those three
possible values of x and I

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.020
think of assigning all
possible probability

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.920
assignments to those three
possible values, what happens?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.390
If I assign all the probability
over here, I get

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.460
that point.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.980
If I assign all the probability

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.530
here, I get that point.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:49.110
If I assign all the probability

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.440
here, I get that point.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.280
And for everything else, it
lies inside that triangle.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.520
And you can convince yourselves

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.410
of that pretty easily.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.190
So for all of those probability
measures where the

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.570
expected value lies on this
line, what you get is

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:16.600
something between this and this
as the expected value of

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.990
h of Z. So you get something
above the line for the

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.690
expected value for h.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.780
Of expected values of Z, you
just get this point right

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.000
there, which is clearly smaller
than anything you can

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.990
generate out of that triangle
or quadrilateral or any kind

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:47.790
of straight line figure that you
draw, which is the set of

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.590
expected values you can get from
probabilities using the

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.995
points on that--

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.820
well, it's what I said it was.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:06.030
OK, Jensen's inequality leads
to the following theorem.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.880
And I'm not going to prove
it here in class.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.930
It's one of those theorems
which is sort of

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:15.230
obvious and not quite.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.710
So if you want to see the proof,
you can look at it.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.040
Or if you want to, you
can just believe it.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.530
If Z sub n is a martingale or
it's a submartingale and if h

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:32.860
is convex, then the expected
value of the magnitude of h of

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.580
Zn is less than infinity
for all n.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:42.180
Then h of Zn is a
submartingale.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.580
In other words, when you have
that convex function, you go

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.130
from something which is a
martingale, which will be what

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:53.180
you would get on the line to
something which is bigger than

00:24:53.180 --> 00:25:00.540
that, so that what you get is
the fact that expected value

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:05.780
of h of Z is, in fact, growing
with time, faster than the

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.380
martingale itself is growing.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:17.790
OK, so one example of this is
if z of n is a martingale,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:22.700
then the absolute value of Z
sub n is a submartingale.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.530
Submartingales are
martingales.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.100
Martingales are submartingales
also.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.990
So I don't have to keep saying
that if it's a martingale or a

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.260
submartingale.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.650
I can just say if it's
a submartingale.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:43.430
This theorem is usually stated
as, if Z of n is a martingale,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:48.070
then h of Zn is a submartingale,
which is true.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.950
But just as obviously, if Zn is
a submartingale, which is

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.970
more general, h of Zn is
also a submartingale.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.750
So you don't get out of the
realm of submartingales by

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.760
taking convex functions.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:10.290
And you also get that Z squared
is a martingale.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.110
And E to the rZn is a martingale
because all of

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:15.410
those are convex functions.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.650
So when you want to look at any
of those, you just go from

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:24.560
talking about a martingale to
talking about a submartingale.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.920
And life is easy again.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.050
OK, major topic-- stopped
martingales.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.670
We've talked about stopping
rules before.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.820
And a stopping rule, we were
interested in stopping rules

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:47.860
when we were mostly talking
about renewal processes.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.990
But stopping rules can be
applied to any sequence of

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.150
random variables at all.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.140
What a stopping rule is, you
remember, is you have a

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.230
sequence of random variables,
any kind of random variable.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.780
And a stopping rule is a rule
where the time that you stop

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.530
is determined by the things that
you've seen up until the

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.430
time that you stop.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.760
You can't peak at
future values.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.230
You have to look at these sample
values one by one as

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.300
they arrive.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.910
And a stopping rule is something
which, when you get

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.010
to the point you want to stop,
you know that you want to stop

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:29.470
there from the sample values
you've already observed.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:34.090
So when you're playing poker
with somebody, which I think

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.680
we talked about before, and you
make a bet and you lose,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.410
you cannot withdraw your bet.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.320
You cannot say, I stopped!

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.570
I stopped before!

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.330
The time that you stop depends
on what you've already seen up

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.650
until the time that you stop.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.500
We talked about possibly
defective

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.580
random variables before.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.850
I realized I never defined
a possibly

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.890
defective random variable.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.710
In fact, somebody asked me
afterwards if it could be just

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.380
any old thing at all.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.580
And I said, no.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.050
And here's what it is.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:24.940
It's a mapping from the sample
space to a set of real values,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.620
to the extended real values.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.540
And it has the property that
for a defective random

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.780
variable, the mapping can
give you plus infinity.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.680
Or it can give you
minus infinity.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.120
And it can give you either one
of those with positive

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.820
probability rather than
just 0 probability.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.410
So it applies to these cases
where you have a threshold, a

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.950
single threshold, for
a random walk.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:52.770
And you might cross the
threshold, or you might never

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.090
cross the threshold.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.890
So it applies to conditions
where sometimes you stop and

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:01.000
sometimes you just keep
on going forever.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.530
So it's nice for that
kind of situation.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.770
The other provisos a random
variable back when we defined

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.540
random variables still hold
for a possibly defective

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.370
random variable.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.100
So you have a distribution
function.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.740
It's just the distribution
function doesn't necessarily

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:21.460
go to 1, and it doesn't
necessarily start at 0.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.270
It could be somewhere
in between.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.720
OK, so a stop process for a
possibly defective stopping

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:38.460
time satisfies Z sub n star,
which is Z sub n star is the

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.710
stopping time.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.790
Let me start on that.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.300
We have now defined
stopping rules.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.280
We now want to define
a stop process.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.810
A stop process is a process
which runs along until you

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.640
decide you're going to stop.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.720
But before when we stopped, the
game was over and nothing

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.930
else happened.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.050
Here, the idea is to game
continues forever.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.790
But you stop playing, OK?

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.920
So the sequence of random
variables continues forever.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.000
But the random variable of
interest to you is this

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.240
quantity Z sub n star, which at
the point you stopped, then

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.160
all subsequent Z sub n's
are just equal to

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.090
that stopped value.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.480
So you're talking about some
kind of gambling game now,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.110
perhaps, where you
play for a while.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.630
And you're playing some
game where the

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:43.580
game continues forever.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.100
And you make your bets
according to

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.010
some strange algorithm.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:50.320
And when you've made $10,
you say, that's

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.530
all I want to make.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.780
I'm happy with that.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.600
And I'm not going to become the
kind of gambler who can

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.280
never stop.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.760
So I'm going to stop
at that point.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:06.010
So your capital remains $10
forever after, although the

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.170
game keeps on going.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.170
And if you start out with a
capital of $10 and you lose it

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.080
all and you can't borrow
anything, then you stop also

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.680
when your capital becomes
minus $10.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.590
So you can see that this is
a useful thing when you're

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.470
talking about threshold
crossings because when you

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.040
have a random walk and you have
a threshold crossing, you

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.840
can stop at that point.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.550
And then, you just stay
there forever after.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:35.330
But if you cross the other
threshold, you stay there

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:36.770
forever after.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.405
And that makes it very
convenient because you can

00:31:39.405 --> 00:31:43.380
look at what has happens out
at infinity as a way saying

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.500
what the value of a game was
at the time you stopped.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:49.170
So you don't have to worry about
what was the value of

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.810
the game at the stopping
point.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.950
You can keep on going forever.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:59.200
And you can talk about what
the stopped process is.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.430
And my guess--

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.530
or if you've read ahead
a little bit,

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.770
which I hope you have--

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.960
you will know that the main
theorem here is that if you

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.510
start out with a Martingale and
you stop it someplace, you

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.690
still have a Martingale.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.570
In other words, if you add
stopping as one of your

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:25.450
options in gambling and it's a
fair game, if you can find a

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:30.010
fair game any place, and
you stop, then it's

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:30.960
still a fair game.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.220
The stop process is
still a fair game.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:40.070
And that's as it should be
because if it's a fair game,

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.010
you should be able to stop.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:46.300
So for example, a given gambling
strategy is Zn is the

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.770
net worth at time n.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.610
You can modify that
to stop when Zn

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.380
reaches some given value.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.620
So the stopped process remains
at that value forever.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.790
And Zn follows the original
strategy.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.800
Here's the main theorem here.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:09.020
If j is a possibly defective
stopping rule for a Martingale

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.250
or a sub-Martingale and Zn
greater than or equal to 1,

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:19.390
then the stop process, Zn star,
is a Martingale if the

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:21.980
original processes is a
Martingale and it's a

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.420
sub-Martingale if the original
process is a Martingale.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.770
And the proof is
the following.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.670
You can almost say this
looks obvious.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.090
If it looks obvious to you, you

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.750
should admire your intuition.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.190
If it doesn't look obvious to
you, you should admire your

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.570
mathematical insight.

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:49.660
And either way, the kind of
intuition is that before

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:55.006
stopping occurs, Z sub n star
is equal to Z sub n.

00:33:55.006 --> 00:33:59.360
And after you stop, Z sub
n star is constant.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.170
So it satisfies a Martingale
condition because it's not

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.790
going up and it's
not going down.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.310
But in fact, when you try to
think through the whole thing,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.560
it's not quite enough.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.899
It's the kind of thing where
after you look at it for a

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:20.260
while, you say, yes,
it has to be true.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:20.960
But why?

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.409
And you can't explain
why it's true.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:26.260
I'm going to go through
the proof here.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.540
And mostly the reason is that
the proof I have in the notes,

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.960
I can't understand it anymore.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.145
Well, I can sort of understand
it when I correct a

00:34:38.145 --> 00:34:39.909
few errors in it.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:44.550
But I think this proof gives
you a much better

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.670
idea why it's true.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.080
And I think you can follow
it in real time.

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.320
Whereas that proof, I couldn't
follow it in real time, or

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.310
fairly extended time.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:59.070
OK, so this stop process,
I can express it in the

00:34:59.070 --> 00:34:59.950
following way.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.730
And let me try to explain
why this is.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:09.950
If your stopping rule tells you
that you stop at time m

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.050
for a particular sample
sequence, this indicator

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:23.020
function, i of sub j equals n,
this function here is 1 for

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.410
all sample sequences for which
you stop at time m.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:32.070
And it's 0 for all
other sequences.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:37.400
So the value of this stop
process at time n is going to

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.560
be the value at which it
stopped, which is Zm, when you

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.910
have this indicator function,
which is j equals m.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.350
And if it hasn't stopped yet,
it's going to be Z sub n,

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.360
which is what it really is.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.250
And it hasn't stopped.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.080
So the stop process hasn't
yet stopped.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.730
So Z sub n star is
equal to Z sub n.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:12.930
OK, so as far as the magnitude
is concerned, the magnitude of

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:17.350
Z sub n is going to be less than
or equal to the sum of

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.610
those magnitudes.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.600
And the sum of those magnitudes,
you can just

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.630
ignore the indicator functions
because they're either 0 or 1.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.690
So we can upper bound
them by 1.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:34.410
So Z sub n star is less than
or equal to the sum over m

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.930
less than n of Z sub
n plus Z sub n.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.220
And this means that the expected
value of Z sub n star

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.920
has to be less than infinity
because what it is in this

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:52.790
bound here is a sum
of finite numbers.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.430
When you take a finite sum--
this is a finite sum.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.110
There are only n plus
1 terms in it.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:03.090
When you take a finite sum of
finite numbers, you get

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.590
something finite.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.500
So expected value
of Z sub n is--.

00:37:18.437 --> 00:37:18.920
Excuse me.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.050
I was a little bit
quick about that.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:28.200
The expected value of Z sub n
star is now less than or equal

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.110
to the expected value of each
of the Z sub n's plus the

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.360
expected value of Z sub n.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.950
Since the Z process is a
Martingale, you know that all

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:40.780
of those expected values
are finite.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.520
And since all of those expected
values are finite,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.140
the expected value of Z sub n
star is finite as we said.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:57.180
OK, so let's try to trace out
what happens if we look at the

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.310
expected value of Z sub n star
conditional on the past

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.230
history up until
time n minus 1.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:10.550
We'll rewrite Z sub n star in
terms of this expression here.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:17.420
So it's the sum over m less than
n of the expected value

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.810
of the stopping point if the
stopping point was equal to m

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:27.070
plus the expected value of Z
sub n if the stopping point

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.430
was greater than n.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.560
So we just want to analyze
all of those terms.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.910
So we look at them.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.710
There's nothing complicated
about it.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:40.310
The expected value of this term
here, expected value of

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:47.720
Zm times i of j equals
m given Zn minus 1.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.920
And now, we're going to be
child-like about it.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:58.800
And we're going to assume a
particular sample sequence,

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.730
which is equal to little
z n minus 1.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.460
What is this expected
value here?

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.120
It has to be Z sub n
if j is equal to m.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.370
Why is that?

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:12.130
That's the argument I was just
going through before.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:17.240
What's the expected value of a
random variable conditional on

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.950
the random variable, that same
random variable, having a

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.160
particular value?

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.650
The fact that you're given
a large number of these

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:28.190
quantities doesn't make
any difference.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.440
The main thing that you're given
here is the value of Z

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:40.030
sub n being little z sub m,
which says this quantity is

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:43.710
equal to little z sub m
if j is equal to m.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.710
That's equal to 0 if j is
unequal to m, which in fact is

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.780
just equal to Zm times the
indicator function of j.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.340
OK, so you--

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.140
and the same thing happens
for the indicator

00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:03.370
function of j equals n.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.260
This should be j greater
than or equal to n.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.350
This is Zn minus 1.

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.220
And we add these things up.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:17.790
And what we get, finally,
is this sum here.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:21.010
And now, you look at this last
term here, which is a

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.150
combination of here and here.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.340
And this is just the indicator
function for j greater than or

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.210
equal to n minus 1.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:34.280
And if you look back at the
definition of Z sub n star,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.720
this is just Z star
of n minus 1.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:44.080
I see a lot of blank faces.

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.680
But this is the kind
of thing you almost

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.930
have to look at twice.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.790
So we'll let it go with that.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:58.390
So this shows that the expected
value of Z sub n star

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:05.010
given the past of the original
process is equal to Z

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.810
star n minus 1.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.650
That's not quite
what you want.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:15.460
You want the expected value of
Zn star given Z star of n

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.700
minus 1 to be equal to
Z star n minus 1.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:25.450
In other words, you want to be
able to replace this quantity

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:29.080
in here with Z star n minus 1.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.770
And the question is,
how do you do that?

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.160
And that's what bothered me
about the proof in the notes

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.480
because it didn't even
talk about that.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:46.000
So the argument is Z star n
minus 1 in the past is really

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.780
a function of the past of
the original process.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.640
If I give you the sample
values of the original

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.840
process, you can tell me where
the process stops.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.550
And you can say what the stop
process is both before and

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.370
after that point.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:07.860
So the stop values
are a function of

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.600
the unstopped values.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.590
So now what I can do is for
every sample point of the

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:20.330
original process leading to a
given sequence of the stop

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:26.320
process, we're going to have
expected value Zn star given

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.040
these values here as equal
to Z star n minus 1.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.350
And since that's true for all
of the values for which this

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:40.300
leads to that, this
is true also.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.480
So that proves it.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:50.080
I'm doing this primarily because
I think you ought to

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.350
be tortured with at least one
proof in every lecture.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:59.230
And the other thing is the proof
in the notes was not

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.110
quite sufficient.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.080
So I wanted to add to it here.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.680
So now, you have
a proof of it.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:13.350
Consequences of the theorem,
this is for sub-Martingales,

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:19.210
the marginal expected values of
the stopped process lies in

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:23.190
between the expected value
of Z1 and the expected

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:24.130
value of Z sub n.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:28.590
In other words, when you take
the stop process, it in some

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:34.270
sense is intermediate between
what happens at time 1 and

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:39.150
what happens for the original
process at time n.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:43.610
It can't grow any faster than
the original process.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.520
This is also almost intuitively
obvious.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.900
And it's proven in
section 7.8.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:55.230
So you can find it there.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.880
It's quite a bit easier than the
proof I just went through.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.920
The proof I just went through
was a fairly difficult and

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.610
fairly tricky proof.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:07.850
Partly I went through that proof
because everything we do

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:09.520
from now on--

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.335
we're not going to do an
awful lot of things.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.560
But the Martingale convergence
theorem, the strong law of

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.890
large numbers, and all of the
other results we're talking

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.860
about all depend critically
on that theorem that

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.410
we just went through.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.680
In other words, it's a
really major theorem.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.650
It's not trivial little thing.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.440
OK, this one is fairly
major, too.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.520
But it follows very easily
from the other one.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:52.150
Do I want to talk about this,
this generating function

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.400
product of the Martingale?

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.450
No.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.840
Let's let that go.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.260
Let's not--

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.510
not that important.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.920
So this is that, too.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.262
No, I guess I better
go back to that.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.610
We need it.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.260
OK, let's look at the generating
function product

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.620
Martingale that we had
for a random walk.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:31.740
So X sub n is a sequence of
IID random variables.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:37.030
The partial sums form the
variables of a random walk.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:42.260
Sn is a random walk
where Sn is a sum.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:49.870
For any r such that gamma of r
exists, we then define Z sub n

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:53.630
to be a Martingale, this
Martingale here.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.660
That's called a generating
function Martingale.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.275
Zn is a Martingale.

00:45:59.275 --> 00:46:02.060
The expected value of
Zn is equal to 1.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.350
You can see immediately from
this that the expected value

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.850
of Zn is equal to 1.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.780
You don't need any of the theory
we've gone through

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:15.950
because the expected value of
the e to the r Sn is what?

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.880
It's a moment generating
function to the n-th power.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.920
That's just this term here.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.480
So this has to be equal
to 1 for all n.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.140
The fact that this is a
Martingale comes from that

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:30.600
example of product
form Martingale

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.590
that we went through.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:38.370
So there's nothing very
sophisticated here.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:42.920
OK, so if we assume that gamma
of r exists and we let Zn be

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:50.090
this Martingale, well, this is
just what we said before.

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.550
So you see it here.

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.860
Let j be the non-defective
stopping time that stops when

00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:02.090
either alpha greater than
0 or beta less than 0.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:07.360
Since this is a stopping time,
the expected value of e to the

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:13.590
Zn star is equal to 1 for all n
greater than or equal to 1.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:21.060
And the limit as n goes to
infinity of Z sub n is then

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:27.550
going to be equal to
the process at the

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.110
time where you stopped.

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.880
After you stop, you
stay the same.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.830
So you never move.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.890
And the expected value
of Z sub j is just

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.990
this quantity here.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.970
What does that look like?

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.180
That's the Wald identity
coming up again.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.420
That's the Wald identity coming
up for a random walk

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.120
with two thresholds.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.760
The nice thing about doing it
this way is you can see that

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.770
the proof applies to many
other situations.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.380
You can have almost any stopping
rule you want.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:05.570
And you still get the
Wald identity.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:11.230
So it has a much more general
form than we had before.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:16.065
This business here, the limit of
Z sub n star going to Z sub

00:48:16.065 --> 00:48:18.710
j is a little fishy.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.260
The proof in the
notes is fine.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.480
This limit does in fact
equal this limit.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.880
What's bizarre is that the
expected value of this limit

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.490
is not necessarily equal to the
expected value of Z sub j.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:41.890
So make a note to yourselves
that if you ever want to use

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:47.530
Wald's identity in this more
general case, think carefully

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.570
about what's going on as
you go to the limit.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.340
Because it can be a little
bit tricky there.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.440
It's not always what
it looks like.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.970
OK, so we're on to Mr.
Kolmogorov again.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:08.860
Kolmogorov was the guy who did
so many things in the subject.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.890
Most important, he said for a
firm foundation to start with,

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.180
he was the one that said you
really need a model.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.970
And you really need
some axioms.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.365
And then, he went on with all
these other neat things that

00:49:21.365 --> 00:49:24.510
we've talked about from
time to time.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:30.280
His sub-Martingale inequality
is a fairly simple result.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.430
But this follows after that
stopping theorem that we've

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.670
just talked about.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.750
And everything else
depends on this.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.180
So there's a sort of chain that
runs through this whole

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.570
development.

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.660
And if you go further in
Martingales, you find that

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.230
this is just an absolutely major
theorem which comes up

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.870
all the time.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:56.490
And it's wonderful because
it's so simple.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:01.940
OK, so let's let Z sub n be a
non-negative sub-Martingale.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.050
And then, for any positive
integer m and any number a

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:17.120
bigger than 0, the probability
that the maximum of the first

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:23.070
n terms of this Martingale is
greater than or equal to the

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:29.840
quantity a is the expected value
of Z sub n divided by a.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:36.290
This looks like the
Markov inequality.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.500
If instead of taking the maximum
from 1 to m we just

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.740
look at Z sub n, the probability
that Z sub n is

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:48.910
greater than or equal to a, then
we get less than or equal

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:53.510
to Z of m divided by a.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.060
So what this is saying is it's
really strengthening that

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:01.140
Markov inequality and saying,
you don't have to restrict

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.670
yourself to Z sub m.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:07.680
You can instead look at all
of the terms up until m.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:11.990
And this bound here you get in
the Markov inequality really

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:18.610
covers the maximum of all of
those terms to start out with,

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.650
which says that for any m, you
can look at the maximum over

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.140
an enormous sum of terms
if you want to.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:29.530
And it does this nice thing.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:33.080
OK, I'm going to prove
this also.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.070
But this proof is simple.

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:39.800
So you can follow it in
real time, I think.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.720
So we want to start out with
letting j be the stopping

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:53.110
time, which is essentially the
smallest term where you've

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.290
crossed the threshold at a.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.550
And if you haven't crossed a
threshold at a, then it's

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.270
equal to the last term.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.340
So here's the specific
stopping rule that

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.680
we're going to use.

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:10.280
If Zn is greater than or equal
to a for any n, then j is the

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.750
smallest n for which Zn
is greater than a.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.835
It's the first time at which
we've crossed that threshold.

00:52:17.835 --> 00:52:24.460
If Zn is less than a for all n
up until m, then we make j

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.700
equal to n.

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.820
So we're insisting on stopping
at some point.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.010
This is not a defective
stopping rule.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:34.520
It's a real stopping rule
because you've set the limit

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.010
on how far you want to look.

00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:41.780
OK, so the process has
to stop by time m.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.820
The value of the process
at the time you stop--

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.120
remember this thing we've called
Z sub j, which is the

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.010
value at the stopping times.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.770
Z sub j is greater than or
equal to a if you stopped

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.020
before time m.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:07.740
And Z sub n is--

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.020
well, we're saying that Z sub j
is greater than or equal to

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:16.300
a if and only if Zn is greater
than or equal to a for some n

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.810
less than or equal to m.

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:25.066
If you haven't crossed a
threshold by time m, then Z

00:53:25.066 --> 00:53:29.690
sub m is equal to Z sub n.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.400
But it's not above a.

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.460
So the stopping time is this
largest possible value that

00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:41.430
we've got until the process
stops by time n.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.470
Zj greater than or equal to a if
and only if we've crossed a

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:48.620
threshold for some n less
than or equal to m.

00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.710
So the probability that we've
crossed the threshold from 1

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:58.400
to n to n is equal to the
probability that Z sub j is

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.750
greater than or equal or a,
which is less than or equal to

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.470
the expected value of Z
sub j divided by a.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:09.320
Since the process must be
stopped by time m, we have Z

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.450
sub j is equal to
Z sub m star.

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:16.800
And the stop process, f
time m and Z sub n, is

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.980
less than or equal--

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:22.450
expected value of the stop
process is less than or equal

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.750
to the expected value of
the original process.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.200
Why is that?

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.830
That's that theorum we just
proved somewhere.

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.190
Yeah, this one here, OK?

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.365
That's submartingale
consequence.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.050
OK.

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.850
So that completes the proof.

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:52.946
And it's 10:30 now.

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:01.130
So the Kolmogorove submartingale
inequality is

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:04.800
really a strengthening of
the Markov inequality.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:10.250
So you get this extra soup
to nuts form of it.

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:14.220
Chebyshev inequality can be
strengthened in the same way.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:18.480
That's called a Kolmogorove
inequality also.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.890
Kolmogorove just got in here
before anybody else and he

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.120
took those axioms that
he made up--

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.740
and he was a smart guy--

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.400
and he developed this
whole school of

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.970
probability in Russia.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.750
And along with that, since he
had these original results, he

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:37.450
just almost wiped up the field
before anybody else knew what

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.530
was going on.

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:41.630
Partly a consequence of the fact
that mathematicians in

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.340
most other parts of the world
didn't believe that there was

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.500
any good probability theory
going on in Russia.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.630
So they weren't really conscious
of this until he

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:54.770
cleaned up the whole field.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.370
So if you want to be famous
mathematician, you should move

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:03.270
away from the US and go to Upper
Turkestan or something.

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.920
And you then clean up the whole
field the same way that

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.750
Kolmogorove did.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.000
OK.

00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:15.190
So the strengthening of the
Kolmogorove inequality.

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:20.270
What the result says is let Zn
be a submartingale with the

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.850
expected value of Zn squared
less than infinity.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:29.070
Then the probability that the
maximum of these terms, up to

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:33.790
n, is greater than or equal to
b, is less than or equal to

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:39.190
the expected value of Zm squared
divided by b squared.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.300
You'll notice that that's almost
the same thing as the

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.960
submartingale inequality.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.250
This one says the probability
that the maximum of Z sub i is

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.090
greater than or equal to i.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:57:01.420
And this one says THE
probability that the maximum Z

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.860
n is greater than or equal to b
is less than or equal to the

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:09.230
expected value of Zn squared
over b squared.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.690
If you can't prove this, go back
and look at the proof of

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:12.940
the Chebyshev inequality.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:24.170
The proof of this given the
submartingale inequality is

00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:28.570
exactly the same as the proof
of the Chebyshev inequality

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:29.890
given the Markov inequality.

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:36.180
You just go through the same
steps and it's fairly simple.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.680
OK.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:40.810
So that is a nice result.

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:44.930
What happens if you apply
this to a random walk?

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:50.080
If you apply it to a random
walk, what you do is replace

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:56.330
this is Z sub n with the sum of
random variables, and the

00:57:56.330 --> 00:57:59.990
random walk, minus the mean
of those random variables.

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:04.470
We have seen that a zero-mean
random walk is a martingale.

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:08.100
So what we're going to do next
is to use that zero-mean

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:13.070
random walk of the martingale
and then what this says is the

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:15.960
probability that the maximum,
from 1, less

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.250
than or equal to n--

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:22.280
less than or equal to m,
of Sn minus nX bar.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:26.090
That's Zn because we're
subtracting off the main.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:29.020
The probability of that is
greater than or equal to, and

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.530
we just give b another name--

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:33.410
m times epsilon--

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.090
and it's less than or equal
to the expected

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.700
value of Z sub m squared.

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:41.250
What's the expected value of
this quantity squared?

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.260
It's n times sigma squared.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:58.800
Because S sub m is just the sum
of m IID random variables,

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.455
which have variance
sigma squared.

00:59:01.455 --> 00:59:06.670
So you take the expected value
of this quantity squared, and

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:12.400
this n times the variance of X.
So this then becomes sigma

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:18.110
squared times m divided by m
squared times epsilon squared,

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.470
and the m cancels out.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:27.130
This gives you the Chebyshev
inequality with the extra

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:33.640
feature, but it deals with the
whole sum from 1 up to m.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:36.170
Now, you look at this
and you say, gee.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:40.210
Wouldn't it be absolutely
wonderful if instead of going

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:44.570
from 1 to m, this went
from m to infinity?

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:47.940
Because then you'd be saying the
maximum of these terms--

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:52.270
the maximum is less than
or equal to something.

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.280
And you'd have the strong law
of large numbers all sitting

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.320
there for you.

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:02.820
And life was not that good, but
almost as good, because we

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:09.320
can now do the strong law of
large numbers assuming only

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.950
IID random variables
with the variance.

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:17.390
So we're going to use that
expression that we just did--

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.770
we're going to plug it into what
we need for the strong

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.630
law of large numbers.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.560
Again, I'm going to give you the
idea of the proof of that.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.600
I wasn't going to do that, but
I looked at the proof in the

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.020
notes, and I had trouble
understanding that too.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.040
You understand, I have
a problem here.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.010
I write things two years ago,
I look at them now.

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:43.130
I have a bad memory, so I have
trouble understanding them.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.650
So I recreate a new proof, which
looks obvious to me now

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:49.280
because I've done it right
now, and in two years, it

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.040
might look just as difficult.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.710
So if you look at this half
proof here and you can't

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:59.140
understand it, let me know,
and I'll go back to the

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.430
drawing board and work
on something else.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.940
OK.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:10.860
So the theorem says let X sub i
be a sequence of IID random

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.905
variables with mean x bar and
standard deviation sigma less

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:16.170
than infinity.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:19.550
So I'm trying to do the strong
law of large numbers before we

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.200
assume the fourth moment.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.740
Here, I'm only assuming
a second moment.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.150
If you work really hard, you
can do it with the first

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.590
absolute moment.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:28.970
OK.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:33.600
Let the S sub n be the sum of
n random variables, then for

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.650
any epsilon--

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:38.570
oh, I don't need an
epsilon there.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.270
I don't know where that
epsilon came from.

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:46.900
Just cross that out.

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.930
It doesn't belong.

01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:52.870
The probability that the limit,
as n goes to infinity,

01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:56.640
of S n over n is
equal to X bar.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.940
The probability of
that event--

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:06.520
event happens for a whole bunch
of sample sequences.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.380
It doesn't happen for others.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.610
And this says that the
probability of the class of

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:14.070
infinite length sequences
for which that

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:16.000
happens is equal to 1.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.980
That's the statement of the
strong law of large numbers

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.180
that we had before.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:26.410
It says that the probability
of the set of sequences for

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:30.860
which the sample average
approaches the main

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.950
probability of that set of
sequences is equal to 1.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:35.280
OK.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.630
So the idea of the proof
is going to be

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:39.880
the following thing.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.650
And what I'm going to use is
this Chebyshev inequality

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.440
we've already done.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.790
But since Chebyshev inequality,
in this new form--

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.220
namely the Kolmogorove
inequality only goes up to n,

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.430
what I'm going to do is
look at successively

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:07.970
larger values of n.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.650
So I'm going to try to crawl
my way up on infinity by

01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:15.110
taking first a short length,
then a longer length, then a

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:17.280
longer length, and a
the longer length.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.640
So I'm going to take this
quantity here, which was the

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.100
quantity in the Kolmogorove
submartingale inequality.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.860
I'm going to ask what's the
probability that the union of

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:35.170
all of these things, from m
equals sum k, which I'm going

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:37.110
to let go to infinity
later, what's the

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:40.470
probability of this union?

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:44.390
And the terms in the union,
instead of going from 1 to n

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:50.370
to n, I want to replace
n by 2 to the m.

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.630
The maximum of this.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:56.090
The probability that this is
greater than or equal to 2 to

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:58.250
the m times epsilon--

01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.755
that's the biggest term
times epsilon.

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:05.590
I want to see that this
is less than or

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:07.720
equal to this quantity.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.500
Now, why is this less than
or equal to that?

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.470
AUDIENCE: Union bound.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.310
PROFESSOR: What?

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.110
AUDIENCE: Union bound.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:16.260
PROFESSOR: Union bound, yes.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.970
That's all it is.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:21.270
I've just applied the
union bound to this.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.830
This is less than or equal to
the probability of this for m

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:33.390
equals k, plus the probability
of this for m equals k plus 1,

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:34.890
and so forth.

01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:39.800
Each of these terms is sigma
squared over 2 to the m times

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.370
epsilon squared.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:45.230
That's what we had on the
last page, I hope.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.570
Yes.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:49.190
Sigma squared over m times
epsilon squared.

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:53.220
Remember, we replaced m by 2 to
the m, so this has changed

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.600
in that way.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.040
And now we can sum this.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.890
And when we sum it, we just get
2 sigma squared over 2 to

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:05.430
the k times epsilon squared.

01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.790
What are we doing here?

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:10.540
What's the whole of this?

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:15.310
The Kolmogorove submartingale
inequality, lets us, instead

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:19.670
of looking at just one value of
n, let's us look at a whole

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.690
bunch of values altogether
and maximize over them.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:27.660
So what I'm going do is use the
Kolmogorove submartingale

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.350
inequality over one big bunch
of things and then over

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:34.190
another much bigger bunch of
things, then over another

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:36.280
much, much bigger
set of things.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:43.340
And because I'm hopping over
these much larger sequences, I

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.220
can now sum this quantity here,
which I couldn't do if I

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:48.690
only had an m here.

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:53.050
If I replaced this 2 to the m by
m and I tried to sum this,

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.020
what would happen?

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:59.940
It's a harmonic series
and it diverges.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:02.770
So what I've been able to do--

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:06.280
or, really, what Kolmogorove
was able to do--

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.010
was instead of summing over
all m, he was summing over

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:13.350
bunches of things and using
this maximum here.

01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:18.710
So this probability is
less than or equal

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:21.350
to something finite.

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:26.380
If I now let k go to infinity,
this term goes to 0, which

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:32.160
says that the tail end of this
whole big thing goes to 0 as k

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:35.610
gets larger, for any
epsilon at all.

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:38.060
But now, this doesn't quite look
like what I want it to

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.990
look like, so what I'm going to
do is find something which

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:45.120
is smaller than this that looks
like what I would like

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.620
it to look like.

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:49.170
So I'm going to lower bound
this quantity here by this

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.310
quantity here.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:54.090
I still have the same
union here.

01:06:54.090 --> 01:07:02.180
Instead of finding the max over
1 to n to 2 to the n, I

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:05.970
will get a probability which is
smaller because I'll only

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.320
maximize over part
of those terms.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.390
I'll only go from 2 to the m
minus 1, less than or equal to

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:15.190
n, less than or equal
to 2 to the n.

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:19.010
So I'm maximizing over a smaller
set of terms, which

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:26.230
makes the probability
of this smaller.

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:32.330
And then I'm replacing the 2
the m here by 2 times n,

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:36.620
because now this bound is
between 2 to the n minus 1 and

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.790
2 to the m.

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:40.670
So I can replace it that way.

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.860
And now, it's exactly
the sum that I want.

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.620
Yeah?

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.980
AUDIENCE: What does it mean to
maximize the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:50.340
Now n is [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.740
So it looks like you're
maximizing over inequalities.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.592
Is it something like that?

01:07:54.592 --> 01:08:05.980
PROFESSOR: Well, Yeah no.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.030
I probably want to take this
quantity, subtract off--

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:15.590
no.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:27.109
What I really have to do to make
this make any sense is

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:37.069
write it as the maximum over
the same set of things S n

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:48.859
over n minus x bar, greater than
or equal to 2 epsilon.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:50.109
OK?

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:09.810
Thank you.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:10.240
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.960
Another thing--

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.466
you're more likely to be bigger

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:14.260
than a smaller quantity.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:19.159
Your n is smaller than 2 to the
m, you're more likely to

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:22.396
be bigger than a smaller
quantity.

01:09:22.396 --> 01:09:24.886
So you're not bounding
correctly, it would seem.

01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:30.889
Oh, no.

01:09:30.889 --> 01:09:34.800
You're doing 2 times m.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.720
PROFESSOR: Well, there's
no problem here.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.744
I think the question is here.

01:09:39.744 --> 01:09:47.520
Can I reduce this maximum down
to a smaller sum and get a

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.770
smaller probability?

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.930
Oh, yes.

01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:55.740
There's a smaller probability
that this smaller max will

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.870
exceed a limit than if this
will exceed a limit.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.210
So I should do it
in two steps.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:02.710
In fact, you pointed
it out here.

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.280
I should do it in three steps.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.670
So the first step replaces this

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:11.170
maximum with this maximum.

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:19.910
Then the second step is going
to go through that step.

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:24.560
And the third one is going to
replace the m here with the n.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.810
Anyway.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:35.945
I think it's OK, with a
few minor twiddles.

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:42.400
And before the term is over, I
will get a new set of notes

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.020
out on the web, and you can
check them to see if you're

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:47.130
actually satisfied
with it, OK?

01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:51.850
OK.

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:57.190
So finally, the martingale
convergence theorem.

01:10:57.190 --> 01:11:04.900
I'm not even going to try to
prove this at all, but you

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.460
might have some imagination
for how this follows from

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.300
dealing with stop
processes, also.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:19.000
What it says is Z sub n
is a martingale again.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.360
We're going to assume that
there's something finite m, so

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:28.680
the expected value of Zn is
less than or equal to n.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.950
So what I'm saying is the
expected value of Z sub n is

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:34.610
now bounded--

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:37.330
it's not finite, it's
more than finite--

01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:39.000
it's bounded.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.800
It can never exceed
this quantity.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.540
I can have an expected value Z
sub n, which is equal to 2 to

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.480
the n, and that's fine
for every n.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.140
But it's not bounded.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:54.650
This quantity, I'm assuming
it's bounded.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:59.050
And then, according to this
super theorem, there's a

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:03.130
random variable, Z. And
don't ask what Z is.

01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:07.630
Z is usually a very complicated
random variable.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:09.650
All this is doing is
saying it exists.

01:12:09.650 --> 01:12:12.570
You don't know what it is.

01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:17.750
Such that the limit, as n goes
to infinity, is Z sub n, is

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.100
equal to this random variable.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:27.110
In other words, the limit of Z
sub n minus Z is equal to 0 as

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.960
n goes to infinity.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960
And the texts proves the theorem
with the additional

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.860
constraint that the expected
value of Z sub

01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.190
n squared is bounded.

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:44.780
Either one of those bounds is a
very big constraint on these

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.020
martingales.

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.280
So the way you use these
theorems is you take an

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.730
original problem that you're
dealing with and you twist it

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.800
around, then you massage it and
you do all sorts of things

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:02.030
to it all in order to get
another martingale, which

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:04.560
satisfies this bound
in the constraint.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.470
Then you apply this theorem, and
then you go back to where

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.710
you started.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:12.380
So that's the sort of general
way of dealing with this.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.770
And you see this theorem being
used in all sorts of strange

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:27.420
places where you would never
expect it to be used.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:31.640
For those of you in the
communication field, about a

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.690
couple of years ago, there was
a very famous paper dealing

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:37.310
with something called polar
codes, which is

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.470
a new kind of coding--

01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:41.410
very careful.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:43.390
And they guy, in order to
prove that these codes

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:47.040
worked, used that.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:47.600
I don't know how--

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.200
I haven't checked it out
yet-- but that was

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.700
crucial in his proofs.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:55.560
So he had to turn these things
into martingales somehow and

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.350
then use that proof.

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:01.530
OK.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:05.000
We talked about branching
processes, about the

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.900
remarkable things about them.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.240
This theorem applies directly to
these branching processes.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.180
A branching process,
you remember--

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:20.310
the number of elements or
organisms or whatever, at time

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:25.390
n is the number of offspring
of the set of elements at

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:28.880
time n minus 1.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.130
Each element at each time has a
random number of offspring,

01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:38.050
which is independent of time
that's independent of all the

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.520
other elements.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:48.140
And it's a random variable Y.
And the expected value of X

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:54.480
sub n is going to be X sub n
minus 1 times the expected

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.650
value of Y, because X sub n
minus 1 is the number of

01:14:58.650 --> 01:15:02.320
elements in the n minus
first generation.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:05.470
Y bar is the expected
number of offspring

01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:07.270
of each one of them.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.242
So you look at it
and you say, ah.

01:15:09.242 --> 01:15:10.420
That theorem doesn't work.

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:10.920
No good.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.540
You walk away.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.860
Then somebody else who is really
interested in branching

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:22.340
processes says, oh, this
process is growing as--

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.460
I mean it's growing by Y
bar every unit of time.

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:32.170
So I should be able to deal
with that somehow.

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:34.720
So I say, OK.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.250
Let's look at the number
of elements in the n-th

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.870
generation and divide
it by Y to the n.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.370
When you do this,
what happens?

01:15:49.830 --> 01:16:04.740
The expected value of X n
divided by Y bar to the n is

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:21.010
going to be equal to X sub n
minus 1 over Y bar sub n minus

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:42.080
1 times

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.550
AUDIENCE: You need
to [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:47.960
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.730
That would help, wouldn't it.

01:16:50.730 --> 01:16:53.040
Thank you.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:02.910
Given X n minus 1 divided by
Y bar n times n minus 1.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:17.070
And Xn minus 2 over
Y bar n minus 2.

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:20.810
And so if we're given these
things, we don't have to worry

01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:23.210
about this quantity if we're
just given a number in each

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.250
generation.

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:27.380
If we're given a number in
generation n minus 1, the

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:37.180
expected value of X sub n over
Y n is just X n minus 1.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.870
Expected value, we pick up
another value of Y divided by

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:48.930
Y bar to the n, which is
X n minus 1 over Y

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:52.860
bar the n minus 1.

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:53.390
OK.

01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:58.520
So the theorem applies here
because that expected value is

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.550
just 1, then.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:04.980
And this is a martingale.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.740
So the theorem says
that this quantity

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:10.370
approaches a random variable.

01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:12.590
And what does that mean?

01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:22.530
Well, if you observe this
process for a long time, it

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:23.930
might die out.

01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:26.090
If it dies out and it
stays died out-- it

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:28.310
never comes back again.

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:32.950
And if it doesn't die out, it's
going to start to grow.

01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:35.520
And if it starts to grow,
it's going to start to

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.530
grow in this why.

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:43.700
After a very long time, if it's
growing, X sub n minus 1

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.380
is humongous, and the law of
large numbers says that the

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:52.990
next generation should have very
close to X sub n minus 1

01:18:52.990 --> 01:18:55.940
times the Y bar elements
in it.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:59.150
So it says that after you get
started, this thing wobbles

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:01.410
around trying to decide whether
it's going to go to

01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:04.420
zero or decide to get large.

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:07.400
But if one starts to get large,
then it becomes very

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.320
stable from that time on.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.090
And it's going to increase by Y
bar with each unit of time.

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:15.940
If it decides it's going to die
out, it goes to 0 and it

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.030
stays there.

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:21.350
So what the theorem is saying
is just what I just said--

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:28.940
namely X to the n over Y bar n
in fact either grows in this

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:33.090
very regular Y or it goes
to 0 and it stays there.

01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:39.750
So this random variable is 0
with a probability that the

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:43.110
process dies out, and we
evaluated that before.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.080
The other values of it are
very hard to evaluate.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.940
The other values depend on how
long this thing takes.

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.180
If it's not going to go to 0,
how long does it take before

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.000
it really takes off?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.220
And sometimes it takes a long
time before it really takes

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.360
off, sometimes it takes a short
time, and that's what

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.620
the random variable Z is.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:13.540
But the random variable Z says
that after a very long time,

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:19.380
the value of this process is
X sub n is going to be

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.510
approximately Z times this
quantity here, which is

01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.620
growing exponentially.

01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.370
OK.

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:33.010
That gives us the martingale
convergence theorem.

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:37.640
Next time, I will try to review
at least the whole

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.890
course from Markov chains on.
