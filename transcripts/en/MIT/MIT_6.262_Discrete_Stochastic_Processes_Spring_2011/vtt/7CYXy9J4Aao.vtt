00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.890
PROFESSOR: OK, we're
all ready to go.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.900
This is Discrete Stochastic
Processes as you are know.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.150
It is--

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.615
want to get it where
I can read it, too.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.270
We're going to try to deal
with a bunch of different

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.450
topics today, some of which are
a little bit philosophical

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.360
saying, what is probability
really?

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.220
You are supposed to have taken
a course in probability, but

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.760
unfortunately courses in
probability are almost always

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.080
courses in how to solve
well-posed problems.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.750
The big problem in probability
theory, and particularly

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.040
stochastic processes is not
so much how do you solve

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.290
well-posed problems.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.320
Anybody can do that.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.040
Or anybody who has a little bit
of background can do it.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.550
The hard problem is finding
the right models for a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.060
real-world problem.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.980
I will call these real-world
problems.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.730
I hate people who call things
real-world because they sound

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.310
like they dislike theory
or something.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.380
It's the only word I can think
of though, because physical

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.200
world is no longer adequate
because so much of the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.190
applications of probability are
to all sorts of different

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.670
things, not having to do with
the physical world very much,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.400
but having to do with things
like the business world, or

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.850
the economic world, or the
biological world, or all of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.190
these things.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.990
So real-world is just a code
word we'll use to distinguish

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.280
theory from anything real that
you might have to deal with.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.830
Theory is very nice
because theory--

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.670
everything is specified.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.800
There's a right answer
to everything.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640
There is a wrong
answer usually.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.350
But there's at least
one right answer.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.420
And most of us like those
things because

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.620
they're very specific.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.250
People go into engineering and
science very often because

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.150
they don't like the
uncertainty of a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.130
lot of other fields.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.170
The problem is as soon as you
go into probability theory,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.560
you're moving away from that
safe region where everything

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.260
is specified, and you're moving
into a region where

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.360
things, in fact, are not very
well-specified and you have to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.900
be careful about it.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.670
OK, so first we're going to talk
about probability in the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.150
real world and probability as
a branch of mathematics.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.840
Then we're going to
say what discrete

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.200
stochastic processes are.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.850
Then we're going to talk just a
very, very little bit about

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.140
the processes we're
going to study.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.430
If you want to see more
of that, you have two

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.530
chapters of the notes.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.720
You can look at them.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.260
You can look at the
table of contents.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.910
And more than that, if you look
at my website, you will

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.490
see the notes for all the other
chapters if you want to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.500
read ahead or if you want to
really find out what kinds of

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.660
things we're going to talk about
and what kinds of things

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.320
we're not going to talk about.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.180
Then we're going to talk
about when, where,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000
and how is this useful?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.385
The short answer to that is
it's useful everywhere.

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:49.930
But we'll have to
see why that is.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.620
Then we're going to talk
about the axioms

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.150
of probability theory.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.310
You cannot take any elementary
course in probability, or even

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.690
in statistics, without seeing
the axioms of probability.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.740
And in almost all of those
cases, and in almost all of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.350
the graduate courses I've
seen, you see them, they

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.340
disappear, and suddenly you're
solving problems in whatever

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.470
way you can, and the
axioms have nothing

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.040
to do with it anymore.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.390
So we're going to see that, in
fact, the axioms do have

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.680
something to do with this.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.940
Those of you who want to be
real engineers and not

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.990
mathematicians, you'll
find this a little

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.910
uncomfortable at times.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.050
We are going to be
proving things.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.940
And you will have to
get used to that.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.560
And I'll try to convince you
of why it's important to be

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.180
able to prove things.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.470
Then we're going on to a
review of probability,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.930
independent events,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.850
experiments, and random variables.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.100
So that's what we'll do today.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.990
Incidentally, this course
started about--

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.730
must've been 25 years
ago or so.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.790
I started it because we had a
huge number of students at MIT

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.120
who had been interested in
communication and control, and

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.170
who were suddenly starting to
get interested in networks.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.780
And there were all sorts of
queuing problems that they had

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.490
to deal with every day.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.950
And they started to read
about queuing theory.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.580
and it was the most disjointed,
crazy theory in

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.690
the world where there were
1,000 different kinds of

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.720
queues and each one
of them had to be

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.960
treated in its own way.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.130
And we realized that stochastic
processes was the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.620
right way to tie all of
that together, so we

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.620
started this course.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.090
And we made it mostly discrete
so it would deal primarily

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.330
with network type
applications.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.120
As things have grown, it now
deals with a whole lot more

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.320
applications.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.170
And we'll see how that
works later on.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.230
OK, how did probability get
started in the real world?

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.540
Well, there were games of chance
that everybody was

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.690
interested in.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.120
People really like to gamble.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.980
I don't know why.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.720
I don't like to gamble
that much.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.740
I would rather be certain
about things.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.330
But most people love
to gamble.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.730
And most people have an
intuitive sense of what

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.690
probability is about.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.790
I mean, eight-year-old kids,
when they start to learn to

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.750
play games of chance--

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.410
and there are all sorts
of board games

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.870
that involve chance.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.740
These kids, if they're
bright--

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.780
and I'm sure you people fall
into that category--

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.230
they immediately start to figure
out what the odds are.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.390
I mean, how many of you have
never thought about what the

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.640
odds are in some
gambling game?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.320
OK, that makes my point.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.630
So all of you understand this
at an intuitive level.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.310
But what makes games of chance
easier to deal with than all

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.340
the other issues where we have
uncertainty in life?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.340
Well, games of chance are
inherently repeatable.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.100
You play a game of chance and
you play many, many hands, or

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.740
many, many throws, or
many, many trials.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.470
And after many, many trials of
what's essentially the same

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.080
experiment, you start to get
a sense of what relative

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.960
frequencies are.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.210
You start to get a sense of what
the odds are because of

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.110
doing this repeatedly.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.500
So games of chance are easy to
use probability on because

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.890
they are repeatable.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.820
You have essentially the same
thing going on each time, but

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.090
each time there's a
different answer.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.190
You flip a coin and sometimes
it comes up heads and

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.630
sometimes it comes up tails.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.310
So in fact, we have to figure
out how to deal with that fact

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.650
that there is uncertainty
there.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.350
I'll talk about that in
just another minute.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.600
But anyway, most of life's
decisions involve uncertainty.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.920
I mean, for all of you, when you
go into a PhD program, you

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.960
have two problems.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.930
Am I going to enjoy this?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.070
And you don't know whether
you're going to enjoy it

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.210
because not until you really
get into it do you have a

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.540
sense of whether this set of
problems you're dealing with

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.060
is something that you
like to deal with.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.330
And the only way you can do
that is to make guesses.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.100
You come up with likelihoods.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.400
There's some likelihood.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.039
There's a risk cost-benefit
that you deal with.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:38.270
And in life, risk cost-benefits
are always based

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.650
on some sense of what the
likelihood of something is.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.710
Now, what is a likelihood?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.360
A likelihood is just
a probability.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.980
It's a synonym for
probability.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.060
When you get into the
mathematics of probability,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.950
likelihood has a special
meaning to it.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.080
But in the real world,
likelihood is just a word you

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.540
use when you don't want to let
people know that you're really

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.790
talking about probabilities.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:07.710
OK, so that's where we are.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.942
But on the last slide, you saw
the word "essentially,

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:14.400
essentially, essentially." If
you read the notes, and I hope

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.060
you read the notes, because I
spent the last three years

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.220
doing virtually nothing
but trying to

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.280
make these notes clear.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.800
I would appreciate it if any
of you, with whatever

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.620
background you have, when you
read these nodes, if you read

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.970
them twice and you still don't
understand something, tell me

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.300
you don't understand it.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.705
If you know why you don't
understand it, I'd appreciate

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:38.420
it knowing that.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.490
But just saying "help" is enough
to let me know that I

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.730
still haven't made something
as clear as it should be.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.240
At least as clear as it should
be for some of the people who

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.590
I think should be taking
this course.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.000
One of the problems we have at
MIT now, and at every graduate

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.980
school in the world I think,
is that human knowledge has

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.390
changed and grown so much
in the last 50 years.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.010
So when you study something
general, like probability,

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.600
there's just an enormous
mass of stuff you

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.020
have to deal with.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.360
And because of that, when you
try to write notes for a

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.290
course, you don't know
what anybody's

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.360
background is anymore.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.580
I mean, it used to be that when
you saw a graduate course

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.320
at MIT, people would know
what limits were.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.830
People would know what basic
mathematics is all about.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.000
They would know what
continuity means.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.110
They would know some
linear algebra.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.440
They would know all sorts
of different things.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.800
Many people still do
know those things.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.830
Many other people have studied
all sorts of other fascinating

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.110
and very interesting things.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.440
They're just as smart, but they
have a very different

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.320
background.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.650
So if your background is
different, it's not your fault

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.090
that you don't have the kind
of background that makes

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.680
probability easy.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.250
Just yell.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.560
Or yell in class.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.440
Please ask questions.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.200
The fact that we're videotaping
this makes it far

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.340
more interesting for anybody
who's using OpenCourseWare to

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.710
see some kinds of questions
going on, so I very much

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.760
encourage that.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.690
I'm fairly old at this point,
and my memory is getting shot.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.500
So if you ask a question and I
don't remember what it's all

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.590
about, just be patient
with it.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.870
I will come back the next time,
or I'll send you an

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.500
email straightening it out.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.640
But I will often get confused
doing something, and that's

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.850
just because of my age.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.090
It's what we call "senior
moments." It's not that I

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.110
don't understand the subject.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.630
I think I understand it, I just

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.936
don't remember it anymore.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.470
Important point about
probability.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.810
Think about flipping a coin.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.920
I'm going to talk about
flipping coins a

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.500
great deal this term.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.300
It's an absolutely trivial
topic, but it's important

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.300
because when you understand
deep things about a large

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.530
subject, the best way to
understand them is to

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.420
understand them in terms of the
most trivial examples you

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.880
can think of.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.770
Now, when you flip a coin, the
outcome-- heads or tails--

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:24.020
really depends on the initial
velocity, the orientation of

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.310
the person flipping it, or the
machine flipping it, the coin

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.960
surfaces, the ground surface.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.480
And after you put all of those
things into a careful

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.800
equation, you will know whether
the coin is going to

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.080
come up heads or tails.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.860
I don't think quantum theory
has anything to do with

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.620
something as big as a coin.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.210
I might be wrong.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.630
I've never looked into it.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.200
And frankly, I don't care.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.870
Because the point that I'm
trying to make is that

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.410
flipping a coin, and many of
the things that you view as

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.170
random, when you look at them
in a slightly different way,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.020
are not random.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.390
There's a big field in
communication called data

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.810
compression.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.270
And data compression is based on
random models for the data,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.480
which is going to
be compressed.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.070
Now, what I'm saying here today
is by no means random.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.900
Or maybe it is partly random.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.910
Maybe it's coming out of a
random mind, I don't know.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:23.725
But all of the data we try to
compress to the people who

00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:27.260
have created that data, it's
not random at all.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.710
If you study the data
carefully enough--

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.510
I mean, code breakers and people
like that are extremely

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.550
good at sorting out what the
meaning is in something, which

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.230
cannot be done by data
compression techniques at all.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.280
So the point is, when you're
doing data compression, you

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.010
model the data as being random
and having certain

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.570
characteristics.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.800
But it really isn't.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.130
So the model is no good.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.550
When you get to more important
questions--

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.950
well, data compression is
an important question.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.530
When you ask, what's the
probability of another

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.790
catastrophic oil spill
in the next year?

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.040
Or you ask the question, what's
the probability that

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.140
Google stock will double
in five years?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.580
That's less important,
but it's still

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.630
important to many people.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.880
How do you model that?

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.300
Understanding probability
theory, understanding all the

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.500
mathematics of this is not going
to help you model this.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.880
Now, why do I make such
a big deal about this?

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.910
Well, there have been a number
of times in the last 10 or 15

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.480
years when the whole financial
system of the world has almost

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.200
been destroyed by very,
very bright PhDs.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.680
Many of them coming from
electrical engineering.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.010
Most of whom are really
superb at

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.580
understanding probability theory.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.490
And they have used their
probability theory to analyze

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.640
risk and other things
in investments.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.630
And what has happened?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.100
They do very well for a while.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.050
Suddenly they do so well that
they think they can borrow all

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.750
sorts of money and risk other
people's money as

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.610
well as their own.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.080
In fact, they try to do that
right from the beginning.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.030
And then suddenly, the whole
thing collapses.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.240
Because their models
are no damn good.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.220
There's nothing wrong with their
mathematics, it's that

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.770
their models are no good.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.710
So please, especially if you're
going to do something

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.940
important in your lives--

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.410
if you're just going to write
papers in engineering

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.000
journals, maybe it's
all right.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.940
But if you're going to make
decisions about things, please

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.060
spend some time thinking about
the probability models that

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.890
you come up because this
is vitally important.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.110
OK, what's probability?

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.630
It's a branch of mathematics.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.870
Now we're into something
that's more familiar,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.420
something that's simpler,
something we can deal with.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.340
You might be uncomfortable
with what

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.280
probability really means.

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.660
And all probability books, all
stochastic process books are

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.080
uncomfortable with this.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.250
Feller is the best book
in probability

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.260
there's ever been written.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.090
Any question you have, he
probably has the answer to it.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:26.960
When you look at what he says
about real-world probability,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.150
the modeling issues, he's an
extraordinarily bright guy.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.900
And he spent some time
thinking about this.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.360
But you read it and you realize

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.630
that it's pure nonsense.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.710
So please, take my
word for it.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.780
Don't assume that real-world
probability is something

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.070
you're going to learn about from
other people because you

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.120
can't trust what any
of them say.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.800
It's something you have to think
through for yourselves,

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.410
and we'll talk more about
this as we go.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.200
But now, when we get into
mathematics, that's fine.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.440
We just create models.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.090
And once we have the model,
we just use it.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.680
We have standard models for
all sorts of different

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.260
standard problems.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.890
When you talk about coin
tossing, what almost everyone

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.339
means is not this crazy thing I
was just talking about where

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.800
you have an initial angular
momentum when you flip a coin

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.300
and all of that stuff.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.990
It's a purely mathematical model
where a coin is flipped

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.440
and with probability one half
it comes up heads and with

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.070
probability one half
it comes up tails.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.050
OK, students are given a
well-specified model, and they

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.840
calculate various things.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.370
This is in mathematical
probability.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.710
Heads and tails are equiprobable
in that system.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.510
Subsequent tosses
are independent.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.630
Here's a little bit
of cynicism.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.700
I apologize for insulting
you people with it.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.430
I apologize to any faculty
member who later reads this.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.300
And I particularly apologize to
businessmen and government

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.070
people who might read it.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.840
Students compute, professors
write papers, business and

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.290
government leaders obtain
questionable models and data

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.540
on which they can
blame failures.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.070
Most cynical towards business
leaders because business

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.220
leaders often hire
consultants.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.300
Not so much to learn what to do,
but so they have excuses

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.430
when what they do doesn't
work out right.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.220
When I say the students compute,
what I mean is this

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.030
in almost all the courses you've
taken up until now--

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.390
and in this course also--

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.220
what you're going
to be doing is

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.820
solving well-posed problems.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.730
You solve well-posed exercises
because that's a good way to

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.340
understand what the
mathematics of

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.410
the subject is about.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.780
Don't think that that's
the only part of it.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.690
If that's the only thing you're
doing, you might as

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:55.830
well not waste your time.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.600
You might as well do
something else.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.730
You might as well go out and
shovel snow today instead of

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.860
trying to learn about
probability theory.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.960
It's more pleasant to learn
about probability theory.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.010
OK, the use of probability
models has two major

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.300
problems with it.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.400
The first problem is, how do
you make a model for a

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.600
real-world problem?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.930
And a partial answer is, learn
about estimation and decisions

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.150
in the context of
standard models.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:31.870
In other words, decisions and
estimation inside a completely

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.880
mathematical framework.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.480
Then you learn a great
deal about the

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.140
real-world problem itself.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.880
Not about the mathematics of it,
but about how you actually

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.270
understand what's going on.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.740
If you talk to somebody
who is a superb

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.030
architect in any field--

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.420
networks, computer systems,
control systems, anything--

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.500
what are you going to find?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.630
You're not going to find huge,
involved sets of equations

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.700
that they're going to use to
explain something to you.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.780
They're going to pick at-- if
there any good, they're going

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.480
to take this big problem, and
they're going to take your

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.560
issue with this big problem.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.700
And they're going to find the
one or two really important

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.790
things that tell you something
that you have to know.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.350
And that's what you want to
get out of this course.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.150
You want to get the ability to
take all of the chat, put it

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.920
all together, and be able to
say one or two important

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.220
things which is really
necessary.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.670
That's where you're going to.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.300
Before you get there, you'll
take low-level jobs in various

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.570
companies and you'll compute
a lot of things.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.310
You'll simulate a
lot of things.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.540
You'll deal with a
lot of detail.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.170
Eventually, you're going to get
to the point where you've

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.920
got to make major decisions.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.800
And you want to be
ready for it.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.580
OK, that's enough philosophy.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.830
I will try to give no more
philosophy today, except when

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.080
I get pushed into it.

00:21:09.776 --> 00:21:15.930
OK, one of the problems in this
problem of finding a good

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.880
model is that no model
is perfect.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.130
Namely, what happens is you
keep finding more and more

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.050
complicated models, which
deal with more

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.990
and more of the issues.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:31.100
And as you deal with them,
things get more complicated.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.380
You're more down in the
level of details and

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.640
you're finding out less.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.850
So you want to find some sort of
match between a model that

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.880
tells you something and a model
which is complicated

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.180
enough to deal with
the issues.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.740
There's a beautiful quote by
Alfred North Whitehead.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.960
I don't know whether you've
ever heard of Whitehead.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.160
You've probably heard of
Bertrand Russell, who was both

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:01.000
a great logician and a great
philosopher, and had a lot to

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.590
do with the origins
of set theory.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.570
Whitehead and Russell together,
wrote this massive

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:14.160
book around the turn of the last
century between the 1900s

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.630
and the 2000s called Principia
Mathematica where they try to

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.220
resolve all of the paradoxes
which were coming up in

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.420
mathematics.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.920
And Whitehead's general
philosophical comment was,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.580
"Seek simplicity and
distrust it."

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.025
Now, every time I look at
that, I say, why in hell

00:22:37.025 --> 00:22:41.640
didn't he say, seek simplicity
and question it?

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.850
I mean, you all hear about
questioning authority, of

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.520
course, and that's
important to do.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.310
Why when you find a simple model
for something should you

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.420
distrust it?

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.670
Well, the reason is
psychological.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.660
If you find a simple model for
something and you question it,

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.260
you have an enormous
psychological bias towards not

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.550
giving up the simple model.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.340
You want to keep that
simple model.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.270
And therefore, it takes an
enormous amount of evidence

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.770
before you're going to
give something out.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.530
Whitehead said something
more than that.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.400
He said, "Seek simplicity
and distrust it."

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.940
Now, why do I talk about the
philosophy of science when

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.110
we're trying to learn about
probability theory?

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.480
Well, probability theory is
a mathematical theory.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.960
It's the basis for a great
deal of science.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.050
And it's the place where
modeling is most difficult.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.600
Scientific questions in most
areas, if there's no

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.140
probability or uncertainty
involved, you just do an

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.170
experiment that tells
you the answer.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.330
You might not do it carefully
enough and then 10 other

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.380
people do it.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.670
And finally, everybody
agrees, this is the

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.140
answer to that problem.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.930
In probability, it ain't
that simple.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.720
And that's why one has to focus
on this a little more

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.740
than usual.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:04.730
The second problem is, how do
you make a probability model

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.430
that has no hidden
paradoxes in it?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:11.130
In other words, when you make
a mathematical model, how do

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.930
you make sure that it really
is well-posed?

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.490
How do you make sure that when
you solve a problem in that

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.400
mathematical model that you
don't come to something that

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.820
doesn't make any sense?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.060
Well, everyone's answer to that
is you use Kolmogorov's

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.030
axioms of probability.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.190
Because back in 1933, Kolmogorov
published this

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.410
little thin book.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.370
Those of you who are interested
in the history of

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.620
science probably ought
to read it.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.530
You will find you only
understand the first five

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:46.330
pages the first time
you look at it.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.170
But it's worthwhile doing that
because here was one of the

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.930
truly great minds of the
early 20th century.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.260
And he took everything he knew
about probability, which was a

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.630
whole lot more than I know
certainly, and a whole lot

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.740
more than anybody else at the
time knew, and he collapsed it

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.100
into these very simple axioms.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.330
And he said, if you obey these
axioms in a model that you use

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.580
in probability, those axioms
will keep you out of any

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.270
paradoxes at all.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.690
And then, he showed why that
was and he showed how the

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.845
axioms could be used
and so forth.

00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:25.990
So we're going to spend a little
bit of time talking

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.790
about them today.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:31.850
OK, quickly, what is a discrete
stochastic process?

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.180
Well, a stochastic process--

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.100
you've been talking
about probability.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.690
And you might be getting the
idea that I'm just using the

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.670
name "stochastic processes" as
a foil for talking about what

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.210
I really love, which
is the probability.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.210
And there's a certain amount
of truth to that.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.360
But stochastic processes are
special types of probability

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.680
models where the sample points
represent functions in time.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.420
In other words, when we're
dealing with a probability

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.270
model, the basis of
a probability

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.750
model is a sample space.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.220
It's the set of possible things
that might happen.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.550
And you can reduce that to the
sample points, which are the

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:20.010
indivisible, little, tiny crumbs
of what happens when

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:20.790
you do an experiment.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.080
It's the thing which specifies
everything that can be

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.040
specified in that model
of that experiment.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.670
OK, when you get to a stochastic
process, what

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:35.600
you're doing is you're looking
at a situation in which these

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.560
sample points, the solutions to
what happens is, in fact, a

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.550
whole sequence of random
variables in time.

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:53.410
And what that means is instead
of looking at just a vector of

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.070
random variables, you're going
to be looking at a whole

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.040
sequence of random variables.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.890
Now, what is different about a
vector of a very large number

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.580
of random variables
and an infinite

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.280
sequence of random variables?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.150
Well, from an engineering
standpoint, not very much.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:18.060
I mean, there's nothing you can
do to actually look at an

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.160
infinite sequence of
random variables.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.380
If you start out at the Big Bang
and you carry it on to

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.220
what you might imagine is the
time when the sun explodes or

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.380
something, that's a finite
amount of time.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:37.330
And if you imagine how fast
you can observe things,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.530
there's a finite number
of random

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.280
variables you might observe.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.670
All these models we're going to
be dealing with get outside

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.960
or that realm, and they deal
with something that starts

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.200
infinitely far in the
past and goes

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.760
infinitely far in the future.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.860
It doesn't make much
sense, does it?

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.610
But then look at the
alternative.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:01.800
You built a device which
you're going to sell to

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.840
people, and which they're
going to use.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.660
And you know they're only going
to use it three or four

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.970
year until something
better comes along.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:13.410
But do you want to build in to
everything you're doing the

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.790
idea that it's going to be
obsolete in three years?

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.390
No.

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:21.510
You want to design this thing
so, in fact, it will work for

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.300
an essentially arbitrary
amount of time.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.160
And therefore, you make a
mathematical model of it.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.860
You look at what happens over
an infinite span of time.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.330
So whenever we get into
mathematics, we always go to

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.290
an infinite number of
things rather than a

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.130
finite number of things.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.420
Now, discrete stochastic
processes are those where the

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.560
random variables are
discrete in time.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.820
Namely, a finite number
of possible outcomes

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.880
from each of them.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:55.340
Or the set of possible sample
values is discrete.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.000
What does that mean?

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.090
It doesn't mean a whole lot when
you really start asking

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.680
detailed questions about this.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.420
What it means is, I want to talk
about a particular kind

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.760
of stochastic processes.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:15.740
And it's a class of processes
which will be more than we can

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.600
deal with in one term.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.900
And I want to exclude certain
processes, like noise

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.890
processes, because we don't have
time to do both of them.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.980
So don't worry too much about
exactly what a discrete

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.230
stochastic process is.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.930
It's whatever we want to call
it when we deal with it.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.630
Oops.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.252
Oh, where am I?

00:29:43.252 --> 00:29:47.180
Oh, I wanted to talk about the
different processes we're

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.540
going to study.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.310
The first kind of process
is what we

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:54.310
call a counting process.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:57.230
The sample points in the
process-- remember, a sample

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.660
point specifies everything
about an experiment.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.660
It tells you every
little detail.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.010
And the sample points here
in counting processes are

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.980
sequences of arrivals.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:13.140
This is a very useful idea in
dealing with queuing systems

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.260
because queuing systems
have arrivals.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.670
They have departures.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.120
They have rules for how the
arrivals get processed before

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.300
they get spit out.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.220
And a big part of that is
studying first the arrival

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.420
process, then we study the
departure process.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.330
We study how to put
them together.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.730
And when we get to chapter 2 of
the notes, we're going to

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.400
be studying Poisson processes,
which are in a sense, the

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.020
perfect discrete stochastic
process.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.660
It's like coin tossing
in probability.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.930
Everything that might
be true with a

00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.530
Poisson process is true.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.830
The only things that aren't
true are the things that

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.130
obviously can't be true.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.280
And we'll find out why
that is and how that

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.150
works a little later.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.750
We're then going to
study renewal

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.950
processes in chapter 4.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.510
We're going to put Markov
chains in between.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.800
And you'll see why
when we do it.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.960
And renewal processes are a more
complicated kind of thing

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.810
than Poisson processes.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.440
And there's no point confusing
you at this point saying what

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.800
the difference is, so I won't.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.690
Markov processes
are processes.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.590
In other words, the sequences
in time of things where what

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.270
happens in the future depends
on what happens in the past,

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.820
only through the state
at the present.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.140
In other words, if you can
specify the state in the

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.760
present, you can forget about
everything in the past.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.750
If you have those kinds of
processes around, you don't

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.030
have to study history at all,
which would be very nice.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:58.110
But unfortunately, not all
processes behave that way.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.860
When you do the modeling to try
to find out what the state

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.650
is, which is what you have to
know at the present, you find

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.050
out there's a lot of
history involved.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.470
OK, finally, we're going to talk
about random wa;ls and

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.640
martingales.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.030
I'm not going to even say
what a random walks or

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.410
a martingale is.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.580
We will find out about that
soon enough, but I want to

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.760
tell you that's what's in
chapter 7 of the notes.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.420
That's the last topic
we will deal with.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.690
We'll study all sorts of
mixtures of these.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.990
Things which involve a
little bit of each.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.790
We'll start out working
on one thing and

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.070
we'll find out another.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:34.000
One of these other topics is the
right way to look at it.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.390
If you want to know more about
that, please go look at the

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.490
notes, and you'll find out
as much as you want.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:46.210
But it's not appropriate to
talk about it right now.

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.400
OK, when, where, and
how is this useful?

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.410
You see, I'm almost at the
point where we'll start

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.130
actually talking about
real stuff.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.440
And when I say real stuff, I
mean mathematical stuff, which

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.780
is not real stuff.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.040
Broad answer--

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.160
probability in stochastic
processes are an important

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.470
adjunct to rational thought
about all human

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.160
and scientific endeavor.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.500
That's a very strong
statement.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.210
I happen to believe it.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.250
You might not believe it.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.720
And you're welcome to
not believe it.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.220
It won't be on a quiz or
anything, believe me.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:34.010
But almost anything you have to
deal with is dealing with

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.860
something in the future.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.890
I mean, you have to plan for
things which are going to

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.180
happen in the future.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.180
When you look at the future,
there's a lot of uncertainty

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.740
involved with it.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.080
One of the ways is dealing
with uncertainty.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.670
And probably the only scientific
way of dealing with

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.180
uncertainty is through
the mechanism

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.660
of probability models.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.760
So anything you want to deal
with, which is important,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.000
you're probably better off
knowing something about

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.050
probability than not.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.810
A narrow answer is probability
in stochastic processes are

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.989
essential components of
the following areas.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.889
Now, I must confess I made up
this list in about 10 minutes

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.860
without thinking about
it very seriously.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.880
And these things are related
to each other.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.690
Some of them are parts
of others.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.360
Let me read them.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.330
Communication systems
and networks.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.960
That's where I got involved
in this question, and very

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.350
important there.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.820
Computer systems.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.420
I also got involved in it
because of computer systems.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.940
Queuing in all areas.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.400
Well, I got involved in queuing
because of being

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.409
interested in networks.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.820
risk management in all areas.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.370
I got interested in that because
I started to get

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.790
disturbed about civilization
destroying itself because

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.199
people who have a great deal of
power don't know anything

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.449
about taking risks.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.560
OK, catastrophe management.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.860
How do you prevent oil spills
and things like that?

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.960
How do you prevent nuclear
plants from going off?

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.660
How do you prevent nuclear
weapons from falling in the

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.320
hands of the wrong people?

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.050
These again, are probability
issues.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.760
These are important probability
issues because

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.430
most people don't regard them
as probability issues.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.520
If you say there is one chance
in a billion that something

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.510
will happen, 3/4 of the
population will say, that's

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.460
not acceptable.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.400
I don't want any risk.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.050
And these people are fools.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:44.950
But unfortunately, these fools
outnumber those of us who have

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.440
studied these issues.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.460
So we have to deal with it.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.340
We have to understand
it if nothing else.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.890
OK, failures in all
types of systems--

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.790
operations research, biology,
medicine, optical systems, and

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.070
control system.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.500
Name your own favorite thing.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.550
You can put it all in.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:04.410
Probability gets used
everywhere.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.660
OK, let's go to the axioms.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.480
Probability models have three
components to them.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.020
There's a sample space.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.810
Now, here we're in mathematics
again.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:24.050
The sample space is just
a set of things.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.660
You don't have to be at all
specific about what those

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.970
things are.

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.400
I mean, at this point we're
right in to set theory, which

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.400
is the most basic part
of mathematics again.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.430
And a set contains elements.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.890
And that's what we're
talking about here.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.700
So there's a sample space.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.770
There are the elements
in that sample space.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.120
There's also a collection
of things called events.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.650
Now, the events are subsets
of the sample space.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:02.700
And if you're dealing with a
finite set of things, there's

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.740
no reason why the events should
not be all subsets of

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.830
that countable collection
of things.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.870
If you have a deck of cards,
there are 52 factorial ways of

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:17.310
arranging the cards in
that deck of cards.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:19.590
Very large number.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.290
But when you talk about subsets
of that, you might as

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:29.530
well talk about all combinations
of those

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.550
configurations of the deck.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.770
You can talk about, what's the
probability that the first

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.770
five cards in that deck happen
to contain 4 aces?

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.870
That's an easy thing
to compute.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:44.010
I'm sure you've all computed
it at some point or other.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.640
Those who like to play poker,
of course do this.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.960
It's fun.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.540
But it's a straightforward
problem.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.660
When you have these countable
sets of things, there's no

00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:01.010
reason at all for not having the
set of events consist of

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:04.200
all possible subsets.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.150
Well, people believed that
for a long time.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.640
One of the things that forced
Kolmogorov to start dealing

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.420
with these axioms was the
realization that when you had

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.010
much more complicated sets,
where in fact you had the set

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:21.910
of real numbers as possible
outcomes, or sequences of

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.460
things which go from 0 to
infinity, and all of these

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:32.000
sets, which are uncountable,
you really can't make sense

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.960
out of probability models where
all subsets of sample

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.240
points are called events.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.020
So in terms of measure theory,
you're forced to restrict the

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:46.980
set of things you call events.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.860
Now, we're not going to
deal with measure

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.200
theory in this subject.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.710
But every once in a while, we
will have to mention it

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:59.130
because the reason why a lot of
things are the way they are

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.260
is because of measure theory.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.900
So you'll have to be at
least conscious of it.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.040
If you really want to be
serious, as far as your study

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.310
of mathematical probability
theory, you really have to

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.570
take a course in measure
theory at some point.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.240
But you don't have
to do it now.

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.640
In fact, I would almost urge
most of you not to do it now.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:26.440
Because once you get all the
way into measure theory,

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.310
you're so far into measure
theory that you can't come

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.790
back and think about real
problems anymore.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.460
You're suddenly stuck in the
world of mathematics, which

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.080
happens to lots of people.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.100
So anyway, some of you should
learn about all this

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.720
mathematics.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.670
Some of you shouldn't.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:45.585
Some of you should learn
about it later.

00:39:45.585 --> 00:39:48.150
So you can do whatever
you want.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.590
OK, the axioms about events
is that if you

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.950
have a set of events.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.260
In other words, a set of
subsets, and it's a countable

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.310
set, then the union
of all of those--

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.190
the union from n equals
1 to infinity of a sub

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.750
n is also an event.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.510
I've gone for 50 minutes
and nobody has

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.660
asked a question yet.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.910
Who has a question?

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.990
Who thinks that all of
this is nonsense?

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.050
How many of you?

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.300
I do.

00:40:26.104 --> 00:40:28.830
OK, I'll come back in
another 10 minutes.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.320
And if nobody has a question
by then, I'm just going to

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.560
stop and wait.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:35.530
OK, so anyway.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.990
If you look at a union
of events.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:44.410
Now, remember, that an event
is a subset of points.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.920
We're just talking about
set theory now.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:51.360
So the union of this
union here--

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.620
excuse me.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:58.960
This union here is A1, all the
points in A1, and all the

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.230
points in A2, and all the points
in A3, all the way up

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.970
to infinity.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.060
That's what we're talking
about here.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.020
And one of the axioms of
probability theory is that if

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.650
each of these things are events,
then this union is

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.420
also an event.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.590
That's just an axiom.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:18.930
You can't define events
if that's not true.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:22.640
And if you try to define events
where this isn't true,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.400
you eventually come into the
most god awful problems you

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.090
might imagine.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.110
And suddenly, nothing
make sense anymore.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:36.700
Most of the time when we define
a set of events in a

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.170
probability model, each
singleton event--

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:44.070
namely, each single point has
a set, which contains only

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.060
that element, is taken
as an event.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.930
There's no real reason
to not do that.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:54.890
If you don't do that, you might
as well just put those

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:59.430
points together and not regard
them as separate points.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.910
We will see an example in a
little bit where, in fact, you

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.950
might want to do that.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.080
But let's hold that off
for a little bit.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.320
OK, not all subsets
need to be events.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.190
Usually, each sample point is
taken to be a singleton event.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.870
And then non-events are
truly weird things.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.320
I mean, as soon as you take
all sample points to be

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:24.460
events, all countable unions of
sample points are events.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.490
And then intersections of events
are events, and so

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.330
forth, and so forth,
and so forth.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.610
So most things are events.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.820
And just because of measure
theory, you can't make all

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.580
things events.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.610
And I'm not going to give you
any example of that because

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.030
examples are horrendous.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:51.120
OK, the empty set has
to be an event.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.850
Why does the empty set
have to be an event.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.293
If we're going to believe
these axioms--

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.990
I'm in a real bind here because
every one of you

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:05.230
people has seen these
axioms before.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:10.320
And you've all gone on and said,
I can get an A in any

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.630
probability class in the world
without having any idea of

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.900
what these axioms
are all about.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.620
And therefore, it's
unimportant.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:21.180
So you see something
that says, the

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.370
empty set is an event.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.450
And you say, well, of
course that has

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.780
nothing to do with anything.

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.450
Why should I worry about whether
the empty set is an

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.960
event or not?

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.730
The empty set can't happen,
so how can it be an event?

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.380
Well, because of these axioms,
it has to be an event.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:40.750
The axioms say that if A is an
event, and that's the whole

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.640
sample space, then the
complement has

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.380
to be an event also.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.320
So that says that the empty
set has to be an event.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.320
And that just follows
from the axioms.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.910
If all sample points are
singleton events, then all

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:59.250
finite and countable
sets are events.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.790
And finally, deMorgan's law.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:05.700
Is there anyone who isn't
familiar with deMorgan's law?

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.210
Anyone who hasn't seen
even that small

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.140
amount of set theory?

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.570
If not, look it up on--

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:23.120
what's the name of
the computer--

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.560
Wikipedia.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.260
Most of you will think
that things on

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.470
Wikipedia are not reliable.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:34.070
Strangely enough, in terms of
probability theory and a lot

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.930
of mathematics, Wikipedia does
things a whole lot better than

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.150
most textbooks do.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.520
So any time you're unfamiliar
with what a word means or

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.170
something, you can look
it up in your

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.300
old probability textbook.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.270
If you've used [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:53.310
and [INAUDIBLE], you will
probably find the

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.670
right answer there.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.630
Other textbooks, maybe
the right answer.

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:00.520
Wikipedia's more reliable
than most of them.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.920
And it's also clearer
than most of them.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.240
So I highly recommend using
Wikipedia whenever you get

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.750
totally confused by something.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:17.020
OK, so probability measure
and events satisfies

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.440
the following axioms.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.350
We've said what things
are events.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.710
The only things that have
probabilities are events.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:27.920
So the entire set has
a probability.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.630
When you do the experiment,
something has to happen.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:32.560
So one of the sample
points occurs.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.820
That's the whole idea
of probability.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.960
And therefore, omega
has probability 1.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.540
Capital Omega.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:44.010
If A is an event, then the
probability of A has to be

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.370
greater than or equal to 0.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:49.670
You can probably see without too
much trouble why it has to

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:51.790
be less than or equal
to 1 also.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:53.700
But that's not one
of the axioms.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:59.670
You see, when you state a set of
axioms for something, you'd

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:03.970
like to use the minimum set of
axioms you can, so that you

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:07.590
don't have to verify too many
things before you say, yes,

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.120
this satisfies all the axioms.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.680
So the second one is the
probability of A has to be

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.940
greater than or equal to 0.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.880
The third one says that if you
have a sequence of disjoint

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.450
events, incidentally when I say
a sequence, I will almost

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.885
always mean a countably
infinite sequence--

00:46:25.885 --> 00:46:29.740
A1, A2, A3, all the way up.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.980
If I'm talking about what
most of you would

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.130
call a finite sequence--

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.610
and I like the word "finite
sequence," but I like to be

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.450
able to talk about sequences.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.180
I'm talking about a finite
sequence I will usually call

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.280
it an n-tuple of random
variables or

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.400
an n-tuple of things.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.380
So sequence really means you
go the whole way out.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:55.800
OK, if A1, A2, all the way
up are disjoint events--

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.630
disjoint.

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.460
Disjoint means if omega is only
in one, it can't be in

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.690
any of the others.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.990
Then the probability of this
countable union is going to be

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.830
equal to the sum of the
probabilities of the

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.980
individual event.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.910
Anyone who has ever done a
probability problem knows all

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.200
of these things.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.570
The only thing you don't know
and you probably haven't

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:19.760
thought about is why
everything else

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.730
follows from this.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.610
But this is the whole
mathematical theory.

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:27.040
Why should we study
it anymore?

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.210
We're done.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:29.340
We have the axioms.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.430
Everything else follows, it's
just a matter of computation.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.180
Just sit down and do it.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.480
Not quite that simple.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.990
Anyway, a few consequences of
the probability of the empty

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:51.030
set is 0, which says when you
do an experiment something's

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.690
going to happen.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:55.360
And therefore, the probability
that nothing happens is 0

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.440
because that's what
the model says.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:02.320
The probability of the
complement of an event is 1

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.380
minus the probability
of that event.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.260
Which, in fact, is what's says
that all events have to have

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.240
probabilities less than
or equal to 1.

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.250
And if the event A is contained
in the event B--

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.870
remember when we talk about
events, we're talking about

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.780
two different things,
both simultaneously.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:26.150
One of them is this beautiful
idea with measure theory

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.340
worked into it and
everything else.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.910
And the other is just a simple
set theoretic idea.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.170
And all we need to be
familiar with is a

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:36.870
set theoretical idea.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:42.190
Within that set theoretical
idea, A contained in B means

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.400
that every sample point that's
in A is also in B. It means

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.650
that when you do an experiment,
and the event A

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:53.360
occurs, the event B has to
occur because one of the

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:57.610
things that compose
A has to occur.

00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:01.255
And that thing has to be in B
because A is contained in B.

00:49:01.255 --> 00:49:04.390
So the probability of A has to
be less than or equal to the

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:08.170
probability of B. That has to
be less than or equal to 1.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.310
These are things you all know.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.230
Another consequence is
the union bound.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.690
Many of you have probably
seen the union bound.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:22.830
We will use it probably almost
every day in this course.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.600
So it's good to have that as one
of the things you remember

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.740
at the highest level.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.780
If you have a set of events--

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.360
A1, A2, and so forth--

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.270
the probability of
that union--

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:38.950
namely, the event that consists
of all of them--

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:43.360
is less than or equal to the
sum of the individual event

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.010
probabilities.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:52.540
I give a little proof here for
just two events, A1 and A2.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.790
So you see why this is true.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.950
I hope you can extend
this to 3 and 4.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.400
I can't draw a picture of
it very easily for 3

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.780
and 4 and so forth.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.980
But here's the event A1.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.830
Here's the event A2.

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:10.320
Visualize this as a set of
sample points, which are just

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.720
in the two-dimensional
space here.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.730
So all these points
here are in A1.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.790
All these points are in A2.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.750
This set of points here
are the points that

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.770
are in A1 and A2.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.610
I will use just writing things
next to each other to mean

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:28.630
intersection.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:33.950
And sometimes I'll use a big
cap to main intersection.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:37.810
So all of these things are
both in A1 and A2.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.550
This is A2, but not A1.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:45.860
So the probability of this whole
event, A1 union A2, is

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.810
the probability of this thing
and this thing together.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:53.300
So it's the probability
of this plus the

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.040
probability of this.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.890
The probability of this is less
than the probability of

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:05.630
A2 because this is contained
in that whole rectangle.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.680
And therefore, the probability
of the union of A1 and A2 is

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:13.160
less than or equal to the
probability of A1 plus

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.060
probability of A2.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.700
Now, the classy way to extend
this to a countably infinite

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.860
set is to use induction.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.340
And I leave that as something
that you can all play with

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.090
some time when it's not between
9:30 and 11:00 in the

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.050
morning and you're struggling
to stay awake.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.410
And if you don't want to do that
on your own, you can look

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.430
at it in the notes.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:45.550
OK, these axioms look
ho-hum to you.

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:47.970
And you've always ignored them
before, and you think you're

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.440
going to be able to
ignore them now.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.670
Partly you can, but partly you
can't because every once in a

00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:58.660
while we'll start doing things
where you really need to

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.510
understand what the
axioms say.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:06.770
OK, one other thing which you
might not have noticed.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:10.570
When you studied elementary
probability, wherever you

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:15.040
studied it, what do you spend
most of your time doing?

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.160
You spent most of your time
talking about random variables

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.740
and talking about
expectations.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:28.370
The axioms don't have random
variables in them.

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.850
They don't have expectations
in them.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.560
All they have in them
is events and

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.230
probabilities of events.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.380
So these axioms say that the
really important things in

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:43.480
probability are the events and
the probabilities of events.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.820
And the random variables and the
expectations are derived

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:51.480
quantities, which we'll now
start to talk about.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.470
OK, so we're now down to
independent events and

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.980
experiments.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:02.350
Two events, A1 and A2, are
independent if the probability

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:05.310
of the two of them is equal
to the product of their

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:06.290
probabilities.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.400
You've all seen this.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.970
I'm sure you've all seen it.

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:13.090
If you haven't at least seen it,
you probably shouldn't be

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:17.240
in this class because even
though the text does

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.920
everything in detail that has to
be done, you need to have a

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.660
little bit of insight from
having dealt with these

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.410
subjects before.

00:53:26.410 --> 00:53:28.830
If you don't have that, you're
just going to get lost very,

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.570
very quickly.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:35.440
So the probability is the
intersection of the event A1

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.160
and A2 is the product
of the two.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.590
Now, in other words, you have
a red die and a white die.

00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:49.900
You flip the dice, what's the
probability that you get a 1

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.360
for the red die and a
1 for the white die?

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:57.630
Well, the probability you get
a 1 for the red die is 1/6.

00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.360
Just by symmetry, there are only
6 possible things that

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.470
can happen.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:04.040
Probability of white
die comes up as 1.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.530
Probability is 1/6 for that.

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:12.720
And the probability of the two
things, they're independent.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:16.970
There's a sense of real-world
independence and probability

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.420
theory independence.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.290
Real-world independence says the
two things are isolated,

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.290
they don't interfere
with each other.

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:28.020
Probability theory says just
by definition, well, the

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.800
real-world idea of them not
interfering with each other

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.390
should say--

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:38.820
and I'm waving my hands here
because this is so elementary,

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.690
you all know it.

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.620
And I would bore you if I
talked about it more.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.305
But I probably should
talk about it, but

00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:46.280
I'm not going to.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:50.060
Anyway, this is the definition
of independence.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.000
If you don't have any idea of
how this corresponds to being

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.510
unconnected in the real-world,
then go to Wikipedia.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:59.330
Read the notes.

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.760
Well, you should read
the notes anyway.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.980
I hope you will read the notes
because I'm not going to say

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.140
everything in class that
needs to be said.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:10.450
And you will get a better
feeling for it.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.820
Now, here's something
important.

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:17.410
Given two probability models,
a combined model can be

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:22.460
defined in which, first, the
sample space, omega, is the

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:26.820
Cartesian product of omega
1 and omega 2.

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.950
Namely, it's the Cartesian
product of

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:30.820
the two sample spaces.

00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:34.390
Think of rolling the red
die and the white die.

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.740
Rolling a red die is
an experiment.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.460
There are 6 possible
outcomes, a 1 to 6.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.940
Rolled a white die, there
are 6 possible

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.940
outcomes, a 1 to a 6.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.250
You roll the two dice together,
and you really need

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.890
to have some way of
putting these

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:51.510
two experiments together.

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:52.650
How do you put them together?

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:57.770
You talk about the outcome for
the two dice, number for one

00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.020
and number for the other.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.200
The Cartesian product simply
means you have the set made up

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.680
of 1 to 6 Cartesian product
with 1 to 6.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.065
So you have 36 possibilities.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.010
It's an interesting thing,
which comes from

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.790
Kolmogorov's axioms.

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:27.420
That, in fact, you can take in
any two probability models for

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.100
two different experiments.

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:33.440
You can take this Cartesian
product of sample points.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.830
You can assume that what happens
here is independent of

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.500
what happens here.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.600
And when you do this, you will,
in fact, get something

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.180
for the two experiments put
together which satisfies

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.850
Kolmogorov's axioms.

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:53.590
That is neither trivial nor
very hard to prove.

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:58.020
I mean, for the case of two
dice, you can see it almost

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.990
immediately.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.720
I mean, you see what the
sample space is.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:06.220
It's this Cartesian product.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.460
And you see what the
probabilities have to be

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:12.370
because the probability of, say,
1 and 2 for the red die

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:18.070
and 1 and 2 for the white
is 2, 6 times 2, 6.

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:24.180
So with probability 1/9, you're
going to get a 1 and a

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.360
2 combined with a 1 and a 2.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.440
I'm going to talk a little
bit later about something

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.240
that you all know.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.650
What happens if you roll
two white dice?

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:40.380
This is something you all ought
to think about a little

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:44.420
bit because it really isn't
as simple as it sounds.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:49.840
If you roll two dice, what's
the probability that you'll

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.440
get a 1 and a 2?

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.440
And how can you justify that?

00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.660
First, what's a sample space
when you roll two white dice?

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.630
Well, if you look at the
possible things that might

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:15.640
happen, you can get 1, 1; 2,
2; 3, 3; 4, 4; 5, 5; 6, 6.

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.140
You can also get 1, 2 or 2, 1.

00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.930
But you can't tell them apart,
so there's one sample point,

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.170
you might say, which
is 1, 2, and 2, 1.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:29.410
Another sample point which is
2, 3; 3, 2, and so forth.

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:33.740
If you count them up, there are
21 separate sample points

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:35.990
that you might have.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:41.150
And when you look at what the
probabilities ought to be, the

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.410
probabilities of the
pairs are 136 each.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:48.830
And the probabilities of the
I J, where I is unequal

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:53.380
to J is 1/18 each.

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:56.080
That's awful.

00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.400
So what do you do?

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.540
When you're rolling two dice,
you do the same thing that

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.860
everybody else does.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.800
You say, well, even though it's
two white dice, I'm going

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.850
to think of it as if it's a
white die and a red die.

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:12.060
I'm going to think of it as if
the two are indistinguishable.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.950
My sample space is going to be
these 36 different things.

00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:18.100
I will never be able
to distinguish a

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.340
1, 2 from a 2, 1.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.690
But I don't care because
I now know the

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.450
probability of each of them.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:30.850
What I'm trying to say by this,
is this a very, very

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:36.100
trivial example of where you
really have to think through

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.000
the question of what kind of
mathematical model do you want

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.220
of the most simple situation
you can think of almost.

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.290
When you combine two different
experiments together and you

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.930
lose distinguishability,
then what do you do?

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:55.390
Well, the sensible thing to
do is assume that the

00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:58.010
distinguishability is still
there, but it's not

00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:59.260
observable.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.760
But that makes it hard to make
a correspondence between the

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.070
real world and the probability
world.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.660
So we'll come back
to that later.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.770
But for the most part, you don't
have to worry about it

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.810
because this is something
you've dealt

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.060
with all of your lives.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.340
I mean, you've done probability

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.730
problems with dice.

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:27.200
You've done probability problems
with all sorts of

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.140
other things where things are

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:31.230
indistinguishable from each other.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:36.140
And after doing a few of these
problems, you are used to

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.630
being schizophrenic about it.

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:41.300
And on one hand, thinking
that these things are

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.090
distinguishable to figure
out what all the

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:44.600
probabilities are.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.460
And then you go back to saying,
well, they aren't

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.600
really distinguishable, and
you find the right answer.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.010
So you don't have to
worry about it.

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:59.390
All I'm trying to say here is
that you should understand it.

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:03.460
Because when you get the
complicated situations, this

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.540
is one of the main things which
will cause confusion.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.260
It's one of the main things
where people write papers and

01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:14.180
other people say that paper is
wrong because they're both

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.420
thinking of different
models for it.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:23.130
Important thing is if you
satisfy Kolmogorov's axioms in

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:27.140
each of a set of models, and
most important thing is where

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.200
each of these models are
exactly the same.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.080
And then you make them each
independent of each other,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.960
Kolmogorov's axioms are going
to be satisfied for the

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.950
combination, as well as
the individual model.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:44.030
Why do I care about that?

01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.600
Because we're studying
stochastic processes.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.370
We're studying an infinite
sequence of random variables.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:56.890
And I don't want to generate a
complete probability model for

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.660
an infinite set of random
variables every time I talk

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:02.410
about an infinite set
of random variables.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:04.850
If I'm talking about an infinite
sequence of flipping

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:10.040
a coin, I want to do what you
do, which is say, for each

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:16.700
coin, the coin is equiprobably
a head or a tail.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.830
And the coin tosses are
independent of each other.

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:23.070
And I want to know that I can go
from that to thinking about

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.060
this sequence.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.990
Strange things will happen
in these sequences when

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:28.250
we go to the limit.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:32.720
But still, we don't want to have
to worry about a model

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.770
for the whole infinite
sequence.

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:39.650
So that's one of the things
we should deal with.

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:40.900
Finally, random variables.

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:45.580
Definition.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:51.810
Three years ago, I taught this
course and I asked people to

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:55.880
write down definition of what
a random variable was.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.140
And almost no one really had
any idea of what it was.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.870
They said it was something
that had a probability

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:06.620
density, or something that had
a probability mass function,

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:10.390
or something that had a
distribution function, or

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:12.570
something like that.

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:17.190
What it is, if you want to get
a definition which fits in

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:20.640
with the axioms, the only thing
we know from the axioms

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.750
is there's a sample space.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.500
There are events and there
are probabilities.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.910
So a random variable, what it
really is, is it's a function

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:37.370
from the set of sample points
to the set of real values.

01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:41.150
And as you get into this, you
will realize that the set of

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:43.300
real values does not
include minus

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.250
infinity or plus infinity.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.800
It says that every sample
point gets mapped into a

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.800
finite value.

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.630
This happens, of course,
when you flip a coin.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.560
Well, flipping a coin,
the outcome is

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.140
not a random variable.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.440
But you'd like to make it a
random variable, so you say,

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.810
OK, I'm going to model
tails as 0 and heads

01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:05.640
as 1, or vice versa.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.200
And then what happens?

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.860
Your model for coin tossing,
a sequence of coin tosses

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:17.550
becomes the same as your
model for data.

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:20.690
So that what you know about coin
tossing, you can apply to

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.920
data compression.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.040
You see, when you think about
these things mathematically,

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.500
then you can make all sorts
of connections you

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.250
couldn't make otherwise.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:37.010
So random variables have to
satisfy the constraint that--

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:51.340
they have to satisfy the
constraint that the set of

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:56.970
sample points, such that x, x
of omega, which is a real

01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.080
number, is less than or equal
to some given real number.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.050
That this set has
to be an event.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.680
Because those are the only
things that have

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.310
probabilities.

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:09.970
So if we want to be able to talk
about the probabilities

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:14.080
of these random variables lying
in certain ranges, or

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.850
things like this, or having
PMFs, or anything that you

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:19.750
like to do, you need this
constraint on it.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:24.470
It's an event for all A in
the set of real numbers.

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:29.790
Also, if this set
of things here

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:31.100
are each random variables.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.900
In other words, if each of them
are functions from the

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:42.600
sample space to the real line,
then the set of omega such

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.620
that x1 of omega is less than
or equal to A1, up to An of

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:50.940
omega is less than or equal
to A n is an event also.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:54.860
You might recognize this as the
distribution function, the

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.190
joint distribution function
for n random variables.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:01.920
You might recognize this as
the distribution function

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.830
evaluated at A for a single
random variable.

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:12.770
So you define a random
variable.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.750
And what we're doing here is--

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.880
it's kind of funny because we
already have these axioms.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.770
But now when we want to define
things in the context of these

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.905
axioms, we need extra things
in the definitions.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.840
This is a distribution function,
a distribution

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.990
function of the random variable
x is the probability

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.860
that the random variable x is
less than or equal to x, which

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:45.850
means that x is a mapping from
omega into real numbers.

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.670
It says that with this mapping
here, you're mapping this

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.730
whole sample space into
the real line.

01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:55.690
Some omegas get mapped into
things less than or equal to a

01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:56.930
real number x.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.510
Some of them get mapped into
things greater than

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:01.590
the real number x.

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:04.820
And the set that gets mapped
into something less than or

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.400
equal to x, according to the
definition of a random

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.230
variable, has to be an event.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.000
Therefore, it has to
have a probability.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.390
And these probabilities
increase as we go.

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:24.440
It is totally immaterial for all
purposes whether we have a

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.690
less than or equal to here
or a less than here.

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:32.450
And everyone follows the
convention of using a less

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:36.420
than or equal to here rather
than a less than here.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:41.360
The importance of that is
that when you look at a

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.240
distribution function,
the distribution

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.820
function often has jumps.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:53.100
And the distribution will have
a jump whenever there's a

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.130
nonzero probability that the
random variable takes on a

01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:00.270
particular value x here.

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:04.160
It takes on this particular
value with something more than

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.520
probabilities here.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.330
If you have a probability
density for a random variable,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.680
this curve just moves
up continuously.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.400
And the derivative
of this curve is

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.310
the probability density.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.970
If you have a probability mass
function, this is a staircase

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.220
type of function.

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:27.279
Because of the fact that we
define the distribution

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:31.410
function with a less than or
equal to rather than a less

01:08:31.410 --> 01:08:37.819
than means that in every one of
these jumps, the value here

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:40.439
is the upper value
of the jump.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:45.180
Value here is the upper value
of the jump, and so forth.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.500
Now, I'm going to--

01:08:54.616 --> 01:08:57.649
I've already said
half of this.

01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:02.120
Affects maps only until finite
or countable set of values.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.370
It's discrete.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:08.139
And it has a probability
mass function--

01:09:08.139 --> 01:09:09.880
this notation.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.640
If the derivative exists, then
you say that the random

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:18.370
variable is continuous
and it has a density.

01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:22.319
And most problems that you do in
probability theory, you're

01:09:22.319 --> 01:09:23.689
dealing with random variables.

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:25.979
And they either have a
probability mass function if

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:28.970
they're discrete or they have
a density if they're

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:30.140
continuous.

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.689
And this is just saying some
things are one way, some

01:09:33.689 --> 01:09:36.069
things are the other way.

01:09:36.069 --> 01:09:37.529
And some things are neither.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:40.180
And we'll see lots of things
that are neither.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.330
And you need the distribution
function to talk about things

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:44.529
that are neither.

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:46.770
We will find that the
distribution function, which

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.120
you've hardly ever used in the
past, is extraordinarily

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:55.440
important, both for theoretical
purposes and for

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.230
other purposes.

01:09:56.230 --> 01:10:02.080
You really need that as a way
of solving problems, as well

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.040
as keeping yourself
out of trouble.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:10.530
For every random variable, the
distribution function exists.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:11.580
Why?

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.990
Anybody know why this
has to exist for

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:15.240
every random variable?

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.215
Yeah.

01:10:22.215 --> 01:10:23.670
AUDIENCE: Because
the [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:31.740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.470
Because we insisted
that it did.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:40.520
Namely, we insisted that this
event actually was an event

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.990
for all little x.

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:46.410
That's part of the definition.

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:51.560
So, in fact, when you do these
things a little more carefully

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.810
than you might be used to, the
definition implies that the

01:10:56.810 --> 01:11:01.790
distribution function
always exists.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:06.110
As a more real-world kind of
argument, we now have a way of

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:09.680
dealing with things that are
discrete, and continuous, and

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.530
mixed continuous and discrete,
and anything else that you

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:19.095
might think of because the
definition restricts it.

01:11:19.095 --> 01:11:23.310
Now, one other thing.

01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:25.185
How do I know that
this starts at 0?

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:32.680
That's a more complicated
thing.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.820
And I'm not even going
to do it in detail.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:43.370
But since every omega maps
into a finite number, you

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:47.300
can't have a jump down here
at minus infinity.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.280
And you can't have a jump
here at plus infinity.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:54.400
Because omegas don't
map into plus

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.910
infinity or minus infinity.

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:58.760
So you have to start
down here at 0.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.510
You have to climb
up here to 1.

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:01.870
You might never reach 1.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:05.610
You might reach it only as a
limit, but you have to reach

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:07.940
it as a limit.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.002
Yes?

01:12:09.002 --> 01:12:11.312
AUDIENCE: In the first
paragraph, [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.790
PROFESSOR: If we have a sequence
of [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:25.230
AUDIENCE: It's [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:27.180
PROFESSOR: You are
probably right.

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.820
Yes.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.030
Well, I don't know I don't
think about that one.

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:38.320
I don't think you're right,
but we can argue about it.

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.130
But anyway, this has
to start at 0.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.380
It has to go up to 1.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:50.400
OK, we did this.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.150
Now, I'm going to go through a
theoretical nitpick for the

01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:56.960
last five minutes
of the class.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.340
Anyone who doesn't like
theoretical nitpicks, you're

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:03.380
welcome to either go to sleep
for five minutes, or you're

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.030
welcome to go out and get a cup
of coffee, or whatever you

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:07.090
want to do.

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:10.230
I will do this to you
occasionally.

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:15.260
And I realize it's almost
torture for some of you,

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:20.890
because I want to get you used
to thinking about how

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:26.590
relatively obvious things
actually get proven.

01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:29.650
I want to increase your ability
to prove things.

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:34.010
The general statement about
proving things, or at least

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:38.000
the way I prove things, is not
the way most mathematicians

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.750
prove things.

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:41.440
Most mathematicians prove things
by starting out with

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.190
axioms and going step by step
until they get to what they're

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:48.340
trying to prove.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:53.020
Now, every time I talk to a good
mathematician, I find out

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.660
that's what they write down when
they prove something, but

01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.140
that's not the way they
think about it at all.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:04.540
All of us-- engineers,
businesspeople, everyone--

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.470
thinks about problems
in a different way.

01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:11.080
If we're trying to prove
something, we first give a

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.770
really half-assed proof of it.

01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:16.580
And after we do that, we look
at it and we say, well, I

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.570
don't see why this is true and
I don't see why that's true.

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.390
And then you go back and you
patch these things up.

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:24.020
And then after you patch
things up, it

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.290
starts to look ugly.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.830
So you go back and do
it a nicer way.

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:30.190
And you go back and forth and
back and forth and back and

01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:37.070
forth, using both contradiction
and implication.

01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:39.270
You use both of them.

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:42.750
Now, when you're proving things
in this class, I don't

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:46.620
care whether you make it look
like you're a formal

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.040
mathematician or not.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.230
I would just assume you didn't
pretend you were a formal

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:52.560
mathematician.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.870
I would like to see you prove
things in such a way that it

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.890
is at least difficult to poke
a hole in your argument.

01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:03.620
In other words, I would like you
to give an argument which

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:06.590
you've thought about enough
that there aren't obvious

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:08.380
counter examples to it.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.940
And if you learn to do that,
you're well on your way to

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:16.080
learning to use this theory in
a way where you can actually

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.020
come up with correct answer.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:23.090
And in fact, I'm not going to go
through this proof at all.

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.830
And I don't think I
really wanted to.

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:26.440
I just did it because--

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.960
well, I think it's something
you ought to read.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:34.410
It is important to learn to
prove things because when you

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:38.800
get to complicated systems,
you cannot see your way

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.000
through them intuitively.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.010
And if you can't see your way
through it intuitively, you

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:47.170
need to understand something
about how to prove things, and

01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:50.320
you need to put all the
techniques of proving things

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:53.920
that you learned together with
all the techniques that you've

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.390
learned for doing things
intuitively.

01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:59.410
And you need to know how
to put them together.

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:02.170
If you're stuck dealing only
with things that are

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:05.100
intuitive, or things that you
learned in high school like

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:11.660
calculus, then you really can't
deal with complicated

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.960
systems very well.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:16.270
OK, I'm going to end
at that point.

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:19.040
You can read this theoretical
nitpick if you want,

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.100
and play with it.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.350
And we'll go on next time.
