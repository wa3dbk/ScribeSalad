00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.150
SHAN-YUAN HO: OK.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.860
So today's lecture
is going to be on

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.570
Finite-state Markov Chains.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.500
And we're going to use
the matrix approach.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.180
So in last lecture, we saw
that the Markov chain, we

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.760
could represent it as a directed
graph or as a matrix.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.860
So the outline is we will look
at this transition matrix and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.220
its powers.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.640
And then we'll want to know
whether this p of n is going

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.490
to converge for very,
very large n.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.790
Then we will extend this to
Ergodic Markov chains, Ergodic

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.460
unichains, and other
finite-state Markov chains.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.170
So remember in the Markovity,
these Markov chains, the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.250
effect of the past on the future
is totally summarized

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.269
by its state.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.590
So we want to analyze the
probabilities of properties of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.150
the sequence of these states.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.430
So whatever the state you are
in, all the past is totally

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.330
summarized in that state.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.970
And that's the only thing
that affects the future.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.310
So an ergodic Markov chain is
a Markov chain that has a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.150
single recurrent class
and is aperiodic.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.150
So this chain doesn't contain
any transient states.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.000
And it doesn't contain
any periodicity.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.455
So an ergodic unichain is just
ergodic Markov chain, but it

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:34.176
has some transient
states in it.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.370
So the state x sub n of this
Markov chain at step n depends

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.450
only on the past through
the previous step.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.500
So for n steps, we want
to be at state j.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.810
And then we have this path.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.510
x sub n minus 1 is i, and
so forth, up to x0.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.040
It's just the probability
from i to j, from

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.620
state i to state j.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.800
So this means that we can write
the joint probability of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.310
all these states that we're in,
so x0, x1, all the way up

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
to xn, as a function of these
transition probabilities.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.060
So in this transition
probability matrix, we can

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.950
represent these transition
probabilities.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.220
We see that here, in this
example, this is a 6-state

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.210
Markov chain.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.380
So if I want to go from, say,
state 2 to state 1 in one

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.780
step, it would just
be p of 2,1.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.990
If I want to go from
state 6 to itself--

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.380
this is last one, which
is p of 6,6.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.700
So this is a probably
transition matrix.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.960
So if we condition on the state
at time 0 and then we

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.850
define this p of ijn is equal to
the probability that we're

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.410
in state j at the n-th step,
given that we start x0 is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.920
equal to i, let's look at what
happens when n is equal to 2.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.580
So in a 2-step transition,
we go from i to j.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.100
It's just the probability that
at step 2, x2 is equal to j,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.870
x1 is equal to some k,
and x0 is equal to i.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.420
So remember, we started
in state i.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.210
But this has to be multiplied
by probability that x1 is

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.490
equal to k, given that
x0 is equal to i.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.500
And we have to sum this over all
the states k, in order to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.754
get the total probability
from--

00:03:21.754 --> 00:03:22.670
Oh, stand back?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.590
OK.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.160
There.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.860
OK.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.770
So this is just probability
of ij in two steps.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.850
It's just the probability of
i going to k times the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.700
probability of k going to j,
summed over all k states.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.270
So we notice that this term
right here, the sum over k or

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.690
ik, kj is just the ij term of
the product of the transition

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.480
matrix P with itself.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.425
So we represent this
as P squared.

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:51.760
So we multiply the transition
matrix by itself.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.300
This gives us the 2-step
transition matrix of this

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.320
Markov chain.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.400
So if you want to go i to j, you
just look at ij element in

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.400
this matrix.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.240
And that gives you the
probability in two steps,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.490
going from state i to state j.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.060
So for n, we just iterate
on this for

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.220
successively larger n.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.520
So for n state to get from state
i to state j, we just

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.680
have this probability x sub n,
given j, given x of n minus

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.950
the previous step is equal to
k, x sub n minus 1 equals k,

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.940
given x0 is equal to i,
summing over all k.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.700
So this means that we broke
this up for n-th step.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.200
In the n minus one step,
we visited state k.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.730
And then we multiplied that
one-step transition from k to

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.560
j because we want to arrive
at j starting at i.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.570
But again, we have to sum over
all the k's in order to get

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.610
the probability from
i to j in n steps.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.960
So p of n right here, this
representation is just the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.770
transition matrix multiplied
by itself n times.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.430
And this gives you the n-th step
transition probabilities

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.890
of this Markov chain.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.860
So computationally, what you do
is you take p, p squared, p

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.680
to the fourth.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.600
If you wanted p to the 9th,
you'd just take p eighth

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.570
multiplied by p, to to
multiply by this.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.140
So this gives us this thing
called the Chapman-Kolmogorov

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.580
equations, which means that when
we want to go from step i

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.800
to step j, we can go to an
intermediate state and then

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.520
sum up all the states that
would go into the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.890
intermediate state.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.980
So in this case, if the step is
m plus n transition, we can

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.330
break it up into m and n.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.670
So it's the probability that it
goes from i to k in exactly

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.660
m steps and k to j in n steps,
summing over all the k's that

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.230
it visits on its way
from i to j.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.110
So this is very useful a
quantity that we can

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.280
manipulate our transition
probabilities when we get

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.180
higher orders of n.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.840
So the convergence
of p to the n.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.250
So a very important question we
like to ask is as n goes to

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.960
infinity whether this goes
to a limit or not.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.810
In other words, does the initial
state matter, all

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.380
initial sates matter in
this Markov chain?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.750
So the Markov chain is going
to go on for a long, long,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.280
long, long, long time.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.350
And at the n-th state where n is
very large, is it going to

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.980
depend on i?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.840
Or is it going to depend on n,
which is the number of steps?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.820
If it goes to this quantity,
some limit, then it won't

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.040
depend on this.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.610
So let's assume that
this limit exists.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.140
If this limit does exist, we can
take the sum of this limit

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.860
and then multiply it by p of
jk, summing over all j.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.790
So we do a sum of over j.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.490
So we're going from j to
k on both sides, and we

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.790
sum over all j.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.020
So we take this limit
right here.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.180
We notice that this left side
going from i to k to n plus 1

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.500
is just that this limit
at state k exists.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.790
Because we saw assumed up here
that this exists for

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.190
all i and all j.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.086
So therefore, if we take the n
plus 1 step, we take this n

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:18.860
going to infinity of i to k,
it has to go to pi of k.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.790
So when we do this,
we could simplify

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.570
this equation up here.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.810
And if it doesn't exist, we have
this pi sub k for all the

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.370
states in the Markov chain.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.780
So this is just a vector.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.885
So pi sub k is equal to pi sub j
times the probability from k

00:07:34.885 --> 00:07:37.120
to j, summed over all j.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.490
So if you have an m state Markov
chain, you have exactly

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.160
m of these equations.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.280
And this one, we'll call it the
vector pi, which consists

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.460
of each element of this
equation, if the limit is

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.000
going to exist.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.400
But we don't know whether
it does or not, at

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.750
this point in time.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.010
So if it does exist, what's
going to happen?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.770
So that means I'm going to
multiply this probability

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.940
matrix, P times P,P P, P,
P, P, P all the way.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.980
And if the limit exists, then
that means for each row, they

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.490
must be all identical.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.610
Because we said the limit
exists, then going from 1 to

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.855
j, 2 to j, 3 to j, 4 to
j, they should be

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:18.050
all exactly the same.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.600
This is also the equivalent of
saying, when I look at this

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.190
large limit, as n is very,
very large if the limit

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.040
exists, that all the elements
in the column should be

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.170
exactly the same as well,
or all the rows.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.220
So the elements are equal to
each other, or all the rows,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.419
if I look at the row, which is
going to be this pi vector.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.220
They should be the same.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.400
So we define this vector.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.340
If this limit exists, the
probability vector

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.830
is this vector pi.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.930
Because we said it was an
m state Markov chain.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.060
Each pi sub i is non-negative,
and they obviously have

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.620
to sum up to 1.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.380
So this is what we call a
probability vector, called the

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.020
steady-state vector,
for this transition

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.690
matrix P, if it exists.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.290
So what happens is this limit
is easy to study.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:14.030
In the future in the course, we
will study these pi P, this

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:18.130
steady-state vector for
various Markov chains.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.870
And so you see, it is quite
interesting, many things that

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.930
could come about it.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.330
So we notice that this
solution can

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.600
contain more than one.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.460
It may not be unique.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.880
So if it contains more than one,
it's very possible that

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.000
it has more than one solution,
more than one probability

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.880
vector solution.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.450
But just because a solution
exists to that, it doesn't

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.010
mean that this limit exists.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.840
So we have prove that
limit exists, first.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:54.490
So for ergodic Markov chain,
here we have another way to

00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:01.320
express this that this matrix
converges is that the matrix

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.570
of the rows--

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.360
the elements in the column are
all the same for each i.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.530
So we have this theorem.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.950
And today's lecture is going to
be completely this theorem.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.450
This theorem says that if you
have an ergodic finite-state

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.890
Markov chain-- so when we say
"ergodic," remember it means

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.540
that there's only one class,
every single state in this is

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.290
recurrent, you have no transient
states, and you have

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.030
no periodicity.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.330
So it's an aperiodic chain.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.590
And then for each j, if you take
the maximum path from i

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.880
to j in n steps, this is
non-increasing in n.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.800
So in other words, this right
here, this is non-increasing.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.976
So if I take the maximum path
from state i to j, it gives

00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:46.600
you exactly n steps.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.920
So that means this is
maximized over all

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.180
initial states i.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.390
So it doesn't matter what state
you start, and I take

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.370
the maximum path.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.180
And if I increase n, and I take
maximum of that again,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.310
the maximum path, this
is not increasing.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.330
And the minimum is
non-decreasing in n.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:10.480
So as we take n, the path from
i to j, this n getting larger

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:16.370
and larger, we have that the
maximum of this path, which is

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.960
the most probable path,
is non-increasing.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.610
And then the minimum of this
path, the least likely path,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.340
is going to be non-decreasing.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:29.600
So we're wondering whether
this limit is going to

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.460
converge or not.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.460
In this theorem it said that
for an ergodic finite-state

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.000
Markov chain, this limit
actually does converge.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.850
So in other words, the lim sup
is equal to lim if of this and

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.250
will equal pi sub j, which is
the steady-state distribution.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.670
And not only that, this
convergence is going to be

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.440
exponential in n.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.230
So this is the theorem that
we will prove today.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.180
So the key to this theorem is
this pair statements, that the

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.010
most probable path from i
to j, given n steps--

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.460
so this is the most
probable path--

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.550
is non-increasing at n,
and the minimum is

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.500
non-decreasing in n.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:12.320
So the proof is almost trivial,
but let's see what

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.220
happens in this.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.410
So we have a probably
transition matrix.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.160
So this is the statement
right here.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.050
And the transition is just one
here and one here, with

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.960
probability 1, 1.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.580
In this case, we want to say,
what is the maximum path that

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.490
we're in state 2,
given n steps?

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.510
So we know that this probability
alternates between

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.150
1 and 2, it's non-increasing,
it's not decreasing, it's

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.740
always the same.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.890
So those two bounds are
met with equality.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.660
So in this here.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.240
So the second example is this.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.690
We have a two-state
chain again.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:58.520
But this time, from 1 to 2, we
have the transition of 3/4.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.326
So that means that we have
a chain here of 1/4.

00:13:01.326 --> 00:13:03.090
See, the minute we put a
self-loop in here, it

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.590
completely destroys
the periodicity.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.760
Any Markov chain, you put a
self-loop in it, and the

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.910
periodicity is destroyed.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:12.050
So here we have 3/4.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.180
So this has to come
back with 1/4.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.220
All right.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:22.590
So in this one, let's look at
the n step going from 1 to 2.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:27.060
So basically, we want
to end up in state 2

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.850
in exactly n steps.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.810
So when n is equal to 1,
what is the maximum?

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.950
The maximum is if you start it
in this state and then you

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:37.890
went to state 2.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.600
The other alternative is you
start at state 2, and you stay

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.040
in state 2.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.250
Because we want to end at state
2 in exactly one step.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.300
So the maximum is going to
be 3/4, and the minimum

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.190
is going to be 1/4.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:50.170
You get n is equal to 2.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.430
Now we want to end up in
state 2 in two steps.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.360
So what is going to
be the maximum?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.960
The maximum is going
to be if you visit

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.580
state 1 and then back.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.840
So n is equal to 1.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.850
Then P1 from 1 to 2
is equal to 3/4.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:15.830
So the probability from 1 to 2
in two steps is equal to 3/8.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.270
So it goes 1/4 plus
3/4, 3/4 plus 1/4.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.280
It should be equal
to 3/8, right?

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.510
Is that right?

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.220
OK.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.570
And then it when P1,2 to 3, if
there are three transitions

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.770
from 1 to 2, then it's
equal to 9/16.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.900
So if for 2, if I want
to transition

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.350
from 2 to 2 n steps--

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.030
so P2,2 is equal to 1/4.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.090
So it just stayed by itself.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:54.600
So P2,2 in two steps, you
don't have a choice.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.850
You have to go from
3/4 to 3/4.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.580
So that's 9/16.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.970
But For thing is I can also stay
here by 1/4 times 1/4.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:14.740
So that gives me 5/8
and so forth.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.305
So basically, the sequence going
from 1 to 2 is going to

00:15:18.305 --> 00:15:24.030
be oscillating between 3/4,
3/8, 9/16, and so forth.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.530
And then going from 2,2, it's
going to be oscillating too.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.440
We can see that's
1/4, 5/8, 7/16.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.980
So what happens is this
oscillation is going to

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.860
converge-- it's going to
approach, actually, 1/2.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:44.540
So if we take the maximum of
these two, so P1,2 and P2,2--

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.410
because that means that we're
going to end at state 2.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.060
And maximum over n steps, then
we just look at these two

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.670
numbers, the 3/4 and 1/4, if we
want the maximum, then it's

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.350
going to be 3/4.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.410
For the 3/8 and 5/8, the maximum
is going to be 5/8,

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.690
the 9/16 and 7/16, the 9/16
will be the maximum.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.975
And similarly, we compare it,
and we take the minimum.

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:07.730
And the minimum is 1/4,
3/8, and 7/16.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.620
So we see that the maximum
is going to be--

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.150
it starts high.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.490
And then it's going to
decrease toward 1/2.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.970
And the minimum, what happens
is it's going to start low,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.060
and then it's going to
increase to 1/2.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.600
So this is exactly
this one here.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.800
So P's transition makes this
an arbitrary finite-state

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.980
Markov chain.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.130
Therefore, each j, this maximum
path, the most problem

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.630
path from i to j in n steps
is non-increasing n.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.860
And the minimum is
non-decreasing n.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.480
So you take n plus 1
steps from i to j.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.570
So we're going to use that
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.790
So we take the first step
to some state k.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.260
And then we go from
k to j in n steps.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.180
But then we sum this
over all k.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:59.620
But this P n for state to j to
k in n steps, I can just take

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.620
the maximum path.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.950
So I take the most probable
path, the state that gives me

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.680
the most probable path, and
I substitute this in.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.359
When I substitute this in,
obviously every one of these

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.670
guys is going to be less
than or equal to this.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.859
Therefore, this outside
term is going to be

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:17.900
less than or equal.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.190
So now this is just going
to be a constant.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.589
So I sum over all k, and
then this term remains.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:29.740
So therefore, what we know is
if I want to end up in state

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:37.430
j, and for n steps, if I
increase the step more, to n

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.930
plus 1, we know that this
probability is going to stay

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.010
the same or decrease.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.330
It's not going to increase.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.520
So you could do exactly the same
thing for the minimum.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.480
So if this is going to be true,
then of course, if I

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.000
think the maximum of this,
it's also going to

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.830
be less than that.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.270
Because this limit's true
for Markov chain.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.620
It doesn't matter.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.830
It just has to be a finite-state
Markov chain.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.250
So this is true for any
finite-state Markov chain.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.850
So if I take the maximum of
this, it's less than or equal

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.560
to the maximum of
the n-th step.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.440
So n plus 1 steps, the path is
going to be less probable when

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.510
I take the maximum path, the
fact that I end up at

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.760
state j than n.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:29.050
So before we complete the proof
of this theorem, let's

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.450
look at this case where P
is greater than zero.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.440
So if we say Pis greater than
zero, this means that every

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.020
entry in this matrix is greater
than 0 for all i, j,

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.310
which means that this graph
is fully connected.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.130
So that means you could get from
i to j in one step with

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.610
nonzero probability.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.250
So if P is greater than 0--

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.600
and let this be the
transition matrix.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.330
So we'll prove this first, and
then we'll extend it to the

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.170
arbitrary finite Markov chain.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.560
So let alpha here is equal
to the minimum.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.420
So it's going to be the minimum
element in this

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.560
transition matrix.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.590
That means it's going to be the
state that contains the

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.580
minimum transition.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.935
So let's call alpha-- it's
the minimum probability.

00:19:15.935 --> 00:19:19.080
Excuse me.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.660
So let all these
states i and j.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.040
And for n greater than or equal
to 1, we have these

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.740
three expressions.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:34.060
So this first expression says
this, that if I have an n plus

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.590
1 walk from i to j, I take
the most probable of

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.960
this walk over i.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.860
So my choices, I can choose
my initial starting state.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.960
In n plus 1 steps, I want
to end in state j.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.690
So I pick the most
probable path.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.680
If I minus this, which is the
least probable path--

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.690
but you get to minimize this
over i, over the initial

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.890
starting a state.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.800
So this is less than or
equal to the n step.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.670
It's exactly this term
here, the n step

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.130
times 1 minus 2 alpha.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.390
So alpha is the minimum
transition probability in this

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.780
probability transition matrix.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.940
So this one, it's not so
obvious right now.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.370
But we are going to prove
that in the next slide.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:26.830
So once we have this, we can
iterative on n to get the

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.670
second term.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:35.170
So for this term inside here,
the most probable path to

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.550
state j in n steps, minus the
least probable path to state j

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.670
in n steps, is equal to exactly
the same thing in n

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.090
minus 1 steps times
1 minus 2 alpha.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:49.300
So we just keep on iterating
this over. n, and then we

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.170
should get this.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.640
So to prove this to this, we
prove it by induction.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.690
We just have to prove the
initial step, that the maximum

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.810
single transition from l to j,
minus the minimum single

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.650
transition from l to j,
is less than or equal

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.700
to 1 minus 2 alpha.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.510
So this one is proved
by induction.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.440
So as n goes to infinity, notice
that this term is going

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.290
to go to 0.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.030
because alpha is going to
be less than a 1/2.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.560
Because if it's not, then we can
choose 1 minus alpha to be

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.870
this minimum.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.340
So if this is going to 0, this
tells us the difference

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.260
between the most probable path
minus the least probable path,

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.390
the fact that we end
up in state j.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:37.140
So if we take the limit as n
goes to infinity of both of

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.240
these, they should equal.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.420
Because the difference of this,
we notice that it's

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.290
going down exponentially in n.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:49.500
So this shows us that this
limit indeed does

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.450
exist and is equal.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.760
We want to prove this first
statement over here.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.870
So in order to prove this first
statement, what we're

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:03.290
going to do is we're going to
take this i, j transition in n

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.990
plus 1 transitions.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.090
And then we're going to express
it as a function of n

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.500
transitions.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.150
So the idea is this.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.900
We're going to use the
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.540
to have an intermediary step.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:24.310
So in order to do this i to j
in n plus 1 steps, the most

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:29.530
probable path, we're going to
go to this intermediate step

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.220
and then on to the final step.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.270
In this intermediate step,
it's going to be

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:36.970
a function of n.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.650
So we're going to take one step
and then n more steps.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:43.310
So what we're going to do is,
the intuition is, we're going

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.890
to remove the least
probable path.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.110
So we remove that from
the sum in this

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.780
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.870
And then we have the sum
of everything else

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.010
except for that path.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.080
And then the sum of everything
else, we're going to bound it.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.760
Once we bound it, then we
have this expression.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.850
The probability of i to j in n
plus 1 steps is going be a

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.050
function of a max and
a min over n steps

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.840
with a bunch of terms.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.720
So that's the intuition of
how we're going to do it.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.750
So the probability of ij going
from state i to state j in

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.290
exactly n plus 1 steps
is equal to this.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.100
So it's the probability of
going from i to k, this

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.550
intermediate step.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.840
We're going to take one
step to a state k.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.860
And then we're going from
k to j in n steps,

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.000
summing over all k.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.260
So this is exactly equal to this
with Chapman-Kolmogorov.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.685
So now what happens is
we're going to take--

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.660
Before we get to this next step,
let's define this l min

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.690
to be the state that minimizes
p of ij, n over i.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.430
So l min is going to be the
state that's going to be such

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:57.060
that the choices I pick over i
that in n steps I arrive at j

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.670
that's going to be the
least probable.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.160
So this is l min over here.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.860
It's the l min that
satisfies this.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.840
Then I'm going to remove this.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.670
So this is one state. l min is
just one state that i is going

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.690
to go to in this first step.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.440
So we're going to remove
it from the sum.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.660
So then, this is just here.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:28.120
So that path goes from i to l
min times l to j in n steps.

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.160
So remove that one
path from here.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.610
Now we have the sum over the
rest of the cases because we

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:34.620
just removed that.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.890
So we have ik, kj to
n, where k is not

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:39.700
equal to that element.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.450
So we removed that path, the one
that goes to that state.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.890
But p of kj, n, the path that
goes from k to j in n steps,

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:54.650
we can just bound this term
by the maximum over l

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:56.390
from l to j of n.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.640
So then we're going to take the
most probable path in n

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.720
steps such that we end
up in state j in n.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.250
So this term right here is
bounded by this term.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:08.150
Becomes is bounded by this,
that's why we have this less

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.240
than or equal sign.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.670
So we just do two things from
this step, the first step, to

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.600
the second step.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.420
So we took out the path that's
going to minimize that right

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.670
at the j-th node in n steps.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:30.870
And then we bounded the rest
of this sum by this.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.840
So when we sum this all up, this
is just a constant here.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:41.800
And ik here is just all the
states that i is going to

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.330
visit except for this
one state, l min.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.450
Since it's just all of them
except for that, it's just 1

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.730
minus the probability that it
goes from state i to l min.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:57.580
So this sum here is just
equal to this sum here.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.120
So this arrives here.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.860
And this term is still here.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:10.620
So going from here, what
happens is we just to

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.420
rearrange the terms.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.440
So nothing happens right here.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.690
It's just rearranging.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.330
Now we have this term here.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.620
So we look at this term, P
from i going to l min--

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.970
Remember, we chose alpha to be
the minimum single transition

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.760
probability, single
transition in that

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.020
probability transition matrix.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.310
So i to l has to be
greater than that.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.050
But the minus of this has to be
less than, the negative has

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:39.800
to be less than.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.320
So this we can substitute
here.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.010
So now we have this.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.872
So the maximum over i of this
n plus 1 step actually shows

00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:52.760
you the probability.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.190
Because this I can write
as an n plus 1 step

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.380
path from i to j.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.030
So if this is less than this
entire term, of course I can

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.740
write the maximum path
from i to j.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.320
It also has to be less of
this because this is

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.900
satisfied for all i, j.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.570
So therefore, we arrive at
this expression here.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:21.750
So now we're kind of in good
business because we have the n

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.110
plus one step at transition, the
maximum path from i to j

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.750
in n plus 1 steps as a function
of n, which is what

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.525
we wanted, and a function
of this alpha.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.980
So we repeat that
last statement.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.170
And the last one is here,
the last line.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.140
So now we have the maximum.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.910
So now we want to do is we
want to get the minimum.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.750
So we do exactly the same thing,
with the same proof.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.593
And with the minimum, what we're
going to do is we're

00:27:55.593 --> 00:28:01.180
going to look at the ij
transition in n plus 1 steps.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.180
And then what we're going to do
is we're going to pull out

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.540
the maximum this time.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.830
So we pull out the most probable
path in n steps such

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.250
that it arrives in state j.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.200
Then we play the same game.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.170
Would bound everything--

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.830
above, this time-- by the
minimum of the n step

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.890
transition probabilities
to get to j.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:24.440
So once we do that, we get this
expression, very similar

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.650
to this one up here.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.330
So now we have the maximum path,
which is n plus 1 steps

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:36.440
to j, and the minimum of
n plus 1 steps to j.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:40.770
So we could take the difference
between these two.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.000
So if you subtract these
equations here, so this first

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.010
equation minus the second
equation, we have this on the

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:53.170
right-hand side here and then
these terms over here on the

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.950
left-hand side.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.660
So these terms over here on the
left-hand exactly proves

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.620
the first line of the lemma.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:13.110
So the first line of
the lemma was here.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.860
So now, to prove the second of
the lemma, remember, we're

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.330
going to prove this
by induction.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.900
in order to prove this by
induction, we need to be first

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.320
initial step.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.670
So the initial step is this.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:30.660
So if I take the minimum
transition probability from l

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.230
to j, it has to be greater
than here with the alpha.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.670
Because we said that alpha was
the absolute minimum of all

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.510
the single-step transition
probabilities.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.770
Then the maximum transition
probability has to be greater

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.250
than or equal to
1 minus alpha.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.450
It's just by definition
of what we choose.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.840
So therefore, if I take this
term, the maximize minus the

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.750
minimum is just 1
minus 2 alpha.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.850
So that's your first step in
the induction process.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:58.215
So we iterate on n.

00:29:58.215 --> 00:30:01.630
When we iterate on n,
one arrives at this

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.880
equation down here.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:24.760
So this shows us from here that
if we take the limit as n

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.360
goes to infinity of this
term, this goes down

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.880
exponentially in n.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.590
And both of these limits are
going to converge, and they

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.795
exist, and they're going
to be greater than 0.

00:30:34.795 --> 00:30:37.690
So they'll be greater than 0
because of our initial state

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.250
that we chose this path with
a positive probability.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.735
Yeah, go ahead.

00:30:43.735 --> 00:30:46.847
AUDIENCE: It seems to me that
alpha is the minimum, the

00:30:46.847 --> 00:30:48.934
smallest number in the
transition matrix, right?

00:30:48.934 --> 00:30:51.250
SHAN-YUAN HO: Alpha is the
smallest number, correct.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:51.665
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:51.665 --> 00:30:53.716
How does it fall from
that, like that?

00:30:53.716 --> 00:31:01.460
So my is, the convergence
rate is related to f?

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.890
SHAN-YUAN HO: Yes,
it is, yeah.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.570
In general, it doesn't really
matter because it's still

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.250
going to go down exponentially
in n.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:12.640
But it does depend on
that alpha, yes.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.820
Any other questions?

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.050
Yes.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.515
AUDIENCE: Is the strength that
bound it proportional to the

00:31:25.515 --> 00:31:27.820
size of that matrix, right?

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.470
SHAN-YUAN HO: Excuse me?

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.800
AUDIENCE: The strength
of that bound is

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.074
proportional to the size?

00:31:31.074 --> 00:31:33.490
I mean, for a very large
finite-state Markov chain, the

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.210
strength of the bound is going
to be somewhat weak because

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:37.190
alpha is going to be--

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.300
SHAN-YUAN HO: Alpha has
to be less than 1/2.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.060
AUDIENCE: OK, yes.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.974
But the strength of the bound,
though, it's not a very tight

00:31:43.974 --> 00:31:47.902
bound on max minus min.

00:31:47.902 --> 00:31:50.400
Because in a large--

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:50.660
SHAN-YUAN HO: Yes.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.760
This is just a bound.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.940
And the bound is what
when we took it that

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.380
minimum-probability path,
the l min, remember?

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:02.050
The bound was actually
in here.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.070
So we took the
minimum-probability path in n

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:09.620
steps, this l min that minimizes
this over i.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.910
And then this is where this less
than or equal to here is

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.160
just a substitution.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.500
Any other questions?

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.750
So what we know is that what
happens is that these

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.820
limited-state probabilities
exist.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.095
So we have a finite
ergodic chain.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.950
So if the probability of the
elements in this transition

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.630
matrix are all greater
than 0, we know

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.990
that this limit exists.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.950
But we know that in general,
that may not be the case.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.415
We're going to have some 0's
in our transition matrix.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.240
So let's go back to the
arbitrary finite-state ergodic

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:03.740
chain with probability
transition matrix P. So in the

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.610
last slide, we showed that this
transition matrix P of h

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:13.560
is positive for h is equal to
M minus 1 squared plus 1.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:19.130
So what we do is, we can apply
lemma 2 to P of h with this

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.025
alpha equals to minimum
going from i to j

00:33:22.025 --> 00:33:23.275
in exactly h steps.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.850
So why is this M minus
1 squared plus 1?

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.020
So in the last lecture--

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.490
so what it means is this.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.020
So what is says is here.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.075
This was an example given
in the last lecture.

00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:43.430
It was a 6-state Markov chain.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.020
So what it says is that if n is
greater than or equal to M

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.510
minus 1 squared plus 1-- in this
case, it's going to be 6.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:56.570
So if n is greater than or equal
to 26, then I take P to

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.000
the 26th power, it means
it's greater than zero.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.350
That meas if I take P to the
26th power, every single

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.590
element in this transition
matrix is going to be

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:14.260
non-zero, which means that you
can go from any state to any

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.389
state with nonzero probability,
as long as n is

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.290
bigger than that.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.889
So basically, in this Markov
chain, if you go long enough,

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:22.190
long enough.

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.905
Then I say, OK, I want to go
from state i to state j in

00:34:25.905 --> 00:34:28.469
exactly how many steps, there is
a positive probability that

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:31.600
this is going to happen.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.380
So how did this bound
come across?

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:44.980
Well, for instance, in this
chain, if we look at P1,1 so

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.340
we have here?

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.449
So I'm going to look
at the transition

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:51.940
starting at state 1.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.600
And I want to come back to 1.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.860
So you definitely could come
back at 6, because these are

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.300
all positive probability 1.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.350
So 6 is possible.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.160
So n is equal to
6 is possible.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.680
So what's the next one
that's possible? n is

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.720
equal to 11, right?

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.100
Then the next one is what?

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.690
16 is possible, right?

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.100
So 0 to 5 is impossible, is 0.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.560
So if I pick n between 0 and 5,
and 7 and 10, you're toast.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.750
You can't get back to 1.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.840
And so forth.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.300
So 18 is possible.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.410
21--

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.480
let's see, is 17 possible?

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.740
Yeah, 17 is also possible.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.750
AUDIENCE: Why is 16 possible?

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:41.630
SHAN-YUAN HO: So I go around
here twice, and

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.880
then the last one.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.810
Is that right?

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.160
So if I go from here to here
to here to here, if I go

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.696
twice, and then one more
in the final loop.

00:35:54.696 --> 00:35:55.550
AUDIENCE: That's 12.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.340
SHAN-YUAN HO: Oh, it's 12?

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:57.870
No.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.640
I'm going to go this inner
loop right here.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.234
So if I go from 1 to 2 to 3
to 4 to 5 to 6, down to 2.

00:36:07.234 --> 00:36:10.130
Then I go 3, 4, 5, 6, 1.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.380
That's 11, isn't it?

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.090
So 16 is I'm going to go around
the inner loop twice.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.870
OK.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:20.610
Go ahead.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:20.980
Question?

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.670
AUDIENCE: So everything 20 and
under is possible, right?

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.670
SHAN-YUAN HO: No.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.730
Is 25 possible?

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.092
Tell me how you're going
to go 25 on this.

00:36:28.092 --> 00:36:30.760
You just do the 5
loop 5 times.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.140
SHAN-YUAN HO: Yeah, but I
want to go from 1 to 1.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.240
You're starting in state 1.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:33.825
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh, sorry.

00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:34.150
OK.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.662
SHAN-YUAN HO: 1 to 1, right?

00:36:35.662 --> 00:36:36.594
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:37.844
OK, I see.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.230
SHAN-YUAN HO: So you know for
this one that this bound is

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.160
actually tight.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.880
So 25 is impossible.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.520
So P1,1 of 25 is equal to 0.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.920
There's no way you
can do that.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.850
But for 26 on, then you can.

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:58.090
So what you're noticing is that
you need this loop of 6

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:02.830
here and that any combination
of 5 or 6 is possible.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:08.310
So basically, in this particular
example, if n is

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:18.710
equal to 6k plus 5j, where k
is greater than or equal to

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.020
1-- because I need that final
loop to get back--

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:23.350
or j is greater than
or equal to 0--

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:28.730
So any combination of this one,
then I can express n.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.140
I can go around it to give me
a positive probability of

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.660
going from state 1 to state 1.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:38.910
So I'm going to prove this
using extremal property.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.330
So we're going to take the
absolute worst case.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:46.970
So the absolute worst case is
that for M state finite Markov

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.540
chain is if have a loop
of m and you have a

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.005
loop of m minus 1.

00:37:51.005 --> 00:37:52.460
You can't just have
a loop of m.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.950
The problem is now this
becomes periodic.

00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.680
So we have to get rid
of the periodicity.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.390
If you add a single group here,
that doesn't help you.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.590
Then after 6, then it I get
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.930
That didn't have this.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.880
So the absolute worst case for
an M state chain is going to

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.430
be something that
looks like this.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.550
1 that goes to 2-- you're
forced to go to 2--

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.840
so forth, until state M. And
then this M is going to go

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.830
back to 2 or is going
to go back to 1.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:31.290
So in other words, the worst
case is if you have--

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:39.210
n has to be some combination
of Mk plus M minus 1 j.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:43.430
So this will be the worst
possible case for M state

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.220
Markov chain.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:50.480
So it'll be Mk plus
M minus 1 j.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.570
So k has to be greater
than or equal to 1.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:55.840
And then j has to be greater
than or equal to 0, because

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.950
you need to come back.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.000
So I'm just looking at the case
probability that I start

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.500
in state 1 and I come
back in state 1.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.670
So all right.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:09.770
So how do we get this bound?

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:14.860
Well, there is an identity
that says this.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:29.370
If a and b are relatively prime,
then the largest n such

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:32.750
that it cannot be written-- so
we want to find the largest n

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:42.430
such that ak plus bj--

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:48.860
but this is k and j greater
than or equal to 0--

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.260
that it cannot be written
in this form.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.820
The largest integer that it
cannot be written is ab

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:00.680
minus a minus b.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.960
This takes a little bit to
prove, but it's not too hard.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.480
If you want to know this proof,
come see me offline

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.090
after class.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.170
This is the largest integer.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:13.160
If n is equal to this,
it cannot be

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.310
written in this form.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:17.690
But if n is greater than
this, then it can.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.680
So all we do is substitute M
for a and M minus 1 for b

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.440
because M and M minus 1
are relatively prime.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.460
But remember, we have a k here
that has to be greater than or

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:29.980
equal to 1.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.330
We need at least one k.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.690
But this so identity is for
k and j greater than 0.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.420
So therefore, we have to
subtract out that k.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:46.030
So therefore, we have M times
M minus 1, minus M

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.200
minus M minus 1.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:58.960
But the thing is we have to add
the extra M, because this

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.360
k is greater than
or equal to 1.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.330
So we have to add up one of
the M's because of this.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:13.830
So this is just equal to
M minus 1, squared.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:18.920
So this number, if n is equal
to this, it's the largest

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.490
number that it cannot be
written like that.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.810
So therefore, we
have to add 1.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.080
So that's why the bound
is equal to 1.

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:30.660
So the upper bound that n can
be written is going to be M

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:34.320
minus 1, squared plus 1.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.410
AUDIENCE: Why did you add
the 1 at the end?

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.960
SHAN-YUAN HO: This one?

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.476
AUDIENCE: No, we've got to
do the 1 at the end.

00:41:40.476 --> 00:41:42.380
AUDIENCE: We already
have that in there.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:42.810
SHAN-YUAN HO: Oh, where is it?

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.245
No, it's in here, right?

00:41:44.245 --> 00:41:45.495
AUDIENCE: No, it's not here.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.670
SHAN-YUAN HO: Did I--

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.720
What are you talking about?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.088
Where's the 1?

00:41:57.088 --> 00:41:59.030
AUDIENCE: At the end,
the last equation.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.500
SHAN-YUAN HO: This one?

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.290
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.270
SHAN-YUAN HO: OK.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:12.420
This is the "cannot," largest
n which you cannot write.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.170
You cannot write this.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.220
So this bound is tight.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:22.890
It means that this is the
one that you can.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.990
So if n is greater
than or equal to

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.470
this, then it's possible.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.970
This is the largest
one it cannot.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.790
Based on this, it cannot.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.070
So we have to add the 1.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.970
So therefore, in here,
you could do 26.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.470
So starting from 26, 27,
28, you can do that.

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:42.890
Any questions?

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.590
AUDIENCE: Relatively prime,
what do you mean by

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:45.920
"relatively"?

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.982
SHAN-YUAN HO: There is a
greatest common divisor of 1.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.790
So if we take h here, h is
going to be positive.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.400
So if h is equal to M minus 1,
squared plus 1, then now all

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.530
the elements are positive.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.590
Because we just proved that
we can write this--

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:13.390
every state can be visited by
any other state, with positive

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:15.260
probability.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:21.620
So we say, looking at P, we know
that P of h is positive

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.510
for h greater than or
equal to this bound.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:28.330
So what we do is we applied this
lemma 2 probability to

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:32.980
this transition matrix P of h,
where we have picked alpha--

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.620
remember, alpha is the
single-step transition

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:35.340
probability.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:38.840
So instead of the single
transition, we have lumped

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.700
this P into P to the h power.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.470
So it's h steps.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:50.790
Because we proved the result
before for positive P. So this

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.760
P to the h is positive, so we
take alpha as the minimum from

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.510
i to j of P to the
h in this matrix.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.360
So it doesn't really matter what
the value of alpha is,

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.950
only that it's going
to be positive.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.290
And it has to be positive
because it's a probability.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:12.770
So what happens is, if we follow
the proof of what we

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.260
just showed in the lemma, then
we show that the maximum path

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.190
from l to j--

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.240
h times M. So M is going
to be an integer, so in

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.220
multiples of h--

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.930
this upper limit is going to be
equal to the lower limit.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.730
So the most probable path
is equal to the

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:36.590
least probable path.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.380
So this is multiple of h's.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.730
So if we take this as M goes
to infinity, this has

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.510
got to equal to--

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:53.110
Oops, this should be going
to pi sub j, excuse me.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.230
This little temple here.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.950
And this is going to
be greater than 0.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.040
So the problem is now we've
shown it for multiples of h's,

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.180
what about the h's in between?

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:10.510
But the fact is that lemma 1,
we showed that this maximum

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.170
path from l to j in n is
not increasing in n.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:18.620
So all those states, all those
paths, the transition

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:21.460
probability for the paths in
between these multiples of

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.110
h's, in between them it's
going to be not

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:26.100
increasing in n.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.852
So even if we're taking these
multiples of each of h and n

00:45:30.852 --> 00:45:33.150
here, here, here, and we know
that this limit is increasing,

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.690
we know that all the ones in
between them are also going to

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.350
be increasing to the same limit
because of lemma 1.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.335
To remember, the maximum is
going to be not increasing,

00:45:45.335 --> 00:45:46.460
and the minimum is going to be

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.760
non-decreasing in any one path.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:54.280
So this must have the
same limit as

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.040
this multiple of this.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.390
So the same limit applies.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.220
So any questions on this?

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.390
So this is how we prove it for
the arbitrary finite-state

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.790
ergodic chain when we have some
0 probability transition

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:13.490
elements in the matrix P. So
the proof is the same.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.880
So now for ergodic unichain.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:26.880
So we see that this limit as n
approaches infinity from i to

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.120
j of n is going to just end up
in the steady-state transition

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.380
pi of j for all i.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.040
So it doesn't matter what
your initial state is.

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.170
As n goes to infinity of this
path, as this Markov chain

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.360
goes on and on, you will end up
in state j with probability

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.440
pi sub j, where pi is this
probability vector.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.090
So now we have this steady-state
vector, and then

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.130
we can solve for the
steady-state vector solution.

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:59.600
So this pi P is equal to pi.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:46:59.860
Yeah?

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.330
Go ahead.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.270
AUDIENCE: Where did you prove
that the sum of all the pi j's

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.030
equal to one?

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:06.563
Because you say that we
proved that this is

00:47:06.563 --> 00:47:07.355
the probability vector.

00:47:07.355 --> 00:47:08.780
But did prove only that
it is non-negative?

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.290
SHAN-YUAN HO: It's
non-negative.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:13.090
But the thing is because as n
goes to infinity, you have to

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.200
land up someone, right?

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.960
This is a finite-state
Markov chain.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.030
You have to be somewhere.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.060
And the fact that you have to be
somewhere, your whole state

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.480
space has to add up to 1.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.550
Because it's a constant,
remember?

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:29.290
For every j, as n goes to
infinity, it goes to pi sub j.

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:31.020
So you have that for
every single state.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.530
And then you have to
end up somewhere.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.570
So if you have to end up
somewhere, the space has to

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:35.896
add up to one.

00:47:35.896 --> 00:47:37.980
Yeah, good question.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.990
So why are we interested
in this pi sub j?

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:45.210
The question is that because
in this recurrent class, it

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.910
tells us that as this goes to
infinity, we see this sequence

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.880
of states going back and
forth, back and forth.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.430
And we know that as n goes
to infinity, we have some

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.285
probability, pi sub j, of
landing in state j, pi sub i

00:47:56.285 --> 00:47:57.810
of landing in state
i, and so forth.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:01.980
So it says that in the n step,
as n goes to infinity, that

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:04.290
this is the fraction of time
that, actually, that state is

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.440
going to be visited.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.590
Because at each step, you have
to make a transition.

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:15.050
So it's kind of the expected
number of times per unit time.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:16.280
So it's divide by n.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.260
It's going to be that fraction
of time that you're going to

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.110
visit that state.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.110
It's the fraction of time
that you're going

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.660
to be in that state.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.940
It's this limiting state as
n gets very, very large.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.520
So we will see that in the next
few chapters when we do

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.210
renewal theory that this will
come into useful play.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.670
And we give a slightly different
viewpoint of it.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.270
So it's very easy to extend this
result to a more general

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.510
class of ergodic unichains.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.350
So remember the ergodic
unichains, now we have

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:48.020
increased these transient
states.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.120
So before, we proved this.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.270
We just proved it for it
contains exactly one class.

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:59.300
It's aperiodic, so we have no
cycles, no periodicity in this

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.170
Markov chain.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:03.080
And so we know that the
steady-state transition

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.510
probabilities have a limit.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.596
And the upper limit and the
lower limit of these paths as

00:49:06.596 --> 00:49:07.680
they go to infinity--

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.770
in fact, they end up in
a particular state--

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:10.430
has a limit.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:14.570
And we have this steady-state
probability vector that

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:15.610
describes this.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.940
So now we have these
transient states.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.290
So these transient states of
this Markov chain, what

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:25.480
happens is there exists a path
that this transient state is

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.370
going to go to a recurrent
state.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.930
So once it leaves this transient
state, it goes to

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:30.550
recurrent state.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:31.810
It's never going to come back.

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:40.500
So there is some probability,
alpha, of leaving the

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.700
class at each step.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.750
So there's some transition
probability in this transient

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:45.630
state that's going
to be alpha.

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.730
And the probability of remaining
in this transient

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.970
state is just 1 minus
alpha to the n.

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.840
And this goes down
exponentially.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.340
So what this says is that
eventually, as n gets very

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.290
large, it's very, very hard to
stay in that transient state.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.340
So it's going to go out of
the transient state.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:04.900
And then it will go into
the recurrent class.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:09.410
So when one does the analysis
for this, what happens in the

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.960
probability in this steady-state
vector is those

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.580
transient states, this pi,
will be equal to 0.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.610
So this distribution is only
going to be non-zero for

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:23.640
recurrent states in this
Markov chains.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.510
And the transient states will
have probability equal to 0.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:31.080
In the notes, they just
extend the argument.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.340
But you need a little bit
more care to show this.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.210
And it divides the transient
states into a block and then

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.660
the recurrent classes into
another block and then shows

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:45.630
that these transient states'
limiting probability is going

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:46.880
to go to 0.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.080
So let's see.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.490
So this says just what I said,
that these transient states

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.180
decay exponentially, and one
of the paths will be taken,

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.880
eventually, out of it.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.440
So for ergodic unichains, the
ergodic class is eventually

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:09.180
entered, and then steady state
in that class is reached.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.370
So every state j, we
have exactly this.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.270
The maximum path from
i to j in n steps--

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.100
and the minimum path.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.820
We look at the minimum path in
n steps and the maximum path

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.700
in n steps.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.820
And for each n, we take the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.220
These guys, these limits are
exactly equal, and it equals

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.680
to this pi sub j, which is
equal to the j state.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:39.150
So your initial states, how you
went the paths that you

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.560
have gone is completely
wiped out.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:44.470
And all that matters is
this final state,

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:45.820
as n gets very large.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.200
So the difference here is that
pi sub j equals 0 for each

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.380
transient state, and it's
greater than 0 for the

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.630
recurrent state.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.580
So other finite Markov chains.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.280
So we can consider a
Markov chain with

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.330
several ergodic classes.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.340
Because we just considered it
with one ergodic class.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:05.790
So if the classes don't
communicate, then you just

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:06.740
consider it separately.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:08.920
So you figure out the
steady-state transition

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.170
probabilities for each of
the classes separately.

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:17.080
But if you have to insist on
analyzing the entire chain P,

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.760
then this P will have m
independent steady-state

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:29.180
vectors and one non-zero
in each class.

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.690
So this P sub n is still going
to converge, but the rows are

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:33.590
not going to be the same.

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:35.210
So basically, you're going
to have blocks.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:38.510
So if you have one class, say 1
through k is going to be in

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.680
one class, and then k through
l is going to be another

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.070
class, and then l through z is
going to another class, you

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:45.960
have a block.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:49.170
So this steady-state vector
is going to be in blocks.

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:56.480
So you can see the recurring
classes only communicate

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.520
within themselves.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.350
Because these don't

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.570
communicate, so they're separate.

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:11.450
So you could have a lot of 0's
in limiting state, if you look

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:15.690
at this, P sub n goes
to infinity.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.010
So there m set of rows,
one for each class.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:20.220
And a row for each class k
will be non-zero for the

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.280
elements of that class.

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.350
So then finally, if we
have periodicity.

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:32.540
So now if we have a periodic
recurrent chain with period d.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.440
We had the two where it's
just a period of 2.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:39.130
So with periodicity, what you
do is you're going to divide

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.770
these classes into d
different states.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:44.880
So you have to go
to one state--

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:50.070
So if there's d states, this is
a period of d, you separate

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.410
or you partition the states into
d of them, d subclasses,

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:56.190
with a cycle rotation
between them.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.380
So basically, each time unit,
you have to go from one class

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.910
to the next class.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:05.080
And then we do that, then for
each class, you could have the

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.210
limiting-state probability.

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:11.290
So in other words, you are
looking at this transition

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.460
matrix, pi d.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.820
Because when it cycles, it
totally depends on which one

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:17.960
you start out at.

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.560
But if you look at the d
intervals, then that becomes

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:24.640
the ergodic class by itself.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.130
And there are exactly
d of them.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:31.020
So the limit as n approaches
infinity of P of nd, this

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:36.220
thing also exists, but exists in
the subclass sense of there

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:40.070
is d subclasses if it
has a period of d.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.570
So that means a steady state
is reached within each

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.640
subclass, but the chain
rotates from

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.240
one subclass to another.

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:47.950
Yeah, go ahead.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.410
AUDIENCE: In this case, if we
do a simple check with 1 and

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.700
2, with 1 and 1, it
doesn't converge.

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.570
SHAN-YUAN HO: No, it does.

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.380
It is 1, converges to 1.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.740
So it's 1, and then it's
going to be 1.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.970
AUDIENCE: It's 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:01.500
So you go here?

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:02.904
Like, it's reached--?

00:55:02.904 --> 00:55:03.372
SHAN-YUAN HO: No, no.

00:55:03.372 --> 00:55:04.790
It converges for here.

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:08.510
But this d is equal to
2, in that case.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:10.534
So you have to do nd,
so you've got

00:55:10.534 --> 00:55:12.200
to look at P squared.

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.536
So if I look at P squared,
I'm always a 1--

00:55:14.536 --> 00:55:16.196
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:55:16.196 --> 00:55:17.380
That's converging.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.300
The other one is 2,
2, 2, 2, 2, 2.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:20.550
That's also converging.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:24.150
OK.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.040
So is there any other questions
about this?

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:30.050
OK, that's it.

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:31.300
Thank you.
