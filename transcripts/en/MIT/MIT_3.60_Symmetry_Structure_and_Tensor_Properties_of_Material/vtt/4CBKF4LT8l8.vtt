00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:09.260
PROFESSOR: OK, ready for more?

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.070
I defined a problem for you.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.110
Now let's address it.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.980
Said that if we have one
coordinate system, and if we

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.560
have some vector, q, that's
defined as a second-rank

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.390
tensor, aij times some other
vector p sub j--

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.360
and let me digress in passing.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.760
I am very careful to say "a
second-rank tensor" and not a

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.820
"second-order tensor," because
higher-order order terms means

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.260
negligible and non-important.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.140
And when I say "second-order
tensor," I don't mean to say

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.000
it's not important
and negligible.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.430
It's very important, so I say
"rank," which has some sort of

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.390
dignity to it.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.160
So I don't like the term
"order," because it has

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.500
another meaning.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.500
OK, so here is a tensor that
relates a vector pj to give us

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.020
the components of a vector qi.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.860
If we change coordinate system,
the components of p,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.290
representing exactly one in the
same vector, wink on and

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.100
off and take different values.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.470
The values for q take on
different values, and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.490
therefore, of necessity, the
three by three array of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.450
coefficients, which relates
these different numbers, must

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.350
also change its numerical
values.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.150
And I hopefully convinced you
at the end of last hour that

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.870
there's times when you might
actually want to do this when

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.750
you're cutting out a particular
sample from a

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.000
single-crystal specimen.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.990
How do we get the new tensor
in terms of the direction

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.890
cosine scheme that specifies
the change of axes and the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.849
original tensor?

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.520
So I am going to refer to my
notes quite closely here,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.270
because I want it to come out
pretty and not have to

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.350
redefine variables
when I'm done.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.870
So let's start with the original
tensor relation, q

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.040
sub i equals aij
times p sub j.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.780
Now, what we want is something
of the form q sub i prime

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.780
equals aij prime times
p sub j prime.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.050
And we know the relations
forward and reverse in terms

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.680
of the direction cosine scheme
cij So let's begin by writing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.640
qi prime in terms of
qi And we know how

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.090
that is going to transform.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.990
It's going to be elements of
the direction cosine scheme

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.430
cim times q sub m.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.190
So that will give me the i-th
component of q in the new

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.090
coordinate system.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.010
I know how q arises from
the applied vector p.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.110
So let me write qm in terms
of the applied pj.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.320
And this is going to
be aij times--

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.750
be careful of my variables
here--

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.295
this is going to be a
ml times p sub l.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.510
And that is going to, from my
definition of a second-rank

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.890
tensor, give me the m-th
component of q.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.245
So far, so good.

00:04:04.245 --> 00:04:08.170
I've got two different repeated
subscripts here, so

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.590
this is a double summation.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.890
Now, I'll have what I want to
have, namely a q sub i prime

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.829
on the left-hand side and a p
sub j prime on the right-hand

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.540
side if I can express the
original components of p in

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.790
terms of the new components
of p.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.330
And I do that by the reverse
transformation.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.160
So let me now write a ml.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.600
And then in place of p sub
l, I will write cjl

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.370
times p sub j prime.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.780
Notice the inverted order
of the subscripts.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.850
That is the reverse
transformation that's going to

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.100
give me p sub l.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.660
So you really have now
what I'm after.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.870
This is a triple summation
in m, l, and j.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.540
I can write the terms that are
in what is going to be a

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.110
triple summation over
a product of terms.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.810
I could write these terms
in any order.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.280
So to simplify it, let me write
q sub i prime is equal

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:34.590
to cim cjl times a ml,
times p sub j prime.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.530
And now, hotcha, I've got an
expression that has q prime on

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.440
the left and p prime on the
right, and paying close

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.640
attention to my notes so that
the subscripts all came out

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.260
the way I would like them to.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:06:01.030
So what this says is that the
transform tensor aij prime is

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.535
going to be equal to,
by definition--

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.640
or what we've shown here,
it's going to be equal--

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.980
just picking off terms--
it's going to be

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.700
cim cjl times a ml.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.330
Just picking off these terms.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.810
m has no physical meaning,
because m simply is an index

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.020
of summation.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.240
l has no specific meaning.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.170
That is just an index
of summation.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.150
But the i and the j
do have meaning.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.370
They go with the i and j on the
particular tensor element

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.610
that we were attempting
to evaluate.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.580
So in other words, to be
specific, if we want the new

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.116
value of the tensor element a1
2 prime, it's going to be c1

00:06:53.116 --> 00:07:01.560
something, c2 something, and
those somethings m and l would

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.160
vary from 1 to 3.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.410
So if I write this out not in
the reduced subscript notation

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.650
but put a summation sign in
there, so a12 prime is going

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:18.605
to be the sum over m and the
sum over l of terms c1m--

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:20.750
the first index is always 1--

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.910
c2 something--

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.600
first index is always 2--

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.085
and then m and l take on
all possible values.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.290
OK, we've got two results.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.950
We learned how to transform
a vector.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.890
And a vector, if you will, is
simply a tensor of first rank.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.700
And transforming the vector,
we summed over all three

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.940
components of the
original vector.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.080
And the coefficients in
that summation were

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.100
one direction cosine.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.810
Now we're transforming
a second-rank tensor.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:04.010
Again, each new element is a
linear combination of all nine

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.200
of the elements in the original
tensor, and the

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.640
coefficients are a product
of two direction cosines.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.150
So we've got two points.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.020
Let's draw a line through them,
and we can say that, in

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.280
general, any new tensor
element of any rank--

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.990
and you could prove it through
exactly this method by going

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.180
up, now, to the third rank,
fourth rank, and so on, and

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.380
writing substitutions
of this form--

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.919
it turns out that a new tensor
element aijkl however far you

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.970
want to go, is going to be given
by a linear combination

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:48.010
of direction cosine element ciI,
cj capital J, ck capital

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:54.630
K, cl capital L, times however
far you have to go times

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:59.200
aijkl, and so on.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.690
So these are the true indices.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.510
These have physical meaning.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:11.200
These have relevance
to how a particular

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.360
property will behave.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.870
The capital I, capital J,
capital L, and so on, are what

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.980
we referred to last time
as dummy indices.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.295
These are indices
of summation.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.020
But the first index on
the direction cosines

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.940
has specific meaning.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.280
They are tied to the indices on
the subscript of the term

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.530
that you would like
to evaluate.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.370
So we've got now a very profound
relation for a tensor

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.350
of any rank.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.590
And really, it just involves
substitutions using the

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.580
reverse or the forward
transformation until you get

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.200
one element on the one side
related to another element on

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.400
the right-hand side.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.960
And this is a specific element
in the new tensor, in our

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.725
case, of the second-rank
tensor, aml.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.290
This is all very abstract.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.290
It is something that we'll have
to do a couple of times

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.670
for a real problem before you
see how it works out.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:47.010
The number of elements that
figure into these

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.800
transformations is really
astronomical.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.120
Suppose, for example, the tensor
involved were something

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.700
like the elastic stiffness
tensor, which is

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.030
represented by c.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.350
And we need four subscripts.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.140
This is a tensor
or fourth rank.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:17.410
If we wanted to transform a
particular stiffness to a new

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:22.840
coordinate system, we would need
a summation ci capital I,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:35.920
cj capital J, ck capital K, cl
capital L, times all of the

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.510
elements in the original
tensor, aijkl.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:45.810
A fourth-rank tensor consists
of an array of 9 by 9 terms.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.390
So there are 81 of these.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.890
We'd have four direction cosines
out in front, and

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:59.860
there would be a total of 81
times 5 characters that we

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.770
would have to write.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:06.780
So to do the complete tensor
transformation, we would have

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.910
to write on the order of 400
quantities to get just one of

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.070
the 81 elements in the
new transform tensor.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.430
So the total number of elements
we'd have to write to

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.810
do this would be 81
squared times 5.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.260
That's a lot of elements.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.920
We'll do a few of these
transformations directly, but

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.700
let me assure you that if we
do a transformation that is

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.860
going to involve symmetry, a lot
of the direction cosines,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.870
if we're lucky, will be 0.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.580
So it's not quite as onerous
as it seems.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.300
So we would make use of this
sort of formalism if we wanted

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.300
to go from one set of reference
axes to a new set

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.470
that might represent a special
specimen that we

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.690
cut out of a crystal.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.460
But there's another formal way
in which we could make very

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.045
profound and non-intuitive
use of these relations.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.530
Crystals, except for the
abominable triclinic crystals,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.740
have symmetry.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.880
If a crystal has symmetry, you
can transform the solid

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.000
physically by that symmetry
operation.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.750
And you have to measure
the same

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.370
property before and after.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.795
So suppose we have a crystal
that has a twofold axis.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.095
And this crystal is something
that looks like this.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:00.010
So this is side A, and this is
side B. We could move the

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.030
crystal by a 180-degree
rotation.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.800
Put it down.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.960
I won't draw it, because it's
going to look exactly the

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.860
same, except now this thing--

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.730
I won't draw, and
I do draw it--

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.230
this is face A, and this is face
B. If we had electrodes

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.860
on the crystal before and after
that transformation, we

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.390
have to measure, let's say,
the same electrical

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.350
conductivity for both
orientations of the crystal.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.430
Now, moving a crystal relative
to some coordinate system,

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.430
relative to a pair of electrodes
that we're

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.710
fastening onto the crystal, is
exactly the same thing as

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.390
doing the reverse transformation
of the

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.080
coordinate system.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.540
That's a vague, strange-sounding
term.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.410
So suppose we have a crystal
with a fourfold axis with four

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:59.980
faces, A, B, C, D. And here
are our electrodes.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.015
To move the crystal relative
to the electrodes by a

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:09.390
90-degree rotation would involve
rotating face D up to

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.580
this location.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.710
A would move to this location.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.520
C would move to this location.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.950
B would move to this location,
and we'd fasten electrodes on

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.530
the crystal again.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.340
If the crystal originally had a
coordinate system such that

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:32.410
this were X1 and this is X2,
moving the electrodes onto a

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.570
different direction on the
crystal is the same as moving

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.980
the crystal in the
opposite sense.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.010
So we could either envision
moving the crystal relative to

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:48.280
the electrodes like this, or we
could move the electrodes

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.960
relative to the crystal by the
reverse transformation.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.700
And the result is the same.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.590
So what I'm saying is that if
a crystal has symmetry--

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:08.260
and let me be specific and
suppose that our crystal has a

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.435
twofold rotation
axis along X3.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.300
Let's ask how that twofold
access would change the

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.780
coordinate system relative
to the crystal.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.060
That's the same as moving the
crystal relative to the

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.380
coordinate system.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:36.930
It's going to take X1 and move
it to this location X1 prime.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.610
It's going to take
X2 and move it

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.600
through 180-degree rotation.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.810
This is going to be X2 prime.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.620
And if the twofold axis
is along X3, X3 prime

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.480
is the same as X3.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.060
So what is the direction
cosine scheme for

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.070
this change of axes?

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.200
You might immediately start
working and saying, well, C11

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.940
is the cosine of the angle
between X1 prime and X1.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.430
That's 180 degrees.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.230
Cosine of 180 degrees
is minus 1.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.359
But let me remind you that the
direction cosine scheme, c ij,

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:16.660
simply gives us the relation
between the new axes x sub i

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.200
prime and the old
axes, x sub j.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.900
So let me, just by inspection,
write down the relation

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.599
between these two sets of
coordinate systems.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.755
So X1 prime is equal
to minus X1.

00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:33.610
X2 prime is equal to minus X2.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.200
X3 prime is equal to X3.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.350
So the direction cosine scheme
for this particular

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:49.170
transformation is simply minus
1 0 0, 0 minus 1 0, 0 0 1.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.070
So I just evaluated a
nine-element direction cosine

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.540
scheme by inspection, if I can
write the relation between the

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.790
coordinate system before and
after the transformation.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.000
OK?

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.630
And as we examine higher
symmetry, the same is going to

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.330
be true for the threefold axis,
let's say, along the 1,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.880
1, 1 direction of a cubic
crystal, for a sixfold

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.130
axis, and so on.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.810
So we'll be able to write the
direction cosine schemes for a

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.455
symmetry transformation
simply by inspection.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.950
So for a twofold axis along X3,
this is the form of the

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.490
direction cosine scheme.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:52.640
So now let me transform the
elements of a second-rank

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.590
tensor term by term and
see what we get.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.840
Suppose I want--

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.840
let's stick with conductivity
as an example.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.140
Suppose I want the value for
the conductivity element

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.640
sigma1 1 prime.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.140
That's going to be c1 something,
c1 something,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.760
because these are the elements
that go in here, times every

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:26.180
element of a conductivity
tensor sigma lm.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.230
The only element of the form c1
something that is non-zero

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:37.540
in this row c11, c12, c13,
is the term c11.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.830
In the same way in the same row,
the only term of the form

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.990
c1 something is c11.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.850
So this is going to be simply
c11 times c11 times sigma11.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.550
That's the only term
that survives.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:58.400
c11 has a numerical value of
minus 1, and that says that

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.860
sigma11 prime is equal
to sigma11.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:09.180
So is there any constraint, any
restriction on sigma 11?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.540
No, sigma11 could be
anything it likes.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.790
So there's no constraint.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.750
Let's do another element.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.590
Let's see what sigma12
prime would be.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:32.430
This will be c1 something times
c2 something times sigma

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.380
something something.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.070
The only element of the
form c1 something that

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.360
is non-zero is c11.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.790
So I'll put in a 1 for the l.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.430
The only direction cosine
element of the form c2

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.810
something which is
non-zero is c22.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.630
So I'll put in c22 and
let n be equal to 2.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.840
c11 is minus 1, c22
is minus 1.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.950
So again, this gives us
something not terribly

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:06.010
interesting.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.690
Sigma 12 prime is equal
to sigma 12.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:17.900
So there's no constraint, at
which point you're probably

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.310
getting very restive,
say, this is

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.580
not telling us anything.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.930
So let me shake you up
by doing one further

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:31.940
transformation, and that is to
find the value for c13 prime.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.880
And that would be
c1 something, c3

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:39.050
something times sigma lm.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.330
The only form of this term of
the form c1 something, that's

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.720
non-zero is c11,
as we've seen.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.730
So I'll put in just that
single term and

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.400
replace l by 1.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.880
The term of the form
c3 something that

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.581
is non-zero is c33.

00:21:56.581 --> 00:22:02.130
And I'll put in a 3 for m, and
this is then c11 times c33

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.790
times sigma13.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:09.520
1, And c11 is minus 1.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.630
c33 is plus 1.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:18.950
And that says that sigma13
prime is minus sigma13.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.620
But if this is a symmetry
transformation, the tensor has

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.020
to remain invariant.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.630
And if we're to have sigma13
equals minus sigma13, there's

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.960
only one number that can make
that claim, and that's 0.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.800
So sigma13 is identically 0.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.850
And that places a rather severe
constraint on the way

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:50.150
in which the crystal is going to
relate an applied electric

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.100
field to a current flow.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.470
Sigma11 is anything.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.890
Sigma12 is anything.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.470
Sigma13 has to be
identically 0.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.330
Now, let's cut to
the bottom line.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:06.450
The direction cosine scheme is
diagonal, so we can say that

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:14.630
for any element that we pick to
transform sigma ij prime is

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:20.360
going to be cii, the diagonal
term which has the second

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.030
subscript equal to the first,
times cjj times sigma ij.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:39.410
And this says that if we have
i or j is equal to 3, then

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.530
sigma ij has to be 0, because
we're going to have a minus 1

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.250
times a plus 1.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:57.280
If neither i or j is equal to 3,
then again, we will have a

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.330
minus 1 times a minus 1.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.580
There will be no constraint.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:10.420
And the only final possibility
is that both i and j

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.320
are equal to 3.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.040
That would be the single
element c33.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.810
Then we would have plus 1 times
plus 1 as the product of

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.070
direction cosines, and there
will be no constraint.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.980
So for a crystal that has a
twofold axis, and in which

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.960
that twofold axis is along the
direction of x3, the form of

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:44.660
the tensor will be sigma11,
sigma12, 0, sigma21, sigma22,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:25:00.900
0, sigma31, that's going to be
equal to 0, and sigma33 has no

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.150
constraints.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:13.100
So rather than having nine
elements, there are only five

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:25.485
independent elements
rather than nine.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:34.400
And there is now another
relation that can occur in a

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.390
second-rank tensor.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:44.370
The off-diagonal terms sigma12
and sigma21 do

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.200
not have to be related.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.823
But for most--

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.820
but not all--

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:07.035
most second-rank tensor
properties happily have sigma

00:26:07.035 --> 00:26:12.440
ij identical to sigma ji.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.710
In other words, the tensor
is symmetric across

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.490
its principal diagonal.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:26.470
That is a condition that does
not arise from symmetry That

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.420
depends on the specific
physical property.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.780
So let me emphasize
that this depends

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.030
on the tensor property.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.970
And for a great many physical
properties--

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.230
conductivity, diffusivity,
permeability, susceptibility--

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:58.270
you can show that the tensor
has to be symmetric.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.310
But there are a lot of tensors,
particularly for the

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.800
more obscure physical
properties, where to my

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:08.980
knowledge, this proof has
never been given.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.350
And along the same lines, it
is well known that there is

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.020
one physical property for
which this is not true.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.730
This is the thermal electricity
tensor.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.300
So for at least one property,
you can show for sure that the

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.260
tensor does not have to be
symmetric and that for a

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.550
crystal of symmetry 2, this
term and this term are

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.860
definitely not equal.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.840
All right, let us do another
transformation for another

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.390
symmetry, and we can see that
it goes fast when the

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.370
direction cosine scheme
is relatively sparse.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.360
Let's ask the restrictions,
if any, that

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.730
are imposed by inversion.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:12.880
So what is the direction
cosine scheme here?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.880
Here's x1, here's
x2, here's x3.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.380
Then operation of inversion at
the intersection of these axes

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.035
will invert the direction
of x1 prime to here.

00:28:26.035 --> 00:28:29.500
It'll invert the direction
of x2 prime here.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.440
It will invert the direction
of x3 prime to here.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.770
So the relation between the
reference axes is that x1

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.870
prime is equal to minus x1.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.990
x2 prime is equal to minus x2.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:48.090
x3 prime is equal to minus x3,
so that the form of the

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:53.940
direction cosine scheme crj
is minus 1, 00, 0 minus

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.300
1 0, 00 minus 1.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.900
Slightly different from that for
a two-fold axis for which

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.460
the first two diagonal elements
were minus 1, the

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.110
third one was 0.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.350
Well, let's jump right
to it and see if we

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.440
can generalize this.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.180
It's a diagonal direction cosine
scheme once again.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.080
And this says that if we
transform a particular element

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:31.840
sigma ij, it's going to be given
by cil, cjm, sigma lm,

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.070
where l and m are variables
of summation.

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.530
The only ones that survive are
the ones for which i equals l

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.590
and for which j equals m.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:47.330
So it's going to be cii,
cjj times sigma ij.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:51.530
Regardless of the values of i
and j, the diagonal terms are

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.330
always minus 1.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.590
And therefore, sigma ij prime is
always going to turn out to

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.460
be equal to sigma ij, so
there's going to be no

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.070
constraint on any element.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.470
And this shortens the job that's
facing us immeasurably.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:18.820
So let me write that down,
because that's important.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:38.070
Inversion imposes no constraint
on any second-rank

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.320
tensor property.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:51.240
So if we stay with monoclinic
crystals, we looked at

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.920
symmetry 2.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.910
Symmetry 2 over m is equal
to 2 with an inversion

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.290
center put on it.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:05.270
But inversion doesn't require
anything, so the symmetry

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:10.620
constraints for 2 over m
have to be the same as

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.640
for symmetry 2.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.600
We look at the constraints that
might be imposed by a

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.870
mirror plane.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:26.555
A mirror plane plus inversion
is 2 over m.

00:31:26.555 --> 00:31:29.310
2 over m has to be
the same as 2.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.760
So this will be the same as 2.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.240
And now we've shown that for
any monoclinic crystal,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.840
regardless of whether the
symmetry, the point group, is

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.050
2m or 2 over m, the form
of the tensor has to

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.840
be exactly the same.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:56.760
So for any monoclinic crystal,
namely 2m or 2 over m, this is

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.380
the form of the tensor where
the twofold axis, again, is

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.420
along x3, the mirror plane would
have to be perpendicular

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.945
to x3, and for 2 over m, both
of the preceding conditions.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.670
So how about that?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.860
Let me issue a caveat, because
we're almost out of time.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.570
There are five independent
elements.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.810
And that's true.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:45.570
But elements sigma12, sigma21,
sigma13, and sigma31 are 0

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:53.150
only for this arrangement
of axes relative to

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:54.400
the symmetry elements.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:14.086
If you wanted to take a
different set of axes, you

00:33:14.086 --> 00:33:17.400
know how to get the tensor
for that set of axes.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.310
Each tensor element is going
to be given by a linear

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.470
combination of these five
non-zero elements.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.520
And if the orientation of the
axes relative to the symmetry

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:35.080
elements is quite general, all
nine elements of the tensor

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.790
will be non-zero.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.770
There will be only five
independent numbers, which

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.430
composes each of those nine
elements, and they will be

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.800
given by a product of two
direction cosines, sometimes

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.860
each of these five non-zero
elements.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.750
But there will be no zeros in
this array at all for an

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.500
arbitrary set of coordinate
systems.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.460
Something that I think I'll ask
you to do as a problem,

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.230
because it's really easy
to do, if the tensor is

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.100
symmetric, which most of them
are, one thing that you can

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:20.210
show quite directly is that
a symmetric tensor remains

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:30.375
symmetric for any arbitrary
change of axes.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.900
And that, again, is something
that's fairly easy to prove,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.750
and I'll let you have the fun
and exhilaration of doing that

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.000
for yourself.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.980
OK, so this means that for
everything except thermal

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.010
electricity, you really have
to transform, at most, only

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.800
six elements if you go from one

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.040
coordinate system to another.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.270
That's still a lot, but it's
considerably better than

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.110
transforming all nine.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.070
So if the tensor originally is
symmetric in one coordinate

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.370
system, it stays symmetric in
any other coordinate system.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.380
Now, one thing that
I should mention--

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.230
I passed over it rather
quickly--

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:33.780
we said that a property of a
direction cosine scheme is

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.860
that it is what's called a
unitary transformation.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.680
And it has the property that
the determinant of the

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.030
coefficients is plus
1 if the axis

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:49.580
retains the same chirality.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.140
The determinant is minus 1 if
you change the handedness.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:59.520
That is only true for what is
called a measure-preserving

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.160
transformation.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:02.920
That's what it's called.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.490
And when it's a
measure-preserving

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.690
transformation, then the
direction cosine scheme is a

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.440
unitary matrix.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:17.210
What is measure-preserving
transformation?

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.070
If it's a right-handed system

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.560
beforehand, there's no squishing.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.740
It doesn't go to an oblique
coordinate system.

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.100
Cartesian stays Cartesian.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.470
If the reference axes are of
equal lengths, they don't

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.440
stretch upon the
transformation.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.150
You can define transformations
like that if you like, where

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.950
the angles between them go from
orthogonal to oblique

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:43.670
after the transformation, and
the units of length along the

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.900
three axes change dimension.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.920
But then the determinant of the
coefficients is not unity,

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.170
and a lot of the nice,
convenient properties that

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.420
we've seen here do not hold.

00:36:57.205 --> 00:37:01.620
All right, that is a good
place to stop, I think.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.970
Next week, no quiz.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.650
If you came in late, we're
going to postpone

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.070
the quiz for a week.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.710
And let's see, look at all I
can ask you just after one

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.930
lecture on tensors.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.700
What we will do next is explore
the form of the

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.830
tensors for other crystal
symmetries.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.600
It goes fairly quickly.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.340
And then having done all that,
I'll show you how you can

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.970
determine the symmetry
constraints by inspection for

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:31.990
a tensor of any rank.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.240
And you're going to despise me
for that, but this was useful,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.090
because we can get used to
manipulating the notation.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.760
But there is a method called--

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.380
appropriately enough-- the
method of direct inspection

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.170
where you can very quickly and
very easily do the symmetry

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.800
transformations.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:52.470
So all this and more will be
revealed next time, which is

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.120
going to be a lot more
beneficial than taking a quiz.
