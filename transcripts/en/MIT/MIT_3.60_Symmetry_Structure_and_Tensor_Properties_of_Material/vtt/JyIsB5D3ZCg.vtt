00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.870
PROFESSOR: We had begun to
discuss, really what is,

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.120
although you would not gather
it from last time, a fairly

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.020
straightforward matter.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.030
Set up our usual Cartesian
coordinate system.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:34.790
And then look at the surface of
the solid, and applied to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.550
this solid a force per unit
area, which we'll represent by

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.100
a vector k.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.360
And then put on some
labels here.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.890
Let this be O. Let this be A,
let this be B, and this be

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.370
point C. Then we
proceeded to--

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.090
I will say, attempt to--

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.270
set up a balance of forces
between the external force per

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.770
unit area and the internal
forces per unit area, which

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.090
have to push back on the
external force if the solid is

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.620
to remain motionless.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.280
The thing that I did not carry
through is that there are two

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.740
directions involved.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.920
One is the direction to the
normal, to the particular

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.250
surface that we're looking at.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.410
We'll call that N. And there is
the direction that k, the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.510
vector k, makes with respect to
the three reference x axes,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.360
x1, x2, x3.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.150
Let's take k and immediately
split it up into the three

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.510
components, k1, k2, k3, because
throughout, we're

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.390
going to be dealing with the
balance of those three forces

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.190
per unit area in the directions
of x1, x2, and x3.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.000
We want to take this surface
area and resolve it into three

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.020
separate areas that are
normal to x1, x2, x3.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.780
And what I did at the end of
last hour was to look at k and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.580
try to express these internal
areas in terms of the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.430
direction cosines of k.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.040
Forget that.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.420
We've split up k into its three
components, and I didn't

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.470
draw in the direction
of the normal to the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.080
surface N last time.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.690
So I kept saying, direction
cosines of k, and people in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.080
the audience said,
no, no, no, no.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.330
And I said, yeah, because you
see, that's the ratio

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.190
of these two areas.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.960
And everybody said, no, that's
wrong, and I said, ha.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.490
And that's where we ended
my most inglorious hour.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.330
And they've got this
all down on tape.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.700
My reputation's going
to be ruined.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.660
So, anyway, let's now
do it properly.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.790
And what I will say is that in
the x1 direction, we have to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.420
have internal forces that push
back, and we have to balance

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.630
those forces in all
three directions.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.100
So I'll say is that in the x1
direction, and this as you saw

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.670
last time, gets very cumbersome
because we have to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.080
deal with all these clumsy
areas, that the force per unit

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.980
area on ABC has to be balanced
for each of the three

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.230
components of k by internal
forces acting

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.580
along x1, x2, and x3.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.890
So we can say is that the first
in the x1 direction, the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:37.930
component of k that acts on
the surface ABC in the x1

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.520
direction has to be balanced
by internal forces.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.150
And let's look first at
the x1 direction.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.440
So there are three internal
surfaces.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.695
They are the area BOC.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.690
That is this back surface here,
and the normal to that

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.470
surface is x1.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.420
So let me define some forces
per unit area that are

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.260
internal, and I'll use the
term sigma for that.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.550
And I will use a first subscript
that gives the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.850
direction in which that force
per unit area acts, and I'll

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.210
use a second subscript that
indicates the normal to the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.460
internal surface.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.280
So area BOC obviously, as we
observed a moment ago, has x1

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.620
as its normal.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.810
But there are three
internal surfaces.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:54.820
There will also be an internal
area, AOC, on which a force

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.470
per unit area acts in
the x1 direction.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.360
So I'll call this one
by analogy to what I

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.440
did a moment ago.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.850
I'll call this sigma 1, because
it acts in the x1

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.400
direction, and it acts on the
surface AOC, which has x2 as

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.260
its normal.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.280
Then finally, there will be a
third force per unit area,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.300
sigma 1 3, acting in the x1
direction, on a surface whose

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.770
normal is perpendicular
to-- along x3.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.840
The surface is perpendicular
to x3.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.287
And that's area AOB.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.600
OK, so this is just a simple
balance of forces, external

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.650
and internal balancing forces,
which act in the x1 direction.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.440
Then we'll write a similar thing
for the x2 direction.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.440
And we'll say that the x2
component of force per unit

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.860
area external to the volume
element acting on area ABC is

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.660
going to be balanced by, again,
forces now acting in

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.280
the x2 direction.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.220
So first, there will be a
component of 4 sigma 2 acting

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.220
on the area that's normal to x1,
and that's the same area

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.940
BOC, plus another force per
unit area acting in the x2

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.830
direction on the surface, whose
normal is a long x2.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.630
And that is, once
more, area AOC.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.610
And that would be a force per
unit area that I'll define,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.570
because it's my ball game
and I own the ball.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.150
So again, that would be sigma 2
2, and then finally a sigma

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:47.010
2 3 times the area whose
normal is x3.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.190
And I think I need not write
the third term that follows

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.640
automatically from what
I've written so far.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.370
So now comes the geometry part,
where I'm going to get

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.200
rid of these messy areas, and
I'm going to divide through by

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.770
the external area on the
surface of the solid.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.370
I will then write accordingly
that k1 is equal to sigma 11

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:28.080
times the ratio of area BOC
divided by area ABC plus sigma

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:40.800
12 times area AOC divided
by area AOB--

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.270
ABC, excuse me.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:57.745
Then finally sigma 1 3 times
area AOB divided by area ABC.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.660
So now I'll introduce a little
bit of geometry that caused

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.620
such difficulties last time.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.980
If I have an area and project
it onto another area that

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.670
makes an angle C with respect
to the first, this area A

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:26.130
prime is equal to the area A
times the cosine of Phi and

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.090
you could define that Phi in a
different way, namely take the

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:36.289
normal to one of the two areas
and let M prime be the other

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.299
normal, so C then is exactly
the same thing as the angle

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.165
between the normals to
these two surfaces.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.340
So let's now look at what the
ratio of these two areas that

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.590
we have is.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:59.890
What we're dealing with here is
an angle between the normal

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.650
to the surface, not k, but the
normal to the surface, and

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:12.490
either x1, x2, or x3.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.460
So the ratio of--

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.350
let's look at one of these
specific terms.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:24.330
The ratio of area BOC through
the ratio of the area ABC

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:30.350
should be the cosine of the
angle between the normal to

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.410
the surface and the normal
to area BOC.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.740
Well, the normal to area BOC is
x1, so that first ratio of

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.090
areas is just going to be the
cosine of this angle.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:52.950
And that cosine is just the
direction cosine of N1 along

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.600
the x1 of M along the
x1 direction.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.420
So this is just the direction
cosine between N, the normal

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.580
to the surface, and x1.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.330
And let me say then that, by
definition, I'll let the

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.410
direction to the normal be its
three direction cosines, L 1

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:18.100
plus L 2, plus J plus
L3 times k.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.500
These are the direction cosines
of the normal to the

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.770
surface, and not k.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:26.780
So this then simply comes down
to sigma 11 times L1, the

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:33.980
ratio of the area AOC to ABC
is going to be the angle

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.550
between N and x2.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.690
And that's the angle whose
direction cosine is L2.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:49.350
And similarly, the ratio of
these two areas will be cosine

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:51.560
minus 1 of L3.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.290
So this cumbersome construction
with ratios of

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:01.680
areas just reduces to sigma 11
L1 plus sigma 12 times L2 plus

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.140
sigma 13 times L3.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:11.540
And the other two equations will
follow a similar form.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:19.590
K2 will be sigma 21 times L1
plus sigma 22 times L2 plus

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.750
sigma 23 times L3.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:29.710
Or in general, case of I will be
given by sigma I J times L

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:36.460
to J. Easy.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.670
Nice and compact.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.920
Nice and simple.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.530
What can we say about this?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:12:01.410
K is a vector which has
components k1, k2, and k3.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:11.370
The direction cosines can be,
as we said a moment ago, can

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:17.240
be regarded as the components
of a unit vector pointing

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.640
along the normal
to the surface.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.930
So k is a vector.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.790
These three direction cosines
are the direction cosine to a

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.060
unit vector normal
to the surface.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.690
If we were to be so foolish to
try to change the coordinate

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.530
system., having just gotten it
right for the first time in

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.050
one coordinate system, we know
exactly how the two vectors

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.390
will change because
we have a law for

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.790
transformation of a vector.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.920
If we were to change the
coordinate system, the

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.720
components of k would wink on
end of and take new values and

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.660
we know exactly how the
components of a vector will

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.440
change as we change
coordinate system.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.830
OK, if this transforms like a
vector and this transforms

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.370
like the vector, then the 3 by
3 array of coefficients which

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.810
relate those to quantities
must be a tensor.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.780
So we've proven rigorously that
sigma IJ is a tensor, in

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.655
particular, it's a second
rank tensor.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.510
And were we to change coordinate
system, we know

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.730
from what we've done in the
past, exactly how the numbers

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:35.520
that make up this 3 by 3
array will transform.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:47.940
These quantities, sigma IJ,
are something that you've

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.070
probably encountered, introduced
to be sure,

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.140
probably in a little
different way.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:59.060
These are the elements of
stress, and sigma IJ is the

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.310
stress tensor.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.680
We can immediately, on physical
grounds, established

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.720
that sigma IJ must be
a symmetric tensor.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.040
So let's set up two axes, x1,
and x2, and x3 obviously is

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:35.300
normal to the board.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.270
And let us look at some
off-diagonal terms like sigma

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.360
12 and sigma 21.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:52.080
Sigma 1 2 would be a force
acting on the x1 direction on

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.940
a surface whose normal is x2.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:00.510
So this is going to be a sheer
stress and that, to prevent

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.290
any translation of the volume
element, must be balanced by a

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.270
sigma 12 on the other
face that acts in

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.240
the opposite direction.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.320
We're going to need a convention
for defining sign,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.450
S-I-G-N, of what constitutes a
positive element of stress and

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.730
a negative element of stress.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:38.365
And I'll define a plus sigma
IJ as a force per unit area

00:15:38.365 --> 00:15:52.490
acting in the plus xi direction
on a surface whose

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.636
normal is plus xj.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.960
So if this is a force per unit
area acting on this surface,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:13.380
and it acts in the direction
of x1 on a surface whose

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.130
normal is x2, what I've shown
here is a positive sigma 12.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.560
A sheer force going in the
opposite direction would be a

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.560
negative sigma 12.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.640
A positive sigma 11 would be
a stress that's tensile, a

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.950
negative sigma 11 would be a
stress that's compressive.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:41.140
So here's a sigma 12, a sigma
12 on the opposite face.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.640
If we went away and turned our
back, this volume element

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.740
would start accelerating,
getting an angular

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.020
acceleration, would start
furiously spinning about the

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.120
x3 axis like a top.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.510
So something, if this volume
element is, by definition, an

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.930
equilibrium, something has
to balance this couple.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.720
And if it's to stay put, we must
have a sheer force like

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.210
this and a sheer force
like this.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.380
And that's the only thing
available from the nine

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.359
elements of stress that will
give a net torque on the

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.540
volume element.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.319
So what are these?

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.630
This is a stress that
acts on the surface

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.280
whose normal is x2--

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.010
whose normal as x1 in
the x2 direction.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:34.950
So this is sigma 21.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:47.820
It acts in x2 direction,
and its normal is x1.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.760
An x, and then [? plus ?]

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.170
x2 direction on [? I ?]

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:03.660
surface, which has a normal
that is along x1.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:14.720
So the only way we can avoid an
angular acceleration is to

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.960
say that sigma 12 has to be
identical to sigma 21 if

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.220
there's no rotation about x3.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.440
And looking at the couple's that
act about x2, and x3, we

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.350
could say in general that sigma
IJ is going to have to

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:38.425
be equal to sigma JI for a
volume element in equilibrium.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:55.260
So stress then is equilibrium
is in place, has to be a

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.510
symmetric tensor.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:06.140
It is, however, a plain old
second-rank tensor like all of

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.090
the other second-rank tensors
that we've spent the last

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.340
month talking about.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.970
And I think I tried to swindle
you on this one before.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:29.580
If this is a second-rank tensor,
the stress tensor must

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:43.220
be symmetric and diagonal
for a cubic crystal.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.900
In other words, the stress
tensor sigma IJ must have the

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:59.270
form sigma 0 0, 0 sigma 0, 0 0
sigma because we've shown that

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.310
that is what is required of a
tensor if the crystal has

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.010
cubic symmetry.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:10.570
So surprisingly, you cannot
subject a single crystal with

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.160
cubic material to
sheer stress.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.470
Any quarrel with that?

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.480
Should we move on?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.000
We better not, but somebody
better raise an objection.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.620
That's not true, obviously.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.820
I can take a cubic crystal and
shear the stuffings out of it.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.710
So what's going on here?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.670
AUDIENCE: The tensor property
that you are applying to

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.100
property of the [? crystal. ?]

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:49.470
But if it is an outside force,
it doesn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.450
PROFESSOR: This is one
of your good days.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.350
society [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.310
PROFESSOR: That makes it an
especially good day because

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.230
you're paying attention to
what I said for a change.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.510
The distinction here, and I did
make it last time-- it was

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.090
one of the things that
I did correctly--

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.600
that there are really two kinds
of things that have to

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.840
be described by second-rank
tensors.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.660
There are the things that we
have been spending most of our

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:23.540
time on, and these are property
tensors and--

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.420
I mentioned last time, too, so
I know I said this before--

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.350
Nye calls them field tensors.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.590
I'm sorry.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.820
Nye calls them property
tensors, also.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.460
And these are something that
depends on the structure and

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.680
bonding and other

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.010
characteristics of the material.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.920
The stress is something that we
we're taking and imposing

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:47.400
on an innocent, unsuspecting
crystal, and that is

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.450
something we do.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:53.860
And we can, by design, twist it,
shear it, stretch it, as

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.330
hard as we like, provided
we don't break it.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.640
And so this is something that
is externally imposed on the

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.860
crystal, and this is something
that's called a field tensor.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.740
We mentioned last time
the meaning of field.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.980
The field is a volume of space
and a field tensor is a space

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.240
in which a value of the tensor
is defined as every point, x1,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.200
x2, x3, in the space.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.850
Just as an electric field is a
vector field and you define

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.690
the electric field we as a
function of every point x1,

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.820
x2, x3, in the space.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.600
So there's no reason whatsoever
that there need be

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.860
restrictions on the tensor
that we apply.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:42.750
And when we can cross out that
interesting, but incorrect,

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.000
supposition.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.430
But they can be a lot of
different forms, special

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:58.880
forms, of stress tensors which
have special forms simply

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.900
because of the nature
of what we do.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.190
And these have restrictions and
equalities that have no

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.080
counterpart in property
tensors.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:13.960
For example, we can have the
cancer sigma 00000000, which

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.170
is something we could never
have identically so for a

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.170
property tensor.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.850
And what does this represent?

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:34.340
This is a tensor for which sigma
IJ is 0, unless I equals

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.140
J equals 1.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.010
So this is the only thing that's
going on, is a force

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.220
per unit area along
the x1 direction.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.655
So this is a uniaxial stress.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.870
And that is a stress field
which we could apply on a

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.850
piece of material very easily.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.860
Just screw a hook into the
material and hang a weight on

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.330
the hook and you've got
uniaxial stress.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.990
We can also have something
that's a little harder to

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.295
visualize, a biaxial stress.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.430
And this would be a stress that
had elements sigma 11,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.420
register 0--

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.690
at least when we refer
to principal axes--

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:35.970
0 sigma 2 2 0 0 0 0.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.190
When it's in diagonal
form, two of the

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.715
diagonal terms are 0.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.850
That doesn't seem to make sense
because, if this is a

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.030
force per unit area along x1,
and this is a force per unit

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:53.700
area along x2, can't we add up
those vectors and say that

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.250
that's a uniaxial stress?

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.750
Depends on your coordinate
system.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:05.260
If you want an example of a
biaxial stress, imagine some

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.360
firemen underneath a burning
building, and they're holding

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.870
out a blanket for somebody
to jump into.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.310
You have one pair of firemen
pulling in this direction to

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:17.300
keep the blanket taut, and
another pair of firemen are

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.560
not quite so vigorous, and
they're pulling in an

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.820
orthogonal direction.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:29.350
And those two forces, sigma 11
and sigma 22, create a biaxial

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.310
stress event material.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.820
You could change the form of
the tensor by rotating the

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.670
coordinate system, but
this is one example

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.280
of a biaxial stress.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.650
The final general form, a
triaxial stress, obviously by

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:48.380
extension, is going to be where
of all three diagonals,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:56.980
sigma 11, sigma 22, and sigma
33, are non-zero when you put

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.690
the tensor in diagonal form.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.080
This would be a general
triaxial stress.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.130
And an example of that would
be when the jumping person

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.560
lands on the blanket, there's
going to be a force that his

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.230
or her mass exerts on the
blanket, and that would be a

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.350
third sigma 3 3.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.532
So that would be a
triaxial stress.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:34.410
Let me give you a couple of
special cases of specialized

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.660
stress tensors.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:46.250
And suppose I had a triaxial
stress, but all the diagonal

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.215
terms were equal.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.980
That's something that I tried
a moment ago to hoodwink you

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.380
into believing was required by
a cubic crystal, but suppose

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.890
that was the form of
the stress tensor.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:03.570
What would that represent?

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.331
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:05.331 --> 00:27:08.860
PROFESSOR: That is something
that's going to be--

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.270
yeah, very good.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.240
That's not a pressure.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.680
It's a dilation.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.990
But if I make it into a more
familiar form, put it here,

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:22.900
minus P, minus P, minus P. It's
a force prevented area.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.530
That's where the stress is.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.730
If it's a hydrostatic pressure,
it's squeezing the

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.070
volume element so it has to be,
by our definition, acting

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.590
in a negative x1 direction
on a surface whose

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.250
normal is plus x1.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.300
So minus P, minus P,
minus P, represents

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.550
a hydrostatic pressure.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.150
And now, unless you've seen it
before, or you're reading the

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.950
notes instead of listening to
me, let me give you a really

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.460
strange-looking one.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.950
What is this stress tensor?

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:15.740
Where sigma 22 is opposite
in sign but equal in

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:18.192
magnitude to sigma 11.

00:28:18.192 --> 00:28:19.485
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:19.485 --> 00:28:20.625
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:20.625 --> 00:28:21.890
Good.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.340
The way to see that

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.210
geometrically is the following.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:32.970
What we're doing is, we're
pushing with a force per unit

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.160
area in this direction.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.680
That would be sigma 11, and
then we squeeze in the

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.310
orthogonal direction.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.290
And that is a sigma 22,
which is negative.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:53.400
If we rotate the solid by 90
degrees, then we've got this,

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.040
plus this, acting on this face,
same forces per unit

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.460
area as we have here.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.840
And that is a net force per
unit area like this.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.990
On the opposite surface, we've
got this force per unit area

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:11.740
and this force per unit
area, component

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.150
going in this direction.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:19.170
And that is going to be a force
that goes like this.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.680
That's going to be a force per
unit area like this, and

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.740
similarly, this combined with
this is going to be a force

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.540
acting in the reverse
direction.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:35.432
That would be, again, this with
this, and this would be

00:29:35.432 --> 00:29:36.920
this with that.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.730
So clearly, that is a body
that's being subjected to pure

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:51.250
sheer, and if we rotated the
axes x1 and x2 by 45 degrees

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:58.510
to an x1 prime and x2 prime
like this, and then

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:05.020
transformed the tensor, it
would take the form 0

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:12.850
sigma sigma 0 0.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.300
And then, what do we want now?

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.740
This would be the only
thing we get.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.000
Except I should be careful to
put a sigma prime on this

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.480
because, when we change axes,
these sigmas will not be of

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.520
the same magnitude as
the original ones.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.620
There's going to be a square
root of 2 coming from cosine

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.330
of 45 degrees in there.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.370
But, anyway, just rotating the
axes 45 degrees of as I've

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:41.600
indicated schematically here
with vector sums is going to

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:49.650
give me two off diagonal terms
equal in magnitude that would

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.320
correspond to sigma
12 and sigma 21.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:06.540
So those are some special forms
of a stress tensor when

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.150
you place it in a diagonalized
form.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.550
But let's conclude this part of
our discussion by observing

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:20.720
that everything that we've said
about second-rank tensors

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.410
holds for the stress tensor.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:38.660
For example, you can always
select new axes that put the

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.530
tensor in diagonal form.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.266
So that's one general
property.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:15.720
You can define a stress quadric,
and we'll do that

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:23.340
with the equation sigma
ij xi xj equals 1.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:23.830
Why not?

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.080
It's a second-ranked tensor.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.250
We can take the elements and
construct a surface from it.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:38.410
This quadric will have the
properties of any other

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.820
quadric for a second-rank
tensor.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:46.790
In particular, if we construct
the quadric, it's now for sure

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.430
going to be able to be either
an ellipsoid, an hyperboloid

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.950
of one or two sheets, or in this
case, even an imaginary

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:58.340
ellipsoid for a stress that's
everywhere compressive.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.600
The quadric could have
its diagonal

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.110
elements all negative.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:07.690
The radius of the stress
quadric in a particular

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:22.540
direction is going to be the 1
over the square root of the

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:25.550
property in that direction.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.560
What does that mean, stress
in a given direction?

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.990
Well, let's again remember
how we have

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.470
defined the stress tensor.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:40.130
A force per unit area has three
components, k1, k2, k3,

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.060
and they're equal to
sigma ij times lj.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.270
So the value of the property in
this direction is going to

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.890
be the value of the property
in the direction defined by

00:33:54.890 --> 00:34:01.880
[? elsa ?] j and the values of
[? elsa ?] j are components of

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.010
the unit vector that point
in that direction.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:11.389
So if this is the direction of
k, [? off ?] like this, the

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:20.400
value of this quadric in this
direction is going to be the

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.810
value of the part of k that's
parallel to the radius vector

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.489
over the magnitude of
the radius vector.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:31.350
But the [? radius ?] vector is
a unit vector, so it's simply

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:36.650
going to be equal
to k parallel.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:41.500
And if k parallel is the part
of the vector that is along

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.330
the surface normal, that is
going to be the component of k

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.885
which is purely tensile.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:55.110
This is a force per unit area,
has parts that are, components

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.030
that are normal to the
surface normal.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.730
Those are shear components.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.890
The component that's directly
along the normal to the

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.330
surface is going to be a purely
tensile component.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:11.940
And, therefore, the radius
of the quadric in a given

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:25.220
direction gives us the tensile
component of the force density

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.575
vector k that is transmitted
across the face--

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:48.605
so let's not say face,
but interface--

00:35:52.340 --> 00:36:08.400
whose normal is in the
direction of R.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.020
So this is the radius vector.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:15.310
That's the direction of the
normal to a surface and 1 over

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.190
the radius of--

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.830
The radius of the quadric in
that direction is going to be

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.740
1 over the square root of the
tensile component of stress

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.110
that's transmitted across an
interface in this direction.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.000
How are we doing on time?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.750
Any questions at this point?

00:37:06.061 --> 00:37:12.470
AUDIENCE: Can you explain how
you know that's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.945
PROFESSOR: Remember what our
radius normal property said.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:29.650
If we have a tensor like good
conductivity, where a current

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:33.835
density is related to an
applied electric field,

00:37:33.835 --> 00:37:36.500
[? essa ?] j and we've--

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.060
unfortunately, that's
segment 2.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.563
This is the conductivity
tensor.

00:37:41.563 --> 00:37:47.440
What we said is that, if we
take the components of the

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.830
tensor, sigma ij, and construct
the surface sigma ij

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:58.690
xij equals unity, that will be
some sort of quadratic form

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:03.490
that has the property that the
radius in any given direction

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:12.740
is 1 over the square root of
the value of the property,

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.820
sigma conductivity
in this case.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:15.760
Bad case.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.890
I shouldn't have picked
things where the

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.620
sigma is also involved.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:22.640
And the value of the property
in the given direction is

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.560
going to be the parallel
component of what happens over

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:30.770
the magnitude of what you do.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.030
So in the case of electrical
conductivity, if we apply a

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:38.160
field in this direction, the
value of the property is going

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:44.570
to be that part of the current
flow, which is parallel to the

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.590
electric field, divided
by the magnitude of

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.600
the electric field.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:56.140
So that is a relation that you
know by heart and have come to

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:59.360
not only know, but to love.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.070
So what are we saying here?

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:05.730
For the stress tensor, we can
take the elements of the

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.940
stress tensor and construct
a quadric.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:12.990
And the thing that's related
here is a force per unit area

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:19.530
that we're applying to the
surface of the crystal, and

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:23.470
that's transmitted through the
volume of the crystal by the

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:27.520
relation that we have defined
as the stress tensor.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.850
So, unfortunately,
again, sigma Ij.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:33.560
And now what is involved are the
direction cosines of the

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.580
normal to the surface.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.770
So what is the applied vector?

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.170
The applied vector is a unit
vector, and this is the normal

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.420
to the surface.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.780
And the surface in question
would be a surface like this.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:40:00.490
The thing that results is
a force per unit area k.

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:06.350
So what we're doing is taking
k, the value of

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.770
sigma, in that direction.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.060
A scalar quantity will be the
part of k that's parallel to

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.060
the normal vector,
divided by the

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:18.700
magnitude of the unit vector.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.840
And that's, a magnitude
of n is 1, so

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.910
that's just k parallel.

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:25.710
So this is the surface.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.260
This is its normal.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.250
And what the radius of the
quadric is going to give us is

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:37.010
that part of the force density,
which is the force

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.150
density vector resolved onto
the normal vector.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.230
And this is a tensile.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:46.750
This is the part of the
tensile stress that's

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.310
transmitted.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.770
This is the total stress
that has a sheer part

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:50.790
and a tensile part.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.420
The radius of the quadric is
going to give you the part

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.930
that's transmitted across the
surface in this orientation.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.460
That is purely a
tensile force.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.760
That make sense?

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.460
I should have done it
without sigmas being

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.710
present in both tensors.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:16.900
So everything you want to know
about stress that's applied to

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.510
a solid is contained in a
second-rank tensor that is

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.940
symmetric and obeys all of the
characteristics that we

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.940
derived earlier for property
tensors, even though this is a

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.760
field tensor, and not
a property tensor.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.870
Let us then turn to the next
thing that I want to discuss,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.930
again something you've
heard before.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.080
But we'll do it within the
context of the tensor algebra

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.850
that we've developed before.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.905
And this is the concept
of strength.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:11.020
And let me introduce
the subject by a

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.650
one-dimensional analog.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:18.250
Suppose we have a very thin
elastic band fastened to some

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:22.535
immovable surface, and this
will be the direction x.

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.950
And then we pull on it.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.540
And here again, we have to be
complete and note that there

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.910
are several different
kinds of behavior.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:44.020
One type of behavior is a case
where the elastic band

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:51.820
stretches, and if there's some
point P on the initial state

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:57.000
that point P will move to
a point P prime that is

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.930
displaced from the original
location by a vector U.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:12.790
There's another point Q part
way along the elastic band.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:16.670
If the thing that we have
fastened to the elastic band

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.100
slipped, and there's no
deformation at all, Q would be

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.080
displaced by the same amount U
if there was just translation

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:27.400
of the elastic because it wasn't
fastened down solidly.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:31.160
But if it's stretching here
between this point and this

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.810
point, it's going to stretch
up here, too.

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:38.320
And, in general, it will move
over to some point Q prime,

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.490
and this displacement vector is
going to be the original U

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:52.620
plus delta U. And what we care
about in defining strength is

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:55.370
not the absolute coordinates,
but the interval

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.770
between these points.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:07.530
This separation is U, and this
separation is U plus delta U.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:11.610
Now this is a common, but
not a necessarily

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.360
unique, sort of behavior.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.280
This is something where the
displacement does not change

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.465
along the length of
the elastic bands.

00:44:19.465 --> 00:44:21.660
This is something that's
called homogeneous

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:22.910
deformation.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:35.260
And this is characterized by a
displacement view that varies

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.680
linearly with position along
the elastic band.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.930
Does something like this.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:50.410
It's possible, in a [? grade ?]
of material, if

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.960
you'd like a real example,
that U, as a function of

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.230
distance along this
one-dimensional object, does

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:57.480
something like this.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:01.660
Why not?

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:08.540
That's what might happen
for example in--

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.230
that's almost an oxymoron, a
one-dimensional elastic band

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:15.020
whose cross-sectional area
changes with distance in that

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.110
one dimension.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.840
So this is homogeneous
deformation, as opposed to

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.590
inhomogeneous deformation.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:30.490
There's another type of
behavior, and this is apparent

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:37.870
if you place a thin piece of
metal or plastic, let's say,

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:43.770
between the pair of grips in the
Instron machine, and after

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.090
deformation, it does something
like this.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.580
There's an inhomogeneous
deformation, which is to

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.120
referred to colloquially
as necking.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.740
A very good example of that is
what happens when you grab

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.180
hold of some cheap plastic
shrink wrap that has been

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.880
shrunk around a package that
has been mailed to you.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.220
And you want to get it
off, so you grab it.

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:12.220
And it doesn't deform
elastically.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.780
What happens is that it necks
in places where there's a

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.220
stress concentration.

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.550
And you get something
exactly like this.

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.500
And if we were to indicate that
sort of behavior, U as a

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.180
function of position would be
one U, and then it would

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.720
increase very rapidly.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.440
The [? UDX ?]

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.970
would be very much larger than
the places which had uniform

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.550
elastic deformation, so it would
be a nonlinear behavior

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:38.880
of this sort.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.130
And that would be necking.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.730
If you've never noticed that
sort of behavior before, I

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:49.510
give you an assignment tonight
of going home and getting a

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.960
piece of Saran wrap from your
kitchen drawer and grabbing

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.210
hold of it and pulling it.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:59.150
And it deforms non-uniformly in
a fashion that's indicative

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:00.400
of necking.

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:09.530
OK, it's just about five of.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:11.300
Why don't I stop there.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.440
And what I would like to do next
is to cast this relation,

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.600
which is a one-dimensional
stream, into a

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.550
three-dimensional situation.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:26.460
And we'll look at some of the
properties of the description

00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:28.620
of a body that's been deformed
in three dimensions.
