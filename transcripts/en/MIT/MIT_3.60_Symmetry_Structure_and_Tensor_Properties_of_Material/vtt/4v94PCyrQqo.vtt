00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.380
PROFESSOR: OK, its always
disappointing when, just as

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.930
you're ready to tie everything
up in a nice, neat little

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.950
package and leave the room to a
round of applause, you screw

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.330
up the last little detail.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.010
Anyway, what's wrong here is,
I said for an arbitrary

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.750
rotation around X3, and I'm
comforted only by the fact

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.120
that nobody else caught this
little glitch either, the

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:37.970
answer elements are a11, a11,
a33, a12, not 0, and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.810
-a12, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.000
So there's a skew-symmetric
form when there's just a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.390
single rotation axis.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.870
So this would be asymmetry n
and this would be one of a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.480
family of two different
symmetries, the dihedral

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.810
groups n22, the two-fold axes
would require that these be

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.420
equal, so, 0, 0, 0,
a11, 0, 0, 0, a33.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.270
So this is not the form of the
tensor for a four-fold axis,

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.390
it's the form for a crystal
with symmetry 422.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.860
And same for a three-fold
axis.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.210
This is the form
for 32 and 622.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.760
For just the single rotation
axis of any sort other than 2,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.330
these two terms are equal
in magnitude, but non-0.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.700
Now if you look at the equation
for the tensor, the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.180
term in a12, x1, x2, and a21,
x1, x2 are opposite in sign

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.990
and disappear.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:01.520
So the quadric is, in fact
a surface of revolution

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.390
So the question is why are there
two degrees of freedom

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.840
rather than three?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.280
And I think the answer to that
is going to lie in what is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
required of the eigenvectors
when the off diagonal turns

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.890
are skew-symmetric, and that is
something I've not thought

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.955
about before.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:30.630
All right, so that one minor
loose end sticking out of the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.640
lid as we try to close the box
on this segment of our

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.290
discussion.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.680
I'd like t move on to
a different set of

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.930
considerations.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
One of the things that we can
subject a crystal to as a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.960
generalized force is not merely
a vector force, but

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.480
stimulations that are
more complicated.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.220
And I would like to in
particular now, as a prelude

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.290
to get into getting
into property

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.900
tensors of higher rank.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.670
I'd like to . first discuss
stress, and then define

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.620
strain, and you've all
heard of these

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.690
questions in other contexts.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.990
I'm going to introduce it,
though, in terms of the tensor

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.830
notation that we've used for
other sorts of tensors, just

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.750
so that we have everything in
terms of the same language.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.000
So let me introduce stress by
supposing I have a volume

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.070
element in a solid, and it will
not surprise you that I'm

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.830
going to define the coordinate
system in the solid by three

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.430
axes, X1, X2, X3
in a Cartesian.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.910
system, and I will look at a
surface on the exterior of the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:03.880
solid that cuts axis X1 at A,
axis X2 at B, and axis X3 at

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.070
C.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.880
Then I'll assume that I have a
force density, force per unit

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.280
area applied to the surface.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.890
And if this is force
per unit area, why

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.209
don't I call it a pressure?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.430
Well, a special case of what
we normally think of as a

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.320
pressure is a hydrostatic
pressure, and that is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.720
something that's always exactly
normal to the surface.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.800
So I don't want to call it a
pressure to mislead you into

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.350
the assumption that this force
per unit area, which is a

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.035
vector, has to be normal
to the surface.

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:47.210
So I'll call it a force density,
which becomes a

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.610
hydrostatic pressure when
that force vector is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.370
normal to the surface.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.990
And I'll call that force density
vector K, and it will

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.240
have three components, KI.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.340
Now, the solid is in
equilibrium, I will assume.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:14.460
And if that external force is
not balance on the other side

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.280
by balancing forced, the volume
element in the solid

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.520
would undergo a linear
acceleration, or an angular

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.570
acceleration at the
very least.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.000
So I will assume that this
force on the outside, KI,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.350
which is a force
per unit area.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.040
So to make that a force, I will
have to multiply that

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.040
force density by the
area of the surface

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.460
ABC, on which it acts.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.780
And I'll say that this has to
be balanced for each of the

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.910
three directions, X1 and X2
and X3 by a force per unit

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.380
area acting on these
internal surfaces.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.240
So I'll assume that there is
a force acting in the x1

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:10.140
direction, and I'll call
those a sigma IJ.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:14.160
And I'll say that there's a
first force acting in the X1

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.860
direction on--

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.910
now I need to somehow specify
the orientation to the

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.160
surface, because on this
internal surface there's also

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.320
a force acting in
this direction.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.000
Now on this back surface there's
also a force acting in

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.970
this direction.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.440
So the forces acting on all
three internal surfaces in the

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.380
X1 direction have to balance
exactly the X1 direction, the

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.230
X1 component of the
force density.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.710
So let me turn this to K1, and
I'll say this has to be a

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.800
force per unit area
acting on area.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.850
First of all, I'll call the
origin O on area AOC.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.726
Plus a force acting in the
X1 direction on area A--

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:07.260
whoops, what did I do?

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:14.800
I wanted to do this first
on area BOC, excuse me.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.520
And a force in the X1 direction
acting on area AOC.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.996
And finally a force acting
on area AOB.

00:07:32.996 --> 00:07:40.190
And these are all acting in the
X1 direction, and I now

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.860
would like to introduce some
notation that indicates the

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.460
direction of the direction
orientation of the surface on

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.560
which that force acts.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.770
And I will use the normal to
these internal surfaces to

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.850
define that.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.460
So the force per unit area on
area AOB, that is a surface

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.360
whose normal is X3.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.320
And I will call this
component sigma 13.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:17.940
And I'll call this one area
AOC is normal to X2.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.700
That's why I did that little
sleight of hand as I began

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:28.820
this, and finally area BOC
has as its normal X1.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:37.030
So my use of subscripts here is
that this first subscript

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.430
is the direction in which
the force acts.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.580
And the second subscript
will be the normal to

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.505
the internal surface.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.490
So I've set up algebraically
a system of

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.830
subscripts that works.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.470
We'll see that these
have some physical

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.210
significance in just a moment.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.890
So what will I call these?

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.080
Well, let me get this in a
slightly different form.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.750
Let me take the left hand side
and divide area ABC into all

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.770
of these other areas.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:42.120
So this then will have
sigma 11 times area

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.110
BOC over area ABC.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:54.290
And not surprisingly, sigma 12
will then have multiplying it

00:09:54.290 --> 00:10:03.210
a term area AOC divided
by area ABC.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.460
And this is all looking very
cumbersome, but you'll be

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.600
amazed at how this cleans
up in just a moment.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.890
And this will be area AOB
over finally area AOC.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.140
ABC again.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.520
OK, so how can we
tidy this up?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.880
Well, let me imagine that I have
some surface, a planar

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.300
surface, and its normal points
in this direction.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.600
And I'm going to take that
area and project it onto

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.165
another surface whose normal
points in this direction.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:46.380
And let's suppose that the
angle between these two

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.400
directions is phi, and
the angle between the

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.910
two surfaces is phi.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:01.680
The area of this original
surface is A, and its normal

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.820
points in this direction.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.150
And I project it onto a surface
whose normal is an

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.700
angle phi away.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.640
This new area, A prime
is equal to A times

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.890
the cosine of phi.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.990
So if we accept that, then the
first line of this equation,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.310
which will be eventually a set
of three equations, this is

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.030
the ratio of area BOC over area
ABC, and what is that?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:38.830
That is the angle between the
direction of the force density

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:45.930
and area ABC.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.510
And here is area ABC.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.820
That's the normal here.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.960
And the first term involves
area BOC, and that is the

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:05.460
direction of X, the normal to
that is X1, and therefore the

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.330
ratio of these two areas is the
same thing as the cosine

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.780
of the angle between K and X1.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:24.000
And this second ratio of areas
is going to be sigma 12 times

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.520
the cosine of the angle between
the force density

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.690
vector K and X2.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.710
And the third term is going to
be sigma 13 times the cosine

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:42.010
of the angle between K and X3.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.860
What these cosines are are just
the cosines of the angle

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.720
between K and the
three reference

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.740
axes, X1, X2, and X3.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:13:05.800
So this is simply the direction
cosine L1 of K. And

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:13.860
this is the direction cosine
L2 of K. And this is the

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.790
direction cosine L3.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:23.430
So the X1 component of the force
density vector is going

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:29.955
to be equal to a term sigma 11
times L1, plus the term sigma

00:13:29.955 --> 00:13:33.860
12 times L2, the term
sigma 13 L3.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.390
And if I would write down
similar balances, forces for

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:41.260
the X2 component of the force
density vector, not

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:47.870
surprisingly these things are
going to give me coefficients

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.855
that I'll label sigma 121, sigma
22 times L2, plus sigma

00:13:53.855 --> 00:13:56.810
23 times L3.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:01.590
And in general then the
requirement that this body be

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:06.170
in equilibrium states that each
component of the force

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:13.160
density vector should be given
by a coefficient sigma IJ

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.160
times L sub J. These are the
components of the force

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.410
density vector.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:33.680
This is the direction cosines
of the direction of K.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.780
This is a unit vector in the
direction of K. This is the

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.840
direction of a vector.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:50.620
These are the components of
K. And therefore these

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.700
coefficients sigma IJ relate to
vectors, and they must be a

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.970
second rank tensor.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.870
And these are called, as you
all know, it comes as no

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.910
surprise as the components
of stress.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:22.280
So the reason that these are
really tensors, and not just a

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.840
vector force per unit area
essentially comes down to the

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.850
fact that the behavior of the
body, dynamically and

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.490
mechanically, is going to
depend not only on the

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.850
direction of the force, but on
the direction of the surface

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.070
on which it acts.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.870
Quite clear here, if I shove,
is a force density,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.040
and that's a vector.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.560
But the way in which this desk
responds to my pushing on it

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.590
with a force vector of that
magnitude is going to depend

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.990
whether I do this, which is
going to compress it, or

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.850
whether it takes the same force
and direct it this way,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.820
which if I don't move
the thing is going

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.120
to result in a shear.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.830
So the behavior of the body will
depend on the direction

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.040
of the force per unit area
that I apply, and the

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.340
direction of the surface
on which I apply it.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.080
In this case, that would
be the surface ABC.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.962
Yes, sir?

00:16:15.962 --> 00:16:20.390
AUDIENCE: You say that the force
density is not parallel

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.850
to the normal of the surface?

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.834
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:28.262
AUDIENCE: So when you do the
ratio of [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:28.262 --> 00:16:31.214
isn't it supposed to
be [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.214 --> 00:16:35.642
of the normal to the
[INAUDIBLE] and X1?

00:16:35.642 --> 00:16:36.626
PROFESSOR: Another way
of defining it.

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:41.030
This is a vector, and what I'm
doing is splitting that vector

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:46.210
up into three internal forces
that act on surfaces whose

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.360
normal are here.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.745
So actually, what I'm going to
do is to take the way in which

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:55.390
the internal force
pushes back.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.710
I see, that's what's
confusing.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:03.790
If the force that I'm putting on
the body, I didn't mean to

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.230
indicate any particular
direction, but if this

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.390
component of K points in this
direction, this force that

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.776
balances it has to go in
the opposite direction.

00:17:13.776 --> 00:17:17.881
AUDIENCE: So you're saying that
there were surface ABC is

00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:20.769
defined as normal to K?

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:23.474
PROFESSOR: ABC is not normal.

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:23.930
No.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:31.700
ABC is not normal to K. All I'm
saying is that it if it

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.920
were normal to K, then the
balancing force would be just

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:41.620
a function of this orientation
of the surface.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.160
But if I allow this to be a
general force per unit area,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.050
then the balancing force on
the inside depends on the

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:57.892
angle between K and the angle
between this internal surface.

00:17:57.892 --> 00:18:04.794
AUDIENCE: I don't see the
relation between K and the

00:18:04.794 --> 00:18:06.766
ratio between other ends.

00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:08.738
BOC and ABC [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:19.091 --> 00:18:19.945
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:22.600
The reason that there are three
areas, is that what's

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.080
troubling you?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.500
Because I'm really now splitting
the balancing force

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.830
up into a force per unit area
on this surface, and a force

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.160
per unit area on this surface,
and a force per unit area on

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.580
this surface.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.310
And that's so that I can look at
these different components

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:44.400
of resistance in terms of
a Cartesian system.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.130
Clear that the ratio of these
two areas does go as the--

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.080
I erased it now, that is
going to go as the--

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.280
This is A prime, and this is the
original A, the relation

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.260
between those areas is
given by the cosine

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.222
of this angle phi.

00:19:05.222 --> 00:19:09.120
If I [INAUDIBLE] this down in
this projection, and this is

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.200
the area of A.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.110
This is the direction of the
normal to the surface ABC.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:17.940
And I'm going to let this be the
direction of the normal to

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.670
one of the internal surfaces,
and these internal surfaces

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:26.908
are going to have as their
normal either X1, X2, or X3.

00:19:26.908 --> 00:19:28.158
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:30.812 --> 00:19:33.740
between the normal
to ABC and X1.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.010
PROFESSOR: And X1, yes.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.650
And that's what I'm saying its,
and that is going to be

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.530
the same thing.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.910
As the cosine of that angle is
just going to be the direction

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:48.105
cosine of the normal to ABC
relative to X1, X2, X3.

00:19:48.105 --> 00:19:49.560
OK?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.925
AUDIENCE: So in the end,
you're saying that K is

00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:58.290
parallel to the normal of ABC?

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.260
PROFESSOR: No, I'm not.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.510
No, I'm not.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.020
This is a relation between
the areas.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.920
And these are the
forces acting on

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.740
those internal surfaces.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.550
And I'm saying there are three
of them, and those three

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.100
components that are all acting
in the X1 direction will

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.360
depend on the ratio
of these areas.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.220
The ratio of this area is
the cosine of the angle

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:39.910
between X1 and K. OK.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.294
This you're OK with?

00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:43.208
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:52.020
And what I'm saying now is that
there is acting on this

00:20:52.020 --> 00:21:00.380
internal surface something
that has to balance the

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:07.380
component of K, which points
in the direction of X1.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.950
And the component of K before
we divided out the area, the

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.860
component of K1 times the area
gave me the net force.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.620
So this K1 now is a force per
unit area, the component of K

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.740
per unit area that points
along the X1 direction.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.010
Now as a force per unit area I
multiply it by an area that

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.550
gave me force.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.110
There are three forces
internally that balance this

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.650
force, and they all act
in the X1 direction.

00:21:37.578 --> 00:21:39.042
AUDIENCE: You're just
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:43.434 --> 00:21:47.826
Shouldn't it be the cosine of
the angle between the normals

00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:49.790
of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:50.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.710
That's what I'm saying here.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:59.040
That for X, for this surface,
yeah, that's what I'm saying.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.060
One of these surfaces here, if
we look at the first term,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:07.540
this is the direction of X1, and
the force here will be the

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:15.100
force along K. And if I take
this force and put it down in

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.450
X1, this is going to be
the force times the

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.520
cosine of the angle.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.245
And the two areas are going to
go as the cosine of the angle.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.042
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:31.042 --> 00:22:33.010
cosine of the normal
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.970
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.180
This is indeed the ratio between
the internal area and

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.430
the external area.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.790
Since the internal area has a
normal that's either X1, X2,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.640
or X3 the angle between the
normal to these internal

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:03.920
surfaces and K is going to be
the direction cosine of K.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:09.210
I suggest since we're getting
out of time quickly we either

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:13.530
resolve this after the
end of class or leave

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.050
it until next time.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.790
That's a bad note on
which to end, too.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:23.115
The point I want to leave, still
subject to resolution

00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:30.390
and debate is that the
coefficient sigma IJ I would

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:36.750
like to claim relate
to vectors.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:43.730
One is the direction of the
external surface, and if it

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:49.400
relates to vectors, then this
set of coefficients qualifies

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.912
as a second rank tensor.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.890
And if you accept that, however
grudgingly, everything

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:04.400
that we've said about second
rank tensors holds for the

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.985
quantity sigma IJ, which are
called the elements of stress.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.100
In particular, we can talk
about a stress quadrant.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.920
We can talk about the
value of a stress in

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.170
a particular direction.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.480
If we have a stress tensor in
which show all the terms are

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.425
non-0, it can be diagonalized.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:09.890
We can also say that if the
crystal has symmetry, for

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:16.550
example, if the crystal is
cubic, you can say that the

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.000
form of a second rank
tensor for a cubic

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.610
crystal has to be diagonal.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.770
And these diagonal elements
represent compressive

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:33.240
stresses, so you can say that
you can only subject a cubic

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.648
crystal to compressive stress.

00:25:36.648 --> 00:25:39.340
On the other hand, if the
crystal is a triclinic

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.020
crystal, you can say that
there's a sigma 11, there's a

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:53.000
sigma 12, a sigma 13, a sigma
21, a sigma 22, sigma 23,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.980
sigma 31, sigma 32, sigma 33.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.820
So for a triclinic crystal,
there appear to be nine

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.940
elements, but next time we will
show that the nature of

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.660
stress is the body has to be in
equilibrium requires that

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.360
the stress tensor be by
definition symmetric if

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.350
there's to be no net couple
to force on it.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.904
Going to buy this?

00:26:21.904 --> 00:26:24.640
You didn't buy the things that
I said that perhaps were

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.020
slightly incorrect.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.040
This is massively incorrect.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:28.787
Jason?

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:33.657
AUDIENCE: You can rotate a cubic
crystal [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:33.657 --> 00:26:34.144
PROFESSOR: No.

00:26:34.144 --> 00:26:37.066
Because say a tensor
of this form acts

00:26:37.066 --> 00:26:39.014
just like the scalar.

00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:42.790
Just like a cubic crystal, you
don't suddenly get off

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.575
diagonal properties
if you transfer it

00:26:44.575 --> 00:26:47.580
to a different axis.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.480
So unless you tell me what's
wrong here, I'm going to leave

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.630
this on your plate
until next week.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.450
And I don't want you fretting
over the weekend.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:04.820
This is clearly nonsense, and
it is a contradiction that

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.130
arises only if you carry too
much of what we've been doing

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.800
for the last month with you into
a discussion of stress

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.950
and strain.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:17.282
Stress is something that you
impose on a crystal.

00:27:17.282 --> 00:27:20.600
It has nothing to do with what
kind of crystal it is and

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.270
what's going on in the interior
of the crystal.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:27.010
There may be constraints on the
coefficients that relate

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.740
stress and strains, and
there surely are.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.470
But I can take a cubic crystal,
and I can squeeze it,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.810
and I can twist it and share
it anyway I like.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.370
So this is an important
distinction between the

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.900
tensors that represent physical
properties, which

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.950
we've been discussing
up to this point.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:51.090
And the properties such as
conductivity, diffusivity,

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.310
susceptibility and so on and
all their many varieties,

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.530
these are something
which we'll refer

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:57.780
to as property tensors.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.290
And they are tensors
demonstrably, but they are

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.250
tensors which describe
the physical

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.080
behavior of a crystal.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.905
Nye uses a term that I don't
think is self explanatory, so

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:18.700
I don't care for it.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.580
He calls these field tensors.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.470
That sounds like some
description of a corn patch

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.970
that requires a tensor.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.670
But no.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.530
We probably don't really
think of what we mean

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.530
when we say a field.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.380
When we say an electric field,
you think of an e-vector.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.560
You think of a vector.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.520
But what a field is is just a
set of coordinates, XYZ, and

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.820
that describes an area
or a volume.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:54.340
And just like the things that
corn grow in are referred to

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.860
as corn fields, it's an area
that has corn on a lattice

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.980
very often also.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.460
So a field is just a set of
coordinates in space to which

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.310
a value of something
is a sign.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.430
So if we have an electric field,
and we express that

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.480
electric field as a function
of X, Y, and Z, that is a

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.090
field of vectors.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.540
If we take something that
has intrinsically, that

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.650
intrinsically needs to be
described as a tensor, then we

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:28.000
have to every point in space XYZ
a tensor sigma IJ, whose

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.610
value and whose components
value vary with position

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.700
within the space.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:38.810
So talking about the field as
assigning values of something

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:44.760
to every coordinate in the space
that could be a tensor.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.370
What we refer to as an electric
field really is a

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:48.430
field vector.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.790
So that's Nye's term, but the
fact that it took me three

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.220
minutes to explain why he uses
it explains as well why I

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.090
don't care for it.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.880
So we'll talk about these
as property tensors.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.040
And property tensors are
something that's

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.000
innate to the material.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.550
Something like stress, strain,
and other second rank tensors

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:18.110
are external stimuli, just
like an electric field.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:23.510
And they have value that is
imposed on the crystal, and

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:28.000
the stress field is defined
as a function of position.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So that's the distinction
between a property tensor,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.690
which is subject to symmetry
constraints, and a tensor that

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.390
represents a stimulus, an
external stimulus applied to

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.320
the crystal, and it's defined
as a function of position.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.360
And that is a field tensor.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.940
OK, so that's the difference.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.640
Since this is something that's
imposed externally, it can

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.760
have any form of the tensor
that you wish to oppose.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.300
And there are no symmetry
restrictions on it.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.760
The only restriction is, as
we'll show next time, that it

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:02.401
must be symmetric if the body
is to be in equilibrium.

00:31:05.287 --> 00:31:05.770
All right.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.540
It is time to quit, and
that I think is a good

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.490
place to leave things.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.100
And we'll say more about
stress next time.
