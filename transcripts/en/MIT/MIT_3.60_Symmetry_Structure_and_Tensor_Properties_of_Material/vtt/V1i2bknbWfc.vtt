00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.350
PROFESSOR: The final quiz is
scheduled for a week from

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.330
today, on December 8.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.230
Following that weekend, we'll
have one class on the 13th.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.950
And the last days of classes
are Monday, Tuesday, and

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.110
Wednesday, the 12th,
13th, and 14th.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.030
So I know a number of you spoke
up last time and said

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.840
that you have a conflict on
Thursday, the eighth, with a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.250
quiz in another class.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910
So could I see a show of hands
again of how many of you have

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.080
this conflict?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.260
So three, six people, seven
people, you're going to enroll

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.475
in the other course just
so you can put

00:00:56.475 --> 00:00:57.725
off taking the quiz.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.730
That's unfortunate, I don't
think anybody should have to

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.590
take two quizzes in one day.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.940
We can't move it up.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.430
We'll have to move it back.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.670
So I don't know if I am
violating any Institute rule,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.200
but I know that it is strictly
illegal to give assignments

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090
that are due after the last day
of classes, let alone have

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.180
a quiz after the last day of
classes, which has not been

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.000
previously scheduled as
a final examination.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.560
So we can't give it after
Wednesday, the 14th, the last

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.680
day of classes.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.700
So, do any of the six impacted
people have a strong

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.975
preference for when we should
schedule the quiz?

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.200
AUDIENCE: Monday?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.790
PROFESSOR: Due it Monday?

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.050
It doesn't have to
be that soon.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.470
Monday?

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.860
AUDIENCE: Why not Tuesday?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.190
PROFESSOR: Because Tuesday
we have a class.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.480
AUDIENCE: Or Wednesday?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.352
Well we would have a Thursday
class instead.

00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:57.220
Correct?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.610
PROFESSOR: No.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940
If we're doing it after
the quiz next

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.100
week, there's a class.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310
We have a last meeting
here on the 13th.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.210
And I'm not going to shift
it for other people,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.460
just for the impacted.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.260
So of the six who are entitled
to vote, how many would prefer

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.320
to have it Monday, the 12th?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.230
Three and I know how it's
going to turn out.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.570
And for Wednesday, the 14th?

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.820
Three.

00:02:36.412 --> 00:02:39.014
AUDIENCE: I can't take the test
because-- not because of

00:02:39.014 --> 00:02:39.828
another test--

00:02:39.828 --> 00:02:40.316
I'm out of town.

00:02:40.316 --> 00:02:41.780
And I might come
back Saturday.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.684
And Monday is just a little
quick to take it

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:46.934
after we get back.

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:54.020
PROFESSOR: I think I'm going to
have to make an executive--

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.841
yes

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.146
AUDIENCE: Professor, when you
mean by conflict, do you mean

00:02:57.146 --> 00:02:59.090
having an exam at
the exact time?

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.690
PROFESSOR: No, it's on
the exact same day.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.760
Considering this is a two hour
examination, to have another

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.620
examination exactly the same
day, if you're not brain dead

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.420
after an hour or two, you will
be pretty close to it.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.840
So I think that is an unfair
penalty to pay.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.230
I think, to keep it as close as
possible to the quiz that

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.330
the rest of the people will be
taking, why don't we make it--

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.170
since it's a tie vote--
on Monday, the 12th.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.380
Do it sooner, rather
than later.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.000
And I'll let you know next time
of where we will hold it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.930
I'll have to arrange
a room for it.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.480
So that will not be
a make-up quiz.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.220
It would be a made-up--

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.980
invented--

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.230
quiz.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.150
And, as I say on Monday, I
should have all of the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.960
homework and the previous
quiz to return to you.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.620
Reason you don't have it now
is all the little crabbed

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.450
handwriting that you see before
you in the form of

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.470
these notes, which
takes forever.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.120
All right, so since we've
satisfied the unpleasant

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.839
aspects of the end of the
term, let's get back to

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.390
discussing some of the other
piezoelectric effects that we

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.500
have defined.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.850
And then also ask the question
rhetorically, is there

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.660
anything like a representation
surface for a third-ranked

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.290
tensor property?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.110
And it doesn't look promising.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.500
But there are some things that
we can do to discuss variation

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.590
of properties with direction,
and we'll see

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.980
directly what those are.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.230
But first let's look at the
converse piezoelectric effect.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.860
And this again is a third-ranked
tensor property,

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.077
but what we do is to have the
elements of strain, epsilon

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:09.350
ij, a second-ranked tensor.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.190
And to take advantage of this
curious relation between the

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.540
directed converse effects,
we define the converse

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.330
piezoelectric effect as giving
you nine elements of strain in

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.210
terms of a third-ranked tensor
dijk times e sub i.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.660
So what is not standard is our
convention for the order of

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.260
the subscripts on the moduli.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.420
And we make up the rules, we
can do it any way we like.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.640
And the advantage of defining
it this way, in nonstandard

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.710
tensor notation, is that we can
use the same coefficients

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.616
for both the direct and
the converse effects.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:54.030
So let me-- to illustrate what
these equations look like--

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.270
write out a few examples.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:07.026
Epsilon 11 would be d1jk
times e sub 1.

00:06:07.026 --> 00:06:09.980
I'm writing it in simple
fashion, and not expanding

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.830
fully, just to save
space and time.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:24.820
Epsilon 22 would be
d2jk times e2.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:33.760
Epsilon 33 will be d3jk
times epsilon 3.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.210
And let me stop after these six
terms, and write, at least

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.770
for these, an expansion.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.040
Because this gives us some
interesting information.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.820
I'm not doing the equal
signs in here.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.920
So this would say that the
element of strain epsilon 11

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:08.990
is d111 times e1 plus d112 times
e2 plus d113 times e3.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.270
And I want to say this is 11k.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.180
And I want to say that
this is 22k.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.610
The next term would be epsilon
22, and that would be d122

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:35.850
times epsilon 2 plus d212.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.802
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
2's be balanced?

00:07:37.802 --> 00:07:38.290
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.760
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
that be d2's?

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're right.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:52.530
This should be epsilon jk equals
dijk times e sub i.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.270
So this is all e1.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.940
This is e1.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.760
And this one goes
with this one.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.230
This 2 goes with this one.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.580
You're right.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.710
d2 and this is the
d311 times e11.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:18.520
This would be 122 times
e1 plus 222 times e2

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:26.830
plus d322 times e3.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:33.590
And the fourth one would be e33
equals d133 times e1 plus

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:43.679
d233 times e2 plus
d333 times e3.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:52.760
OK, these elements here are the
three that appear in the

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.930
box that I had indicated
for the terms djk.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.410
When we write the direct
piezoelectric effect, this

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.190
would be the box of
coefficients.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.290
When we write the converse
effect, this is the box of

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.650
coefficients.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.550
And now what I wanted to point
out is that delta v over v is

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.610
equal to episilon 11 plus
epsilon 22 plus epsilon 33,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.210
which is the trace of
the strain tensor.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.400
And we're going to get one set
of terms which depends on the

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.290
x1 component of the field,
another set of three terms

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.025
that depend on the x2 component
of the field, and

00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:38.650
another one on the
x3 component.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.230
If these expressions sum
to 0, then there would

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.770
be no volume change.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.320
So this first set of 3--

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.070
3 of the first 6 equations--

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.270
give you an indication of when
the application of a field

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.270
will result in no volume
change in the sample.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.300
And that again, I remind you,
can be for two reasons.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.180
It could be because all of
these six of the nine

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.430
piezoelectric moduli are 0.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.720
Or alternatively, if you
examined the form of the

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.750
piezoelectric moduli matrices
that is required by symmetry

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.880
constraints, you'll find that
there are a substantial number

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.750
of point groups for which
some terms are 0.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.870
But then there is, in addition,
an equality between

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.840
some of the other terms, which
make the volume change zero.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:42.250
Even though, not all of the
elements within this 1/2 box

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.270
of moduli are zero.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.410
So that is an interesting
effect.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.970
And it turns out that
the majority of the

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.580
non-centrosymmetric point groups
do not have a volume

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.730
change, when you apply in a
field in any way you choose.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.720
A few do, but it's a minority.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.920
Alright, but this is not the
main point of writing this.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.900
I want to--

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.170
at this point--

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.190
point out that this tells you
about the volume change.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.330
And then we would have
additional terms, we would

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:33.740
have a term of the form e1
something like e123 or e132.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.350
And this would be e14.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.710
This would also be e14 since
we replace both of those

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.260
subscripts by a single
subscript.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.220
And the tensor elements
that would go in

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:52.430
here would be d123.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.000
We just want one of the them.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:09.300
d123 times e1, and then we want
d223 times e2, and then

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.520
d323 times e3.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.940
We're writing one of the
specific equations for the

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.500
shear strings.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.600
If we write the expression for
d132, this is going to be d132

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:42.400
times e1 plus d232 times
e2 plus d332 times e3.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.690
There are two interesting
consequences of this.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:55.060
The strain tensor
is symmetric.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.130
And this element of strain--

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.360
why have I got three
subscripts in here?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.840
Don't want that one in there.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.570
These two strains are equal.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:15.710
And therefore, if we would apply
just an e1 for example,

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:21.980
let e be equal to just a
component of field along x1.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.760
The strains have to be equal.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.690
But we have two different
tensor elements here.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.460
And the only way that strain
can be symmetric, and it's

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:41.460
defined as such, is that d123
be identical to d132.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.220
And that resolves the issue
that came up in connection

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.080
with the direct case
electric effect.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.480
We said the direct piezoelectric
effect depends

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:53.850
just on the sum of the elements
dijk and dikj.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.610
And since they're lumped
together, all we can measure

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:58.740
is the sum.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.160
And, so, we'll just have
to call that a

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.080
single matrix element.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.540
The converse piezoelectric
effect tells us these tensor

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.200
elements have to be equal,
if the strain

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.450
tensor is to be symmetric.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:26.260
So that says that, since we
defined d16 as the sum of d123

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:39.650
plus d132, this says that d132
is equal to d123 is equal to

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:47.030
1/2 of d16, just making
the equality

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.020
in the reverse direction.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:55.860
The converse effect let's us
say that 123 has to be 132,

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.210
that any ijk has to be
equal to a dijk.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.880
So if I tried now to write this
first expression in the

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:20.230
reduced subscript notation,
e23 is what we let e5 be.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:26.510
And now we have this equal to
and in our reduced subscripts,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.370
we have this as 1/2 of d16.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.150
And the field that's
multiplying this is

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.480
piezoelectric modulus is e1.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.470
And that messy factor of 2 has
come back to haunt us again.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.955
It's like trying to stuff
a jack-in-the

00:15:46.955 --> 00:15:48.530
box back in the box.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.810
It keeps popping up.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:56.550
We ate the factor of 2 in
defining the matrix

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.050
representation of the

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.280
piezoelectric electric modulus.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.920
And now when we try to go to a
reduced subscript notation for

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.210
the converse piezoelectric
effect, we've

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.780
got a 1/2 in there.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.370
And similarly, the second
equation would be e5--

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.670
same result epsilon 5--

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:22.050
and it's 132, but 132 is
1/2 of d16 times e1.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:33.000
And we have a similar mess for
the other coefficients here.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.230
So what do we do?

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:46.800
Do we say that the relation
between strain epsilon j

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:54.820
equals dij e sub j has 1/2 in
front of several of the

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.330
coefficients and
not in others?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.670
Well, we can't really absorb
the factor of 2 in the

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.079
definition of the piezoelectric
moduli, because

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.819
we've already done that.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:11.160
So the only thing we can do is
to say that we will have to

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.710
take the off diagonal strains,
and define them as having a

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.730
1/2 in front, and
we add these up.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.720
So we will have to write matrix
strain in this reduced

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.770
subscript notation.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.560
We'll have to take e11, epsilon
12, epsilon 13,

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:45.250
epsilon 21, epsilon 22, epsilon
23, epsilon 31,

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:50.790
epsilon 32, and epsilon 33.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.490
And in converting this to matrix
form, we'll call this

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.110
epsilon 1, analogous
to what we did

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.710
for the tensile stresses.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.980
We'll call this epsilon
2 and this epsilon 3.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.960
And then for all of the
off-diagonal elements of

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.250
strain, in order to avoid the
factor of 2 popping up in

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.890
front of the matrix
representation of the

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.280
piezoelectric moduli, we're
going to have to put in here

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:23.867
1/2 of epsilon 4, 1/2 of epsilon
5, and 1/2 of epsilon

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:28.050
6, and same for the off diagonal
terms 1/2 of epsilon

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:33.035
5, 1/2 of epsilon 4, and
1/2 of epsilon 6.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.340
So the moral of this story is
that you can't win, but if you

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.410
play it right, you can
come out even.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:49.060
So only if we define the reduced
subscript strains in

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.510
this fashion, can we write an
expression of this form.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.370
So this algebra is carried
through for you for the other

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.890
elements in the notes.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:15.080
But this is the way we are
forced, unless we want to have

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.620
a factor of 2 in some terms, and
not in others, is the way

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.830
we have to define
matrix strain.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.850
All this is formalism and
definition, but I'd like to

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.110
now do two things.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.240
First of all, give you some
examples of real numbers for

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.390
piezoelectric moduli, and then
ask the question about

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.765
representation surfaces.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.170
Once again, these numbers are in
the handout for you, so you

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.010
don't have to make
note of them.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:58.280
But one of the very important
piezoelectric materials is the

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.020
quartz form of SiO2.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.160
SiO2 has many polymorphic
forms.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.820
Quartz is the form that's stable
at room temperature,

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:25.080
and it has point group
32 asymmetric.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.640
And there are higher
temperature

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.820
polymorphs of SiO2.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.090
There's a phase transition in
quartz to a more symmetric

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.550
form, and then there are cubic
forms at the highest

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.800
temperatures.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:45.970
Now, quartz is not the material
that displays the

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.750
largest piezoelectric moduli.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.210
But it has the following
advantages.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.020
One is it is a naturally
occurring material that is

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.510
very inexpensive.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.260
So it's not an exotic
expensive material.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.260
Very stable.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.360
It's not water soluble.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.620
Extremely tough.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.620
You can take a thin wafer of
quartz, for example, if you

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.550
want to make a monochromator for
a diffraction experiment.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.550
You can take a thin wafer of
quartz, and bend it like this,

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:17.910
and it does not break,
very elastic.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.240
And if you want a material
that's going to earn its

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.130
living by being squished, you
want something that doesn't

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.480
plastically deform and something
that is very hard

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.300
and resistant to stress.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.070
So quartz, even though the
moduli are not the largest, is

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.840
a very attractive material,
and is used in

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.730
a variety of devices.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.760
There was a time when CB radios

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.260
were very, very popular.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.290
Everybody had to have
one in their car.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.990
I guess so they could pretend
that they were truck drivers.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.550
But anyway, you don't have
them anymore now that

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.690
cellphones have come
in in existence.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.310
But for your CB radio,
you needed

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.150
something called a crystal.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.000
And they were fairly
expensive.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.020
And the number of channels on
which you could communicate

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.870
dependent on the number of
crystals that you could plug

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.090
into your CB radio.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:17.820
The so-called crystal
was exactly that.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.550
It was a little black box that
looked almost like a

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.360
transistor.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.180
And there were two leads
coming out of it.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.300
If you ever got curious and
broke this thing open, what

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.120
you found was a nice
wafer of quartz.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.500
And on the wafer of quartz--
brazed onto it--

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.470
were two wires.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.040
And that's all there
was in the box.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.240
The crystal really
was a crystal.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.580
And the crystals had been
very precisely ground to

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.720
thicknesses such that when a
field caused these wafers to

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:51.210
hit a resonance, that resonance
would be at exactly

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.430
a particular frequency.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.170
And that was the frequency
of that channel.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:03.610
One of the crises, during the
Second World War, is that the

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:08.070
highest quality natural crystals
of quartz come from

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:15.220
Brazil, and during the conflict
the sea channels were

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.380
essentially blocked.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.650
And so, people-- in order
to make all these

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.240
communication devices--

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.370
had to learn how to synthesize
crystals of quartz

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.790
synthetically.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.420
And there are a number of
companies, such as Sylvania up

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.210
on the North Shore, that
developed entire buildings

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.680
devoted to growing single
crystals of quartz.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.040
And they're big tanks like
something out of the aquarium.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.940
And in the center of the tank is
a rod, and seeds of quartz

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.980
are placed on the rod.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.880
And the thing very
slowly rotates

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.510
around in this solution.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.770
And on the rod, eventually, are
single crystals of quartz

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.620
that are this size.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.290
And its a very spectacular
thing to see.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.270
In any case, symmetry
3 2, and the moduli

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.370
that are 0 and non-zero.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:12.000
If we refer the reference axes
to a set of coordinates with

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.150
x1 in this direction, and x2--

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.960
since it has to be orthogonal
to x1-- in between the

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.360
two-fold axes, and x3.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:30.130
And for all materials of
commerce that are anisotropic,

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.070
there has to be some standard
for defining

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.330
the choice of axes.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.820
For example, crystallographers
would say the unique axis

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:42.090
should be along the z direction,
the x3 direction.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:46.490
But why isn't x1 and x2 in
between the two-fold axis?

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.640
There's some professional
society that is responsible

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.500
for giving standards for
representing property

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.930
measurements in some mutually
agreed upon form.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.550
And this is the standard set
of axes for the quartz and

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.200
symmetry 3, 2.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:10.610
The moduli, dij, not dijk, but
dij, these two are constrained

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.940
to be equal.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.860
This one is 0.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:28.509
This is minus 0.67, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0.67, 4.6, 0, 0, 0,

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:30.994
0, 0, 0, 0.

00:25:30.994 --> 00:25:35.340
One of the strange materials
for which no field

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:41.450
can create a strain--

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.810
field along x3 cannot
create a strain.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:48.570
And these are all in units of
10 to the minus 12 coulombs

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.890
per Newton.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:57.860
An example they give you here,
if you apply a field of 100

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.110
volts per centimeter, which is
not terribly large, but would

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.950
be comparable to what
you have in some

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.140
electronic device, perhaps.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:12.040
So this, since our units are
MKS, this would correspond to

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.370
10 to the 4 volts per meter.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.810
The strain epsilon 1, which
is d11 times e1.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:28.510
It turns out to be minus 2.3,
which means it contracts.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:35.580
That's the significance of the
negative times 10 to the 4.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.310
And that turns out to be
10 to the minus 12

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.560
times 10 to the fourth.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:49.900
That turns out to be a strain
of minus 2.3 times 10 to the

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.900
minus eighth.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.800
10 to the minus eighth is not
exactly a large point strain.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.550
You're not going to see the
crystal wafer twitch and jump,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.210
if you apply a field
of 100 volts on it.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.450
But yet, even a strain of
this sort is more than

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.660
enough to be useful.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.540
But this is just to illustrate
that quartz is not the most

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:21.495
sensitive of piezoelectric
materials.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:31.660
Another one that I give you
data for is so-called ADP.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.360
And this is a widely
used material.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.665
This is ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.780
And this is one of the family of
salts that have very large

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.420
piezoelectric responses.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.180
The nice part about it is that
it's water soluble, so you can

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.640
grow very, very large crystals
easily from solution.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.040
The nasty part about it is that
it is water soluble, so

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.230
you have to be careful to
protect this material from

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.990
moisture if you're going to use
it in any sort of device.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:21.180
But if we look at the moduli,
relative to the standard axes,

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.720
and this has point
group 4-bar 2m.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.655
So x3 is taken along
the 4-bar access.

00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:35.010
Then there are two-fold axes
and orientations like this.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:41.280
And since they are orthogonal,
you can take both x1 and x2

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.260
along the two-fold axes.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:54.264
And the numbers here for dij,
are 0, 0, 0, 1.7, 0, 0, 0, 0,

00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:57.350
0, 0, 1.7, 0.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:01.140
This is one of the interesting
tensors where there's a

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.930
diagonal row of non-zero terms
off on the right hand side.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.170
And finally, the big surprise
is the third

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.540
modulus this is 51.7.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.690
So you can see this has
a very strong effect.

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.070
This is over 10 times
the maximum

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.270
piezoelectric modulus in quartz.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:23.040
So this is a material that's
very commonly used in

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.340
transducers.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.704
This is again times ten to the
minus 12 coulombs per Newton.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.480
One of the very, very exciting
developments in recent years

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:43.000
is a class of materials
that are perovskites.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.435
And they are very, very new.

00:29:46.435 --> 00:29:48.710
I gave you the reference to
the first one that was

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.970
reported, and that was just
in the spring of 2000.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.540
And these are perovskites.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:03.090
Perovskites are materials that
in the type form are cubic.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.840
But depending on composition
and temperature, they can

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.530
transform to a distorted version
of this very simple

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.890
cubic structure that
is tetragonal.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:17.480
And this material can exhibit
piezoelectric effects.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:21.050
And whether it distorts or not
depends on the relative sizes

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.840
of what goes into
the perovskite.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:28.800
Perovskite has a composition
ABO3 like barium titanate is

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.050
one example.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.410
And the material has two
different cations.

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.750
And they have different
valences so they have

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.560
different sizes.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.720
And I won't bother to describe
the structure, but it is only

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:56.940
a very restricted locus in the
field RA versus RB, where both

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.670
the A and the B can remain in
contact with the oxygen

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.445
without distortion.

00:31:01.445 --> 00:31:04.680
And it turns out to be a line
that does something like that.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.250
Any other perovskite-- and there
are lots of them in this

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.260
field of radii--

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.990
has to have one of the ion
sort of flopping around.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.390
And if that gets too serious,
the structure distorts so that

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.330
all these ions can remain in
contact with the oxygen.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.130
OK in order to do that,
many of them distort

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.710
to tetragonal forms.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.840
Others distort to super
structures, which have very,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.940
very large unit cells.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:35.880
But in any case, when you're
right at the phase boundary

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.460
between the distorted structure
and the true

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.340
perovskite structure, these
materials sometimes have very,

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.220
very complicated x solutions of
the two phases, on a very

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.850
sort of fine scale.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:53.480
And it's not known exactly why
they have this property.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:59.000
But they have absolutely
enormous piezoelectric moduli,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.620
very close to this
phase boundary.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.590
And the references that I give
you-- here-- is a compound

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:11.540
that is a lead titanium
zinc niobate.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.610
And the complicated composition
is to get you

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.340
close to this phase boundary.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:29.380
This has a d333 that is greater
than 2,000 picocuries

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:30.650
per Newton.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:39.960
And pico is 10 to
the minus 12.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:48.510
So this is a piezoelectric
electric modulus that is 10 to

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.435
the 3 times d11 for quartz.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.430
So 3 orders of magnitude
stronger than this very

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.340
commonly used piezoelectric
material.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:12.390
Some of these materials have
strains getting close to 1%.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.630
So this is something that will
actually twitch on the lab

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.900
bench, when you apply
a field to it.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.450
So these are entirely new.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.040
People still don't know the
origin of this behavior.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.720
And it's still under
considerable study.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.120
So this is a new family
of materials.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.850
It's very exciting, and
undergoing a lot of

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.940
investigation and development
work at the moment.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.100
Alright, we are almost
out of time.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.910
Time goes fast when
you're having fun.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.740
Let me raise the question that
we'll consider next time,

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.780
which will be one of
our last lectures.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:34:00.000
And that is, is it possible to
create representation surfaces

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.300
that tell you how the
piezoelectric properties of a

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.300
particular material will
vary with direction?

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.219
Well, vary with what?

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:13.110
Well, we talk about the direct
piezoelectric effect.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:18.770
This gives us components of--

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.489
well let's look at the
simpler one, in

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:25.449
terms of what we apply.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.929
We have the converse
piezoelectric effect that says

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:36.290
that epsilon ijk is going to
be dijk times e sub i.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.710
So we've got a piece of
material, and we apply a

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.915
field, e sub i.

00:34:46.915 --> 00:34:50.780
So we can vary this in space
relative to a coordinate

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.646
system x1, x2, x3.

00:34:54.646 --> 00:34:57.575
But how in the world are we
going to show what happens?

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.720
So I always do an extra
thing in here.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.540
There are 9 components
to the strain

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.370
tensor, which is symmetric.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.865
So they're really six responses
that are unique.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.210
So yes, we can define
the direction

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.600
of the applied field.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.070
But they're going to be
6 different strains.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.910
So we're going to need six
representation surfaces.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:45.320
One for each of the three
tensile strains, and one for

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.510
each of the three
shear strains.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.060
So you can't do it with
a single surface.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:58.050
So you can't do much other than
say, there are certain

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:05.220
responses which are intended
to emphasize one particular

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:12.400
sort of strain or one
particular sort of

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.040
polarization.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:18.060
So one of the things we might do
is to cut a very thin plate

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.700
of something like quartz,
and subject it

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:25.010
to a uniaxial stress.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.050
So let's say sigma along
the x3 axis.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:31.860
So we're looking at a very
restricted strain tensor.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.530
That's 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 0, sigma 3.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.710
And in response to that strain,
there are going to be

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.320
three different components
of the polarization.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.740
Polarization is manifested as
a charge per unit area.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.310
So if we make a very
thin plate--

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:56.610
to be sure there will
be charges induced

00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:00.580
on these thin edges--

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:04.790
but if it's got a surface area
that's a large compared to the

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.110
area of these thin edges, we
are going to be measuring

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.200
primarily p3--

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.160
the component of polarization
that's

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.970
normal to this surface--

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:20.070
and that might have a charge
per unit area that is

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.880
comparable to these other
two charged surfaces.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:28.120
But because the area by design
of our specimen is so large,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.650
the response that would be most
easy to detect, and which

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:38.280
would be the largest response,
by design, would be p3, which

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.620
is the charge per unit
area on this surface.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.420
So this is an effect we can
define for a particular

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.370
sample, and for a particular
special form of the

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:53.290
generalized force.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:59.940
And we then can ask, what is
the value of the single

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.180
modulus that relates
p3 to sigma 3?

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.970
And that's a question
we can ask.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:14.070
And we can plot that response as
a function of direction of

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.410
a plate that we consider as
being cut out of a single

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:23.080
crystal, and different
orientations, and then ask how

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.030
this modulus--

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.930
which connects the two--

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.900
changes with the orientation
of x3.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.050
So that is a question
we can ask.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.940
And these surfaces are
absolutely wild, highly

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.130
anisotropic, can be identically
zero in certain

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.600
special directions, and they
are very interesting, and a

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.940
lot of fun to look at.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.580
So we'll take a quick look at a
couple of those, which won't

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.690
come as a surprise because
they're already worked out for

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:50.940
you in the notes.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.520
So we'll take a look
at one of those.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.640
And in the problem set, I invite
you to amuse yourself

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.700
by looking at such
representation surfaces for

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.920
