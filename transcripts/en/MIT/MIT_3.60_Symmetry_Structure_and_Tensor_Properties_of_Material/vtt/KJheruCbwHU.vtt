00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.280
PROFESSOR: Any questions about
where we left off-- up to

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.530
where we left off?

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.700
OK, what I'll do then is give
you a few more examples of the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.750
combinations in 22 to show which
ones we have to retain

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.590
as frameworks for
crystallographic point groups

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.320
and which ones exist as groups
but which involve rotational

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.080
symmetries that are not
permitted to a lattice.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.410
So we've seen a combination of
three orthogonal twofold axes

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.500
and then projection that
would look like this.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.880
And the international symbol for
that point group is just a

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.190
running list of the different
axes that are present, 222.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.940
The next group in the sequence
would be 3 2 2, where we took

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.940
a 120 degree rotation.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.820
We combine that with a twofold
axis perpendicular to it and

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.120
the new twofold axis comes out
and reminds you again of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.520
things that are quite clear but
which are easy to forget--

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.550
that this angle here is
1/2 of 2 pi over 3.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.680
Don't forget that 1/2.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.600
So the neighboring twofold axis
is 60 degrees away and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.750
then if we allow these axes to
operate on each other, the net

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.680
symmetry consistent set of
axes looks like this.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.630
But let us look at a solid
that has this symmetry.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.350
And such a solid would
be a trigonal--

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.600
triangular prism.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.080
And again we can use the corners
of this polyhedron as

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.440
the reference locations
of our motifs.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.170
So let us put a first motif
here, number 1.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.500
Let's rotate it by 120 degrees
to get a second motif here.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.770
And then let us rotate that
one down by a twofold axis

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.950
coming out of one
of the edges.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.930
That will give us number 3 that
is down here or of the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.520
same chirality.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.630
And how do we get from 1 to
3 directly in one shot?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.240
And the answer is about a
twofold axis that comes out of

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.490
the face of the prism.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.010
So again the prism that we've
used as our reference is a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.800
prism that looks like this.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.420
We've got one twofold axis
coming out of the face.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.960
The next twofold axis is the
one that is equivalent to a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.320
threefold rotation followed
by a twofold rotation.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.500
Now here we hit a situation in
deciding on the name for the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.040
combination that is analogous
to what we found in

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.550
two-dimensional plane
groups for 3mm.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.170
We saw that only one mirror
plane was distinct.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.440
We look at this arrangement
of axes--

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.120
this was axis a, alpha,
this was axis b, beta.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.880
But if I repeat one of these
twofold axes by 120 degree

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.130
rotations, this one is the
opposite end of this one, this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.000
one is the opposite end of this
one, and this one is the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.280
opposite end of this one.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820
So there are only three kinds
of-- there are three, twofold

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.080
axes and they are related by
the 120 degree rotation.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.680
Another way of saying that is
that if we look at a trigonal

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.330
prism, each of the twofold axes
comes out of an edge and

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.490
out of the opposite face.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.560
So there they all do the same
thing in this regular prism--

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.130
twofold axes extend between
corners of the opposite face.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.330
So there are only--

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.950
there's only one kind of twofold
axis present in terms

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.790
of being symmetry independent.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.770
So just as we called 3mm, 3m,
and we call this one 3 2

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.180
because all the twofold axes
are symmetry equivalent.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.650
The next one that is
crystallographic would be a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.750
combination of a 90 degree
rotation with a pair of

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.710
twofold axes that are normal to
it and separated by 1/2 of

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.415
pi over 2, the [? throw ?]
of a fourfold axis.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.440
And the symbol for this one
would be a fourfold and now

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.380
there are two different
kinds of twofold axes.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.280
And if we look at a regular
square prism, we can again

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.070
show that what we've been
demonstrating for these other

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.750
prisms is true.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.490
One twofold axis would come
out of the face, the other

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.670
twofold axis would come out of
the midpoint of an edge, and

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.780
the fourfold axis would
come up here.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.030
And a 90 degree rotation, from
here to here, followed by a

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.320
twofold rotation about this
axis, gives us as a net

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.370
effect a 1, 2, 3.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.170
And that rotation from 1 to 3
about this twofold axis gives

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.420
us the combined mappings.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.790
Notice that the order in which
we do them is unimportant.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.500
For example we could do the
same thing but do two 180

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.670
degree rotations about
the twofold axes.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.280
Let's say we start by doing
a rotation about

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.650
this twofold axis.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.550
From here down to here.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.350
And then we do a twofold
axis about the--

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.140
twofold axis that comes out the
face and that would take

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.940
number 2, and rotate
it up to number 3.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.830
And the way we get from 1 to 3
directly is by a rotation of C

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.570
pi over 2 about the square
face of the prism.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.760
So do them in any
order you like--

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.420
two 180 degree rotations, or a
90 degree rotation, one of the

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.370
two full rotations with 90
is the other twofold--

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.260
the other type of
twofold axis.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.190
The 90 degree rotation plus the
second type of the twofold

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.230
axis is the same as the first.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.040
So the result can be permuted
and turns out to be the same

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.290
combination.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.130
The next one that we would hit
if we proceed systematically

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.500
is non-crystallographic.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.670
And this would be
a fivefold axis.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.390
And I'm foolhardy to even start
trying to sketch this in

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.640
three dimensions.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.570
Nevertheless, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.190
Start with a twofold axis out of
one of the edges and rotate

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.750
from 1 down to 2.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.710
Follow that by a twofold
rotation about the twofold

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.460
axis that comes out
of the face.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.870
And that gives us one number 3
up here, and lo and behold,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.070
the way you get from 1 to 3
directly is by a rotation

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.810
through 1/5 of 2 pi.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.410
So this would be the
non-crystallographic point

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:02.760
group, 5- well it's not
going to be 5 2 2.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.020
And that has a whole bunch
of twofold axes separated

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.020
by 1/10 of 2 pi.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.950
And just as in 3 2, twofold axes
here all come out of the

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.280
face and out of the
opposite edge.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.880
So this would be called 522.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.900
A nice symmetry but not
crystallographic, so we can

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.150
promptly forget about.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.520
So what comes out of this is a
family of groups that are all

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.500
of the form n 2 2.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.020
The crystallographic ones are
222, 32, 422 which we've

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.549
looked at in detail, and one
that I won't draw because

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.410
there's so much symmetry
it get's messy.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:53.940
This is 622.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.410
There is a Schoenflies
notation.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.590
You remember the language that
we encountered for our two

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.360
dimensional point groups.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.130
We used m for mirror in the
international notation.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.370
We used C standing for cyclic
group, subscript s standing

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.410
for Spiegel in the Schoenflies
notation.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.960
The Schoenflies notation for all
of this family of symmetry

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.990
is Dn, and the D stands
for dihedral.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.310
And the reason for that name is
that the difference between

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.640
all of these groups, besides the
n-fold axis, is this angle

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.830
between adjacent twofolds and
this is a dihedral angle.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.440
I have a set of planes passing
through a common axis; the

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.920
angle between those planes is
termed a dihedral angle.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.550
So this is called D for dihedral
and then a subscript

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.200
that gives the rank
of the axis.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.190
So Dn generically.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:05.710
This is D2, this is D3, this
is D4, and this is D6.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.270
Comments or debate?

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.038
Yes, sir.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:23.288
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.270
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.420
--out of this face.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.360
So I got from here down to the
diametrically opposed axis.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.790
And I rotate it about the
adjacent one which comes out

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.790
of an edge and--

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.120
what did I do here.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:57.085
Here I did A pi over 2 from 1
to 2, and then I did B pi,

00:10:57.085 --> 00:11:02.400
where this is B pi, and they
turned out to be C pi, which

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.090
is this one here.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.660
So going from here to here down
to number 3 is the same

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.010
as going from 1 to 3 in one
shot about a twofold axis

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.260
normal to the face.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.180
And actually I'm courageous
to try to do this in three

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.840
dimensions.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.940
We could do it in projection
and then things are used--

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.990
this for a point that's up,
and use this for a point

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.600
that's down.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.830
And then what we've done is to
go from 1 that's up, to 2

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:48.200
that's up, and then we rotate
it about this twofold axis.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.710
That was 3, that's down.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.990
So when we get into complicated
symmetries where

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.220
you just can't do a proper
job drawing them in an

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.190
orthographic drawing, we'll do
them in projection and use a

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.140
solid dot for something that's
up and an open circle for

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.390
something that's down.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.410
Is there any other way we
can combine things?

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.820
Well what you would have to do
is use these three relations,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.470
and plug and chug your way
through all of the

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.080
combinations which were
enumerated in the handout.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.020
And I'll save ourselves a lot
of work by saying that there

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.410
are only two more
combinations.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.020
And these are combinations of
axes at angles that have

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.680
relevance to directions
in a cube.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.490
One of them is a twofold axis
with a threefold axis with a

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.760
threefold rotation.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.830
Again remember these are not

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.450
equations in symmetry elements.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:56.180
This is really A pi, combined
with B 2 pi over 3, combined

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.810
with C 2 pi over 3.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.320
And the angles that fall out of
this are all crazy things

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.480
like 109 point something degrees
and they make no sense

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.130
whatsoever.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:13.300
They're not nice things like
some multiples of 2 pi, 90

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.030
degrees or 120 degrees.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:21.030
And they make no sense at all
until you refer them to

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.530
directions in a cube.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.360
And this one, 2 3 3, consists
of a twofold axis coming out

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:39.090
of the face of the cube, a 120
degree rotation, so this is B

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.000
2 pi over 3, this is A pi.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.270
And the other one, C2 pi over 3,
corresponds to a threefold

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.260
axis coming out of another
body diagonal.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.000
I don't know if I want to be
gutsy enough to try to

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.140
illustrate that that
really works.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.540
But one thing that we should do
is to let these axes go to

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.330
work on one another, and
see what comes out.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.650
First thing we can say is that
this threefold axis--

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.270
if we extend it, it comes
out of the bottom

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.360
diagonal of the cube.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.760
This one, if we extend it, will
come out of this diagonal

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.550
of the cube.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.300
So there's a threefold here,
and a threefold here.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.700
The twofold axis gives us a
threefold axis that will come

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.290
down this way.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.400
So there's a threefold axis
here and a threefold axis

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.720
coming out here.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.000
And then the twofold axis will
rotate this threefold axis

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.970
over to the remaining
pair of corners.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.940
So we have created this by
looking at a twofold rotation,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.490
combined with the threefold
axis, combined with the

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.790
rotation of another
threefold axis.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.990
But in point of fact, if you let
the twofold axis operate

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:11.620
on the threefold axis coming out
of one body diagonal, you

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.980
get threefold axes
automatically

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.340
out of all body diagonals.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.760
So this is given the
international symbol 2 3,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.900
because if you start with one
twofold axis out of a face

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.420
normal and one threefold
axis out of--

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.830
along a body diagonal, the
twofold axis, acting on that

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.150
threefold axis gives you one
along every body diagonal.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.895
And the threefold axis--

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:43.590
let me point out that a cube
standing up on its body

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.150
diagonal, with a threefold axis
coming out here and these

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.030
faces sloping down into
the blackboard.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.780
If I have a twofold axis coming
out of one face, the

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.620
threefold axis puts a twofold
axis on this face and rotates

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.510
again 120 degrees and puts a
twofold axis on this face.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.490
So the threefold axis relates
all twofold axes coming out

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.790
normal to the cubed face.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:14.630
And they were really just two
independent axes in this

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.680
combination.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.160
So 2 3 is the international
symbol-- one kind of twofold

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.730
axis, one kind of
threefold axis--

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.200
inclined at these crazy angles
that are in a cube.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:34.770
The Schoenflies notation for
this is T, and that stands for

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.020
tetrahedron.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:47.640
And let me try to convince
you that if I look at a

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.520
tetrahedron, that that is the
arrangement of pure rotation

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.070
axes in a tetrahedron.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.110
And the way to show a
tetrahedron is to

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.650
inscribe it in a cube.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:18.670
So if I connect these two faces
together and these two

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:34.970
faces together, that will define
for me a solid that has

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.910
four triangular faces.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.705
Easier to recognize it when
we put it up on one face.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.110
So this is a tetrahedron.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.540
Schoenflies symbol is T. And I
love to get to this part of

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:00.280
the semester and be at this
point at the end of the hour,

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:07.000
because if I draw a
stereographic projection of

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.730
the twofold axes, in this
symmetry, I can take a couple

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.700
of more twofold axes and add it
to this combination which

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.660
destroys the group.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.670
But lets me wish everybody a
happy Halloween and exit to a

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.020
stunned silence at the
end of the hour.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.340
So this is a nice point
group for October.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.780
There is one more and that is
the highest symmetry of all.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.420
And this is a combination
of a rotation--

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:53.200
A pi over 2, a 90 degree
rotation, with a rotation B 2

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.280
pi over 3, rotation through one
third of the circle, and

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.630
the rotation C pi.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.650
And the directions between the
axes that come out there don't

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.050
come out some multiples
of 2 pi.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.880
Again they are crazy angles
that make no sense at all

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.700
unless you refer them
to directions

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.160
that occur in a cube.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.310
The fourfold axis is in the
direction that corresponds to

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.180
the normal to a face.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.910
The twofold axis corresponds
to a direction out

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.300
of one of the edges.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.600
And the threefold axis
corresponds to a direction

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.940
that is a body diagonal.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.240
So again this is a mess.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.010
If we let those axes work on one
another however, we will

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.420
produce, more readily
appreciated in a stereographic

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:47.310
projection, fourfold axes along
the directions that

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.710
correspond to face normal.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.620
So the cube, threefold axes
coming out of the body

00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:00.060
diagonals and twofold axes in
between all of the fourfold

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:06.690
axes in directions that
correspond to the lines from

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.130
the center of the cube out
through the edges.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.650
So this is a group which
would be called 4 3 2.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.220
There's one kind of fourfold
axis related to all the others

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.570
by the other rotation axes
that are present.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.840
One kind of threefold axis that
is related to all of the

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.970
other threefold axes along the
body diagonal by other

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.720
rotation axes that
are present.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.410
And twofold axes, one kind, all
coming out of the edges.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.070
So this is the group that, in
international tables, is

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.760
called 4 3 2.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.650
And the Schoenflies notation,
this is called O. And that is

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.590
the general reaction when one
sees this lovely combination.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.980
You go ooh and O is
what it's called.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.090
But the O doesn't stand for
a gasp, it stands for an

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.340
octahedral.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.460
This is the symmetry
of an octahedron--

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.910
rotational symmetry
of an octahedron.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.290
So that's it.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:09.280
That is the bestiary of ways
in which you can combine

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.650
crystallographic rotation axes
in space about a fixed point

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.220
of intersection.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.360
And there are eleven of them.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.760
There are the axes
by themselves--

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.250
1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:29.540
There are the dihedral groups,
222, 32, 422, and 622..

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:35.690
And then the two cubic groups,
T and O. In the international

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.670
notation, I'm mixing
metaphors.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:45.970
These are 23 and 432.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:53.250
I call to your attention the
insidious similarity of the

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:59.170
two combinations of
axes, 32 and 23.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:04.740
When the 3 comes first, this
is a group of the form n22.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.190
When the 2 comes first, that
is the tetrahedral group.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:19.580
So if you count them all up,
there are 4, 2 is 6, and 5.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.945
There are eleven axial
combinations.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.450
Quite a few more than the
situation in two dimensions

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.440
where we just had single
rotation axes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:46.480
Now we have those as in two
dimensions but the dihedral

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.630
groups and the two cubic
arrangements of axes as well.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.410
So we don't have to stretch our
vocabulary too much more

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.260
to be all inclusive here.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.110
OK, comments?

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.460
Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:31.160
All right, let me indicate
the next step in outline.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.470
What we will next do is
introduce our remaining two

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.370
symmetry operations
into the picture.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.250
We have the eleven axial
combinations.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.920
As I said, we can regard these
as a framework that we can

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.210
decorate with mirror planes and
or the inversion center,

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.110
which has not appeared until
this point because inversion

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.620
is inherently a three
dimensional transformation.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.300
So what we're going to do
is to take these axial

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.450
combinations and add
another symmetry

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.240
operation to the group.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.750
And this as--

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.300
we used the term earlier,
this is an extender.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.380
We have something that
constitutes a group by itself

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.650
then we muck things up by adding
another operation.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.580
Remember in all of this we are
combining operations, not

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.880
symmetry elements.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.840
So we'll take an axial
combination and add the

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.930
reflection sigma, a reflection
operation sigma.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:52.620
Or take a rotation and combine
it with the operation of

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.930
inversion as an extender.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.710
So let's itemize the sorts of
extenders we should consider.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:08.090
And the ground rules are that
the extender should leave the

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.620
arrangement of rotation
axes invariant.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.360
Because if it doesn't, we are
going to create a rotation

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.110
operation that does not conform
to the constraints

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.270
that we used in Euler's
construction.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:33.200
So for example, if we take
222, which contains the

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:43.690
operations A pi, B pi,
C pi and identity,

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.810
that's the group 222.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:52.600
If we would add to the
arrangement 222 a mirror plane

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.850
that snaked through some
arbitrary fashion like this,

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.240
that mirror plane is going to
reproduce the twofold axis

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.970
over to here.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:07.120
And that is either going to not
constitute a group because

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.670
this twofold, this twofold, and
this twofold don't conform

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.480
to Euler's construction.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.150
Or alternatively, if we put it
in carefully at 45 degrees

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.330
with this twofold axis, we're
going to get twofold axes that

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.390
are 45 degrees apart and that's
going to change this

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.460
into a fourfold axis.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.500
So if the addition of a mirror
plane does not leave the

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.870
arrangement of rotation axes--

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.020
rotation operations--

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.050
invariant, we're either going
to get something that's

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.160
impossible and does not
constitute a group.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.660
Or else we're going to get
a combination of rotation

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.840
operations of higher symmetry
which we've already found

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.270
because we went through that
process of combination using

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.730
Euler's construction in
an exhaustive fashion.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:58.560
So the rule then is that if we
add the reflection operation

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:11.410
sigma, then the arrangement of
rotation operations must be

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.660
left invariant.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.320
OK let's look at the
single axes.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.380
If there's an n-fold axis, the
ways we can add a reflection

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:57.080
operation to that axis is to
pass the reflection operation

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.570
through the axis.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.750
And this is going to look very
much like the two dimensional

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:09.630
point groups of the form nmm
except that rather than having

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.940
a mirror line, imagine the
whole works as extending

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.430
upwards along the rotation
axis and space.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.950
So this extender is called
a vertical mirror plane.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:30.350
The other way we could add a
mirror plane to an n-fold

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:37.010
rotation axis is to put the
mirror plane in an orientation

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:40.090
that's perpendicular to
the rotation axis.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.450
That didn't exist in two
dimensions because that plane

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.240
that's perpendicular
to the axis is the

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.830
plane of our paper.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.060
And unless we wanted to have a
two-sided group that was on

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.370
both the top of the paper and
the bottom of the paper, and

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.890
we make up the rules since
it's our ball game.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.590
And that could be a group and
these would be the two-sided

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.880
plane groups, a plane
point groups, but we

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.000
didn't do that here.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.215
Adding the mirror plane, the
reflection operation sigma, in

00:29:07.215 --> 00:29:11.450
a fashion that is normal to the
rotation operation, A 2 pi

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.450
over n, is another distinct
combination.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.865
And this is called, very
descriptively a horizontal

00:29:16.865 --> 00:29:18.115
mirror plane.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.710
That looks like about all you
can do except for the cases

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:41.900
where we have more than one kind
of rotation axis present.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:46.600
So let me use 422
as an example.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.000
We could add a horizontal mirror
plane perpendicular to

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.330
the principal axis of symmetry,
and that would be

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:53.625
the horizontal sigma.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.430
We could add a vertical
mirror plane.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.480
And now there are two
ways we can do it.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.550
We could put the mirror plane,
the operation sigma, through

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.620
the fourfold axis and in a
fashion that was perpendicular

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.110
to the twofold axis.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.400
And we will retain the
term of vertical

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.370
sigma for that addition.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.980
But the other thing that we
could do would be to put the

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.140
reflection operation interleaved
between the

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.900
twofold axes.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.390
That's going to take this one
and flip it into this one,

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.550
this one flip it into this
one, flip these back and

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.300
forth, and that doesn't create
any new reflection.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:50.100
And this is referred to as a
diagonal reflection plane.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.280
Diagonal to what?

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.710
Diagonally interleaved between
the twofold axes.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.280
And these are distinct additions
and they will lead

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.530
to different groups.

00:31:04.448 --> 00:31:09.120
In as far as addition of
reflection operations is

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.620
concerned, that's about all
we can do that's distinct.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:20.810
And notice that this is
for the groups Dn, and

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.570
tetrahedral, and octahedral
only.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.250
The distinction here
is not defined for

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.500
just a single axis.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.010
So there are three possible
extenders here-- a vertical

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.800
mirror plane, a horizontal
mirror plane, a diagonal

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.920
mirror plane, added to each of
the eleven arrangements of

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.640
rotation axes.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.860
And then the final extender
that we could

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.025
add is to add inversion.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:59.390
And the symbol for the inversion
operation is 1 bar.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.200
And obviously if one point in
space is going to be left

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:14.800
invariant, you either add this
on a single axis, and that is

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:22.320
what you'd have to do for the
groups Cn, or at the point of

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.570
intersection.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:45.620
And that would be the case if
more than one axis, and that's

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.770
the groups of the form n22, T,

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:54.912
and O. That's it.

00:32:54.912 --> 00:32:57.580
That's the job.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.070
So we should consider each of
these possible additions of an

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.210
extender systematically.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:08.460
I don't propose to do every
single one independently.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.790
If we do a couple, you'll
get the general idea.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.160
And I think because I have an
honest face, and you've come

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.010
to trust me, I can just describe
the remaining results

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.900
to you and we won't grind
through every single one.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.950
Now the enormity of what I've
proposed becomes apparent when

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:36.640
I say that we now are going to
have need of a number of

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.870
different--

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.630
what I call combination
theorems, that let us complete

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.850
the group multiplication
table.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:49.290
And deduce, as a consequence,
which symmetry operations must

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.310
come into being because
of these additions.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.790
So we'll want to know what
happens when you add a

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:01.370
vertical sigma to a rotation
operation, A 2 pi over n.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.330
We'll want to know what
happens when you add a

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:08.650
horizontal sigma to a rotation
operation, A 2 pi over n.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.330
And we're going to want to know
what happens when you add

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:16.719
a diagonal mirror plane, this
really is a special case of

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.340
the vertical mirror plane.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.280
And we'll want to know what
happens when you add an

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.089
inversion center to
a rotation axis.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.739
So let me do a few of these
and then next time we can

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.969
start off and start driving
the three dimensional

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.219
symmetries.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:58.920
So let's just repeat the ones
that we've already done.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.230
We said that if we have a
rotation operation A alpha,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:10.720
and we put a reflection plane
through it, that A alpha

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.710
followed by a reflection plane
passing through it-- let me

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.430
call this sigma V-- because
this is the so-called

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.440
vertical, up orientation.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.580
We've already seen that
in two dimensions.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.650
This is a vertical mirror plane,
sigma prime, that is

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.330
going to be alpha over 2
away from the first.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.200
So that is something that we've
already seen in it's

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.290
entirety in the two dimensional
point groups.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:46.170
There was m sigma, there was
2mm, and that was C2V, 3m,

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:57.020
that's C3V, 4mm, and that was
C6V, and 6mm, and that's C4V,

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.510
and that's C6V.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:02.970
So that is the result that we
obtained for two dimensions.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.130
And you can see now the reason
for distinguishing the mirror

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.810
plane by saying it is a vertical
mirror plane because

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.530
this is in the three
dimensional sense.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.130
It's vertical parallel to and
passing through the rotation

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.035
axis-- no longer a rotation
point but a rotation axis.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.930
So we've got those theorems.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:36.780
What happens if we take a
rotation operation, A pi, and

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:42.590
put a horizontal reflection
operation through it

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:44.230
normal to that axis?

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:47.635
So I'll call this sigma h,
a horizontal operation.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:57.720
OK what we have to do is draw
it out once and for all.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.500
Here's the first one, let's
say it's right-handed.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.540
We'll rotate by A pi to get
a second one which stays

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.620
right-handed.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.210
And then we'll reflect it down
in the horizontal mirror plane

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:14.260
to get a third one which
is left-handed.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.550
And now the question is, how
is number one related to

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.640
number three?

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.970
Anybody want to hazard
a guess?

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.730
We've got to go from a
right-handed one to a

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.590
left-handed one.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.400
But these two guys are oriented

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.480
anti-parallel to one another.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.830
So how do we relate the first
one to the third one?

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:43.560
I heard somebody mumble softly
enough to remain anonymous.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.651
Inversion.

00:37:45.651 --> 00:37:47.560
Right.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.830
So as we go along making these
combinations, if we had not

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:54.990
been bright enough to think of
the operation of inversion as

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.120
a general transformation where
the sense of all three

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.880
coordinates is changed, we
would have stumbled over

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.470
headlong right here.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:08.280
Combine a rotation operation, A
pi, with a mirror reflection

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.210
that is perpendicular
to the axis.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.680
The way you get from one to
three in one shot is by

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:19.510
inversion through a point that
is at the intersection between

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.610
the rotation axis and
the mirror plane.

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:30.500
So rotation followed by rotation
in a vertical mirror

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.640
plane that's perpendicular to
the axis is the operation of

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.545
inversion at the point
of intersection.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.070
So again, if we had not been
clever enough to invent it or

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.320
tell you about in advance,
there it is.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.750
When we start forming the group
multiplication table, we

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.800
would have had to have defined
this operation to describe

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.514
this relation.

00:38:57.514 --> 00:39:00.280
AUDIENCE: Is that sigma sub h?

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.672
PROFESSOR: Ah yeah.

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.010
Let me write that, sigma h.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.795
I thought that V didn't look
like a V, so I changed it so

00:39:06.795 --> 00:39:08.500
it looked like a V but it
shouldn't be a V. That's a

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.750
horizontal mirror plane.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:31.990
OK this is a new combination and
if we see what operations

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.080
are going to be present in the
group, we've got the two

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.930
operations of the twofold
axis, 1 and A pi.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:46.230
And what we have added is
sigma h as an extender.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:53.910
So 1 and A pi, this little box
here is the subgroup that we

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.470
know and love as the
twofold axis.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.680
And then we'll write sigma h
here and now let's fill in the

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.970
group multiplication table.

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.840
Doing the identity operation
twice is identity.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.020
Doing the identity operation
followed by A pi is A pi.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.830
Identity followed by
sigma h is sigma h.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:17.380
Identity followed by A
pi, sigma h, lets me

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.830
fill in those boxes.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:22.470
Do a rotation twice, that's
the identity operation.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.670
Do a rotation of A pi and follow
that by a reflection, A

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.260
pi followed by reflection.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.580
This is the inversion
operation.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.630
And so I should add inversion to
my list of operations since

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.880
it's come up.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.950
So 1 followed by inversion
is inversion.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:50.135
A pi followed by inversion is
the horizontal reflection.

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:58.060
Horizontal reflection
followed by A pi

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.310
is the same as inversion.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:07.530
Horizontal reflection followed
by horizontal reflection is

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.720
the identity operation--

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.220
brings me back to where
I started from.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.770
And a horizontal reflection
followed by inversion is the

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.310
same as A pi.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:21.330
So I'll have another object
down here to complete the

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:23.730
three dimensional arrangement.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.980
And this is the group
for operations--

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.920
A pi, inversion, horizontal
reflection, and

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.170
the identity operation.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.180
So what do we call this one?

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:45.920
The operation A pi plus a
horizontal reflection

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.410
operation gives rise to a group
that is a twofold axis

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.510
of its operations,

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.710
perpendicular to a mirror plane.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:59.770
And this written as a fraction
means that the 2 is

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.620
perpendicular to the mirror
plane rather than being

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.760
parallel and in the plane
of the mirror plane.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.880
So two codes for writing
symbols.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.090
A 2 followed on the same line
by the m means that the m is

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.070
parallel to 2.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.810
We know that when we write them
as a fraction, that will

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.740
be our way of designating that
this mirror plane is

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.660
perpendicular to
a twofold axis.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:32.230
OK it's the witching hour,
4 o'clock exactly.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.440
That's when we ought to quit,
so let's stop there.
