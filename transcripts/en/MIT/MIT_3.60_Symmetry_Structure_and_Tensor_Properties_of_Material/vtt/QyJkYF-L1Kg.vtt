00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.220
PROFESSOR: Resume by going back
to our one-dimensional

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.630
body that has undergone some
elastic deformation.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.530
And what I would like to do now
is to distinguish between

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.510
displacement of an object and
fractional change of length,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.540
which turned out to be measured
by the same thing,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.710
that thing that we're
going to name strain

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.430
when properly defined.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.130
OK, here is our one-dimensional
case.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.190
And we said that originally some
point, P, at a location x

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.260
gets mapped to a point P prime
that is at x plus some

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:02.510
displacement U. So this is the
displacement vector U.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.110
Our point Q, which is originally
at some location x

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.770
plus delta x, where delta x
is the original separation

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.990
between P and Q, gets mapped to
a point Q prime, which is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.910
going to be equal to a whole
collection of terms.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.850
It's going to be equal to x
plus delta x, the original

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.708
location, plus the linear
variation of U with x that has

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:44.870
to go U times x plus delta x.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.770
And if we simplify this a little
bit, Q prime is going

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.360
to be at a location, factoring
out x plus delta x, x plus

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.150
delta x times 1 plus e.

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:07.515
AUDIENCE: Is e represented
here?

00:02:07.515 --> 00:02:12.570
PROFESSOR: e is the linear
relation between displacement

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.670
U and position along the body.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.390
OK, so what has happened here?

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:37.280
The relative change of length
is going to be P prime

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.108
Q prime minus PQ.

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:48.360
And if we just substitute in
our two expressions, the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:56.420
relative change of length is
going to be equal to delta x

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.795
times 1 plus e minus delta x.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.960
This is the relative
change of length.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.500
And I should label this such.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.600
That's going to be equal to
delta x times 1 plus e minus

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.250
delta x divided by delta x.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.410
And that simply going to be
e, which is equal to delta

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.720
U over delta x.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.610
And that is what we
define as strain.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.170
And that is a dimensionless
quantity.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.630
Because it has units of
length over length.

00:03:47.935 --> 00:03:52.710
All right, how can we patch this
one-dimensional sort of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.406
behavior up to a
three-dimensional situation?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.850
What we are saying in this
one-dimensional case is that

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.530
the displacement of a particular
point P varies

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.680
linearly with position
in the body.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.610
So let's generalize that into
three dimensions by saying

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.610
that the component of
displacement U1-- and this is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.100
going to look like an
algebraic identity.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.100
It's going to be the way in
which U changes with x1 times

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.090
the position x1.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.890
So this is saying that the
displacement will vary

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.800
linearly with x1.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.500
And the rate will be du1 dx1.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.250
But also U1 is going to change
with the coordinate x2.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:02.650
And the coefficient there
will be du1 dx2.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.690
And there's going to be a third
term that will be the

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.900
way in which U1, the x1
component of displacement,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.110
changes with x3 times the
position in the body x3.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.780
So this is saying exactly the
same thing that we did in one

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.010
dimension, that displacement
depends linearly with

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.550
position, except that
there's now three

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.340
coordinates for position.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.560
And the displacement will change
with an increment of a

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.550
change in position along each
of those three axes.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.190
Similarly, we can say that U2
is going to be equal to the

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.890
way in which U2 changes with x1
times the position x1, the

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.420
way in which U2 changes with x2
times the coordinate within

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.930
the body x2, and the same for
U2 dx3 and the actual

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.340
positional coordinate x3.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.000
And so, in general, we're going
to propose that the i-th

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.520
component of displacement is
given by the way in which

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:15.730
displacement changes with
x sub j times x sub j.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.270
Or you could do the same thing,
not in terms of actual

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:43.170
displacement, but differences in
displacement, the same way

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.070
we could define strain as the
fractional change of length of

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.310
our line segment on the
elastic band or,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.870
alternatively, as the
shift in position.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.000
So we could define it also as
the difference in distances or

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.720
displacements let
me call them.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.920
And that really is
a trivial change.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.700
We'll say the change of a length
along x1 delta U1 is

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.140
going to be the way in which U1
changes with x1 times delta

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:30.580
x1 plus the way in which U2
changes with x1 times the way

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.290
in which U1 changes with x2
times delta x2 plus the way in

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:43.550
which U1 changes with x3 times
delta x3 or, in general, that

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:49.720
the fractional change in length
is going to be equal to

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.590
dui dxj times delta xj.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:03.480
All right, so what we're going
to define now is dui.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.510
Dxj will be defined as something
like strain.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.360
It's not exactly strain yet.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.540
And this is going to be a
measure of deformation.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:24.350
I'm hedging my words because of
something that we'll want

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.960
to impose upon the proper
strain tensor.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.010
But first, let's see what these

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.100
three-dimensional terms mean.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:43.505
And to see that, let me look
at a place within the body.

00:08:43.505 --> 00:08:48.520
And I'm going to look at a line
segment that goes between

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.430
a P and Q that is oriented
along x1.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.370
And I'm picking that
deliberately.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.720
Because I want to keep things
simple and isolate one of

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.890
these terms so we can identify
its meaning.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.810
So let's say here we have two
points P and Q separated by a

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.530
distance delta x1 prior
to deformation.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.850
And now we squish the body.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.590
And what happens is that
P will move to

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.930
a position P prime.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.950
Q will move to a position
Q prime.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.450
And this will be the new line
segment, P prime Q prime.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.580
This will be the original
delta x1.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.150
To that we're going to
tack on an instrument

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.310
which is delta U1.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.155
But then there will also
be a delta U2.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.770
And clearly what has happened is
that the length of the line

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.410
segment P prime Q prime
has changed.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.860
But also the orientation of the
line segment has changed

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.595
by an angle, which I'll
define as phi.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.890
So again, we have
a line segment.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.930
We deform the body.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.270
P is displaced.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.650
Q is displaced.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.960
The component of that line
segment along x1 has changed

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.350
in length by an amount
delta U1.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:28.220
The coordinate along x2 will
change by an amount delta U2.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.820
So we not only change
the length.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.580
But we rotate the
line segment.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.570
We can express these in terms of
our general relation that I

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.470
proposed a moment ago.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:08.810
Delta U1 is going to be equal
to du1 dx1 times delta x1.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:15.100
And that is going to be given
by the element epsilon 1, 1

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.450
times delta x1.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.280
The value of x2 was going
to be equal to du2

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.970
dx1 times delta x1.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.415
And that's going to be
by definition e2,

00:11:28.415 --> 00:11:30.220
1 times delta x1.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.520
And the reason this is so simple
is that I initially

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.450
picked the line segment which
was parallel to x1.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:44.200
So not all of the four terms
that would be present in the

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.280
x1, x2 system have come in.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.320
So there's no contribution of
delta x2 because of the fact

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.905
that I've picked this
special orientation.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:26.970
OK, the fractional change of
length resolved on x1 is going

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:35.600
to be, well, it's going to be
exactly delta x plus delta U1

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.190
quantity squared, it's going
to be this horizontal line

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:48.675
segment, plus delta U2
quantity squared all

00:12:48.675 --> 00:12:52.160
to the power 1/2.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.030
And now I'm going to say that
delta U2 is negligible

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.680
compared to this big delta
x plus delta U1.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.480
And I'll say that this is
approximately equal to delta x

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:15.150
plus delta U1, OK, just taking
the whole works outside of the

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.400
square root sign.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:29.450
So delta U1 over delta x1 is
going to be equal to the term

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:35.150
e1, 1 from this expression
here.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:41.760
So the term e1, 1 represents the
tensile strain along x1.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.470
So we can see how these
derivatives are going to enter

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.620
into changes of length.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.940
The P prime Q prime has also
been rotated by phi.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.530
And we can say exactly what that
is that the tangent of

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:28.860
phi is going to be given exactly
by delta U2 divided by

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.330
the original length of the line
segment delta x1 plus the

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:40.930
little increment of displacement
along x1.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.850
And this is--

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.700
I'll walk down here
so I can see it.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.560
This is delta U1.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.830
This is delta U2 over
times delta x1--

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.430
sorry, I can't see what I've
got down here-- delta

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.870
U1 plus delta x1.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.130
OK, so it's the amount of
displacement along x2 over the

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.680
original line segment delta
x1 plus the change in

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.800
displacement delta U1.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.900
And clearly delta U1 can be
claimed to be small with

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.460
respect to delta x1.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:26.130
So this is approximately equal
to delta U2 over delta x1.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.670
And tangent of phi is going
to be tangent of

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.310
a very small angle.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.930
So this will be delta
U2 over delta x1.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:44.100
And so this angle phi is, for
small strains, going to be

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.180
equal to delta U2
over delta x1.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:16:00.800
And that is the definition of
our element of strain e1, 2.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:19.780
So e1, 2 corresponds to a
rotation of a line segment

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:29.125
that was originally parallel to
x1 in the direction of x2--

00:16:35.474 --> 00:16:36.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.790
PROFESSOR: e2, 1, I'm sorry, e2,
1, yeah, along x1 in the

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.440
direction of x2.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.120
And that is counterintuitive as
I have just demonstrated.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.480
e2, 1 is a rotation of a line
segment along x1 in the

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.600
direction of x2, which is just
the reverse of the subscript.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.339
So eij, a general off-diagonal
element of the array eij, is

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:20.880
going to be a rotation of a line
segment initially along x

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.590
sub j in the direction
of x sub i.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:37.910
And for very small strains,
numerically that term eij will

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.596
give an angle in radiants.

00:17:40.596 --> 00:17:43.520
AUDIENCE: For the equation you
have over there, should it be

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.492
delta x plus delta x2?

00:17:47.492 --> 00:17:49.550
PROFESSOR: No, I would
say this--

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.880
AUDIENCE: Because aren't
you saying delta U1?

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.380
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK,
you're right.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.380
Yeah, I didn't take the
difference here.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.380
AUDIENCE: Delta U1 is basically
negligible?

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.150
PROFESSOR: Yep, yep, so I'm
saying that that [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.420
should be delta x1--

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.900
AUDIENCE: Plus delta U2?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.930
PROFESSOR: --plus delta U2.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.540
You're right.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.790
No, I'm throwing this out.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.190
And that's right.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.730
So I'm saying that this
is essentially delta

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.590
x1 plus delta U1.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.170
I'm saying that this
is negligible.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:27.200
So strictly speaking the
distance between P prime and Q

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.050
prime is the square
root of this

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.290
squared plus this squared.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.750
But if this thing is tiny, P
prime Q prime is essentially

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.860
going to be this distance,
delta x1 plus delta U1.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.110
So that's right.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:54.390
OK, so we have something that
looks like it measures

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.730
deformation.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:02.640
But I would like to ask if this
is a suitable measure of

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.580
deformation.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:19.100
And I would like to show that,
unless the tensor eij is

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.420
symmetric, that we have included
in our definition of

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:30.650
strain rigid body rotation as
well as true deformation.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.770
So in order to demonstrate that,
what I'm going to look

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.790
at is a case where we have
actually, by the way in which

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.300
we apply a stress to the
material, actually done

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.440
nothing more than rotate
x1 to x1 prime and

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.750
rotate x2 to x2 prime.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.060
And in general, for a real
amount of deformation, that is

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.900
something that is
going to happen.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:05.420
Let's say I decide to deform
this eraser in shear before

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.210
your very eyes.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.260
And I try shearing it.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.500
Nothing much has happened.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.720
And I squeeze a little harder.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.240
And finally, I've got it
wrestled down into an

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.270
orientation like this.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:20.170
And when I finished, this
was the original

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.300
position of the eraser.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.170
Here's x1.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:24.690
Here's x2.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:30.060
And by the time I've wrestled it
around to a deformed state,

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.205
it sits down like this, maybe
deformed a little bit.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:42.180
But would you say that this
angle here is a measure of

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.100
deformation?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.300
No, that's clearly a rigid
body rotation.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.310
And what I would intuitively
do, if I wanted to measure

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:55.950
true deformation, if this were
the original body and after

00:20:55.950 --> 00:21:01.130
deformation it went to a
location with some deformation

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:06.950
to be sure but this has
been rotated to here.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.760
This has been rotated down.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.230
And I wouldn't want to say
that this is a measure of

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.460
deformation.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.160
This would be e1, 2.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.290
What I would want to do
intuitively would be to

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:23.370
position the body symmetrically
between the axes

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.860
and then say that this is a
measure of shear strain.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.850
So let me show you now in a more
rigorous treatment that,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.460
if there is a component of rigid
body rotation, let me

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.980
show you what a rotation of the
coordinate system to a new

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:44.250
orientation x1, x
prime would do.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.950
So let's say that this is
an original point Q1.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.030
And after deformation, it moves
by a rotation phi that's

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:59.110
equal to e2, 1 to a new
location Q1 prime.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.220
Let's suppose that this
is a position Q2.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:08.080
And after what we think is the
deformation, this moves to a

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.000
location Q2 prime.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.050
And this would be e1, 2.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.000
That's equal to minus phi.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.280
This is e2, 1.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.790
And that's equal to plus phi.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.670
So what we would do is
like to get rid of

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.450
that rigid body rotation.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:44.670
And what I'll do is to show
that, if we have a point

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.310
that's out at the end of a
radial vector, R, which has

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:54.520
coordinates xi, x1, x2, x3, and
if we have a displacement,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.890
which is absolutely
perpendicular to that radial

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:04.410
vector, that this would
be characteristic

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:08.080
of rigid body rotation.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:18.900
And I will say that, if Ui is
perpendicular to the radial

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:27.750
vector xi, then U.R should
be equal to 0 for

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.361
every position xi.

00:23:31.361 --> 00:23:36.780
So if we just multiply this out,
this is saying that Ui Ri

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.700
should be equal to 0 for
rigid body rotation.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.110
And let's simply carry
out this expansion.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:24:04.340
And I will have then eij xi xj
forming this dot product.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.980
And that is going to be 0 for
a rigid body rotation.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.790
And if I expand this, this will
contain terms like e1, 1

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:21.950
times x1 x1 plus e2,
2 times x2 x2 plus

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.310
e3, 3 times x3 squared.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:30.690
And then they'll be cross-terms
e1, 3 plus e3, 1

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:47.510
times x1 x3 plus e1, 2 plus e2,
1 times x1 x2 plus e2, 3

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:52.770
plus e3, 2 times x2, x3.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.530
And my claim now is that, if
this represents rigid body

00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:01.995
rotation, then that
should be 0.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.810
That is to say the displacement
is absolutely

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.420
perpendicular to the radius
vector for small

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.370
displacements.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:21.120
This must be 0 for all xi.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.770
And the only way that's going
to be possible for any value

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:30.290
of x1, x2, x3 is that each
of these six terms vanish

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.782
individual.

00:25:31.782 --> 00:25:34.960
It's the only way I'm going to
be able to get the whole thing

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.570
to disappear for any value
of coordinate x1, x2, x3.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:48.220
So we're going to have to then
have e1, 1 equals e2, 2 equals

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.080
e3, 3 equals 0.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.650
All the diagonal terms are
going to have to be 0.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:58.040
In order to get the fourth term
to vanish, I'm going to

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:04.930
have to have e1, 3 equal to the
negative of e3, 1 and e1,

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:13.140
2 the negative of e2, 1 and e2,
3 the negative of e3, 2.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.700
So what is this going to look
like for the part of the e

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.960
tensor that corresponds to
rigid body rotation?

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.000
The diagonal terms are
all going to be 0.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.260
And the off-diagonal terms are
going to be the negative of

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:36.800
one another.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.480
So this is e1, 2.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.447
e2, 1 would have to be
equal to minus e1, 2.

00:26:42.447 --> 00:26:49.290
e3, 1 would have to be equal
to the negative of e1, 3.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.390
And so we will have something
like this.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:06.140
So this suggests that our
definition of the true

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:20.240
deformation, which will be
a tensor epsilon ij--

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.550
I bet you kind of guessed I was
going to call it epsilon

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:30.435
and not E. I can write this
as a sum of two parts.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.440
I'll turn that around and say
I'll write epsilon ij plus

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:45.640
another three by three array
omega ij is equal to the

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.190
tensor eij.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.500
That's a novel idea.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.590
This is addition of two tensors
element by element.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:07.390
And if I do that and define
epsilon ij equal to 1/2 of eij

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:14.800
plus eji, so for the diagonal
elements that is going to take

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.910
1/2 of e1, 1 plus e1, 1.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.960
And that's just going to give
me e 1, 1 back again.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:33.450
And I'm going to define the
terms omega ij as 1/2

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:39.505
of eij minus eji.

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:43.130
And if I do that, the resulting

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.275
tensor will be symmetric.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:58.410
OK, so from tensor eij we can
split it up into two parts and

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.240
a part omega ij.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.820
And I won't bother
to write it out.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:07.340
But you can see that omega ij
plus eij is going to be equal

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:18.440
to eij minus 1/2 of 2eij
minus 1/2 of 0.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.280
And that's just going
to be eij.

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.850
So this plus this is indeed
going to give

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:24.590
me the tensor eij.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:34.690
So given a tensor eij, which
is not symmetric, I will

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:41.950
define eij as the sum of two
parts, a tensor epsilon ij,

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:49.520
which is true strain, and a part
omega ij, which is rigid

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.770
body rotation.

00:29:55.879 --> 00:30:02.950
And now at last we have a
satisfactory measure of true

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.530
deformation in terms of the
displacement of points within

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.110
a deformed body where that
displacement can arise from

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.280
either rigid body rotation
and or deformation.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:27.850
So finally, we have a tensor
epsilon ij, which is the

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.100
strain tensor.

00:30:36.095 --> 00:30:42.910
And now I can finally make my
claim that, if this really is

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.985
true deformation, that
for cubic crystals--

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.760
you can see the same
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.210
window coming again--

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.520
since second ranked tensors have
to be symmetric for cubic

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.790
crystals, the form of
strain for a cubic

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.722
crystal can only be this.

00:31:02.722 --> 00:31:08.600
It has to be diagonal
if the tensor is to

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.140
conform to cubic symmetry.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.260
And you say, ah, ah, you tried
to pull that on us with

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.020
stress, too.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.250
And I can squish a crystal
anyway I want.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.650
But you can only develop
a strain if

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.980
you deform a crystal.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.020
And the symmetry of the crystal
is going to determine

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.710
how the crystal deforms.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.380
So therefore, a cubic crystal
should be able to deform only

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:36.510
in a way that stays invariant
to the transformations of a

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.780
cubic symmetry, right?

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:43.420
So cubic crystals can only
deform isotropically.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.020
So if I wanted to design springs
for an automobile so

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.750
that elastic energy could be
stored most efficiently in a

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.060
solid, I would want to make
these automobile springs out

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.880
of a triclinic metal.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.950
Because then the tensor could be
one of general deformation.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.490
OK, well, this, obviously, is
a swindle like my assertion

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:15.070
that stress could only be an
isotropic compressional stress

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.140
for a cubic crystal.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.480
But the argument is a little
more convoluted.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.090
And strain, indeed, is
also a field tensor.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.820
Because, even though I can only
create the deformation by

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.040
application of a stress or
perhaps an electric field or

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.870
something of that sort in that
the link between the

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:40.690
deformation and what I do to
the crystal is coupled by a

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.970
property of the crystal, which
has to conform to the symmetry

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:51.300
of the crystal, nevertheless,
given a tensor that describes

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:55.720
deformation, I can always,
independent of the symmetry of

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:00.840
the crystal, devise a particular
set of stresses

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.890
that would produce any state
of strain I want.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.500
I would have to design, though,
a particular state of

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.130
stress to produce a desired
state of strain.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.270
And that coupling has
to conform to the

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.560
symmetry of the crystal.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:17.980
But there's no reason why strain
itself has to conform

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.220
to the symmetry of
the crystal.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.050
I can create any state of strain
I like by choosing the

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:25.600
appropriate stress.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.120
OK, so that is a swindle.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:37.390
But everything now that I can
say about the behavior of a

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.990
second ranked tensor applies
to the strain tensor.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.420
I can take a strain
tensor epsilon ij.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:54.840
And I can perform the surface
epsilon ij xi xj equals 1.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.180
And that will be the
strain quadric.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:14.000
The strain quadric will have the
property like any quadric

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.500
constructed from a tensor that
the value of the radius in a

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:29.320
particular direction is going to
be such that the strain in

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.249
that direction is equal to 1
over the radius squared.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.860
So what does that mean?

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:44.900
Well, we have to look at what
the strain tensor is relating.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:53.750
The direction, remember now
that the definition of the

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.750
strain tensor is that U
sub i equals epsilon

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.920
ij times x sub j.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:12.590
So the quote "applied vector"
is the direction in a solid.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:19.640
And we will get, in general, a
displacement, U, which is not

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.890
parallel to the direction
that we're considering.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:29.330
And the epsilon in a particular
direction is going

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:35.790
to be equal to the part of
U that's parallel to the

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:41.650
direction of interest divided by
distance in that direction.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:47.430
And what this is going to give
us is the tensile component of

00:35:47.430 --> 00:36:00.815
deformation in the direction
that we're examining.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.475
Now, the radius normal property
works in this case.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.980
And what the radius normal
property says, if you look at

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:39.290
a certain direction in the solid
and then look at the

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:44.880
normal to the surface at that
particular point, this will be

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.830
the direction of
what happened.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.180
So I've not drawn
this correctly.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.930
This should be the direction
of U. And this

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:53.080
is the radio vector.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.130
So the normal to the surface
gives us the direction of the

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.000
displacement that's
going to occur.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.830
And the reason I can say that
is by definition that that

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:05.760
property holds only for
a symmetric tensor.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.330
And by definition, we have
defined the strained tensor

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.790
such that it is symmetric.

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.535
So the radius normal
property holds.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:26.850
If we want to change from one
coordinate system to another,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:32.900
we do that by the all for
transformation of a second

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.230
ranked tensor that, if we change
coordinate system, the

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.160
elements of strain change to
new values epsilon ij prime

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:49.940
that are given by cil cjm times
epsilon lm, the same law

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.600
for transformation of a second
ranked tensor that we have

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.850
seen earlier.

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:09.240
Finally, we can, because there
is a quadric, we can change

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:14.030
that by finding eigenvectors
and eigenvalues, take a

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:19.600
general form of the tensor
epsilon 1, 1, epsilon 1, 2,

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:27.660
epsilon 1, 3, and so on, and
by solving the eigenvalue

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.298
problem, convert this to a value
epsilon 1, 1 prime 0, 0,

00:38:32.298 --> 00:38:38.420
0, epsilon 2, 2 prime 0, 0, 0,
epsilon 3, 3 prime to find out

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:43.150
what the extreme values of
tensile deformation are and

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.310
the orientations within the
original description of the

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.060
body in which these extreme
values occur.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.410
OK, I'm just about
out of time.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.550
I'll save until next time
another neat feature of the

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.940
strain tensor.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:16.230
And that is contained within
these elements is information

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:19.260
on the volume change that
the body undergoes.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.150
And this is something
called the dilation.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.520
And we'll see that this is
related in a very simple way

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.040
to the elements of the
strain tensor.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.880
OK, we've spent a lot of time
developing the formalism of

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.770
stress and strain.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.850
And next thing we'll do is to
move on to some interesting

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:48.350
properties of crystals, which
are defined in terms of

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.420
tensors of rank higher
than two.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.430
So we'll look at some third
ranked tensor properties.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:40:00.590
That will include things like
piezoelectricity, the stress

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:04.570
optical effect, and things
of that sort.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:08.020
These are going to be
really anisotropic.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.540
Second ranked tensors were
anisotropic enough.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.750
But the variation of property
with direction was a

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:18.150
quasi-ellipsoidal variation When
as 1 over the square of

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.310
the radius of the quadric.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.340
For higher ranked tensor
properties, we will encounter

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.520
some absolutely weird surfaces
with dimples and lumps and

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:34.200
lobes, not this smooth
quasi-ellipsoidal variation, a

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.800
property with direction, which
was the case for second ranked

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.070
tensor properties.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.280
So we will get into some exotic
anisotropies very

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.070
shortly to finish
up the semester.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.800
So I will probably see some
of you at the MRS

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.330
meeting next week.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.880
I won't see you on Thursday for
reasons that I need not

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.780
elaborate upon.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.510
So I hope you have
a happy holiday.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:05.960
Relax, suck in air, and come
back refreshed next Tuesday

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.950
for some really wild anisotropy
of physical

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.200
properties.
