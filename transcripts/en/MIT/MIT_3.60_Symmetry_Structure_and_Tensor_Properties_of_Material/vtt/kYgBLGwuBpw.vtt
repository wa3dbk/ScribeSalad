00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.240
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.940
The end of this lecture
generated so much excitement

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.410
that we've continued on into the
start of the next segment.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.220
So I think we'd better begin.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.030
What I told you, as several
people were clever enough to

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:33.630
observe, that the number of
planes between the origin and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:43.030
intercept plane is equal to A
times B times C, where the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.010
intercept is A T1 out plus
B T2 out equals C T3 out.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.440
That is true only if the
numbers A, B, and C are

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.980
mutually prime.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.239
If it's something like 4,
2, 1, you won't get

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.390
that number of planes.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.270
You'll get a submultiple.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.960
And the reason for that is that
some of the planes, when

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.700
you generate them by these three
different translations

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
in different directions, some
of them are mapped on top of

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.760
existing planes.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.210
And I'm not going to attempt to
prove this, but let me just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.670
tell you the result, that if
A and B contain some common

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.670
factor, p, and B and C contain
some common factor, q, and in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.250
the worst possible case, A and C
contains some common factor,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.290
r, then the number of intervals
is equal to A times

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.310
B times C divided by
p times q times r.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.960
And probably the best way to
show that is let you show, on

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.070
a problem set in the very near
future, to actually map out

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.440
the planes in the
two-dimensional situation, for

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.240
a and b that are mutually prime,
and then do the same

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.880
thing for a and b that contain
some common factor.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.790
So this is the so-called
Miller indices, the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.000
Miller-Bravais indices, and
everybody hears about them,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280
but it is not at all clear why
one takes this very indirect

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.630
and non-intuitive way
of defining the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.700
orientation of a plane.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.680
And the reason for this,
ultimately, is that in x-ray

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.870
diffraction, you want to
integrate up the scattering of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.970
all atoms in a crystal.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.350
So you want to integrate over
a plane that contains the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.890
atoms, and this locus has a
convenient form only if you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.480
choose these indices to find the
orientation of the plane.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.450
And what comes out of this, as
I said to a couple of people

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.150
during intermission, is that the
amplitude of the scattered

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.990
wave has some summation
over all of the atoms.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:19.290
And in that phase of that ray,
that is e to the plus 2 pi i,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.620
hx plus ky plus lz.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.790
Very, very simple form.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.550
And it has that form only
because the locus, the way

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.810
this plane is defined was done
very, very carefully.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.720
So it's something beyond just
simple geometry that forms a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.970
reason for it.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.840
Let me say a couple more things
in general about the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.240
Miller-Bravais indices.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.330
They are very, very intuitive,
counter-intuitive.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.340
Let's suppose that this is a,
and this is b, and this is c.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.620
And I put down here, again, the
equations of the entire

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.900
set of planes in the stack.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.460
And let's look at the first
planes and ask what the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.710
intercepts are.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.680
The intercepts on x, y, and z
are going to be 1 over h on x,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.140
1 over k on y, and
1 over l times z.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.500
So the first plane from the
origin is going to be 1 over h

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.590
of the a translation, 1 over k
of the b translation, and 1

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.890
over l of the c translation.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:44.060
So this gives us one way
of determining, given a

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.080
particular rational plane, show
it relative to the three

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.710
translations.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.510
From the first plane from the
origin, h is going to be 1

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.120
over the intercept on T1.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.330
I'll call it a, which is
what we usually do.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:13.090
k is going to be 1 over the
intercept on b, and l is going

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.930
to be 1 over the intercept
on c for the first

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.180
plane from the origin.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.100
So if you have a drawing of the
set of planes relative to

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.510
the translation, such as the
one that I obliterated from

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.960
just a moment ago, reciprocals
of the intercepts of the first

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.795
plane from the origin give you
h, k, and l very easily.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.310
The thing that is
counter-intuitive is that, if

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.310
you look out of context at the
three indices, h, k, and l,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.160
you have the feeling that as l
gets larger, the intercept of

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.160
the plane on c should gradually
creep up from here,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.250
to here, to here, and so
on, as l gets larger.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.410
Actually, the reverse is true.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.480
As l increases, the intercept on
c gets smaller and smaller

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.590
and smaller and smaller, until
finally, when l is infinity,

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.390
the intercept is 0.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.140
So it's counter-intuitive.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.190
The intercept on the axis gets
larger as the Miller index

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.440
gets larger.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.290
Let me give you a proprietary
Uncle Bernie's secret method

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.260
for determining Miller indices
without stress and strain.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.510
This works every time.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.670
Find the intercepts
of any plane.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.100
And we know from these
equations what those

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.780
are going to be.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:12.940
For the nth plane, the
intercepts are going to be n

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:23.310
over h, n over k on b,
and n over l on c.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.560
Take the reciprocals.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.680
And the reciprocals are going
to be h over n, k over

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.050
n, and l over n.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:46.140
And then find whatever integer,
n, you must multiply

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.650
those reciprocals by in order
to convert them to mutually

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.700
prime intercepts, and you've
got the Miller indices in a

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.475
no-brainer, automatic fashion.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.290
Another bit of jargon.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.330
We will also use the basis
vectors to define locations

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.360
and to define directions
in a lattice.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:27.470
To distinguish three integers
that indicate a plane, and you

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.780
all know this from previous
experience, the parentheses

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.994
says plane, an individual
plane.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:53.500
There are other times when you
would like to use the indices

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.780
of one representative plane to
indicate the entire set of

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.490
planes that are related by the
symmetry of the crystal.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.580
So let me give one
specific example.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:12.670
Suppose we had a cubic crystal,
where these are the

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.130
three translations that form
the edge of the unit cell.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.610
And let's say that this is a1,
this is a2, and this is a3.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.680
I'm using a1, a2, and
a3, not a, b, and c.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.700
But let's not go there.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.590
OK, these are lattice points.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.350
And if I look at this plane
that's perpendicular to a1 and

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.060
cuts it at one lattice
point, l, this would

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.900
be the 1, 0, 0 plane.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.390
And I would indicate that that
is an individual plane that

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.190
we're talking about.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:53.010
But if this crystal is cubic,
all six faces of the set, 1,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:10:04.930
0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1; and then
the plane that's in the

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:11.450
opposite direction, minus
1, 0, 0; 0, minus 1, 0;

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.910
and 0, 0, minus 1.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:20.390
These six planes define the
surfaces of the cube.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.470
So there are times, since these
are equivalent to planes

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.090
and will have the same
properties, the same hardness,

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.270
the same [? edge ?] bits and
everything else, there are

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.440
times when we may want to
refer to the entire

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.190
symmetrical set.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.180
And we do that.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:40.000
We call that set a form.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.570
It is a symmetry-related set.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.590
And you can pick any
one you like.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.900
Generally, you pick one with
simple indices, like the one

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.820
that is perpendicular to
the translation a.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.210
And then you indicate
by braces, which is

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.810
the symbol for set.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.520
This means the set 1, 0, 0, and
that would correspond to

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.770
all six of these faces.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:26.350
The number, if you do this in
reverse, and I'm going to give

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.750
you the indices, what are
the separate faces?

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.540
That depends on the symmetry.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.980
So to give you an example, if
I have a unit cell that has

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.380
three orthogonal translations,
and this is a, and this is b,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.310
and this is c, so that there
is no cubic symmetry to it.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:52.310
This face, which would be 1,
0, 0, and the one that cuts

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.680
the axes at minus a, minus 1, 0
0, those are going to be the

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.920
only faces with a single 1 and
a pair of 0's which are

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.270
equivalent by symmetry.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.572
So in this case, for this brick
shaped unit cell, 1, 0,

00:12:08.572 --> 00:12:14.720
0 would mean this pair of two
faces, rather than six.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.830
So to go from a representative
face to the set of planes, you

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.180
have to know the symmetry.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.060
If you can write the planes on
the basis of symmetry, take

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.180
one representative and
let that be the form.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.370
So it leads one to observe
that crystals undergoing

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:44.075
plastic deformation
have bad form.

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:45.037
Yeah?

00:12:45.037 --> 00:12:47.442
AUDIENCE: Is that different
from when you

00:12:47.442 --> 00:12:48.885
talk about a direction?

00:12:48.885 --> 00:12:50.330
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.830
You will see in just a moment
that we use the same system of

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.200
three integers, but in order to
distinguish which one he's

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.184
talking about when one's
thinking about integers with a

00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:01.434
different set of numbers.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.760
Again, if we use the lattice as
the basis of a coordinate

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:28.570
system, another thing we might
want to specify is the

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.850
orientation of a rational
direction.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.660
And let me go to a
two-dimensional case.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.980
Assume that c goes
straight up.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:45.570
Directions of easy plastic
deformation will very often

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.960
involve integral number
of translations.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.620
For example, this direction here
is obtained by going one

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.090
translation in the a
direction plus one

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.750
translation in the b direction.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.680
So we could use the pair of
integers 1, 1, and if we are

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.540
normal to see we'd use a 0
for the third integer.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.920
But how are we going to tell
whether we're talking about a

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.450
direction or a plane?

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:19.410
And the way one does that is
to use square braces to

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.175
indicate one particular
direction.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:41.720
You may want to also indicate
the location of a particular

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.350
atom within the unit cell.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:51.730
In order to do that, one could
really use the location of a

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:57.570
vector, the components of a
vector, xa plus yb plus zc,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:01.340
the vector from the origin to
that atom as coefficients

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.880
which correspond to
the atom location.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.050
So if that is the case,
the numbers

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.480
are usually not integers.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.290
And one simply uses the
three integers in

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.540
an unadorned fashion.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.360
So the lattice translations
give you the basis of a

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.520
coordinate system, and we use
those to specify features,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.856
rational or not, of planes and
directions and coordinates.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.120
OK, any questions here?

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.460
OK, we are next going to take
the first small step in a

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.420
process of synthesis.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.000
We have found that there are,
in two dimensions, five

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.790
distinct kinds of lattices.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:26.660
The oblique, the rectangular,
the centric rectangular, the

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:32.880
square, and the hexagonal.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.130
Five kinds of lattices.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.430
We've shown, to this point, that
each of these lattices

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.430
can accommodate a certain
rotational symmetry.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.390
1 or 2 here.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.770
m and m for the rectangular
and centric rectangular.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.670
4, the fourfold axis
for a square.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.870
3 or 6 for the hexagonal
lattice.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.839
So what I would like to do next,
after we make a brief

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:11.550
direct diversion, is to combine
with each of these

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:20.790
nets one of the two symmetries
which can be

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.400
accommodated in that net.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.359
And what we will have determined
then are the

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:30.630
patterns' lattice and symmetry,
which can exist in

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.670
two dimensions.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.510
The sort of things we look at
actually, like the pattern of

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.680
square tiles on the floor, or
the two-dimensional pattern

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.110
that is on a fabric design.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:46.850
So we'll derive those
exhaustively.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.160
The thing that results is
something that is called a

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.410
plane group.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.100
And I'm going to take this
through in detail because

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.950
there are not that many
combinations that can be made.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.490
And the number is enough
to count on

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.720
your fingers and toes.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.400
You've got to use both, so
they're a fair number, but not

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.480
a staggering number.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.330
If we were to do this exercise
in three dimensions, there

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.050
would be 230 distinct
combinations.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.812
And that's too much for
anybody to go through.

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.430
I know of very few people who
work professionally in this

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:31.910
area who've actually sat down
and derived every single one.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.950
If you know the principles of
the derivation and know how

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.780
you could go about doing it if
you were forced to, that's

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.050
sufficient.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.450
The results are tabulated in
an admirable compilation.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.850
We mentioned that at
the beginning.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.270
This is the International
Tables for X-ray

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.530
Crystallography, Volume 1.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.610
So what we should end up with is
a way for you to go to this

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.890
reference data and know
how to interpret it

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.250
and make use of it.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.030
But this is a nice microcosm.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.620
There are not many plane
groups, and to do this

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.660
exhaustively, will let us see
the sort of reasoning that

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.470
goes into it.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.690
I have to tell you that this
is not in Buerger's book.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.020
We're going to do
two-dimensional

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.890
crystallography first,
and then extend

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.340
it in a third direction.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.680
In fact, I know of no
book that does this.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.840
And so you're going to get a
unique, handwritten document

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.620
by none other than yours truly
that will do this in detail

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.850
every step of the way.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.360
And I don't know of any other
place where this is done.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.240
Now, what is the origin
of this name?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.290
Plane, well, these
are symmetries

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.810
confined to a plane.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.480
And then there's this mysterious
term, group.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.660
And the corresponding thing
in 3D is something

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.910
called a space group.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.990
This is a language derived from
a branch of mathematics

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:06.230
that is called group theory, and
it is exactly the language

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.690
that describes things
that we've mentioned

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:14.430
conversationally, such as if you
take two transformations

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.070
and perform them in succession,
they're going to

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.880
give you a third that
has to be present.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.510
If you've got two present,
there must be a third.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.260
We talk about symmetries
being self consistent.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.070
If you have a rotation operation
that is not an

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.850
integral submultiple of 2 pi,
it's not going to be self

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.010
consistent because you go
around, and around, and

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.280
around, and you will never
come exactly full circle.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.000
So group theory is a branch of
mathematics that deals with

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.300
concepts of this sort.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.150
So it's not very hard to
develop, and it gives its

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.050
ideas to the notation that is
used in crystallography.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.730
So let me say a few words
about group theory.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.980
What is a group?

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.440
A group is a set of elements--

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.220
And what are elements?

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.470
Elements are things--

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.930
For which a law of combination
is defined.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.150
And the nature of the elements
can be very,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.140
very different things.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.135
They could be numbers.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:55.060
They could be complex numbers,
and the law of combination

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.790
here might be multiplication.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:03.900
They could be matrices, for
which the law of combination

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.990
is defined as matrix
multiplication.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.280
Or they could be pots of
different color paint, for

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.360
which the law of combination is
defined as mixing the two

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.160
colors 50-50.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.910
I don't know any practical
application of that sort of

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.390
group, but nevertheless, it
follows the definition, a set

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.000
of things for which a law of
combination is defined.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:40.615
And in addition, which satisfies
three so-called

00:22:40.615 --> 00:22:41.865
group postulates.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:56.220
And the group postulates are
the combination of any two

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:06.705
elements is also a member
of the group.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.800
The second group postulate
is that the identity--

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.050
I'm going to call it
just identity--

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.100
and let me define, identity
is doing nothing--

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.610
Is also a member of the group.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:24:01.290
And if we define the identity
operation as I, this means

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:08.770
that for every element, I
followed by a or a followed by

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.490
I, is the same as a by itself.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.360
If the law of multiplication
were just arithmetic

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.570
multiplication, then number
1 would be the identity

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:22.300
operation because 1 times any
number gives you the number.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.340
Any number times 1 gives you
the same number back again.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:35.400
And the third postulate is that,
for every element, an

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.650
inverse exists--

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.670
let's call the elements
a and a minus 1--

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:56.000
such that a followed by a
minus 1 is equal to the

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.530
identity operation, and the
inverse element followed by

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.825
the original element, a, is also
the identity operation.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.950
So if the law of combination
were defined as

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:17.750
multiplication, you would have
to find, for every number,

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.660
another number, which multiplied
by it, gives you

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.910
the number 1.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.060
OK, let me now illustrate with
a couple of simple examples.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:42.540
Let's consider the set of
numbers 1, n minus 1.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:51.070
The number of elements in the
group is said to be the rank

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.675
of the group, or some people
like to use the term order.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.470
And I don't like that term
because second order or fourth

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.940
order is a term applied to
quantities which are not

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.960
terribly important.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.500
So we expand this except for
higher order terms, which are

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.880
negligible.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.500
And I don't like that
connotation.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.190
So I will not use order,
although it's sometimes used

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.900
to talk about the
rank of a group.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.260
The rank or order of the group
is simply the number of

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.560
elements contained in a set.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.050
So let's show that the numbers
1 and minus 1 constitute a

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.270
group of rank two.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.460
Is the combination of any
pair of elements also a

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.560
member of the group?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.970
Well, to do this, it's
convenient to set up an array

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.910
called the group multiplication
table.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.730
And what you do is you simply
put the elements of the group

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.230
along a row.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.680
And in this case, it's
1 and minus 1.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.630
And then you put the same
elements along a column, and

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.380
then you combine them.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.080
1 times 1 is 1.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.590
Minus 1 times 1 is minus 1.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.650
1 times minus 1 is minus 1.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.770
Minus 1 times minus
1 is plus 1.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.860
Sometimes, as I'm giving this
part of the lecture, somebody

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.880
passes down the hallway, and
they hear 1 times 1 is 1.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.080
1 times minus 1--

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.530
and they go in reverse to see
what in the world could be

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.170
going on in this high-powered
mathematical lecture.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.240
That's why I close the door.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.580
OK, so any combination
of elements is also a

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.710
member of the group.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.750
Is the identity operation
present?

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:02.170
Yes because minus 1 times plus
1 or plus 1 times minus 1

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.080
gives you the same element
back again.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.570
So for every element in the
group, the combination of any

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.620
two elements is present.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:17.240
For each operation, we've shown
that an inverse exists

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.840
and for every element there's an
identity operation, and the

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.940
inverse exists.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.160
So the pair of numbers, not
terribly exciting, 1 and minus

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:32.380
1 where the law of combination
is defined is a

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.930
group of rank 2.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.100
I'll give you another example.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.180
I won't bother to carry out all
the terms, but the numbers

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:53.220
1, minus 1, i, and minus i,
where i is equal to the square

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.690
root of minus 1, and where the
law of combination is defined

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:03.020
as multiplication, constitute
a group of rank 4.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:21.320
With this simple introduction,
I think one can see that

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.380
symmetry transformations can be
regarded as operations that

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.690
are elements in a group.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:34.870
And let me give you
a simple example.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.590
Let's look at a combination.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.790
We still haven't considered the
mind-boggling possibility

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.890
of having more than one symmetry
element present in a

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:45.730
space at the same time.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.210
But let's suppose we have two
mirror planes that are

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.850
completely orthogonal, and see
what sort of pattern they

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.290
would generate.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:57.560
Here's a first motif.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:03.300
If I call this mirror plane m1,
and this mirror plane m2.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.950
m1 is going to take this
object and reflect

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.380
it across to here.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:15.174
m2 will take this object and
reflect it down to here.

00:30:15.174 --> 00:30:17.720
Take this one, and reflect
it down to here.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.440
And now I know how this is
related to this, how this is

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.310
related to this, how this
is related to this.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:28.410
But this one and this one are
exactly the same thing.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:35.360
And those two objects are not
related by reflection.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.040
If this is a right-handed one,
this is a left-handed one,

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.940
this is a left-handed one, and
this is a right-handed one.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.830
So if something relates these
two, it has to be something

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.780
that does not produce
an enantiomorph.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.760
The only thing that's possible
then would be translation.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.080
And these two guys are not
parallel to one another.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.060
You can't get this one
by just sliding

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.420
this parallel to itself.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.750
The only thing that's
left is rotation.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:08.870
And, lo and behold, we can get
from this one to this one by a

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.530
180-degree rotation.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.695
And we can get from this
one to this one by

00:31:12.695 --> 00:31:15.850
a 180-degree rotation.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.860
So here's an example of a way
in which we've combined

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.920
without showing why this is
possible, or how I got there.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.590
Here's a combination of symmetry
elements that gives

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.025
us a possible arrangement
of objects in space.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.890
It's going to be convenient to
have a notation to indicate

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.150
such combinations.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:43.260
And we call them Harry, George,
and Sam, or some

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.690
popular, affectionate name.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.330
Or call them number 1,
number 2, number 3.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.730
But a nice notation is going to
be a descriptive one which

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.280
tells you what you have.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.510
And what is done in
crystallography is to indicate

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:00.470
these possible combinations
by a running list of the

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.100
different kinds of symmetry
elements that are present.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.875
And here, we've got a twofold
axis, for which the symbol is

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:09.680
2, and two mirror planes that
are different and function in

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.140
different ways in the pattern.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.940
So this combination
is called 2mm.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.610
OK, that's getting ahead
of our story.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:25.140
But what I wanted to do now is
to show you that this set of

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.790
symmetry elements contains
four operations that

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.700
constitute a group.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.710
There's the operation
of a one-fold axis.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.980
That's the identity operation.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.670
There is a reflection
across the first

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.370
type of mirror plane.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.170
And notice, now, the utility
of having a symbol that

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.500
indicates a specific
operation rather

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.280
than a symmetry element.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.970
There's a second reflection
operation, sigma 2, and there

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.860
is a rotation operation through
a 180 degrees, A pi.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.340
So I'd like to show that these
four operations constitute a

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.210
group of rank 4.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.820
So how do we show this?

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.340
We first set up the group
multiplication table.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:21.590
And then we simply
combine these

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:24.640
four operations pairwise.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.440
Put the same 1, sigma 1,
sigma 2, and A pi down

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.110
this side of the array.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.470
Doing nothing, doing nothing, is
the same as a one-fold axis

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.260
doing nothing.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.170
Doing a reflection sigma 1
followed by doing nothing

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.230
gives you sigma 1 back again.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.420
Doing a reflection sigma 2
followed by doing nothing

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.350
gives you sigma 2 back again.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.210
And similarly, rotating
A pi followed by doing

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.730
nothing is the same.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:58.060
If I go along the columns,
doing nothing followed by

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.300
sigma 1 is sigma 1.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.850
Sigma 1 and 1 combined
is sigma 2.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.060
A pi combined with
sigma 1 is A pi.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.739
So far so good, but
not surprising.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:19.159
Doing sigma 1 and following it
by sigma 1 is reflecting left

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:23.290
to right across mirror plane 1,
and then reflecting right

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.409
back again.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.870
So that is going to be a
one-fold axis doing nothing.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.719
Doing sigma 1 following up by
sigma 2 would reflect across,

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.080
and then follow up by reflection
in the second

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.270
mirror plane.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:41.040
I get from the first one
to the final one by

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.690
the rotation A pi.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.060
So this is A pi.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.420
And if I do the first
reflection, sigma 1, and

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:58.270
follow that by A pi, that gets
me from number 1 to number 2

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.120
to number 3.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.930
And I get from number 1 to
number 3 directly by the

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.430
reflection operation, sigma 2.

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:06.550
OK, you notice what's
happening?

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.050
I get the same four elements
back again in

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.020
every column or row.

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.360
Sigma 1, 1, A pi, sigma 2.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.550
And if I rattle these off
quickly, this as A pi.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.290
This is identity, and
this is sigma 1.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.410
And this will be sigma 2.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.480
This will be sigma 1.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.610
And this will be the
identity operation.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:35.470
So the first group postulate
is satisfied.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.610
These four elements combined
pairwise always give you

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.285
nothing but one of these
elements back.

00:35:43.285 --> 00:35:46.600
An identity operation is present
because the one-fold

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.320
rotation axis is the same as
leaving the thing alone.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.540
And we've seen that for every
operation, an inverse exists

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.040
because 1 occurs once in
each row and column.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:05.230
So sigma 2 is its own inverse,
and for sigma 1, sigma 1 is

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.140
its own inverse.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:10.260
For A pi, A pi is
its own inverse.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.510
So an inverse exists.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.590
So we've got a group.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:23.350
And this is another way of
saying, in general terms, if

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.600
we put two mirror planes and a
twofold axis together in this

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.050
specific fashion, these
operations, when they go to

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:37.280
work on an initial motif,
reproduce a finite set of

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.990
objects and not a clutter that
just fills space and never

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.510
closes upon itself.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.395
Yes, sir?

00:36:43.395 --> 00:36:45.335
AUDIENCE: I see why you have
sigma 1, sigma 2, A pi in that

00:36:45.335 --> 00:36:48.460
group, but why do you have the
1, which is a conversion?

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:48.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.620
If I didn't put it in-- no,
that's the identity operation.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.900
This is a one-fold axis.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.050
Just this 2 was a
twofold axis.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.670
So one-fold axis is a nice
symbol for identity because it

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:02.500
doesn't do anything.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.020
It picks something up and
puts it right back down

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.820
where it came from.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.120
OK.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:08.560
Yeah.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.240
That's deceptive because 1,
when we're talking about

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.010
multiplication of numbers,
also functions as

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.506
the identity operation.

00:37:16.506 --> 00:37:16.988
Yeah?

00:37:16.988 --> 00:37:19.880
AUDIENCE: If all these
symmetries are commutative,

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.808
[? that is, ?]

00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:24.459
if they all commute, do you
really [INAUDIBLE] bottom

00:37:24.459 --> 00:37:25.182
diagonal [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:25.182 --> 00:37:26.146
PROFESSOR: In general, yes.

00:37:26.146 --> 00:37:27.592
AUDIENCE: Generally?

00:37:27.592 --> 00:37:28.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.450
Actually, this is a special
group because if I have two

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:38.530
elements, a, and take b and
follow it by a, that is the

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:42.700
same result as a
followed by b.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.340
And a group that has
this character

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.590
is said to be abelian.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.590
There's a standing rotten joke
in mathematics that asks

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:02.700
rhetorically, what is
purple and commutes?

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.440
The answer is an
abelian grape.

00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:09.690
I don't think it's terribly
funny either, but if you had a

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.990
gaggle of mathematicians here,
they would chortle and double

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.546
over in laughter.

00:38:14.546 --> 00:38:17.380
Ha, ha, ha, abelian grape.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.530
Well, I don't feel badly.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.200
You react about the same
way to some of my

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.310
funny things, too.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.360
But you get used to that
sort of thing.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:31.010
All right.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:35.860
The feeling I want to leave you
with at this point is the

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.220
idea that group theory and
some of its concepts are

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.830
exactly what we're meaning when
we grope for a definition

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.040
of the fact that a certain
collection of symmetry

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.190
operation should be finite.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.940
That is to say, it's finite.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.450
The operations combined on
each other have to give a

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:01.250
finite number, must constitute
a group.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:06.120
And the main reason for being
familiar with this is that

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:13.900
group theory forms the basis of
a lot of the words that are

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.080
used to describe the

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.070
combinations of symmetry elements.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:26.120
For example, what we have
derived here, the symmetry

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.050
that's called 2mm, is something
that's called a

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:30.300
point group.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.330
Point because there is at
least one point in space

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.440
that's left unchanged, and
that's this point of

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.040
intersection of all three
symmetry elements.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.380
And it's called a group
because the individual

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.610
operations of these symmetry
elements, when combined

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.520
according to group theory,
can be shown to

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.860
constitute a group.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:00.520
The patterns that we get when we
add symmetry elements to a

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:10.190
lattice are groups in the
sense, if you regard the

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:14.220
pattern as extending infinitely
in all directions,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.750
that the combination of any
two elements gives you

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.700
something that's also
in the group.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.740
But the number of elements
is infinite.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.420
For example, in the lattice,
here's T1.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.870
Here's T2.

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:29.660
Every other lattice point
can be described as some

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.450
combination of T1
followed by T2.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.500
But the numbers in
front of those

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.690
translations can be infinite.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:42.660
If we put a symmetry element
in this lattice, like a

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.370
twofold axis, for example, the
translations reproduce this

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.120
twofold axis to an infinite
number of locations.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.790
But yet, all of the group
postulates are satisfied.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:56.210
The number of elements in the
group does, however, not have

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.560
to be finite.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.260
So that is another distinction
that's worth making, that

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.530
there are infinite groups and
there are finite groups.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.630
And the number of elements
can be infinite.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:25.840
Collection of symmetry elements
that leave one point

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.130
in space unmoved is called
a point group.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.000
If we do something like this,
put a twofold axis in

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.310
combination with a pair of
translations, that is an

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:41.140
infinite set of operations that
acts on all of space.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.610
This is something that's
called a space group.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.390
Another designation,
distinction, that's sometimes

00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:09.310
useful to make are
crystallographic point groups,

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:15.890
such as this one, 2mm, as
opposed to combinations of

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.950
symmetry elements, which are
perfectly lovely and which are

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:24.910
valid groups, such as a
combination of rotations of 2

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:29.590
pi over 5, or a combination
of a fivefold axis

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.500
with a mirror plane.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.920
Perfectly lovely symbols,
constitute groups, but these

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.180
are non-crystallographic

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.790
These would be

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.080
non-crystallographic point groups.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.140
Satisfy all the requirements of
the group, but if it's to

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.430
be in a crystal, the fivefold
axis must be combined with

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.840
translation, and that's
impossible.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.480
So you can have

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.370
non-crystallographic point groups.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.720
There are no
non-crystallographic space

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.150
groups because they are, by
definition, something that

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.775
involve translation yet
constitute groups.

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.190
All right.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.590
Set the stage for next time, so
you all come back excited.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:18.800
We have shown that there are a
limited number of symmetry

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.472
elements that are possible in
a lattice, rotation 1, 2, 3,

00:43:24.472 --> 00:43:28.300
4, and 6 in a mirror plane.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.790
And these are now examples
of what we would call

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.530
crystallographic point groups.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.870
These would be the sort of
symmetry elements that are

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.635
candidates for two-dimensional
patterns.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.210
But are these the only
symmetries that can be added

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.510
to lattices?

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:09.100
Could we not combine a mirror
plane with a twofold axis?

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.300
The answer I say to
that is, sure.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.040
You bet you can.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.840
You just did it for us.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:17.120
But could you combine a mirror
plane with a threefold axis, a

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.450
mirror plane with a fourfold
axis, a mirror plane with a

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:20.670
sixfold axis?

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.160
The answer to all of those
questions are yes.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.700
So there are going to be spaces
here, where there will

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.270
be additional groups.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.030
And when we're done, we will
have the two-dimensional

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.340
crystallographic point groups.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.480
But now I have to be able
to complete something.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:44.020
If I take A pi and combine it
with a mirror operation sigma

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.200
1, what do I get?

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.520
If I take A 2 pi over 3, a
threefold rotation, combine

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.460
that with a mirror plane
that passes through

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.310
it, what do I get?

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.890
Again, a characteristic of
symmetry theory is that

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:04.410
whenever I take a motif and
repeat it by operation number

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:10.780
1 to get a second motif, and
then I repeat that by

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.840
operation number
2, I have three

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.980
things that are identical.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.940
And there must be some way,
some operation, that

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.320
automatically arises that
tells me how number 1 is

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.910
related to number 2.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.880
Number 1 is related
to number 3.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.700
Tied in with group theory, this
says that if you combine

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:36.180
operation 1 in a space, if
it's to be a group, if

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.030
operation number 2 is present,
you must combine those two

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:44.390
steps, and whatever pops up must
be a member of the set of

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.600
operations that are present.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.000
So we're going to have to come
up with something that I call

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.250
combination theorems.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:05.650
And this is simply expressing
the result of a combination of

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.360
two elements in a group
multiplication table.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.720
It goes with a caveat.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.560
If you're so excited about this
stuff, you're going to

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.760
run home and start reading
Buerger's book as

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.010
soon as you get there.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.490
You can regard these symmetry
transformations as operators.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.300
And you're familiar with other
sorts of operators like d by

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.640
dx, d by dy.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.660
And when you apply them in
succession, you actually write

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.860
it as a product.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:42.900
d by dy followed by d by dx you
write as d squared dxdy.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.750
Or you write it as d squared
dx squared when you

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:46.700
differentiate twice.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.330
You don't mean you take the
differential of the function

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.560
with respect to x and
then square it.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.600
You mean you do this
operation twice.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.180
So these are all operators.

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:07.450
And what we usually understand
is that if you do d by dy

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:15.800
first and then follow that with
d by dx, the sequence of

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.755
operation goes from
right to left.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.320
And I think that will come right
quite naturally to you.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.820
You do that with differentials
and other sort of operators.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.110
That is what we'll do.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:37.445
Not Martin Buerger.

00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:40.760
A very strong-minded person,
and he did what

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.460
he thought was sensible.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:47.490
And he said we read things
from left to right.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.920
We read everything from
left to right.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.400
So I will be damned if I'm going
to write d by dx, d by

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.390
dy to be a sequence of
operations that goes from

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.600
right to left.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.100
So all throughout Buerger's
book-- and it's easy to get

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:08.020
adjusted to, if he writes A dot
B, he means B followed by

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:19.840
A. Whereas normally, in the
calculus of operations, we

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:27.700
will use, as the rest of the
world does, this is A followed

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:38.290
by B. Trivial point, but one
that can throw you for a loop

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.100
the first time you see
it in Buerger's book

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.350
if you follow it.

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:55.410
Distinction does not matter
if the group is abelian.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.970
So that the order of operations
doesn't make any

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.895
difference.

00:48:59.895 --> 00:49:02.070
OK, that's enough for one day.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.870
Beginning next time, know we
will start to begin this

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.220
process of synthesis.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.530
And the first thing we'll ask
is, how do you combine a

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:13.390
rotation operation with a
reflection operation?

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.640
See you next week.
