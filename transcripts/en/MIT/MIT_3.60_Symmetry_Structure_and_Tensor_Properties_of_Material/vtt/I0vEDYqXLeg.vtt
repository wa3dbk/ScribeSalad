00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.700
PROFESSOR: All right, an
announcement that I must make,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.690
after developing all these
friendships and working

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.350
together, we will, next Tuesday,
once again, enter a

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.570
brief adversarial
relationship.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.340
And we will have quiz
number two.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.970
What we will cover on that
quiz will be about 50%,

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.330
perhaps a little bit
more, on symmetry.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.630
And I'll remind you in just a
minute what we've covered

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.220
since the last quiz.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.180
And the second half or 40% of
the quiz will be on the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.550
formalism of tensors and
tensor manipulation.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.390
And obviously, you've
had a chance only to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.090
do a very few problems.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.620
So these will be pretty basic
questions and nothing tricky

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.280
or very difficult.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.460
So let me remind you very, very
quickly just by topics

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.810
what we've covered.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.950
We began the period following
the first quiz discussing how

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.440
we can take the plane groups,
two-dimensional symmetries

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.720
that are translationally
periodic, and defining a third

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.590
translation to stack up the
plane groups to give us a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.140
three-dimensional periodic

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.030
arrangement of symmetry elements.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.580
In doing so, we found that
we had to pick that third

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.360
translation such that the
symmetry elements that were in

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.080
the plane group, and those were
the things that made the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.780
lattices of the plane groups
special, made them square or

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.340
hexagonal or rectangular, that
was true because there was

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.260
symmetry there.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.210
Once again, symmetry and the
specialness of a lattice are

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.870
two inseparable parts
of the story.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.160
But if we did this,
the symmetry

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.960
elements had to coincide.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
Otherwise, we would reproduce
new symmetry elements in the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.740
base of the cell and
wreck everything.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.160
So when we did that, there were
a very limited number of

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.410
ways of doing it.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.420
In the course of doing that,
we fell headlong over screw

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.400
axis in the same way that we
fell over glide planes as soon

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.390
as we put mirror lines in a
two-dimensional lattice.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.910
The interesting thing was that
that exercise of stacking the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.580
two-dimensional plane groups
gave us almost all of the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.610
lattice types that exist
in three dimensions.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.080
And the reason for that is we
showed very directly that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.020
inversion requires nothing.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.100
So therefore, any of the point
groups that were used in

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.210
deriving the plane groups, when
augmented by inversion to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.080
give a three-dimensional point
group, are going to require

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.000
nothing more than the lattices
that we derived by stacking

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.240
the plane groups.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.800
And that took care of just about
everything except for

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.650
the cubic symmetries.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.350
And we disposed of those
in very short order.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.560
So that led us to the
14 space lattices,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.070
so-called bravais lattices.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.840
And then we proceeded to work
with those lattices and put in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.370
the point groups that could
accommodate them.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.370
Having discovered glide planes,
we then, if we had

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.700
done the process systematically,
would have

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.620
replaced mirror planes
by glide planes.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.810
And having discovered screw
axes, we replace pure rotation

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.940
by screw axis rotations.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.780
And then doing what we did but
didn't have to do very often,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.130
mercifully, for the plane
groups, we said one could also

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.350
interweave symmetry elements.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.230
And that gave a few additional
space groups.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.590
We did not derive very
many of them.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.320
What is important at this stage
is simply to realize

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.420
that their properties and
applications are very similar

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.850
to what we discovered for the
two-dimensional plane groups.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.730
The notation is a little
bit different.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.460
Because there can be symmetry
elements parallel to the plane

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.410
of the paper so that in
depicting the arrangement of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.390
symmetry elements you need a
little [? chevron-type ?]

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.830
device to indicate whether
you've got a mirror plane or a

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.340
glide plane in the
base of the cell.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.360
And similarly with two-fold
axes, and that's about the

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.460
only thing that would be in the
plane of the paper if the

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.459
principal symmetry is normal to
the paper, we need a device

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.380
for indicating the elevation
and whether the axis is a

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.490
two-fold rotation
axis or a screw.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.280
So there's a geometrical
language for describing the

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.930
arrangement of the
space groups.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.320
We had a few problems in
determining space group

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.500
symbols and interpreting
what these mean.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.420
But again, I don't think I would
be sadistic enough to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.000
ask you to derive a complicated
three-dimensional

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.380
space group.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.710
I don't know.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.300
Maybe over the weekend, if I get
to feeling mean, I might

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.740
ask you something in
those directions.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.150
But it will not be anything
terribly formidable.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.620
Then finally, we looked at the
way in which space groups can

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.890
be used to describe
three-dimensional periodic

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.100
arrays of atoms.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.560
And that again was strictly
analogous to what we did in

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.070
two dimensions.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.290
The description of the
three-dimensional arrangement

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.820
of atoms, particularly if it
is too complicated to be

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.230
readily appreciated in a
projection, would have to be

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.710
given in terms of the space
group, the type of position

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.600
that is occupied, either
special or the general

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.260
position, and then depending on
how many degrees of freedom

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.410
are available in those positions
to give you the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.480
coordinates of the element or
just the x-coordinate or the x

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.760
and y-coordinate.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.840
And then you run to the
international tables.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.840
You don't have to work
this out yourself.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.510
And you find the list of
coordinates that are related

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.590
by symmetry for that particular
special position

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.310
and then plug in x and y to get
all the coordinates of the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.560
atoms in the unit cell.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.380
To go to the practical aspects
of this, usually only simple

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:10.520
structures can be projected
with any clarity that lets

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.410
them be interpreted.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.640
And even with a computer these
days one can show an

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.210
orthographic projection of the
structure and then in real

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.850
time manipulate it so you
can see this beautiful

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.770
construction with colored
shiny spheres

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.550
in it rotating around.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.670
But if it's a complicated
structure, even that doesn't

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.340
do you very much.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.320
It works for NaCO and
zinc sulfide.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.840
But you know what
those look like.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.450
And so you don't really need
this very attractive, real

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.680
time interaction.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.167
What I found works well is to
take the structure and slice

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:52.020
it apart in layers like a
layer cake and look at a

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.590
limited range of the one
translation, generally, one of

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.440
the shorter translations, and
examine the coordination of

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.040
atoms within that layer.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.540
And so by slicing the structure
away and looking at

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.760
it in several layers that are
stacked on top of one another,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.910
the way I work between the ears,
usually lets me gain an

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.080
appreciation of what's going
on in that structure.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.530
Something different might
work for you.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.180
Matter of fact, you might be a
gifted person who can see the

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.080
things spinning around on a
computer screen and understand

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.040
exactly what it is.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.980
But everybody's mind works in
a slightly different way.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.740
OK, that is roughly what we'll
be covering on symmetry.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.770
Then we got into the connection
between symmetry

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.760
and physical properties.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.755
And we defined what we
meant by a tensor.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:46.460
A tensor of the second
rank is something

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.240
that relates to vectors.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.700
We got into a notation involving
the assumption that

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.800
any repeated subscript, and
there's subscripts all over

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.680
the place in tensor
properties.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.890
Any repeated subscript is
automatically implied to be

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.525
summed over from 1 to 3.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:14.690
We then derived the laws for
transformation of a tensor.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.970
Namely that, if you specify
the change of coordinate

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:24.890
system by a direction cosine
scheme, cij, where cij is the

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:30.810
cosine of the angle between x of
i prime and x sub j, that,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.140
since these direction cosines
constitute unit vectors, there

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.370
had to be relations
between them.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.830
Namely the sum of the squares
of the terms in any row or

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.750
column had to be unity.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.960
The sum of corresponding terms
in any row or column

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.140
had to add to 0.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.860
Because these represented dot
products of unit vectors in a

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.280
Cartesian coordinate system.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.060
And then using this array of
direction cosines, we found

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.970
that the way in which a second
ranked tensor transformed was

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.560
that each tensor element was
given by a linear combination

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.300
of all of the elements of
the original tensor.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.550
And out in front of the tensor
was a product of two direction

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:24.920
cosines, the subscripts of which
were determined by the

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.210
indices of that element.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.300
A vector could be regarded
as a first ranked tensor.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.430
And everybody understands
the law for

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.000
transformation of a vector.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.440
Namely that each component
of the vector is a linear

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.270
combination of every component
of the original vector with

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.370
one direction cosine
out in front.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.590
Tensor of second rank has a
product of two direction

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.080
cosines summed over all
the elements of

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.330
the original tensor.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.710
Third ranked tensors, which,
believe it or not, we'll get

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.340
into after the quiz in
considerable detail, and even

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.310
shudder fourth ranked tensors
are going to involve

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.090
summations that involve scads of
terms and products of three

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.120
and four direction cosines
respectively.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.890
So we won't get very
far into tensors.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:16.060
We will perhaps have a couple of
questions on the nature of

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.710
anisotropy that's implied
by these relations.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.940
And I think, if you looked at
the problem sets to this

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.520
point, that's as far as
we'll go on the quiz.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.830
And we will not throw something
at you that you've

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.850
not seen before.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.710
So it'll be merciful.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.750
We'll pull out all the stops
in the last quiz.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.290
Because then you'll
be leaving.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.270
And you can hate me.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.190
But I never have to deal
with you again.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.455
So that will not make
any difference.

00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:48.140
All right, I have handed back
all of the problem sets except

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.360
two, which are partly done.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.190
I never again will ask anybody
to draw out patterns of

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.480
rotoinversion and rotoreflection
axes.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.840
Because they go on
and on and on.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.580
And I am so tired of staring at
little circles and trying

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.340
to tell which ones are right
and which one are wrong.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.010
But that's something else
we have in common.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.770
You probably hated looking at
them when you were drawing

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.330
them out for yourself.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.610
So let me tell you what's going
to go on for the next

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.600
several days.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.680
Tomorrow is a holiday, not for
instructors who are making up

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.530
a quiz, however.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.630
So I will be in my office from
early morning on for the rest

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:26.090
of the day.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.430
So if you want to come by to ask
questions, what I will be

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.180
doing primarily is finishing up
grading the problem sets.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.170
And if you want to pick up your
problem sets and ask a

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.430
question about those, I am
there at your disposal

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.220
hopefully with no ringing phone
calls and no committee

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.180
meetings and nothing
of that sort.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.340
If I have finished the problem
sets and you haven't gotten

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.390
yours yet, what I will do is
tape an envelope to my door

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.760
and have them tucked in there.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.990
So you can come by any time over
the weekend and pick them

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.390
up if you want to get hold of
them and look them over at

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.280
your leisure.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.650
I have to tell you, looking
ahead in the schedule, I,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.420
unfortunately, bad timing, I
have to be away on Monday.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.530
So if you have a last minute
question or you need to be

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.660
calmed down from a last minute
panic, you can catch me

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.630
Tuesday morning.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.050
I'll be in all of the earlier
part of the day.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:27.450
But if you do have questions,
please come in on Friday.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.440
Because I'll have lots of
time to spend with you.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.170
So your problem sets, anything
turned in to this point and

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:39.190
turned in today, should be on my
door, if you haven't called

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.950
for it no, later than the
beginning of the week.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.430
OK, any questions?

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.620
Any puzzles that you want to go
over before we launch into

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.870
new material?

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.300
OK, what we have done with
second ranked tensor

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.900
properties is to derive a
whole set of symmetry

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.380
constraints on something aij
that represents a physical

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.640
property of a crystal.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.200
And one of the things that
we've seen, let's look at

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.300
conductivity once more since
that's something we're all

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.090
familiar with and can readily
appreciate, that the

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:25.910
components of the current
density vector depend on all

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.340
of the components of the
applied electric field,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.490
voltage per unit length.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:41.260
And in as much as for anything
other than a crystal of cubic

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.860
symmetry, the numbers in this
array, at least some of them,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.240
are different.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.530
And that gives two surprising
results.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.420
One is that the direction of
J relative to the applied

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.000
electric field will change
as you apply the field in

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.520
different directions
in the crystal.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.380
And moreover, the magnitude of
the current is going to change

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.390
as you change the orientation
of field.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.310
That's true of every crystal
in a crystal

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.560
system other than cubic.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.680
So the thing that I would like
to address today is the

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.280
interesting matter of what is
the nature of this anisotropy

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.100
and if a consequence of a second
ranked tensor relation

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.990
is that, if we apply an electric
field, the current

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.290
doesn't go in the
same direction

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.360
as the applied field.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.380
It runs off in some other
direction as non-intuitive as

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.440
that might seem.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.250
First of all, there are
two directions.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.760
If we talk about a property
varying with direction, which

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.320
direction are we talking about,
the direction of the

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.350
applied field, the direction of
the resulting current flux,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:03.420
or something halfway in between,
split the difference?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.560
Well, we can answer that
question by doing a couple of

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.140
thought experiments.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.460
Suppose we had decided that we
want to measure the electrical

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:17.560
conductivity along the 1,
0, 0 direction of an

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.770
orthorhombic crystal.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.290
What would we do?

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.640
Well, we get a hold
of that crystal.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.620
And we would cut surfaces on
it such that this was the

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.680
direction of 1, 0, 0, if that's
what we wanted to do.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:41.620
We would glom on electrodes and
put a voltage across this

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.420
crystal, this chunk of crystal
that we had cut out.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.280
So when we say we're going to
measure the property along 1,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.740
0, 0 or 1, 1, 1, what we really
mean is that we're

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.400
going to cut the crystal normal
to that direction and

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.330
then apply some sort of
electrodes or attach

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.390
some sort of probe.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.780
So when we talk about the
direction of the property, the

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.430
direction of the property will
be the direction of the

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.680
applied vector.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.990
And we had a very fancy name
for the applied vector.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.430
We said we could think of that
as a generalized force.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.510
And what happens is a
generalized displacement.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.370
Notice that, when we apply the
field, there are all sorts of

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.730
components to J. And so the
direction of the property,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.310
although we would get a number
out of this experiment, the

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.910
property really is a tensor.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:59.200
And there are nine different
quantities involved in it.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.970
OK, so the direction of the
property is going to be the

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.140
direction in which we apply
the generalized

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.220
force of the stimulus.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.640
When we do that, however, that
is going to unequivocally, at

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.980
least in this experiment, place
the electric field in a

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.740
direction along the
crystallographic orientation

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.359
of interest.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.980
Because the electric field in a
pair of electrodes like this

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.109
extends normal to those
electrodes.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:32.720
The current flow, the charge per
unit area per unit time,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.490
goes off in some direction
like this.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.310
Well, conductivity relates
current flow to applied

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.410
electric field.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.480
So would we say that the
conductivity, when we apply

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:50.510
field in that direction, is
simply J/E, magnitude of J

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.820
over magnitude of E since
these are both vectors

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.876
question mark?

00:17:55.876 --> 00:17:59.730
The answer to that, if we do
this in terms of a thought

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.550
experiment, is no.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.080
That is not what we're
measuring.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:14.060
What we can imagine is that
between our electrodes is some

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:19.213
window of unit area between
those electrodes.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.730
And what we're going to measure
as the current flow is

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:40.580
the amount of charge per unit
area per unit time that passes

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.190
between the electrodes, namely
the charge per unit area per

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.860
unit time that gets through this
window and reaches the

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.970
other electrode.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.130
That's what we're going
to measure.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:56.330
And what we're going to want
to call the conductivity is

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:02.490
the ratio of this part of the
current flux, let me call that

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:08.220
J parallel, over the magnitude
of E. And that's what we'll

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.470
mean by the conductivity in the
direction in which we've

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.440
applied the field.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.060
The actual flow of
current goes off

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.410
in some other direction.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.640
But what we measure, at least
in this experiment, is the

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.350
component of that charge flux
that goes through a window,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.540
that pair of unit area, that's
parallel to the electrode.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.440
And we don't really care if the
current is going off in a

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.430
different direction.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.000
We don't even care if it jumps
around in majestic

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.370
loop-de-loops.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.640
What we're going to measure is
the amount of that charge

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:46.380
motion that moves normal to our
window and gets through

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.190
one unit area from one
electrode to another.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.920
So the conductivity and the
direction of E then is going

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.190
to be measured by the parallel
part of the resulting

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.340
generalized displacement divided
by the magnitude of

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.970
the applied generalized force.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.920
If you're not convinced and
completely overwhelmed by

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.860
that, let me give you
another experiment.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.280
Another tensor relation, another
tensor property, is

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.070
the diffusivity of a material.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:28.840
And if you put a material in a
concentration gradient dc dx,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.580
you produce a flux of matter.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.650
And the proportionality constant
is the diffusion

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.640
coefficient.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.660
And this has units of length
per unit time if you put in

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.150
the units of the concentration
gradient and the flux.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.280
Well, dc dx is a gradient.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.070
That's a vector really.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.970
So a proper tensor relation,
instead of a scalar relation

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.890
like this, would be the change
of concentration with the i-th

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.400
coordinate.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.990
And out in front would be a
diffusion coefficient Dij.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:15.300
And this tensor relation would
give us the components of the

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.190
mass flux J1 J2 J3.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.040
Actually, thermodynamically we
shouldn't be talking about a

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.390
concentration gradient.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.640
We should be talking about a
gradient in free energy.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.380
The concentration works
well enough.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.170
And the concentration is
what one would measure.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.510
So what might a typical
experiment be?

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.110
If you wanted to know what the
diffusion was in the 1, 1, 1

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.060
direction of some crystal, you
would, again, cut a plate that

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.900
is normal to the direction
of interest.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.860
And then your boundary
conditions can be different.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.190
But what you would typically do
for a simple experiment is

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.920
to put some sort of solute on
the surface of the crystal.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.250
And what you would see after
heating the sample up for a

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.900
period of time is that the
material would have migrated

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.680
into the sample.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.820
And if you plotted concentration
as a function of

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.760
distance along the normal to
the plate that you've cut,

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.280
this would do something
like that.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.790
What can you say about this
process after you've done the

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.040
experiment?

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.970
All that you can say is that
some front of concentration

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.580
has advanced parallel
to the surface.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.780
And you have no idea what the
individual atoms have done.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.240
Then they could be doing
loop-de-loops

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.510
or little hip hops.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.750
And all that you measure is
the rate at which material

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.910
advances in the direction
of the current gradient.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.610
So again, I think I've convinced
you, hopefully, that

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:01.360
what you're measuring is the
flux of matter unit area per

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.840
unit time that is in the
direction of the applied

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.500
concentration gradient.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.880
And you do not measure, and in
fact, in this instance, I

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.830
don't think I could come up
with even a very clever

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.580
experiment that would let you
measure in a single experiment

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.380
the magnitude and direction
of the net flux.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.730
All right, so if we're measuring
a property then like

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.490
conductivity, the value of the
conductivity in the direction

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.370
of the applied field is going
to be the part of the

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.720
conductivity that is parallel
to the field divided by the

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.020
magnitude of the field.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.330
We all agree on that.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.370
Let's have a show of hands.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.050
Fine.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.440
I saw just a few tired hands
saying, OK, I believe, I

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.610
believe, let's get on with it.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.990
All right, let me now put this
using our tensor relationship

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.680
into a nice analytic form that
we can not only do something

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.400
with but can gain
some insight.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.950
The components of the charge
density vector are given by

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:20.480
the conductivity tensor sigma
1, 1 times the component of

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.460
the electric field E1 plus sigma
1, 2 times the component

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.200
of field E2 plus sigma
1, 3 times E3.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.050
Or in general, I don't have to
write out every equation.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.200
We can say that the i-th
component of J, our old friend

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.960
the second ranked tensor
property, again, is given by

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.430
sigma ij times each component
of applied field.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.820
If we specify the direction
relative to the same

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.820
coordinate system in which the
electric field is being

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:02.330
applied, we can specify that
direction by a set of three

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.160
direction cosines,
l1, l2, and l3.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.480
So we can write as the three
components of the electric

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:17.870
field E sub i as the magnitude
of E times the direction

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.390
cosines l1, l2, and l3.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.690
So here we now have
the components of

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.100
the electric field.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.080
If these are the components of
the electric field, we can say

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.500
that J sub i is going
to be equal to sigma

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.710
ij times E sub j.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.930
And I can write for E sub j the
magnitude of E times the

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.980
direction cosines l sub j
where these are the same

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.200
direction cosines of
the applied field.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.820
OK, now we have two relations in
reduced subscript form that

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.070
we can do something with.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:11.760
The magnitude of the
conductivity in the direction

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.060
of E, that is in the direction
that has direction cosines li,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.950
is going to be J parallel over
the magnitude of E. We can

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:33.630
write that as J.E, except that
involves the magnitude of J,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.980
the magnitude of E times
the cosine of the

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.350
angle between them.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.990
And so if I just want J
parallel, I'd want to divide

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.990
this by the magnitude of E. And
that will give me just the

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:53.940
part of J that falls parallel
to E. And then down here in

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.280
the denominator, I'll
have magnitude of E.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.130
So if I tidy this up a little
bit to bring everything on the

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:08.260
same level, we can write the dot
product of J and E as Ji

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:16.800
Ei, like J1 E1 plus
J2 E2 plus J3 E3.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.530
And then I will have
in the denominator

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.170
magnitude of E squared.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.805
But we know what Ei is.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.850
It's going to be magnitude
of E times li.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.060
I know how to find the i-th
component of J. That's going

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:52.790
to be sigma ij times E sub j
over magnitude of E squared.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:28:01.150
And I can write E sub j as
magnitude of E times l sub j

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:05.970
times l sub i times magnitude
of E divided by

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.960
magnitude of E squared.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.970
Magnitude of E drops out.

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.890
Again, the conductivity
is linear the way

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.740
we've defined it.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.780
It shouldn't depend on the
magnitude of E. And what I'm

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:20.290
left with then is a
very simple and a

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:21.860
rather profound relation.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:26.400
It says that in a direction
specified by the set of

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.550
direction cosines l sub i that
the magnitude of conductivity

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:41.090
in that direction is going to
be li lj times sigma ij.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.230
So that is an expression that
involves the three direction

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.530
cosines in which you're
applying the field and

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.950
measuring the property.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.440
But this is a linear combination
of every one of

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.040
the elements in the
original tensor.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.220
So if I write this out, because
this is an important

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.710
relation, it's going to be l1
squared sigma 1, 1 plus l2

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:13.550
squared sigma 2, 2 plus
l3 squared sigma 3, 3.

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.050
And then there will be
cross-terms of the form 2 l1

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:34.220
l2 sigma 1, 2 plus 2 l2 l3 times
sigma 2, 3 plus 2 l3 l1

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.360
times sigma 1, 3.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:45.730
That has made an assumption.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.470
And probably I should not have
done it at this point.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:54.430
That's assuming that the term l1
l2 sigma 1, 2 and the term

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.260
l2 l1 sigma 2, 1 can
be lumped together.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.860
And maybe I shouldn't
write it that way.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.650
Because that assumes that
the tensor is symmetric.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.440
And it doesn't have to be
for some properties.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.910
So let me back off and write
it without any assumptions.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:22.010
So this would be sigma 1, 2 l1
l2 plus sigma 1, 3 l1 l3 plus

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:32.230
sigma 2, 1 times l2 l1 and then
corresponding terms--

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.080
let me put this one
down here--

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:43.010
sigma 2, 1 times l2 l1 plus
sigma 3, 1 l3 l1.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.030
And then the one that I'm
missing is sigma 2, 3 times l2

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:52.900
l3 plus sigma 3,
2 times l2 l3.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.950
So there is an explicit
statement of this more compact

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:03.840
expression written in reduced
subscript notation.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.010
OK, so this is something that is
going to tell us in a very

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:13.970
neat sort of way what the
anisotropy of the property is.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.090
You pick the direction in
which you're interested.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:19.860
And this will tell you the value
of the property in that

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.570
direction and, therefore, by
inference how things will

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.900
change with direction.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.600
Let me quickly, and then I'll
pause to see if you have any

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:38.090
questions, give you an
interpretation of the meaning

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.770
of some of these elements
of the tensor.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.750
We've really not been
able to do that.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.710
We've been able to use them to
give the value of the property

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:49.750
in a given direction but not
their individual meaning.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:56.320
Suppose I ask what the value of
the property would be along

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.070
the x1 direction.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.810
So suppose we ask what value of
the conductivity would we

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:07.960
measure along x1 for a given
tensor sigma ij.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.580
If that is the case,
l1 is equal to 1.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:16.510
The angle between the
x1 axis and x2 is 0.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.160
So l2 is 0.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.950
90 degrees cosine of
90 degrees is zero.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.270
l3 would be equal to 0.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:29.060
So if I put this set of
direction cosines into this

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.720
complicated polynomial,
the term l1 squared

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.530
sigma 1, 1 stays in.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.010
But l2 is 0.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.200
l3 is 0.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.030
And I've got either an l2 or an
l3 or both in all of these

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.090
other terms.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:49.260
So along the x1 direction, the
only term that stays in is

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:56.170
sigma 1, 1 squared
times l1 squared.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:57.830
But l1 is unity.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:08.390
So along the x1 direction the
value of sigma is sigma 1, 1.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.980
And by inference the value of
the property that we would

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.400
measure along x2 would
be sigma 2, 2.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.660
And the value of the property
along x3, guess

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.780
what, sigma 3, 3.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.620
So in this three by three array
of numbers for sigma ij,

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:31.260
there's a very direct meaning
to the diagonal

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.540
values of the tensor.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.860
These are the values that you
would measure along x1, along

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.580
x2, and along x3 directly.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:49.190
So the off diagonal terms are
going to be saying something

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.700
about how the extreme values
of the property are aligned

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.505
relative to our reference
axes.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.370
OK, any comment or questions
at this point?

00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:24.000
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we've defined
those as the cosines of the

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.840
angles between the
reference axes.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.870
And this is the direction in
which we're applying our

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.590
electric field or our
generalized forced temperature

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.300
gradient, concentration
gradient, magnetic field, or

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.550
what have you.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.870
OK, I've got some time left.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:14.260
So let me push this further into
a different form by using

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:20.165
the elements of the tensor to
define a locus in space.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.710
Again, what I'll do is something
that may seem silly.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.080
But we'll see that there are
some very useful and profound

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.720
conclusions to be
drawn from it.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:42.520
Let me take the elements of
the tensor and use them as

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.640
coefficients to define
a surface.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.790
I'm going to take sigma 1, 1 and
multiply it by the product

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:56.610
of the coordinate x1 times x1.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:59.720
What I'm viewing this
now is a variable.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.340
I'm going to take sigma 2,
2 and multiply it by the

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.330
coordinate x2 and x2 again.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:13.620
Sigma 3, 3 and I multiply
that by x3 times x3.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.940
And then I'll have these
cross-terms, sigma 1, 2, x1,

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.240
x2, and so on.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.340
Or in short, I'm going
to define a

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.590
function sigma ij xi xj.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.360
And xi and xj are running
variables.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.110
x1, x2, x3, they can extend
from 0 to infinity.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:45.980
But now I'm going to take this
sum of nine terms and I'm

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.455
going to set it equal
to a constant.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.470
And what constant could be
neater and cleaner and more

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.990
abstract than unity?

00:36:55.990 --> 00:37:01.420
But I could say that some
function of x1, x2, x3 equal

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.880
to a constant is going to define
a locus of points in

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.470
space, which satisfy
that equation.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.760
And we do that all the time.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.420
We specify some functional
relationship that defines in

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:23.115
the space some surface f of
xi xj equals a constant.

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:25.230
And that's done all time
in mathematics.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.340
I've yet to encounter yet a
department of mathematics that

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.440
did not have in its corridors
some glass case that was

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.200
filled with yellowing plaster
figures, that some of them

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:41.210
cracking or already cracked,
that represented exotic

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:45.220
surfaces, like elliptic
paraboloids and

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.750
things of that sort.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.350
I think the last time I walked
down the corridor of building

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.450
two there really was one of
those in our mathematics

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.300
department in the little door
that opened out onto the great

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.410
court about halfway down
that corridor.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.405
But you've seen these things I'm
sure, elliptic cylinders,

00:38:01.405 --> 00:38:03.880
elliptic cones, and all sorts
of glorious things.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.320
This function, though, is
a very special one.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.470
This is a quadratic equation
in the second order of

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:17.660
coordinates.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.280
And this is referred to
as a quadratic form.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.510
And sometimes for short, since
that's something of a

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.555
mouthful, one refers to
this as a quadric.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:42.480
And we are going to very shortly
demonstrate that this

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.480
particular function tells you
everything you could possibly

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.650
want to know about the variation
of a tensor property

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:55.650
with direction, how the
magnitude of the property

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.510
changes, how the direction of
the resulting current flow or

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.660
flux is oriented.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.305
And this is, consequently,
called, when applied to a

00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:07.100
tensor, the representation
quadric.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.310
Because it really does represent
anything you would

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.350
like to know about the
physical property.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:30.440
This will be demonstrated
in short order.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.410
Let's first notice, though, that
there's only a limited

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:44.660
number of surfaces that can be
represented by this equation.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.390
One of them is one
that we're all

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.500
familiar with, an ellipsoid.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.430
And that's most easily
represented when we've

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.400
referred it to the principal
axes of the ellipsoid.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:05.070
So an ellipsoid is
a quasi-sausage

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.730
like thing like this.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:13.250
These sections perpendicular
to x3, x1, and x2 are all

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.330
ellipsoids.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:24.800
And if this semi-axis is a and
this semi-axis is b and this

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:31.690
semi-axis is c, the equation of
the surface in that special

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:38.110
orientation is x1 squared over a
squared plus x2 squared over

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:43.280
b squared plus x3 squared
over c squared equals 1.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.980
OK, the surface that
we have defined

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.070
involves tensor elements.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:04.150
And if the equation is ever
going to get into this form,

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.640
we've had to get rid of
these cross-terms.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.710
And we are going to have
principal axes that are some

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.800
function of the tensor elements
that would be out

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:22.820
here in the form of some
aggregate sigma ij prime.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.730
So we'll have to see how one
could go from a tensor that

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.090
describes an ellipsoid in
a general orientation to

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:33.190
something that has been
diagonalized and has the

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.450
coordinate system taken along
the principal axes.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.460
But that's only one
possible surface

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.710
that we could encounter.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:51.830
The second one is one that we
might encounter that, when we

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:58.520
put it in diagonal form, has
this form, x1 squared over a

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:07.580
squared plus x2 squared over b
squared minus z squared over c

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.430
squared equals 1.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.695
This is something that
has a peculiar shape.

00:42:17.695 --> 00:42:21.948
It's sort of an hourglass
like figure.

00:42:21.948 --> 00:42:24.870
It has an ellipsoidal
cross-section.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:28.906
This is x3.

00:42:28.906 --> 00:42:29.860
This is x1.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.275
This is x2.

00:42:31.275 --> 00:42:36.020
It has an ellipsoidal section
perpendicular to x3.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.950
But it has, as a cross-section
in planes that are parallel to

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.680
x3, paraboloids.

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.180
And the shape of the paraboloids
depends on which

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.500
particular section that
you take through x3.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.380
This is a surface that's
called a hyperboloid.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.110
And it's all one continuous
surface.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:09.560
So this is called a hyperboloid
of one sheet,

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.775
sheet in the sense of surface.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.520
And then down in here when x3
is 0, it would again be an

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.400
ellipsoidal cross-section but a
little bit smaller than when

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.600
we increase x3 above 0.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:39.920
OK, and the other surface,
another surface, a third kind

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:48.470
of surface is something that
occurs when the terms in front

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:56.390
of two coordinates are negative,
x2 squared over b

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:01.160
squared x3 squared over
c squared equals 1.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.380
This is something that
looks like two

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.680
surfaces nose to nose.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:16.140
The cross-section of these two
different sheets are ellipsis.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:20.180
The cross-sections
passing through--

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:20.580
let's see.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.990
This would be the
shape for x1.

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.250
That would be the special
direction.

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.320
And then this could
be x2 and this x3.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.500
OK, this is called an
hyperboloid of two sheets.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:55.850
And it has the property that the
distance to the surface in

00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:01.530
orientations in between the
asymptotes of these hyperbolic

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.476
sections, these radii,
are imaginary.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.140
And between the asymptotes, if
we take a section, we would

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:28.380
have two hyperboloids
in a cross-section.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.320
And again, a range of directions
between the

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.700
asymptotes in which the radius
would be imaginary in

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.020
directions along the coordinate
which has the

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.370
positive sign we'd have
a minimum radius.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.890
And this would get progressively
larger and go to

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.545
infinity along the asymptote.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:00.200
Finally, there's a third
surface in which, by

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:09.170
extension, all three terms
in x1, x2, and x3

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.535
have negative signs.

00:46:16.095 --> 00:46:17.690
And what does this look like?

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.378
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:19.378 --> 00:46:20.360
PROFESSOR: No, it does.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.220
It's something that's called
an imaginary ellipsoid.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:34.140
So called because the radius in
all direction is imaginary.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.290
And what does it look like?

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.100
You just have to use
your imagination.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.710
That's all.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:41.610
Because it's an imaginary
ellipsoid.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:45.030
Is that something that we could
ever get if we were

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:50.960
using the elements of
a property tensor?

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.220
The answer, he says with
a big wink, yes.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.960
It's unusual but yes.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.140
You can get physical properties
whose magnitude as

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:04.495
a function of direction
do this.

00:47:04.495 --> 00:47:09.260
All right, I think that is
a sufficiently formal and

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.340
deadening component to our
presentation that it would be

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.280
appropriate to take a break
and stretch a little bit.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.960
When we return, I will show
you an amazing connection

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:29.290
between the anisotropy of a
physical property and this

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:30.750
representation surface.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.720
So called because it
tells you how the

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.430
property is going to change.
