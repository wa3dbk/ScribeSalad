00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.840
PROFESSOR: --not of the
vindictive sort.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.790
You skip class, you've skipped
a lot of important stuff.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.220
But I'll get you on the
quiz, that's all.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.300
Kidding aside, there were
a number of things

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.530
that I passed out.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.530
I think nobody needs a set
of problem set number 13.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.440
That was the one that had
something on symmetry

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.645
constraints and working with
second-rank tensors.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:45.020
If anybody missed that, you
can see me during break.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.430
Some people, I think, missed
problem set 14.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.200
And that's the one where you
are invited to diagonalize

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.260
some tensors, either using
the method of successive

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.705
approximations or the direct
diagonalization-

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.710
by-an-eigenvalue procedure.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.540
Anybody need one of that?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.570
And I'm sure that nobody has a
copy of problem set number 15,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.310
which deals with
piezoelectricity.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.880
And I know you don't
have it, because

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.450
I just put it together.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.930
So I'd like to hand it out and
invite you to explore things

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.090
that deal with third-rank
tensors.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.510
And I hope that, even though
doing the problem sets is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.120
optional, particularly at this
juncture in the semester when

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.580
things have come to a set
of successive crunches.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.250
But if you don't know how to
do it, for goodness' sakes,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.920
come see me.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.546
Or raise it in our next class.

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:47.130
You know, some question like,
I haven't the foggiest idea

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.430
how to do problem number two.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.220
Could you say a little bit
about that, please?

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.470
And I'd be happy to oblige.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.800
All right.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.760
I will have for you next time
the quizzes and also all the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.800
problem sets which will
have been turned

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.480
in up to that point.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.280
And what I spent my time doing
instead is writing out notes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.750
for those people who missed
the last lecture, and also

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.480
notes covering what we're
going to do today.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
Because it is very exquisitely
intensive, algebraically.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.810
It's not hard, but there are a
lot of variables with a lot of

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.960
subscripts.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.696
So let me pass this around.

00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:30.740
I'll split it up into packs.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.240
These are notes on some basic
relations in electromagnetism

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.095
which you may or may
not have forgotten.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.480
Take one off the top.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.850
And it's coming at you from
either side, so you're going

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.770
to pass it back.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.590
And the notes also cover
everything that we're going to

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.170
do on piezoelectricity.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.450
Most of it will take
place today.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.840
And I can zip along a little
more rapidly if you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.351
have notes to follow.

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:04.510
I would like to ask you when you
get a set of the notes--

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.730
I could really kick myself--

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.630
the introductory discussion
reminds you of the definition

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.130
of a dipole.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.750
And down in the middle of the
page, on the cover sheet, two

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.040
different types of
polarizability are defined.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.410
And one of them involves the
separation of charge on an

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.050
individual atom.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.680
And that is called, quite
appropriately, the electronic

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.880
polarizability because it
involves polarization of the

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.140
electrons and protons on
the individual atoms.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.600
And then there's another type of
induced dipole moment that

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.190
comes when the structure
is ionic.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.160
And then an electric field will
pull positive ions in one

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.180
direction and negative ions
in the opposite direction.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.510
And that is very often referred
to as the ionic

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.920
polarizability.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.870
And it's easy to keep
them straight.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.890
One involves electrons,
which all atoms have.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.510
The other involves ions.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.720
And not all structures and
materials have ions.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.329
So the second one is unique
to ionic structures.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.170
And then, these are sometimes
also referred to as the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.910
dielectric polarizability.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.890
And I meant to purge that
from the notes.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.690
And as I put this together to
xerox it, I grabbed the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.770
uncorrected sheet.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.090
So please, just below you see
the displaced positive and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.710
negative ion on the middle
of the page, cross out

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.730
"dielectric" polarizability.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.140
And change that to "ionic"
polarizability.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.680
And I didn't catch that.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.070
There's one other little typo
as we go partway through.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.010
In any case, we'll talk about
third-rank tensor properties.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.430
We'll introduce some other
ones other than

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.460
piezoelectricity later on.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.050
But piezoelectricity is one of
the primary examples of a

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.960
third-rank tensor property.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.450
And it's one that has a lot of
applications in devices--

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:16.000
pressure sensors, audio
equipment, electronic devices.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.340
It's a very important property
in terms of devices and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.710
present-day technology.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.530
But there are others.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.670
And we'll cover those
in due course.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.480
Some of them are
rather exotic.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.710
OK.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.170
But to review these basic
concepts in electromagnetism,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.650
we remind you again of the
definition of a dipole.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.350
We mentioned this last time.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.770
But to quickly review, a dipole
is a pair of charges of

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.510
opposite sign but equal
magnitude, separated by a

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.580
separation, d.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.750
And then one defines a dipole
moment, which has a vector

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.700
character, as the product
of one of the charges of

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.240
magnitude, q.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.940
And the vector that separates
the two charges in the sense

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.200
of the vector is defined as
going from the negative charge

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.160
and pointing towards the
positive charge.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.490
It's purely a definition.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.360
But the reason it's convenient
is that the vector sense and

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.490
the product of charge and
separation comes up again and

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.830
again in all sorts of
problems, among them

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.550
definition of the piezoelectric
effects.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.480
Also a dipole in an electric
field is going to experience a

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.760
torque because the electric
field will pull on the

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.790
positive charge in the
same direction.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.190
It will pull on the negative
charge in the opposite

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.230
direction from the field.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.760
And that's going to create a
torque on this little gizmo.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.970
OK.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.660
Now it's important, too--

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.830
and interesting to note-- that
there are three different

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.040
kinds of dipole moments.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.120
There are some molecules--

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.030
and water is the primary
example.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.070
Water has seen an asymmetrical
arrangement of hydrogen,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.780
relative to the oxygen ion to
which they are connected.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.890
And that gives water a permanent
dipole moment, which

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.290
is what makes water such
a darn good solvent.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.990
And its ability to dissolve
primordial juices probably

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.280
accounts for our fact,
intelligent design

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.080
notwithstanding, of why
we are here today.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.520
On the other hand, dipoles, as
I was just saying, can be

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.750
induced when you impose an
electric field on matter.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.190
And these are of two kinds.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.580
One is the dipole moment
that is induced on

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.180
an individual atom.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.270
And that results in displacement
of the positive

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.250
nucleus relative to the negative
electron shell.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.450
It's found that the dipole
moment is proportional to the

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.590
magnitude of the
electric field.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.350
And the proportionality
constant, alpha, is called the

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.930
polarizability.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.900
And for an individual atom, as
I said a moment ago, it's

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.660
defined as the electronic
polarizability.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:13.620
We write it as a scalar
quantity, but actually, by now

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.390
you're probably sensitized to
being a little bit skeptical

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.530
when things that relate
to vectors are

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.440
described as a scalar.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.710
And in fact, the electronic
polarizability is not a

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:25.760
scalar, it's a tensor.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.510
And one should really write that
the i-th component of the

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.240
dipole moment is given by
alpha i,j times the j-th

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.500
component of the
electric field.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.370
Second type of induced dipole
moment involves, again as we

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.290
said a moment ago, the effect of
imposing an electric field

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.420
on an ionic structure.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.880
And again, the field will pull
the positive ions in one

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.590
direction and negative
ions in the other.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.292
And here quite clearly, if
this pair of ions is in a

00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:03.050
structure, and that structure
has some symmetry, we really

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.510
have to consider this second
origin to induce dipole

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.120
moments as a tensor.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.400
And this is referred to as
the ionic polarizability.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.750
So both of these types of dipole
moments will be present

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.240
in matter, in general.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.440
The relative importance of each
depends on whether the

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.480
electric field is a static
field or an oscillatory

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.870
electric field.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.680
And then the frequency
dependence of these two

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.780
polarizabilities has a
consequence on the magnitude

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.470
for fields of different
frequencies.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:46.130
And not surprisingly, the
ability of the ions in the

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.910
structure to polarize is
going to poop out with

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.580
high-frequency electric fields
a lot quicker than just the

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.280
displacement of the
light electrons

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.240
about a positive nucleus.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.950
So there is a frequency
dependence of the net

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.230
polarizability.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.350
We won't go into that.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.720
But just keep in mind that at
very high-frequency electric

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.210
fields, the ionic polarizability
will damp out.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.060
OK.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.810
Then we went through a rather
simplified but amusing model

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.970
for the electronic
polarizability.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.870
And there's some rather severe
assumptions that are made.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.730
But making those assumptions
let's you get a rigorous

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.040
result, which tells you
something about the electronic

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.920
polarizability.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.590
So we model the electron
distribution on the atom as a

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:44.820
uniform charge density in a
distribution that goes up to

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.280
some radius, r, and
then quits.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.710
So there's a sharp cutoff to the
distribution of electrons,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.350
which is obviously ridiculous.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.510
You know there are a collection
of wave functions

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.450
that give you charge
probabilities that tail off

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.830
slowly to large distances,
getting progressively smaller

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.680
and smaller.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.950
So this is not terribly
realistic.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.820
And then the other thing we
assume to make this model,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.580
something that we can solve
exactly, is that the nucleus

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.160
and the electron distribution
displace as units.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.270
In other words, we start with
a sphere of electrons, the

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.240
center displaces, but it stays
a sphere of uniformly

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.150
distributed electrons.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:28.710
And then having made those
assumptions and having lost

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.910
any credibility for the model,
if we carry through to see

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.290
what the model predicts, it's
rather interesting.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.560
We use a fact, again, known
to freshman and sophomore

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.200
students of electromagnetism,
that a charge inside of a

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.400
uniform distribution of charge
experiences no force.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.970
And that's surprising, but it's
something that you are

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.820
very often invited to
do on problem sets.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.670
So therefore, if the center of
the electron distribution is

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.880
displaced from the nucleus,
then the restoring force

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.350
between the electron sphere and
the nucleus is simply the

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:16.180
coulombic force between a
nucleus of charge plus ze, and

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.050
a fraction of the total number
of electrons, namely that

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.020
fraction of the electrons which
are contained within a

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.740
sphere that has a radius equal
to the displacement.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.940
And that geometry and that
algebra's carried out for you

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.080
on the bottom of
the first page.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.540
If you set that up and ask what
the dipole moment will

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.020
be, it comes out beautifully
simple.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.230
It comes out to be equal to
whatever proportionality

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.380
constant you use in
Coulomb's law.

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:51.540
I use rationalized MKS units
from force of habit.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.160
So there's a 4 pi epsilon 0 in
there, then times the cube of

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.310
the radius of the electron
distribution, times the

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.540
electric field.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.900
So the two items of note that
come out of this simplified

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.820
treatment is first of all, the
induced dipole moment is

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.790
proportional to the applied
electric field, which is what

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.290
we assumed.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.340
And so therefore, the
polarizability, which is the

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.410
quantity that relates the dipole
moment to the magnitude

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.900
of the field, is a constant.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.530
And it turns out to be
equal to 4 pi epsilon

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.590
0, times the radius.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:36.250
So not only does this tell
us that the electronic

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:42.525
polarizability is something that
relates dipole moment in

00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:45.520
direct proportion to the
magnitude of the field.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.240
And secondly, the electronic
polarizability involves the

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.340
radius of the charge
distribution, cubed.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:57.410
And even on a qualitative basis,
this is interesting.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.550
It tells you that
high-atomic-number, big, fat

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:06.930
ions are going to have a very,
very large polarizability.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.570
And things way down in the
periodic table, like beryllium

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:18.440
and lithium, and other low-z
atoms, are going to be tough

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.620
little nuts that don't display
much polarization at all.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.360
And in point of fact, several
individuals have tabulated

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.580
empirical sets of electronic
polarizabilities.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.260
One of the earliest ones are
the so-called TKS values

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.340
published a long time ago
by Tessman, Kahn,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.170
and "Wild Bill" Shockley.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.740
And I give you the reference
to those.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.950
There is another set of values
that were assembled by a

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.020
fellow at DuPont named
Bob Shannon.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.880
And I'll give you a citation
to those values.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.080
But in any case, if you look at
these values, you find that

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.900
the cation that has highest
electronic polarizability is

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.680
thallium, way down on the bottom
of the periodic table,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.750
next to lead.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.780
And that's just a big, fat,
flabby atom that can be

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.120
deformed very, very easily.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.490
How do you get these
polarizabilities?

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.420
Well, the equations at the
bottom of page two-- which we

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.620
won't make any use of but,
nevertheless, will tell you

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.010
where they come from--

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.500
there's a relation between the
square of the index of

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.730
refraction and the sum of the
polarizabilities of the

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.330
individual species, times the
number of those species per

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.760
unit volume.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.890
And that is something that's
called the Lorentz-Lorenz

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.780
equation, equation.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.040
I can't resist saying
everything

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.870
twice, Lorenz and Lorentz.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.890
You can put this in another
form that involves the

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.170
molecular weight of a molecular
structure and the

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.685
polarizability per molecule.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.450
It's the same equation, but
for organic compounds.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.190
It's a useful form.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:15.100
And it turns out that the
dielectric constant of the

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.540
material is directly related to
the square of the index of

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.740
refraction.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:25.540
So you can write those two
equations in terms of either

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.590
the dielectric constant or
the index of refraction.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.780
And if you substitute dielectric
constant in place

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.070
of n squared in those
equations, the

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.390
equations get new names.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.060
And they're not called the

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.610
Lorentz-Lorenz equation, equations.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.290
They're called the
Clausius-Mossotti equations,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:48.880
which shows you that sometimes
fame and immortality can be

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.850
gained simply by a trivial
substitution of variables.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.590
Nice to keep in mind if you can
find something like that.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.990
Finally, we don't see
dipole moments on

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:03.050
individual atoms or molecules.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.630
We see evidence of polarization
in bulk.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:12.906
And on page three is a little
model that reminds you of what

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:17.390
the polarization of
a material is.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.119
And that's defined as
simply the dipole

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.109
moment per unit volume.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.050
And that's represented
by a capital P rather

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.099
than a small p.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:30.800
And this is also a
vector quantity.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.660
And we can see how this is
related to the individual

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:39.850
dipole moments in the solid by
dividing the solid up into

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.460
individual cells.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.130
And I use the term of
"cell" loosely.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.320
Is this a unit cell?

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.720
Is this a box around
each of the atoms?

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.370
It really doesn't matter.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.700
Because all of these little
dipoles on the individual unit

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:58.860
cells are packed together back
to front in the solid.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.750
So internally, the negative
end of one induced dipole

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.990
moment is always adjacent to
the positive end of the

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.470
neighboring dipole moment.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.060
And everything cancels out
internally, except for the two

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.500
surfaces of the solid.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.230
So macroscopically, if you
impose an electric field and

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.900
it induces dipole moments, what
happens is you see that

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.060
there is a charge on
the surface of

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.020
the piece of material.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.230
And that is a real charge.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.570
It's a bound charge.

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.410
You can't draw that charge
off as a current.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.620
Because the minute you reduce
and eliminate the electric

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.390
field, those dipoles
disappear.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.710
And the charges all go back
to where they came from.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.760
So this is the thing that keeps
the exact model that we

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.270
use for one of the cells in the
solid [INAUDIBLE] of no

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.950
importance whatsoever.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.050
You could say that the dipole
moment on each atom is the

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.570
charge times the separation
of the positive

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.160
and negative charge.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.760
And qi is the induced charge.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.480
The number of cells per unit
volume, if we say that they're

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.620
little cubes of the same edge
length, delta, is unit volume

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.050
one divided by the volume
per cell, which

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.910
will be delta cubed.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.670
And the dipole moment per unit
volume is the number of cells

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.300
per unit volume times the
polarization on each.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.410
And you find that everything
drops out.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:29.840
And the polarization indeed
turns out to be equal to

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.690
induced charge per unit area,
whether that's induced charge

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.570
per unit area of one of our
cells or on a square

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.930
centimeter of material.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:45.560
So polarization, dipole moment
per unit volume is numerically

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.470
equal to, and physically
equivalent to, an induced

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.480
charge per unit area.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:55.480
OK.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.960
So much for freshman

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.810
electromagnetism in fast forward.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.100
And now I'd like to turn to
something that involves

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.530
tensors and materials.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.380
As I mentioned a moment ago,
piezoelectricity, literally

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.990
"pressure electricity," is a
very technologically important

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:22.320
property, useful property, but
also provides a nice example

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.400
of a tensor property that has
to be defined in terms of a

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.880
sensor of third rank.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.310
There are a number of different

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:33.410
piezoelectric effects.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.165
The first one is the so-called
direct piezoelectric effect.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:53.020
And it refers to the fact that
if you subject a material to

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.160
an applied stress, it will
develop a surface charge.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.460
Remove the applied stress, the
surface charge goes away.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.600
The surface charge can be
described in terms of a

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:11.390
polarization, a dipole moment
per unit volume.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.800
And it will be in direct
proportion to a stress

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.400
tensor sigma j,k.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.700
And so what we'll assume--

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.210
and this is an assumption.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:30.210
And it's followed, except for
very extreme conditions, that

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:36.070
each component of the
polarization, p sub i, is

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.960
given by a linear combination
of every one of the nine

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.900
elements of stress, sigma i,j.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.000
Oops, not i,j.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.080
I have to use a different
index.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.880
I'm used to writing i,j.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.250
So each component of the
polarization, where i ranges

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.660
from 1 to 3, is given by a
linear combination of all nine

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.950
of the elements of stress,
sigma j,k.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:08.520
And the proportionality
constants, di,j,k, are known

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.630
as the piezoelectric moduli.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.230
And this is called the direct
piezoelectric effect.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:19.440
OK.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:24.290
That's simply an assumption
that the polarization is

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.620
proportional to the
applied stress.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.920
We know that stress,
however, is a field

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.870
tensor of second rank.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:38.550
We know that the polarization
has the character of a vector,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.460
charge times the length.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.980
We know how second-rank
tensors transform.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.230
We know how first-rank
tensors transform.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.540
And therefore, knowing that,
we can say that the

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:56.980
coefficients, the array of
coefficients, di,j,k, will

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.090
transform like a third-rank
tensor.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.530
And therefore they
are a tensor.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.840
So we will have three components
of polarization.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.380
And we will have nine components
of stress.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.776
And so there will be 27
piezoelectric moduli, di,j,k.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:24.940
So things go up rapidly
in terms of number of

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.560
coefficients as the rank
of a tensor increases.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:37.320
Now let's take a look at the
nature of these equations.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.550
We'll have, for example, the x1
component of P being given

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:52.030
by d1,1,1 times the element
of stress sigma 1,1.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:24:00.450
The next term will be d1,2,2
times sigma 2,2.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.640
I'm putting down the tensor
components first.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.060
But this is just an equation.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.580
I can write the terms
in any order.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:13.370
Next will be a d1,3,3
times sigma 3,3.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:26.130
And the next one would be a
d1,2,3 times a shear component

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:31.436
of stress sigma 2,3
and other terms.

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:33.540
I don't want to write out
all nine of them.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.870
Because I think I have written
enough to make my point.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.850
The point is that the value
of i is always tied to the

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:48.680
component of the resulting
vector that we're defining.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.940
But the second pair of
subscripts, j and k, always go

00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:01.320
together as an unseparable pair
with the component of

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.710
stress that they modify.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.070
So the 1,1 here goes
with the 1,1.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.720
The 2,2 goes with the 2,2.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.720
The 3,3 goes with the 3,3.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.680
So why in the world, if they're
always going to go

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:19.930
together, do we have to use
two indices to define the

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.250
piezoelectric moduli?

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.210
Why don't we use a
single symbol?

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.960
Well, there is a good reason
for not doing it.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:29.260
But we'll issue that
caveat later on.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:34.610
We could use an a, a b, and a c,
or an alpha or a beta or a

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.910
gamma, or some other
esoteric symbol.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.620
But what makes sense since we're
using Arabic numerals to

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:49.300
represent subscripts, let's
write the pair of indices in

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:55.410
terms of an index that's related
to the stress tensor,

00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:00.280
which is sigma 1,1;
sigma 2,2; sigma--

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.500
whoops.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.940
Sigma 1,2; sigma 1,3.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:08.420
And then comes sigma 2,1; sigma
2,2; sigma 2,3; sigma

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.280
3,1; sigma 3,2; sigma 3,3.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:19.410
We know that this is
a symmetric tensor.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.420
So these off-diagonal
terms are always

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.710
equal to one another.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.890
So we're numerically going
to have to enter

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.050
each of those twice.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:35.310
So to define a single index
that represents the

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.130
components of stress.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.820
And I'll describe it in this
fashion so you can remember,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.290
as a mnemonic device, what
makes this work.

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.740
We'll go down the main diagonal
of the stress tensor,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.960
this fashion.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.440
And then having reached the
bottom, we'll go up along the

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.940
right-hand side and then jog
over to the left to pick up

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.010
the last term.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.310
And we'll define a number
associated with these indices

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:10.060
that goes in the form 1 to 2,
to 3, to 4, to 5, to 6.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:19.150
So we'll just use these three
integers, ranging from 1 to 6,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:24.480
to represent pairs of integers
in the stress tensor.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.970
So things tidy up quite
nicely then.

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:38.120
This would be P1 is d1,1 times
sigma 1; plus d1,2 times sigma

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:48.540
2; plus d1,3 times sigma 3;
plus d1,4 times sigma 4.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.070
And now, uh-oh, Houston.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:56.040
We've got a problem.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.530
Because there's another
term in here that is

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:03.750
d1,3,2 times sigma 3,2.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:09.280
And sigma 3,2 is required,
because the stress tensor is

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.400
symmetric, to be numerically
equal to sigma 2,3.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:23.510
So this is really d1,2,3
times sigma 2,3.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.820
And then we've got a d1,3,2
times a sigma 3,2.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.260
I know that this is
equal to this.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:41.780
But is there any reason d1,2,3
has to be equal to d1,3,2?

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.420
I can't see any reason why.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:45.610
OK.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:49.230
Let me confide in you that,
yes, they are equal.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:53.150
But we can't show it or claim it
on the basis of what we've

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.000
got before us right now.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
It's going to come later.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.200
But we can show that
they are equal.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.420
OK.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:04.210
But equal or not, this means
we'll have a term d1,4 sigma

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.900
4, and we're going to get
it in there twice.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.580
So when the subscripts go up to
4, we're going to get a 2

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.280
out in front.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:21.770
And then we'll get for the term
sigma 1,3 and 3,1 we'll

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.850
have a d1,5 times a sigma 5.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.160
This would be sigma 1,3.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.320
And then we'd have another
d1,5 for sigma 5 again.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.870
And this would be sigma 3,1.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:38.760
So what are we going to do?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.280
We're going to say, well, it's
nice we're getting rid of an

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.350
unneeded subscript.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:49.100
P1 is the d1,1 times sigma 1;
plus d1,2 times sigma 2; plus

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.260
d1,3 times sigma 3.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:58.580
Are we then going to say 2 d1,4
times sigma four, and say

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.900
that the coefficient here
is di,j when i is

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.180
equal to 1, 2, 3.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:12.030
But the coefficient is 2 di,j
when j is 4, 5, or 6?

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.060
Hell of a matrix
that would be.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.900
That's going to be a bother.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.140
Since it doesn't seem that
we can measure these two

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:28.070
coefficients, d1,2,3 and d1,3,2,
independently anyhow,

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.390
let's just write our relation in
reduced subscripts with the

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:38.370
two added together as
the element d1,4.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:50.280
So we are going to define d1,4
equals d1,3,2 plus d1,2,3.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.780
So that's a definition.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:31:01.380
And d1,5 will be defined as the
sum of d1,1,3 plus d1,3,1.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.480
And we're going to define
d1,6, finally,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.820
as d1,1,2 plus d1,2,1.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.200
OK.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.930
So if we do that, then and only
then are we entitled to

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:24.390
write a nice, simple, compact
little nugget that says that

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:32.940
in our redefined form,
Pi is equal to di,j

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.350
times sigma of j.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:45.095
And i goes from 1 to 3, and
j goes from 1 to 6.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.890
And this is kind of
a neat compact,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.830
easily managed outcome.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.510
So the moral of this story is,
I like to think, is you can

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.890
have your cake if
you eat its 2.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.170
Oh come on, this is a
tough, tough crowd.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.950
You're just all worn out
from the MRS meeting.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.240
That'll do it to anybody.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.970
So why do we worry about the
fact that to the direct

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:28.150
piezoelectric effect should
be a third-rank tensor?

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:33.130
The answer, my friends, is
that this is no longer a

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.450
tensor relationship.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.170
It's a matrix relationship.

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.800
A tensor is a matrix, but it's
a matrix with a difference.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.830
It's a matrix for which a law of
transformation is defined,

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.660
if you change axes.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.200
There's no such law defined
for the di,j's.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.910
So they qualify as a matrix,
but they are not a tensor.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:02.950
So to attempt to say-- as you
might be inclined to do when

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.490
we raise the issue of what the
symmetry restrictions are on

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:07.580
these tensors--

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.980
if you attempt to say, well, I'm
going to find d2,1 prime.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:16.785
And that's going to be
c2,i c1,j times di,j.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:20.650
Wrong.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.850
You go down in flames because
that's just nonsense.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.940
That's just nonsense.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.040
So this is a matrix relation.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.320
And if you want to do exercises
such as slice a

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.930
piezoelectric wafer out of a
piece of quartz, and then

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:43.930
having done so, refer the
properties to axes taken along

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.770
those edges of the plate that
you've cut, you've got to-- in

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.540
order to find the piezoelectric
moduli for that

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.500
plate in that new coordinate
system--

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.700
you've got to be prepared always
to go back to the full

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.500
tensor notation.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.370
If you want to derive symmetry
restrictions, which we're

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.790
going to do whether you
want to or not--

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.389
but we won't do them
exhaustively--

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:13.250
you've got to go from this
matrix notation back to the

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.789
full three-subscript
tensor notation.

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:17.650
OK?

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:17.940
Yes, sir?

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.814
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you extend c
sub i,k's to be [? 3,6's ?]

00:34:20.814 --> 00:34:23.690
and extend most others
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:24.540
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.310
No, if we would write all
these down, we'd have--

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.330
I don't know if that's what
you're asking-- but we'd have

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:35.739
P1 is equal to d1,j times sigma
sub j; P2 is equal to

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:41.320
d2,j sigma sub j; and
P3 is equal to d3,j

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.620
times sigma sub j.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.980
So I just did that for the
line with i equal to 1,

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.350
because I was too lazy to write

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.280
down all three relations.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.250
Is that what you're asking?

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.640
AUDIENCE: No, I'm saying you
could have a transformation

00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:00.870
model if you were to extend a
c sub i,j matrix to be 3,6.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.340
PROFESSOR: No.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.250
It just won't do it.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.120
I mean, think of what
these indices are.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.570
They're 1, 2, and 3 standing for
the x1 direction, the x2

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.140
direction, the x3 direction.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.510
What's the x5 direction?

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:19.860
It's just not defined.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.808
Good try, but you just
can't do it.

00:35:21.808 --> 00:35:24.248
AUDIENCE: I'll think of
something next time.

00:35:24.248 --> 00:35:25.750
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm
sure you will.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.410
Whether it will work
or not is an

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.370
absolutely different question.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.100
OK.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.840
So beware.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.910
Do not try to transform
tensors of third rank

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:49.428
expressed with two subscripts
to other coordinate systems.

00:35:49.428 --> 00:35:49.850
All right.

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:54.440
What I would like to do now,
then, is to examine the

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.290
symmetry restrictions that are
imposed on a third-rank tensor

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.410
by crystallographic symmetry.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.690
And these are embedded in
the notes that you have.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.690
But it's going to
be bothersome to

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.380
leaf through those.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.920
So I separated out the
pages separately.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.870
And I'm going to look at a few
transformations so that you

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.940
can see how they work, and then
point out some very, very

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:22.490
curious consequences of this,
which are non-intuitive.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.680
So first of all, how
would we do it?

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:33.260
If we want to get the form
of di,j, the matrix for--

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.370
let's do a very, very
simple one.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.250
Well, let's do one that we did
last time, for those who were

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.620
here, for inversion.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.400
For inversion, the direction
cosine scheme

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:49.220
is c1,1, 0; 0, 0--

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.810
I'm sorry.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:55.158
For 1 bar, the transformation
of axes is c1,1, 0, 0; 0,

00:36:55.158 --> 00:36:59.200
c2,2, 0; 0, 0, c3,3.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.910
So we'll take di,j, change it
to the full three-subscript

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.310
notation, di,j,k.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:12.360
And the law for transformation
of the third-rank tensor is

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:21.830
di,j,k prime is equal to ci,
capital I; cj, capital J; ck,

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:30.310
capital K; times d, capital I,
capital J, capital K. We've

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.970
not done this much.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:35.200
But we've mentioned quite some
time ago that this is the way

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:39.630
a third-rank tensor would
transform element by element.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:45.610
The only terms that are non-zero
in this array, when

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.970
the symmetry transformation
is inversion--

00:37:48.970 --> 00:38:00.420
where x1, x2, x3 goes to minus
x1, minus x2, minus x3--

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.530
is whatever i is, minus
1; whatever j is--

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.235
only the diagonal terms
are there, and

00:38:07.235 --> 00:38:08.650
they're all minus 1--

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:14.000
whatever k is, it's going to
be minus 1, times di,j,k.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.240
So we find that for inversion,
di,j,k prime is always,

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.200
regardless of what the three
indices are, is going to be

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.450
minus di,j,k.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.500
And if inversion is a symmetry
operation which the crystal

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.690
possesses, we're demanding that
the transform index be

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.560
identical to the
original index.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.320
But there's a minus
sign in there.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.010
So we can say that every
single element

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.510
vanishes, has to vanish.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:46.400
So any crystal that has
inversion in it is not going

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.410
to be able to display the
piezoelectric effect or any

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:55.466
other third-rank tensor
property.

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:59.446
The electro-optic effect,
piezoresistance, and there are

00:38:59.446 --> 00:39:02.560
a whole slew of them, which are
examined for you in part

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.480
on this sheet.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.990
One third-rank tensor property
is the direct piezoelectric

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:13.050
effect, which we've been
discussing as our example.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:20.680
There is something called the
converse piezoelectric effect,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.550
which describes the phenomenon
where an applied electric

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:29.440
field creates a strain.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.370
So the direct effect is you
[? scush ?] your material, you

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.020
develop charge.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.430
The converse piezoelectric
effect says if you apply an

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.680
electric field that's going to
move the atoms around and

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.480
induce polarizations, you are
going to create a strain.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:54.000
And the absolutely mind-boggling
thing is that

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.600
the same array of 3 by 9
coefficients describe both the

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.120
direct piezoelectric effect
and the converse

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.570
piezoelectric effect.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.470
So in one relation, we have
that each component of

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:15.110
polarization is di,j,k times the
nine elements of stress.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:23.390
And that means we have to write
three equations in nine

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:27.452
variables, the elements
of stress.

00:40:27.452 --> 00:40:30.170
And the converse piezoelectric
effect, we're

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.740
developing a strain.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:38.010
And there are, therefore,
nine elements of strain.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:45.240
And we're applying a vector,
e sub i, a field.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:48.080
So there are three components
of that vector.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.651
27 elements, 3 times 9.

00:40:51.651 --> 00:40:55.380
27 elements, 9 times 3.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.960
So both of these are
third-rank tensors.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.430
Strain transforms like
a second-rank tensor.

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.080
Field vectors transform like
a first-rank tensor.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.760
Therefore, the coefficients
are elements of

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.270
a third-rank tensor.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:18.870
But what boggles the mind is
that the same 27 numbers

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:25.040
describe these two seemingly
disparate phenomena.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.860
You don't prove this
by symmetry.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:30.500
You don't prove this by the
nature of stress and strain.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.810
This hinges on the thermodynamic
argument, which

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.440
I'm not going to go into.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.780
But what you do if you're
willing to stretch tensor

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.920
notation a little bit--

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:47.430
you can't have a 3 by 9 array
when you've got a tensor of

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.100
second rank on the left and
a vector on the right.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:58.080
You have to write this in this
fashion, that di,j,k times ei

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.880
gives you the element of
strain, epsilon j,k.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.910
And that's not proper
tensor notation.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:08.420
But we're not going
to quibble.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:13.080
Because if you allow this
little departure from

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.350
convention, then you can
write both the converse

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:20.050
piezoelectric effect and the
direct piezoelectric effect in

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.305
terms of the same matrix.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.320
But again, that is not
intuitively obvious.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.350
It does not have
to be the case.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.686
And it hinges on an argument
in thermodynamics.

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.790
Some other examples of
piezoelectric relations that

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.670
I've mentioned in the notes.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:47.700
If you apply a stress and you
get a polarization, that

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.140
stress produces a strain.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.260
So you also have to get a
polarization if you're

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.240
applying a stress, and write
it in terms of the strain

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.030
that's produced.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:03.490
Similarly, if you apply an
electric field and it produces

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.060
a strain, the crystal must
be in a state of stress.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:13.650
So there must be relation
between stress and applied

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.570
electric field, which will also
be a third-rank tensor.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:19.810
Those two relations are
represented by coefficients

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.250
given the symbol e.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.370
And again, the same array
of 27 elements

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.830
describes both effects.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.670
And these are not dignified
with any special names.

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:33.210
They're just tensor relations
that have to be true because

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:35.860
of the fact that stress
and strain are

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:39.360
coupled by elastic relations.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.810
Not surprisingly, then, the
coefficients e must somehow

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.630
involve the piezoelectric moduli
di,j and the elastic

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:48.940
properties of the material.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.050
Another effect which is a very
interesting one is the

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:58.410
electro-optic effect.

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:03.900
If you apply an electric field
to a material, you change the

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.260
birefringence of the field.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.380
The birefringence is defined as
the difference in index of

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:13.435
refraction for light polarized
in two orthogonal directions.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.980
Another tensor effect-- and I'll
give you a note defining

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.010
the terms next time we meet--

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:32.980
there is a piezoresistive
effect, which you don't see

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.250
talked about very much.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.340
But that's a property that
Texas Instruments was

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.070
interested in at one time.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.290
And I have a set of sheets
defining those relations that

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:47.130
the presenter of a paper
at a meeting, one time,

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.440
kindly gave to me.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:52.960
OK.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.870
So what other symmetry
restrictions are there?

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.040
Having shown that inversion will
not permit any third-rank

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:09.320
tensor property, we have gone
from 32 point groups, lost

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:14.300
interest in the 11
centrosymmetric point groups.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:19.000
And so there are only 21
piezoelectric point groups.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:35.260
And the way we would plod
through all 21 of them would

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:39.590
be to simply define, starting
with a twofold axis.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.480
Let's say a twofold axis
parallel to x3 would

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:49.920
correspond to a change of axes
ci,j that describes the new

00:45:49.920 --> 00:46:00.040
axes in terms of the original
ones that consisted of minus

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:05.710
1, 0, 0; 0, minus
1, 0; 0, 0, 1.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:09.220
So if we look at an element in
the piezoelectric matrix--

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:15.700
something like d1,6--

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.890
d1,6 actually corresponds
in tensor notation

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:27.030
to d1,3,2 plus d1,2,3.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:42.060
And d1,3,2 prime is going to be
c1,i c3,j c2,k times all of

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.660
the original tensor
elements di,j,k.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.050
The only term of the form
ci, something that

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:53.520
is non-zero is c,1,1.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.180
And that has a value, minus 1.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.960
The only term of the form
c3, something which

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.880
is non-zero is c3,3.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.860
And that turns out
to be plus 1.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:10.380
c2, something, the only form
that's non-zero is c2,2.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.100
And that has value, minus 1.

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:21.120
And this should be times d.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:25.250
And the only value of
i that stayed was 1.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.725
The only value of j
that stayed was 3.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.750
And then only value of
k that stayed was 2.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:41.200
So this says that d1,3,2 should
be equal to d1,3,2,

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:51.775
which I don't like, unless it's
supposed to be negative.

00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:06.345
I did something wrong here.

00:48:06.345 --> 00:48:08.472
Well, you see how easy
it is, even if it

00:48:08.472 --> 00:48:09.830
didn't turn out right.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:14.140
And the form of the tensor for
monoclinic crystal of symmetry

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.970
2, with a twofold access
parallel to x3, has as shown

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:24.190
in the lower left-hand corner
of the handout on symmetry

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:28.010
restrictions, it has eight
non-zero terms.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.200
If you do the same thing for a
mirror plane perpendicular to

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:36.280
x3, you find that there
are 10 non-zero terms.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.865
So we don't have the situation
where all of the point groups

00:48:41.865 --> 00:48:44.830
that are able to show the
property within a given

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:47.900
crystal systems like monoclinic
have exactly the

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.650
same form of the property
tensor.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.510
In fact, you'll notice a curious
correspondence between

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:00.120
the restrictions for symmetry
2 and symmetry m.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:06.210
All the terms that are 0 in
symmetry 2 are non-zero in

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.490
symmetry m, and vice versa.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:12.380
All the non-zero terms
in symmetry 2 are

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.960
0 in symmetry m.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.100
And the reason for that is
simply that this is the form

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.010
of the direction cosine
scheme for symmetry 2.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:26.160
The form of the direction cosine
scheme for symmetry m,

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:30.768
where the m is perpendicular to
x3, would have the form 1,

00:49:30.768 --> 00:49:36.660
0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, minus 1.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.840
So ci,j, for a mirror plane
perpendicular to x3, is

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:46.290
exactly the negative of the
direction cosine scheme for a

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.360
twofold axis parallel to x3.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.130
And since the number of
direction cosines is odd, this

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:56.230
means that everything that has
an equality between the

00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:01.170
di,j,k's for m would have the
transformed element be the

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.250
negative of the original one
for 2, and vice versa.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:11.100
So that's why there's this
complementary form of the

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.250
tensors for the two monoclinic
symmetries.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.295
Point out a couple of curious
things in the tables.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:29.780
You really have to go through
21 of the symmetries

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.650
independently.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:38.480
And you find that some of them
do come out the same.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.810
Symmetry 4 bar 3m and
symmetry 2:3 have

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.940
restrictions of the same form.

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.040
But for the most part--

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:46.774
Yes?

00:50:46.774 --> 00:50:49.380
AUDIENCE: I know why
this is wrong.

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.010
PROFESSOR: Why is that wrong?

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:55.010
AUDIENCE: Because your notation
of d1,6 is in fact

00:50:55.010 --> 00:51:00.510
not d1,3,2 but d1,2,1.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.510
Since you have two same
indices, [? d3 ?]

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.510
and minus [? d1. ?]

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:06.746
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:51:06.746 --> 00:51:08.560
d1,6; d1,6.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.570
Ah, of course.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:14.470
Of course. d1,2,6 is
the one up here.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:19.440
And that's 1, 2 and 2,
1 for the strains.

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.400
OK.

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:23.192
Thank you.

00:51:23.192 --> 00:51:33.520
So this is d1,1,2 plus d1,2,1.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:44.710
And so we would have
1 by 1,k and 2,k.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.550
1, 1, and 2.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:53.120
And 1, 1, 1.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:05.060
1,i; 1,j; and 2,j
for this one.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:11.510
So we'd have c1,1 c1,1 c2,2. c
c1,1 is minus 1; c1,1 is minus

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.480
1; c2,2 is minus 1.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:21.460
So d1,1,2 is minus d1,2,1, which
means they have to be

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.280
identically 0.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.270
Thank you.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:26.400
I'm sure nobody cares
at this point.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.510
Very good.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.770
OK.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:34.050
Another curious thing that
happens is that for cubic

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:37.900
symmetry 4:3:2, it's acentric.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:41.470
But every single modulus is 0.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:44.170
And the reason, the explanation,
is there's so

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:48.460
many different transformations
which have to leave the tensor

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.990
invariant that the poor tensor
just can't do it.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:57.940
It gives up, packs up, and goes
home, leaving all the

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.480
elements zero.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.125
Just no way you can get all the
qualities to be satisfied.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.080
Another curious result that I
point out for some of the

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:14.390
hexagonal symmetries for
symmetry 3:2, for symmetry

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:21.110
6:2:2, and for 3 over m and 6
bar 2m, all the elements of

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:26.190
the form d3, something
are identically 0.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:31.290
Which says you simply cannot
create a polarization that has

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:37.290
a component P3.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:40.700
You just cannot create a
polarization perpendicular to

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.000
the axis of high symmetry.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:44.390
Yeah.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.675
Got a question?

00:53:44.675 --> 00:53:47.865
AUDIENCE: So all of the cubic
that has 4:3:2 symmetry or

00:53:47.865 --> 00:53:49.730
[? 4:1:0 ?], that means
you can't get--

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:53.290
PROFESSOR: You just don't have
any piezoelectric effect, even

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:58.730
though the crystal is not
centrosymmetric, requiring

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:01.880
that all those transformations
leave the tensor invariant;

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.360
simultaneously, require that
everything has to be 0.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.900
One final thing, and then I'm
running a little bit over.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:17.550
But I'd like to go on to other
aspects of piezoelectricity

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.800
during the next hour.

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.790
Remember something that we've
shown and which I've asked you

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:27.160
to look into again on one of the
problem sets, and that is

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:33.620
that the trace of the strain
tensor gives you

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:34.940
the change in volume.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:49.870
The first 3 by 3 blocks of this
tensor that we've been

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:58.970
looking at, were we to write
the elements of strain,

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:04.740
epsilon i,j, in terms of d--

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.020
epsilon j,k--

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:17.310
in terms of di,j,k times e sub
k, it is this block in here

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:26.300
which enters into the terms
epsilon 1,1; epsilon 2,2; and

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:30.350
epsilon 3,3.

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:36.100
These terms give you the
fractional change in volume.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:41.420
And the elements that are
involved in the piezoelectric

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.220
matrix are these
terms in here.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:52.830
So if all of those terms are 0,
it turns out that when you

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.260
apply a stress and look at the
electric field, or apply an

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.490
electric field and look at the
strain, if you apply a field

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:02.200
and all of those nine
terms are 0, you

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.750
cannot create a strain.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:04.820
So there's no volume change.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.070
There can be a strain,
but no volume change.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:10.720
The only deformation you can
create is pure shear.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.550
So if you drive a piezoelectric
oscillator with

00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:19.080
an electric field, for those
property tensors for which

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.810
that first 3 by 3 block
are all zero,

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:23.760
the thing can shear--

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.060
in the water, for example--
but it can't pulse.

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.550
It can't have a volume change.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.900
And if you were to create
a transducer for sonar

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.930
applications, what you would
want to do is to have

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:41.030
piezoelectric device which
expanded this way, to create a

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:42.560
sound wave going through
the water.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.840
If it just goes back and forth,
it's going to slosh

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.040
back and forth in the water and
not create any sonic wave

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.670
that could be used in sonar.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:55.610
Now that is true for elements
being identically 0.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:57:00.340
It turns out it's also true for
elements such as 4 bar,

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:06.160
where two of those terms in
the 3 by 3 block are the

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.430
negative of one of the other.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:10.110
These will also have
no volume change.

00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:13.330
So that's another very curious
property of piezoelectric

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:18.350
response that follows from these
symmetry restrictions.

00:57:18.350 --> 00:57:18.595
OK.

00:57:18.595 --> 00:57:21.600
That's enough for our
first session.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.300
When we come back, we'll
look at the converse

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.090
piezoelectric effect.

00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:32.700
And we'll also look at
representation surfaces for

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:40.890
specific piezoelectric devices
and ask if it's possible for a

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:45.550
third-rank tensor to have a
representation surface that's

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.150
analogous to the representation
quadric for

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:50.170
second-rank tensors.

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.910
So I'm sure you'll all want to
come back and hear the answer

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:55.160
to that question.
