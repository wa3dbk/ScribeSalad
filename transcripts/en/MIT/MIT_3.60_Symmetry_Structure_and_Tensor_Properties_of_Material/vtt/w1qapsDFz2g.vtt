00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.310
PROFESSOR: To mention,
most everyone did

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.830
extremely well on the quiz.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.280
But I sense that there's still
some of you who have not yet

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.160
come to terms with
crystallographic directions

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.090
and planes, and you feel
a little bit awkward in

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.330
distinguishing brackets
around the HKL and

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.650
parentheses around HKL.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.710
And there are some people
who generally get that

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.040
straightened out, but when I
said point group, suddenly

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.070
pictures of lattices with
fourfold axes and twofold axes

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.730
adorning them came in, and that
isn't involved in a point

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.790
group at also.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.640
Again, a point group the
symmetry about point.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.340
A space group is symmetry spread
out through all of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.210
space and infinite numbers.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.820
So let me say a little
bit about resources.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.050
I don't know whether you've been
following what we've been

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.710
doing in the notes from
Buerger's book

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.030
that I passed out.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.610
That was hard to do is because
we did the plane groups, and

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.480
he doesn't touch them at all.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.560
So now we're back following once
again Buerger's treatment

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.540
quite closely.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.720
So read the book.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.250
And if you like, I can tell
you with the end of each

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.060
lecture, this stuff is on
pages 57 through 62.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.955
The other thing.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:38.060
As you'll notice, this
nonintrusive gentleman in the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.540
back is making videotapes
of all the lectures.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.770
These are eventually going to
go up on the website as

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830
OpenCourseWare.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.090
We were just speaking about
that, and it takes a while

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.140
before they get up, but I have
a disk of every lecture.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.040
So if there's something you
didn't follow or a place where

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.020
I chewed my lines and you want
to go back over it again-- not

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.990
that that happens very often--

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.110
you are more than welcome to
ask me to borrow and borrow

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.790
the disk if you want
to review it.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.530
So that's another resource.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.660
And then I will regularly
throughout the term give

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.270
hard-copy handouts of some of
the things that we're doing,

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.500
particularly when it
involves geometry.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.760
And when we move on to
three-dimensional geometry,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.070
unless of the graphics is really
tight and precise, it's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.080
hard to follow what's
going on.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.600
So in that vein, one of the
first things I wanted to pass

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.850
out-- the only other
one for today--

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.310
is a demonstration that in fact
in the Group 23 all you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.120
need is a single twofold axis
oriented along the normal to a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.150
face and a single threefold
axis coming

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.450
out of one body diagonal.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.550
And that gives you all
of the axes you are

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.210
going to get into 23.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.230
So when this comes around, there
are number of steps that

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.130
you can perform letting the
axes work on each other.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.400
And if you start with just the
single twofold axis and the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.780
single threefold axis-- which
the symbol suggests is all you

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.010
need, there's only one
kind of each--

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.770
if you look at a cube along its
body diagonal, the twofold

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.090
axis that's coming out of one
face gets rotated into

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.980
directions normal to all the
other faces if you rotate by

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.780
120 degrees.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.220
So the little diagram in the
upper right hand corner of the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.000
sheet hopefully convinces
you of this.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.700
Now we've got three mutually
orthogonal twofold axes and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.150
one threefold axis coming
out of a body diagonal.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.960
So the vertical twofold axis
swings that around by 180

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.120
degrees to give you another
threefold axis

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.870
along a body diagonal.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.060
And I labeled that one
3 prime in the

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.480
middle diagram at right.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.110
And then if you take the axis
3 prime and repeat it by the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.930
second of the twofold axes
that we have along face

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.480
normals, that in the middle
diagram on the right hand edge

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.660
takes 3 prime and repeats
it to 3 double prime.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.320
Then finally, the third twofold
axis that we generated

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.880
repeats the threefold prime
axis to the remaining

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.170
threefold axis along the
fourth body diagonal.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.550
So the results start with one
twofold axis oriented along

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.280
the normal to a cube and one
threefold axis along the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.280
diagonal of the cube, you get
axes coming out of all faces

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370
and all diagonal.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.390
And there's a staple on that
sheet for reasons that I don't

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.470
understand, but it there was,
probably on the surface of the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.734
Xerox machine when I
went over there.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.160
So let me now return to our next
step, and that is to add

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.330
what in the language of group
theory is called an extender,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.400
a new symmetry operation that
can be added to a preexisting

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.890
group that will generate
new operations.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.630
And let's see what sort of
theorems we need to describe

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.120
what we should look for and in
which particular orientation.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.380
We've got these 11 axial
combinations, and these are

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.270
frameworks that we can hang
mirror planes on.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.700
So let's look at a first
simple combination.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.490
Suppose we have a twofold axis,
and the only nontrivial

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.630
operation there is a rotation
through 180 degrees.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.430
So this an axis A pi.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.600
And again, the ground rules
are that if we're to add a

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.490
mirror plane to this axis,
which along with identity

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.730
constitutes a group, we can't
create any new axes.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.750
So there are two ways
we can do this.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.380
One is the three-dimensional
analog of something that we

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.930
have already done, namely to
pass a mirror plane through

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.450
the twofold axis.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.560
And this is the group that we
found as a two-dimensional

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.980
Point Group, and we
called it 2mm.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.310
And to do that, we used the
theorem that says that if you

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.390
take a rotation operation A
alpha and combine it with a

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.950
reflection operation that goes
through it, you get a new

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.410
reflection plane, sigma prime,
that's at an angle alpha over

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.040
2 to the first.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.940
So what gave us the second
mirror line in two dimensions,

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.220
in three dimensions that would
give us another mirror plane

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.890
that's at right angles
to the first.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.540
And this will give us a
three-dimensional symmetry,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.770
which is also called 2mm.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.290
So it's nothing more than taking
the two- dimensional

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.730
Point Group and letting it come
out at the board at you--

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.570
Man, that'll give you nightmares
when these things

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.260
are coming out of the
paper at you--

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.240
and that is a valid group 2mm.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.530
There's another way that we can
add a mirror plane to a

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.510
rotation axis though which will
not create any new axes,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.730
and that's to add the mirror
plane-- the reflection

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.130
operation sigma I should say
since it is a combinations of

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.500
operations--

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.240
exactly perpendicular
to the locus of

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.370
the rotation operation.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.690
And that reflection operation
sigma then just flips the

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.370
rotation axis end to end.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.680
And the rotation operation just
swirls the locus of the

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.860
reflection plane around within
its own locus and doesn't

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.020
create any new reflection
plane.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.350
So in the particular combination
A pi, if we add a

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.260
mirror plane perpendicular to
that as the operation sigma,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.170
this would be then all of the
operations of a twofold axis

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.320
over all of the operations
of a mirror plane.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.030
So we've got now a combination
of a twofold axis with a

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.640
mirror plane.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.960
We've got the same thing here.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.420
To distinguish these two
combinations, we'll write this

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.650
as a fraction 2/m.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.780
And that literally in words
is the way we've added the

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.660
twofold axis.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.760
It is sitting over the mirror
plane and gets reflected down

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.120
into its other end when the
mirror plane act on.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.590
So it's just language.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.659
It's nice though, as we said
some weeks ago, if our

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.820
language have some descriptive
content to so when we look at

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.169
it we can remind ourselves
of what it means.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.560
So two 2mm means the mirror
planes are parallel to the

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.960
axis that contain it.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.830
2/m means the twofold axis
is over the mirror plane.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.320
It goes through and
pierces it.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.900
What I would like to
ask though is have

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.770
we got a group yet?

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.070
And let's take a
first object--

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.880
let's call it right handed--

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.670
rotate it by 180 degrees.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.780
You get a second one, which
will stay right handed.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.370
And then repeat it by a
reflection operation in the

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.500
mirror plane, and we'll
get a third operation.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.840
Reflection changes
chirality, so the

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.270
third one is left handed.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:34.170
So we are performing the
sequence of operations A pi

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.010
followed by sigma.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.810
And let me append just so we
make no mistake and not

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.370
confuse it with 2mm that the
reflection operation is normal

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.060
to the mirror plane.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.565
So question, what is
the net effect?

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.980
And lo and behold, we have
stumbled over-- if we had not

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.240
been clever enough to invented
it and suggested it early on--

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.810
the only way you can get from 1
to 3 in one shot is to turn

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:12.330
it inside out and change its
chirality by projecting it

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.680
through a point which is the
location where the twofold

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.780
rotation pierces the
mirror plane.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.560
And what this is going to do is
to change the sense of all

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.630
three coordinates.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.540
This is going to take the
coordinates XYZ of object

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:35.330
number 1 and change them into
minus x, minus y, minus c.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.330
And what we're doing is
inverting the motif, turning

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:43.450
it inside out as it were,
into an enantiomorph.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.900
And we have discovered as soon
as we combine a pi with a

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.650
perpendicular reflection plane,
a new operation which

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.265
we'll call in words inversion.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:02.340
And the symbol that used to
describe this is a one with a

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.430
bar over it, and we'll
see why later on.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.820
But this is a onefold axis
with an inversion center

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.980
sitting on it, and that's
what an inversion

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.450
center by itself is.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.370
The implication is that they're
going to be other axes

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.620
that we can abbreviate such as
3-bar, 4-bar, and so on.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.160
So this is analogous to a
situation that will come later

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.660
where we really need
a new notation.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.000
So we've fell headlong over
a new type of symmetry

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.380
operation, and we should
consider taking inversion and

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.690
adding that to the
rotation axes by

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.390
themselves as an extender.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.940
Obviously, if we take inversion
and add it to a

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.030
mirror plane, we're
going to get A pi.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:54.260
If we take a twofold rotation,
add it perpendicular to a

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.860
mirror plane, we
get inversion.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.970
If we put inversion and put it
on a 180-degree rotation,

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.630
we'll get the mirror
plane back.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.540
So these things all permute
one to another.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.160
You may even remember some time
ago we asked in general

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.270
terms when do two operations
permute

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.720
without changing anything.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.550
And the answer is if these
operations to leave the locus

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.330
of the other one alone.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.740
And the mirror plane obviously
leaves the locus of the

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.780
rotation operation unchanged.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.200
The rotation operation spins the
mirror plane around in its

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.660
own plane and doesn't
create a new axis.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.640
And the inversion center leaves
the mirror plane alone

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.570
and takes the twofold
axis top to bottom.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:51.720
So those three operations,
inversion A pi, sigma are the

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.030
three nontrivial operations
that exist in the space.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.240
The fourth one is the
identity operation.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.220
So here is the set of elements
in the group that

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.920
we will call 2/m.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.460
2/m implies three operations
inversion, a 180-degree

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.020
rotation, reflection in a plane
perpendicular to the

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.895
axis, and the identity
operation.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.780
And I'll leave it to yourself
for you to convince yourself

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.580
that I can rotate and then
reflect or I can reflect and

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.530
then invert.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.410
And all of these operations
do not create any new

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.860
motifs in the set.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.100
The group multiplication
table, in other words,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.830
contains just the four
elements, 1,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.440
1-bar, A pi, and sigma.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.820
So the full pattern that
corresponds to 2/m consists of

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.800
four objects.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.810
It'll be a fourth
one down here.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.710
The twofold axis tells you
have this fellow is

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.710
related to this one.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.880
Inversion tells you how this
one is related to this one.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.460
And the mirror plane tells you
how this one, number 1, is

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.870
related to number 4.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.063
And the identity operation
tells you how 1

00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:09.490
is related to itself.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.930
So, again, as we've seen in
the set of operations that

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.220
constitute a group, there's a
one-to-one correspondence

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.460
between the transformations that
are elements of the group

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.760
and the number of objects
in the pattern.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.540
So we've made one combination,
and what we found from this is

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.950
a new transformation inversion
that involves changing the

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.350
sign of all the coordinates in
a space through a point which

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.635
is called the inversion
center.

00:14:48.313 --> 00:14:49.563
Questions?

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:05.470
If not, let me quickly rattle
off other Point

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.840
Groups in this family.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.975
We could take the operation A
pi/2 in 90-degree rotation and

00:15:13.975 --> 00:15:18.135
add this perpendicular
to mirror plane.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.840
Let me now say something
that I've said

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.260
again many times before.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.200
The pattern of objects that will
result is the pattern of

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:37.270
objects that's produced
by the initial group--

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.460
let's say a fourfold axis--

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.590
repeated by the extender.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.570
And the operation sigma
perpendicular is the extender.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.530
So the pattern, without making
any big deal about it, is

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:57.340
going to look like this square
of objects reflected down

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.390
below the mirror plane.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.840
So it'll be one going
down like this.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.620
One like this.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.300
One like this.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.810
The operation A pi sits
perpendicular to the operation

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:10.360
of reflection, so there will
be an inversion center that

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.590
arises at the point
of intersection.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.260
And indeed the square above
can be inverted

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.030
through this point--

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.350
little hasty repairs there--

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.690
and every one up above gets
inverted down to an

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.210
enantiomorph below.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.400
So all of these guys up on
top are right handed.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.820
All these guys down below
are left handed.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.340
So this is another group.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:44.070
This is 4/m in international
notation, a fourfold axis

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.810
perpendicular to
a mirror plane.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:54.030
There is also, unfortunately,
a Schoenflies notation.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.650
The international notation tells
you what you've got, a

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.770
twofold axis or a fourfold axis

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.060
perpendicular to a mirror plane.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.490
The Schoenflies notation tells
you how you derived it.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:11.079
And the symbol for a twofold
axis is C2, so this is a

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:13.180
twofold axis.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.930
And what we did was to add an
extender consisting of a

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.609
horizontal mirror plane.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:25.630
Schoenflies calls this one
C2h; Group C2, which is a

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:33.695
twofold axis; a horizontal
m is the extender.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.820
So Schoenflies tells you
how you make it.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.040
The international notation
tells you what

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:45.280
you get as a result.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.200
Schoenflies notation here would
be C4, that's the symbol

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.763
for a fourfold axis, and
the extender is an h.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.480
And then without making any big
fuss about it, if I do the

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.510
same with a sixfold axis, I will
have six objects related

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.730
by a sixfold rotation axis.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:16.010
If I take that sixfold axis
and put a mirror plane

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:20.960
perpendicular to it, these will
be reflected down to a

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.400
hexagon of enantiomorph
equidistant

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.650
below the mirror plane.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.100
That's not terribly good, but
it's not terribly bad either.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.693
So this would be called 6/m,
Schoenflies notation C6h.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:53.240
And the operation A pi exists in
a sixfold axis, so there is

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.690
an inversion center but also
arises as a new symmetry

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.493
element at the point
of intersection.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.750
So with reckless abandon, you
can continue on here and

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:10.360
derive noncrystallographic
groups for all the even-fold

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.740
axes and derive an 8/m
and a 12/m and 16/m.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.760
Lovely symmetries.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.240
I wouldn't want to draw them,
but they're still symmetries.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.210
They all have an inversion
center in them, but they're

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.340
noncrystallographic.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.460
So we don't have to worry about
them for prism purposes.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:41.200
I left one out because it
introduces a complication that

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.360
is kind of curious
and interesting.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.040
Any questions on what
we've done here?

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.340
Yes?

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.770
AUDIENCE: The 2mm, it's
just the same--

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.480
Schoenflies notation
is just C2--

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.810
PROFESSOR: Schoenflies notation
for three dimensions

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.880
is exactly the same as in two.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.540
So the three-dimensional version
where this extends in

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:10.350
a direction that is normal to
the two-dimensional space of

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.080
our two dimensions.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.090
Two dimensions it was this.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.220
Now just imagine them coming out
of the blackboard at you.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.970
The symbol for this
one was 2mm.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:26.740
The symbol for this one is
also 2mm, the same thing.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.590
The mirror plane is a vertical
mirror plane.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.510
So the Schoenflies notation is
exactly the same as what we

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.580
used per two dimensions.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.830
It's called C2v.

00:20:42.205 --> 00:20:45.190
We've added a vertical
mirror plane.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.090
And again, horizontal
and vertical.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.300
Horizontal is horizontal
with respect to the

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.470
axis of higher symmetry.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.750
Vertical is vertical with
respect to the two-dimensional

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.240
space of the two-dimensional
Point Group, parallel to the

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.800
axis in three dimensions.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.455
So that's the vertical
indication.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.100
So let's, though, tuck that
away for future reference.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.340
We've got two kinds
of extenders.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.060
We've got a horizontal mirror
plane, and we've got a

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:23.570
vertical mirror plane, and these
are extenders that we

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.760
should consider adding.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.520
So we've taken care of
2/m, 4/m and 6/m.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.420
2mm, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm are just
the extensions into a third

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.570
dimension of what we've seen
and come to love in the

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.820
two-dimensional space.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.050
Let me now turn to the
threefold axis.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.920
And this is a curious one.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.030
Threefold axes require fewer
symbols to indicate the

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.700
vertical mirror planes
because there's only

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.890
one independent one.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.760
But let's see what
would happen.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.740
And now I'm not going to attempt
to draw these in three

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.710
dimensions anymore.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.140
I'm going to use a stereographic
projection.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.700
And what I'll do is use a solid
dot for a point that's

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.690
up above the equatorial plane
and an open dot for one that's

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.250
down below the equatorial
plane.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:30.260
So my stereographic projection
of 4mm would look like.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.780
This is the fourfold axis.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.770
This is the mirror plane.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:40.370
And I've got one up that gets
reproduced by the axis to give

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.730
me a set of four.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.450
All of these are, let's
say, right handed.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.490
And then directly below them
is another set of four

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:53.750
repeated by reflection, and
these are all left handed.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.270
And then there's an inversion
center at the point of

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.040
intersection.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.500
And I'll indicate that by the
little open circle sitting

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.120
right on the fourfold axis.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.310
So there is a projection
of what 4/m looks like.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:15.740
So let me now do the same thing
for a threefold axis.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:22.050
And I'll add to the triangle
of points that a threefold

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.460
axis would generate.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.800
So these guys are all
of one chirality.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.050
Let's say right handed.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.170
Then I'll reflect them down,
and I'll get three objects

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.420
that are down.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.935
And that's what 3/m
looks like.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.360
Is there an inversion
center here?

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.456
No.

00:23:58.456 --> 00:24:05.440
No, because the operation
of A pi is missing.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.840
And it was the horizontal mirror
plane combined with A

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:15.620
pi that gave us the inversion
center with all of the even

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.340
rotation axis.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.980
So one of the things we have to
say here is that there is

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:30.490
no 1-bar that's present, which
means in this instance, unlike

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.200
the other ones, we have
another option.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.730
So we can use the operation of
inversion as an extender too.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.430
So we're going to get another
group out of the threefold

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.080
axis besides this one.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:25:00.060
And this one we will
name 3/m or C3h

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.310
in Schoenflies notation.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:12.150
They're six objects here, so
there should be six operations

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.420
in the group.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:18.590
So let me number these guys
up on top as number 1,

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.190
number 2, number 3.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.400
And 1 is related to itself
by inversion.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.770
There's an operation A 2 pi/3.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.950
And that tells me how the one
that's up is related to the

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.260
second one that's up and how
the left-handed one that's

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.900
down is related to the
one that's directly

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.570
below number 2.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.250
There is an operation
A 4 pi/3.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.970
And that's the same as saying
8 minus 2 pi/3.

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:56.220
And that tells us how the things
that are separated by

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.370
240 degrees are related,
both up and down.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:14.490
I know how 3 up is related to 3
down and how 1 up is related

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.480
to 1 down and 2 up is
related to 2 down.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.860
This is all with the horizontal
mirror plane, which

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.110
I'll call sigma h.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.540
That is a total of one,
two, three, four--

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.730
whoops-- one, two, three
four operations.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.980
I need six.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:49.430
Let's ask how is this one that's
up related to this one

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.680
that's down?

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.310
I just got rotation operations
and reflection.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.870
The only way I can get from this
one number 1 to this one

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:10.750
number 3 left that's down is
to take two steps to do it.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.590
I can't get from this one up
here to this one down here

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:24.805
unless I rotate 60 degrees
and then invert.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.530
If I move over to 3-bar.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:45.225
This is A 2 pi/3 with 1-bar
as an extender.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.540
The pattern would, again,
look like what are

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.660
threefold axis does.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.080
But then if I repeat this set of
three by inversion, the two

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.410
triangles above and
below are skewed.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.060
The ones down below
are enantiomorphs.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.800
The three that are up are
of opposite chirality.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:20.310
And this is a new
type of pattern.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:24.850
And in international notation,
what do we call this?

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.290
It's a threefold axis.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:32.730
But how do we indicate a
symbol for three with

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.420
inversion sitting on it?

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.090
Let's ask if we know how each of
these objects is related to

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:42.350
each of the other.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:53.040
So here's 1, 2, and 3; 1 goes to
2 by A 2 pi/3; 1 goes to 3

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.130
by A minus 2 pi/3.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.350
Let's put some numbers on here
for the ones down below.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:13.485
Let's call them 4, 5, and 6;
1 goes to 6 by an version.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.590
How do I get from 1 up
to 4 that's down?

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.160
I can do that only by
taking two steps.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.520
Rotate 1 from here
to number 2.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.450
Don't yet put it down.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.000
First invert it.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.990
So 1 to 4 involves the operation
A 2 pi/3 followed

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.240
immediately by inversion.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:05.530
And I go from 1 up to 5 down by
doing the operation A minus

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.240
2 pi/3 followed immediately
by inversion.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.640
And then 1 goes to
1 and itself by

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.020
the identity operation.

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.170
So I have six objects, one, two,
three, four, five, six

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.810
operations.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.140
Yes?

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.122
AUDIENCE: In the cases where
you're rotating and inverting,

00:30:26.122 --> 00:30:30.098
does it matter which
way to the other?

00:30:30.098 --> 00:30:32.930
PROFESSOR: No, it shouldn't
because they

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:33.940
leave each other alone.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.085
So I can rotate from here
to here and invert.

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:40.210
Or I can invert from here
to here and then rotate.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.500
It's the same transformation.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.100
Again, they permute if the two
loci of the two operations

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.050
leave the other locus alone.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.640
Maybe the enormity of what
we've shown here

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.320
has not sunk in.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.090
This is a new two-step
operation.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.220
We can't describe it any simpler
than saying, rotate

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.200
and not put it down yet,
follow up by inversion.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:12.480
Yes, sir?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.896
AUDIENCE: Couldn't we express
that in another way by sort of

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:16.256
extending the three-directional
glide plane

00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:21.692
by saying invert, then transform
by some vector

00:31:21.692 --> 00:31:24.596
that's parallel to
the glide plane?

00:31:24.596 --> 00:31:28.360
PROFESSOR: Maybe they do in
space group, but as soon as we

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.460
introduce a glide plane, you've
got an operation that's

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.525
half a lattice translation.

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.010
And that means you've got to
have a lattice translation and

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.030
double the lattice
translation, so--

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.990
AUDIENCE: Oh, we don't have
to worry about that.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.180
PROFESSOR: --when we're in
a space group, yeah.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.080
That could be present.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.550
But not for a point group
because the ground rules are

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.380
at least one point
has to remain

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.815
immutably fixed in space.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.530
So this is a two-step operation,
and what we're

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.470
going to call it is
rotoinversion.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.930
It consists of as a first step
an operation by rotating alpha

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.720
from 0.1 to a virtual
point number 2.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.510
But before you put it down, you
will invert it to a new

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:25.035
object number 2 which is
of opposite chirality.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.630
So here then are the operation
of the group that results when

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.900
you combine a threefold rotation
axis and add to it an

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:45.210
version center as an extended;
A 2 pi/3; A minus 2 pi/3; a

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:50.960
rotoinversion operation through
2 pi/3 and then

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.920
inverting; a rotoinversion
operation of A minus 2 pi/3

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.280
followed by inversion.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.390
And the symbol that is used to
represent that new two-step

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:06.730
operation is putting a bar
over the top of the

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.940
symbol for the axis.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.260
And then, finally, we have
inversion by itself.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.840
So that's a group rank 6.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:26.790
The Schoenflies notation is
called C3i because we got this

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.830
group by adding an inversion
to C3, the threefold axis.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:37.200
The international notation picks
up on putting a bar over

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.240
an axis to indicate a
rotoinversion operation.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.700
So this is called 3-bar in the
international notation.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.300
So there is a new group,
and it is an oddball.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.070
It sort of stands alone
from the other

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.135
groups of the form C3h.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:34.500
This we derived by using the
rotation of the threefold axis

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.050
and adding 1-bar
as an extender.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.600
So there's no mirror
plane in this.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.290
AUDIENCE: That's not
the same as--

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:43.239
PROFESSOR: That's the
same as 3/m, no.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.210
3/m is C3h.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:52.389
3-bar is C3i, different extender
added to the same

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.639
subgroup 3C.

00:35:00.407 --> 00:35:03.500
AUDIENCE: What was the
definition of 3/m?

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.910
PROFESSOR: Oh, we never
really finished that.

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.090
That if we need the six
operations that control the

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:13.050
group, we'll have a sixfold
rotoinversion axis.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:17.490
But this pattern looks just like
the triangle produced by

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:23.480
3, and we add an reflection
operation as an inversion, and

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.140
the 3 go down.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.070
So if we ask how every one of
the top is related to one

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.550
underneath, that's by this
horizontal mirror plane.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.980
If I want to know how I get
from this one that's up to

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.800
this one that's down, then I've
got to rotate through 60

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.590
degrees and invert.

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.460
So that would be a rotoinversion
operation.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:04.530
Let us to extend this idea of
a rotoinversion operation.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:12.670
And we would find this
eventually in adding different

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.930
extenders and falling headlong
over this rotoinversion

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:20.360
operation as we did
here with 3-bar.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:29.440
But let me in this case start by
defining a 4-bar operation.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.030
And this would contain the
operation A pi/2 followed

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:41.970
immediately by inversion.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.770
And we'll call this
step A pi/2-bar.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.280
So let's try to do that
and see what we get.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.790
Start with a first
point, number 1.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.420
And that's up, so it's
a solid dot.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.980
And let's say it's
right handed.

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:10.670
If we combine that with a
rotation of 90 degrees.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.710
Not yet put it down.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.170
That's a virtual motif.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.160
Before putting it down,
we inverted it.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:21.650
We would get one that's down,
and it would be left handed.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.060
Do the operation again.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.200
I'll put the little
tadpole inside.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.360
Do the operation again.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.530
Rotate 90 degrees and invert.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.680
We're back up again.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.780
So this was 1.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:34.350
This is 2.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.080
This was 3.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.210
And that's up.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.900
Do the operation again.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.515
Rotate and invert.

00:37:40.515 --> 00:37:43.790
And here is number
4, and it's down.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:46.030
Do it a fifth time, and we're
back to where we started.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.790
So this is a crazy pattern.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.220
It's a pair of objects that's
up and a pair of objects

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.750
that's down.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.260
So there's a twofold
axis in there.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.380
That twofold axis A pi leave
the pattern invariant.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.460
But there is no way of
specifying the relation

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.500
between the two that are up
and the two that are down

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.450
other than doing this two-step
process of rotating 90 degrees

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.360
and then inverting.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.680
So there is actually in this
pattern a new type of

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.730
operation analogous to 3-bar,
and it's called a 4-bar axis.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.870
And it's indicated geometrically
by drawing a

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.690
square because there's
a 90-degree

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.290
angular symmetry to this.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:41.740
But a twofold axis inscribed
inside of it because this is a

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.360
pattern that has a
twofold symmetry.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:54.410
So something that has this
symmetry is the symmetry of a

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:55.660
tetrahedron.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:02.310
And if we draw a line from the
upper edge to the lower edge,

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.785
this is the locus
of a 4-bar axis.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:19.250
International notation
this is called 4-bar.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.500
That's how we generated
the pattern.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:31.610
The Schoenflies notation is an
S, little bit of exotica.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.570
This geometric solid
is something

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:36.820
that's called a sphenoid.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.790
And sphenoid.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.850
Is the Greek word for axe.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:52.050
And you can imagine a handle
put onto this thing, and it

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.090
does look kind of like an axe.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.550
You could splits firewood
with a thing like that.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.070
It looks like a tetrahedron,
but in a tetrahedron, it's

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.650
either elongated along the
4-bar axis are squished.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.090
It doesn't have to be regular.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.290
So this is called S4, and the
S stands for sphenoid.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.492
AUDIENCE: Is it part of
a regular tetrahedron?

00:40:19.492 --> 00:40:20.930
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.660
A regular tetrahedron would be
something where all of the

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.940
edges had equal length.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:32.050
And what we're doing is taking
one edge and the edge that's

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:38.090
opposite it and either
stretching it or squishing it.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.050
So there are two edges.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.420
This one, and this one, which
are the same length.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:48.260
And then these four inclined
edges have a different length.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.330
It could be either elongated
or squished.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.895
But it's not a regular
tetrahedron.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.220
If those three distances were
equal, then geometrically it

00:40:58.220 --> 00:40:59.270
would be a tetrahedron.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.540
But strictly speaking, a
tetrahedron is not a

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.980
tetrahedron, just as a square
prism with eight sides

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.740
approximately equal can't claim
to be a cube unless

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.620
there's symmetry present that
demands that this be true.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:17.920
In this case, the 4-bar requires
that these four edges

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.590
inclined to the 4-bar axis
be of one length.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.450
And this have to have
the same length.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.570
But there's nothing that
constrains all six to the

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.540
edges to be of identical
length.

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.780
So it's not a tetrahedron,
so squished or deformed

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.030
tetrahedron.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:47.200
So there is another two-step
symmetry element that we would

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:51.630
not have been clever enough to
think of had we not discovered

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.880
this sort of rotoinversion
operation when we added

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.340
inversion to a threefold axis.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.960
A 3-bar axis is a step that's
present when you add inversion

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.320
to a threefold axis.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.430
So 3-bar, what we call it for
short, is identical to a

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.280
threefold axis plus inversion
sitting on it.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:20.390
A 4-bar is not equal to a
fourfold axis with inversion

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:21.640
added to it.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:26.540
A 4-bar is something that you
cannot describe any more

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.770
simply than saying there is a
two-step operation in there,

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.450
and it's a group of rank 4.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:44.690
Let me finish by setting up the
task of going through this

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.940
systematically.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:57.464
We have 11 axial combinations
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422,

00:42:57.464 --> 00:43:03.140
622, 23, and 432.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:05.930
So there are 11 of those.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:11.550
We want to examine as extenders
a vertical mirror

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:17.690
plane that would be
one extender.

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.830
We should add that to each
of these symmetries.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.510
We already done a
lot of these.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:28.190
We've done pretty
much up here.

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.110
We could add a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:44.710
Or we've encountered inversion
when we added a mirror plane

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:46.820
perpendicular to an
even-fold axis.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:48.615
We could add inversion
as an extender.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.970
And to be complete, we should
add to our list of axes in

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:59.700
quotation marks, the 4-bar axis,
having discovered it.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.710
And does that do it?

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:11.940
Is there anything else we could
do to these axes that

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.196
would leave them invariant?

00:44:15.196 --> 00:44:16.142
.

00:44:16.142 --> 00:44:17.392
AUDIENCE: What about 2-bar?

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:25.300
PROFESSOR: 2-bar; 2-bar
would be rotate

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.510
180 degrees and invert.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:35.310
So 2-bar is identical to a
horizontal mirror plane.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:36.560
So that's nothing new.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.035
We're already running a
little over time so--

00:44:42.035 --> 00:44:42.250
Yeah?

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.530
AUDIENCE: 3-bar?

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:47.100
PROFESSOR: 3-bar is 3 plus
1, and we call at 3i, so

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.180
this one down here.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.520
This is 3-bar.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.800
We describe it for short as
that, but it really is a

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.350
threefold axis with
an inversion

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.960
center sitting on it.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.070
This thing is distinct because
it's not a fourfold axis with

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.130
inversion sitting on it.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.190
A 4-bar is a 4-bar is a 4-bar.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:09.050
You can't decompose it as a
twofold axis is a subgroup.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:12.040
That's only half the story.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:16.510
I don't want to keep you
anxious, not anxious to find

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.175
out what the answer is
but anxious to get on

00:45:18.175 --> 00:45:19.350
your way and go home.

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:29.170
So let me submit that when we
have more than one rotation

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:49.440
axis, such as 222 or as in 32,
if we put the mirror plane in

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:56.510
normal to the principal axis,
we'll call that a horizontal

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.084
mirror plane.

00:45:59.084 --> 00:46:04.930
If we add the mirror plane
through the principal axis, we

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:08.550
could pass it through the
threefold axis and the twofold

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.100
axis, pass it through the
vertical twofold axis and the

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.770
horizontal twofold axis.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:17.330
We will call this a vertical
mirror plane.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.260
And that's all we could say for
a single axis, the mirror

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.200
plane was perpendicular to the
axis or passed through it.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:26.930
But when there's more than one
axis, another thing we could

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:33.310
do would be to snake the mirror
plane in between the

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.860
twofold axis.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.370
In that case, this
twofold axis gets

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.100
reflected into this one.

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.750
But I haven't created
any new axes.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.980
So that is going to leave
the results of Euler's

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.700
construction unchanged.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.500
I can't similarly put a vertical
mirror plane through

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.800
this first twofold axis but
in between the other two.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.740
In that case, this is no longer
222 because these two

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.220
mirror planes are equivalent
by reflection, so I want to

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.820
drop that at very least.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.440
So in any case, without
belaboring

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.860
the point, it's late.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:12.290
I could do for each of the
groups that involved more than

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:19.885
one axis I could add a diagonal
mirror plane, or I

00:47:19.885 --> 00:47:21.500
should try to add a diagonal
mirror planes.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:26.520
And this means interleaved
between axes that are present

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.010
in these combinations,
added such that

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.370
no new axis is created.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.930
But the addition clearly is
going to be a new disposition

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.030
of symmetry elements
arranged in any

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.890
different fashion and space.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.620
So the game's afoot.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.920
This is what remains
to be done next.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.050
What I'll do for next time is
prepare a chart that looks

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.680
like this that has the results
of all of the unique

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.530
combinations shown and then
hand out pictures of

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.880
stereographic projections
of all the results.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.910
I think once you know how to
play the game to go through

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.020
and do every single
one in detail is

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.400
probably not necessary.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.010
If you know how to do some of
them and you know all the

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.930
tricks for adding extenders, you
could do it if you had to.

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:20.270
All right.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:24.350
So, again, sorry we started late
and sorry that we last

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:25.600
long as well.
