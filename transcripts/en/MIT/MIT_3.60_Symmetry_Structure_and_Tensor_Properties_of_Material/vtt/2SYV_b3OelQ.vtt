00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.100
Before we get started, I'd
like to deal with a small

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.960
matter of some unpleasantness.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.280
The class is sort of like
a football game.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.030
When there's two minutes to go,
you shoot off a pistol.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.330
But when there are two meetings
to go until we have

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.740
the quiz, we shoot off a
pistol to wake you up.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.250
We're scheduled to have
a quiz on October 6.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.680
And even though October seems
far away when you're still in

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.080
September, that is going
to be a week

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.920
from this coming Thursday.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.580
So if you have problems that
you're working on, try to get

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.560
them to me on Thursday, or just
come slide them under my

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.840
office door, if I'm not in.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.330
And I'll have them back for you
on this coming Tuesday.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.450
The way the material has played
out is that we're

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.000
really at a nice, convenient
juncture between one chunk of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.020
interconnected material
moving on to another.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.340
So I think the first quiz
we'll confine to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.025
two-dimensional symmetry.

00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.900
And beginning in about two
minutes flat, we'll begin to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.110
move into--

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.830
take the first small steps,
at any rate, into

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190
three-dimensional symmetries,
which will be much more

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.470
complicated in which we
will not deal with the

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.180
exhaustiveness that we have been
able to afford the luxury

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.230
of in two dimensions.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.400
Before I begin, let me-- does
everybody remember their

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.710
spherical trigonometry?

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
Has anybody had spherical
trigonometry?

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.090
OK.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.950
What I will then do is give a
short primer on some of the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.250
definitions and concepts in
spherical trigonometry.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.960
And then we shall immediately
use this to combine rotation

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.310
axes in space.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.560
Pass those back.

00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:04.220
AUDIENCE: I had a quick
question on this.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.580
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure, please.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.118
AUDIENCE: With the limiting
possible--

00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:09.601
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.016
AUDIENCE: --reflections and
conditions, that does say they

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:13.950
have to be figured out?

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.380
PROFESSOR: Actually, that was a
good question and something

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.000
that we are not going to use at
all in the symmetry tables.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.210
Somebody asked what about this
notation in the far right-hand

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.180
edge of all of the
plane groups--

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.226
conditions limiting possible
reflections.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.820
One usually doesn't put a
two-dimensional crystal in an

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.540
x-ray beam fairly often,
although I suppose a thin film

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.710
actually is almost a
two-dimensional crystal.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.560
But you've probably all heard
one way or another about the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.840
magic conditions relating the
Miller indices of a plane that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.650
will require that the intensity
diffracted from that

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.910
set of planes is identically
zero.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.980
And they're linear combinations
of H, K, and L.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.100
And one of the rules is that if
H plus K plus L is even or

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.680
not, the intensity
may be zero.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.380
These are rules for systematic
absences.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.890
And the corresponding
information is given for you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.930
here for these not terribly
realistic real

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.520
two-dimensional crystals.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.170
So, for example, if you turn to
number seven, P2MG, it says

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.320
conditions limiting possible
reflections

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.630
for the general position.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.310
For H and K, there's
no condition.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.610
For H zero, H has to be even,
if the reflection is to have

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.040
non-zero intensity.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.070
And for the last two, for the
general reflections, H, K, if

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.060
there's an atom occupying the
position either zero, zero or

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.490
the position zero, one half,
then for the general planes

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.230
with indices H, K, you will
see intensity only if H is

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.339
even, as well-- same as
the condition above.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.960
This is something that is not
generally known that everybody

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.340
knows-- that if the crystal is
face-centered cubic, there is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.130
a pattern of absences.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.470
But there are additional
absences if the atom is in a

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.700
special position.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.760
And this can very often be used
to advantage because you

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.690
can single out certain classes
of Miller indices for which

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.570
one atom in the structure will
not diffract or which another

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.620
atom in the structure
will not diffract.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.020
And that can be of
great utility in

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.080
unraveling a structure.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.050
We'll see some examples of this
in useful form when we

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.090
deal with three-dimensional
space groups.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.510
And the corresponding sheets
for the three-dimensional

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.900
symmetries will be handed
out to you-- some of

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.150
them, not all of them.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.600
Let me take a little bit of time
to remind you, if you've

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.670
forgotten them, but to inform
you of certain definitions and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.820
trigonometry in spherical
geometry.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.220
Spherical trigonometry differs
from plane geometry in that

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.310
all of the action takes place
on the surface of a sphere.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.190
And it'd be nice if I had
a spherical blackboard.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.210
Actually there is one in the
x-ray laboratory that I can

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.710
draw things right on that
spherical surface.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.550
But this is a sphere.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.935
We'll see directly that
the radius of the

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.840
sphere is not important.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.560
So we'll take that as a unity,
which is a nice, even number.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.200
And as my dichotomy of the
afternoon, if we pass a plane

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.990
through that sphere, if the
plane hits the sphere, it will

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.970
intersect it in a circle.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.230
If the plane passes through
the center of the sphere--

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.830
and we've assigned the radius
of the sphere as unity, then

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.515
this is a circle that's referred
to a great circle.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.670
Sounds like a value judgment,
but it's simply saying that's

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.370
as large as the circle is going
to get is when it passes

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.540
through the center of the
sphere., it would have unit

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.085
radius, just as the
sphere does.

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:39.130
So if you take any other plane
which intersects the sphere

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.680
but doesn't pass through the
center, it's going to have a

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.590
smaller radius.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.325
And this is something that's
called a small circle.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.180
OK, so if all of the action is
going to take place on the

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.410
surface of the sphere, and we
have two points on the sphere,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.360
A and B, sitting on the surface
of the sphere, how do

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.204
we measure the separation
of A and B?

00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:15.310
Well, if you think in terms of
a normal three-dimensional

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.740
person, you say, zonk, connect
them by a line.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.770
And that's the distance between
A and B. Now, you

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.180
can't do that because all the
action has to take place on

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.510
the surface of the sphere.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.750
People who deal with spherical
trigonometry all the time are

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.360
airplane pilots.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.060
And if your pilot is going to
take you from New York--

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.860
where would you like to go?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.400
Paris?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.210
That sounds like a nice place.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.560
But if you're going to go from
New York to Paris, you don't

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.890
plow your way through the
intervening earth.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.650
You follow something that is at
a constant radius out from

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.200
the center the Earth, at a
height of 5,000 feet above the

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.320
surface of the Earth, an
additional radius.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.670
So the way we'll define distance
is to pass a great

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.700
circle through A, B, pass a
plane through A, B in the

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.610
center of the sphere.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.040
And then we will define distance
between A and B as

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.580
the smaller of the two angles
subtended at the

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.340
center of the sphere.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.490
So this is a more reasonable
looking great circle.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.850
If this is point A and this is
point B, pass a plane through

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.410
the center of the sphere, O, and
through A and through B.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.740
And then we'll measure the
length of the arc AB in terms

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.830
of the angle alpha subtended at
the center of the sphere.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.799
So it's a crazy notion.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.630
We're measuring distance
in terms of an angle.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.740
And if that's an angle, we can
take a trigonometric function

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.740
of that angle, like
sine or cosine.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.990
And that blows the mind that
you can take trigonometric

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.130
functions of a distance.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.700
But we can.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.700
We'll see it's going to
be useful to us, too.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.290
And then I emphasize again,
we'll take this

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.780
as the smaller distance.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.400
It'll be 360 degrees
minus alpha.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.260
That would be the
long way around

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:10.432
from A to B. All right.

00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:14.270
We've defined now
how we will draw

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.820
distances between two points.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.750
Suppose I have three points on
the surface of the sphere--

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:28.290
A, B, and C. I can pass a great
circle through A and B.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.470
I know how to do that.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:35.180
I can pass a great circle
through A and C. I

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.910
know how to do that.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.700
And I can pass a great circle
through B and C.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.130
So now I have defined something
that is referred to

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.605
as a spherical triangle.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.200
We know how to measure
the length of

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.010
the spherical triangle.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:06.780
Let's call the arc opposite the
point of intersection A as

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.970
little a and the length of the
arc opposite B as a distance

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.320
and angles little b, and
the distance from A

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.400
to C as little c.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.660
But there's something in between
these arcs that looks

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.810
like an angle analogous to the
angle in a planar triangle.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.520
And how can we define that?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:40.300
Well, the arc AB is defined by
a plane, a great circle.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.090
The arc AC is similarly defined
by a plane that passes

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.090
through a, c in the center
of the sphere.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:56.200
And what we will define as the
spherical angle BAC is the

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:02.120
angle between the great circles
that define the two

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.920
different arcs.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.530
So if there's one great circle
that defines the arc from A to

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.790
B and another plane that defines
the arc from A to C,

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.140
we'll define as the spherical
angle between those two arcs

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.390
the angle between the planes
that define the great circles.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.840
So we're going to call this
angle in here between these

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.210
two planes as angle BAC.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.245
Another construct that
is a useful one--

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.050
suppose I look at the plane
that I've used to define a

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:59.260
great circle and at the center
of the sphere construct a line

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.530
that is perpendicular
to the great circle.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.120
And if I extend that line,
sooner or later it's going to

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.300
poke out through the surface
of the sphere.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:20.480
And I will refer to this point
as the pole of arc AB, or the

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.190
pole of the great circle that
we've used to define arc AB.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:35.010
So the North Pole is actually
the pole of the great circle

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.750
that defines the equator.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.180
And clearly there
are two poles.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.800
There's one in either
direction.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.505
So there's a North Pole and a
South Pole to this arc AB and

00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:46.460
to the great circle
that defines it.

00:12:57.942 --> 00:12:59.436
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:02.922
Why couldn't you define the
angle BAC as the angle

00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:04.172
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:12.384
PROFESSOR: You want to
make a tangent here?

00:13:12.384 --> 00:13:13.634
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.796
PROFESSOR: I don't know if
that's really defined.

00:13:26.796 --> 00:13:31.800
In other words, if I'm saying I
want a line that is tangent

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.844
to the sphere, it doesn't
fix its orientation.

00:13:34.844 --> 00:13:36.460
AUDIENCE: In the plane
of the great circle.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:36.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.010
In the plane of the
great circle.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.350
Suppose you could if
you wanted to.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.210
There are trigonometric
qualities to defining the

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.010
angle in the way that we have.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:14:00.030
And the construct really is not
something confined to the

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.390
surface of the sphere, and
everything else that

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.270
we are doing is.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:06.780
OK?

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.940
So it's sort of the non sequitur
because we started

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.100
out by saying that everything
has to take place on the

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.730
surface of the sphere.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.760
There's things that we would
do in our three-dimensional

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.100
world, like defining distances
between points as the shortest

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.980
straight line, that are ruled
out in spherical trigonometry.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.160
And I think something
similar could be

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.340
levied at your proposal.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:41.302
And the answer is we just
don't do it that way.

00:14:41.302 --> 00:14:42.552
That's the real answer.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:46.420
OK.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:54.690
If I have not boggled your mind
so far, let me go a bit

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.885
further with another
useful construct.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.420
We can see how we can define a
pole of a great circle or a

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:11.050
pole on an arc that is a portion
of a great circle.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:18.750
Let me take a spherical
triangle, A, B, and C. And

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.810
I've got three great circles
now, which have formed those

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.640
arcs that make up the sides
of my triangle.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:33.620
Let me now find the
pole of arc CB.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.900
And that means we're going to
go out 90 degrees to that

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.720
plane through the center
of the sphere.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.390
And that's going to define some
point that I'll call A

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.050
prime, that is the
pole of arc BC.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.260
And I'm going to do the same
thing for the other arcs that

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.700
are sides of my great circle
of my spherical triangle.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.400
I'll find the pole of arc AC.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.070
And I'm going to label that
point as B prime.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.630
And, finally, there'll be
another pole that is

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.480
the pole of arc AB.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.100
And that's going to define
a point C prime.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.440
Now I've got three points, I can
connect these together and

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.998
make another spherical
triangle.

00:16:13.998 --> 00:16:17.670
AUDIENCE: How do you know to
determine where the pole is?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.700
PROFESSOR: If you think of it
in three dimensions, I got

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.670
three different arcs.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.020
And for each one of them I am
drawing a perpendicular to the

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.310
plane of that great circle
and looking at the

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.460
point where it emerges.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:28.720
OK.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.060
So now if there's another arc,
there'll be another great

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.940
circle coming around
like this.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.660
And I look for the pole of it.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.950
And that would be another
one of the corners.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.860
This thing that I've constructed
is bizarre.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.200
But it's given a special name.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.615
This is called the
polar triangle.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.185
And it has some useful
properties.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.530
A property of the polar triangle
is that the two

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:15.569
triangles, A, B, and C, and A
prime, B prime, and C prime

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.540
are mutually polar.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.800
That is, if I use the spherical
triangle ABC to

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.095
define and locate the
three points A

00:17:24.095 --> 00:17:25.560
prime, B prime, C prime--

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.985
now if I reverse the process
and find the whole of arc A

00:17:30.985 --> 00:17:36.960
prime C prime, that turns
out to be point B.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.120
And if I take the arc of A prime
B prime, that turns--

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.070
I'm sorry-- take the arc of B
prime C prime, that turns out

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:50.470
to be point A. So the two
triangles are mutually polar.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.190
The polar triangle of the polar
triangle is the triangle

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.340
that we started with.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:54.810
Yeah?

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.220
AUDIENCE: I guess
I missed that.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.570
So if you take B prime
through C prime, then

00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.510
all of that is going--

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:05.002
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm saying that
the pole of this arc, A

00:18:05.002 --> 00:18:08.770
prime C prime, is
this point here.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:18.450
And the way I can show that
is to say that we got B by

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:21.150
looking at the pole--

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.000
I'm sorry--

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.510
I got C by looking at the
pole of the arc AB.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:33.840
So B is 90 degrees away
from C prime.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:43.080
I found point A prime by finding
the pole of arc CB.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.440
So B is 90 degrees from
any point on that arc.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.140
So it's 90 degrees away
from A. So B is 90

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.200
degrees from A prime.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.040
B is 90 degrees C prime.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.290
And, therefore, it has to
be the pole of that arc.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.510
Now that was a little
too quick.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:02.740
That's written down
in the notes.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.990
And that's why I
wrote them out.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.310
One final thing and then we can
put circle trigonometry to

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.690
one side, and this is something

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.490
that is not all obvious.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:26.500
If we look at a spherical
triangle and simultaneously

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.540
the polar triangle--

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.290
so let's say this is ABC.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:38.660
And here is the polar triangle
A prime, C prime, B prime.

00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:53.170
It turns out that the spherical
angle in one circle

00:19:53.170 --> 00:20:00.380
triangle and the length of the
arc opposite it, namely this

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.665
arc B prime C prime,
are complementary--

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.300
supplementary, not
complementary.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:21.900
And the way one would do that is
to say that the measure of

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.160
alpha is the length
of this arc here.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:36.700
And this total side, B prime C
prime, is equal to this arc

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.490
plus this arc minus
this length.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.910
And these two arcs
are 90 degrees.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.820
So let me do as I've
done in the notes.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.270
Let me call this
point P prime.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.860
And I'll call this
point Q prime.

00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:05.340
So my argument, it says that B
prime is the pole of arc AC.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:13.170
And, therefore, B prime
Q prime equals

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.660
90 degrees in length.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:23.810
And then I would say that C
prime is the pole of arc AB.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:30.710
And, therefore, the distance C
prime P prime is also exactly

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.670
90 degrees.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:39.940
And that says that B prime Q
prime plus C prime P prime--

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.530
if I add those two together,
it has to be 180 degrees.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:54.880
But I can write B prime C prime
as B prime P prime plus

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:03.020
P prime Q prime plus Q prime
C prime plus the

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.870
side P prime Q prime.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.080
And that's 180 degrees.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.390
But these three things that I've
lumped together here are

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.780
exactly the same as the length
of the spherical polar

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.280
triangle A prime.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.170
So what we've shown then is
that A prime plus alpha is

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.580
equal to 180 degrees--

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.780
QED.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:38.100
So this angle plus the side of
the polar triangle add up to

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.350
180 degrees.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.230
And that is not obvious
at all.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.430
One final relation--

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.635
and this I will simply hand
to you on a platter.

00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:57.570
I'm not about to derive it.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.140
Sides and angles in planar
geometry are related.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.130
And there's a particularly
useful relation in plane

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.340
geometry that's called
the Law of Cosines.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.800
So this is in plane geometry.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.280
And if you have a triangle
that has sides a, b, c--

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.300
a general oblique triangle--

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.030
and it has angles A, B, and C,
the Law of Cosines says that

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:40.410
the side A is determined
by c and b and the

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.900
angle between them.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.630
And that's clear.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.440
If I specify this length,
specify this length, specify

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.960
that angle, things set up like
a bowl of supercooled jello.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.830
And the triangle's completely
specified.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.565
So a squared in the Law of
Cosines is b squared plus c

00:23:56.565 --> 00:24:03.880
squared minus 2bc times
the cosine of angle A.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.670
In a spherical triangle there
is a similar sort of

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.030
constraint.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.580
If we have a spherical triangle
with sides a, b, and

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.750
c, and spherical angles capital
A, capital B, capital

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.640
C, in the same way as specifying
the spherical angle

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.650
A and the lengths of the two
sides c and b, specifies and

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:33.080
fixes the spherical
triangle entirely.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.810
This side must be determined by
the length of side c, the

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:40.460
length of side b, and the
angle between them.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.960
And that, since everything
is in terms of angles, is

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.160
something that doesn't
involve squares.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.510
It involves totally
trigonometric expressions.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.490
And it turns out the cosine of
this missing side a is given

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.475
by the product of the cosines
of the two other sides.

00:24:57.475 --> 00:25:00.680
So as I said, you can take a
trigonometric function of a

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.260
length, which sounds
like an oxymoron.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.820
And it's the product of the
cosines of the two known sides

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:15.380
and times the sine of b sine of
c times the cosine of the

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.090
spherical angle A.
And that is also

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.340
called the Law of Cosines.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.490
And this is the corresponding
case in spherical geometry.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.430
OK.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.740
So there's some machinery--

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.674
yes, sir?

00:25:36.674 --> 00:25:39.009
AUDIENCE: What's the difference
between the sines

00:25:39.009 --> 00:25:41.811
of lowercase a and--

00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:44.850
PROFESSOR: OK, the angles
are the capital letters.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.230
This would be the angle between
the great circles that

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.740
defines the--

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.065
AUDIENCE: Since the radius is
one, there's no difference

00:25:51.065 --> 00:25:54.446
between the angles and the--

00:25:54.446 --> 00:25:56.378
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:56.378 --> 00:25:59.200
PROFESSOR: No.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.910
This angle is something, for
example, we can choose.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.270
And depending on how long we
want this arc to be, we can

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.270
put the arc BC anywhere
we like.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.722
AUDIENCE: Does that mean your
radius [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.190
PROFESSOR: No.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.000
This would be, say, two points
of the spherical triangle.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.120
Now we can pick any third point
on the surface of the

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.540
sphere, connect that with great
circles, and here is a

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.790
spherical triangle.

00:26:29.264 --> 00:26:29.710
OK?

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.130
So I see.

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.290
I think I see what
your problem is.

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.610
Here are the two planes.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.870
We define the angle of the
spherical triangle as the

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.940
angle subtended buy
the great circle.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.590
So this is the definition
of A.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.940
But now the other two points on
the spherical triangle can

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.060
be any point on these
great circles.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.750
So this can be point B, and this
can be point C. And my

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.340
spherical triangle can be
something like this.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:07.630
So the arc that defines the
spherical angle A is a value

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:12.240
that is independent from the
length of the arc AC.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.910
That would be what is
subtended at the

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.160
center of the sphere.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.050
I'm going to have time just to
set the stage for how we're

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.336
going to use these relations.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.900
And the problem that I would
like to raise and then apply

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:46.720
spherical trigonometry to is
the question if I go into

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:54.990
three-dimensional space, there
is no longer any requirement

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.340
that rotation axes be all

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.170
parallel to the same direction.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.120
In two dimensions the rotation
points were really--

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.420
could be viewed as axes that
were always perpendicular to

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.140
the plane of the blackboard, the
plane of the plane group.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:16.250
But now when I'm dealing with
three-dimensional spaces, this

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:20.420
could be the operation
A alpha.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.220
And there is no reason
whatsoever why we should not

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.940
try to combine with this
first operation a

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.790
second rotation B beta--

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:35.090
a rotation through an angle beta
about this axis B and a

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:40.060
rotation of angle alpha through
this axis A. If we're

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.690
going to come up with a
crystallographic combination,

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.970
the angles alpha and beta have
to be restricted to the

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.410
angular rotations of either
a onefold, a twofold, a

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.420
threefold, a fourfold, or
a sixfold axis, if the

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.550
combination is going to
be crystallographic.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.012
Yes, sir?

00:28:57.012 --> 00:28:59.322
AUDIENCE: You're just rotating
around those lines?

00:28:59.322 --> 00:29:00.750
PROFESSOR: I'm rotating around
those lines, yeah.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:05.200
So I'm saying that we're going
to rotate an angle alpha about

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.930
axis A.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.480
And now what I'm going
to raise as

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.100
a rhetorical question--

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.550
what is the rotation A alpha
followed by B beta?

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:23.440
So I rotate through the angle
alpha about A. So here's my

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.920
first motif, right-handed.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.560
Then I'll rotate
alpha degrees.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.290
And this here's number two.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:36.380
And that will stay
right-handed.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.840
Now, I will place on axis
B the two constraints.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.010
These have to be
crystallographic rotation

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:52.380
angles, namely 360, 180,
120, 90, or 60.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.330
And I'll also, since I would
like to obtain point group

00:29:55.330 --> 00:30:00.450
symmetries initially, I will
require that axis A and axis B

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.620
intersect at some point.

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.090
And one of the variables in the
combination will be this

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.000
angle between the two
rotation axes.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.660
So let's complete our
combination of operations.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.490
I'll rotate from one
to two by A alpha.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:19.560
If the first one is
right-handed, the second motif

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.310
is right-handed, as well.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:27.840
And then I will rotate beta
degrees about B. And here will

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.680
sit number three.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.930
And it will stay right-handed.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:41.190
So, again, the $64 question that
we raise periodically--

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:46.020
what operation is the net
effect of two successive

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.755
rotations about a point
of intersection?

00:30:51.984 --> 00:30:53.234
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:56.290
PROFESSOR: Lots of opinions.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.230
Let's sort them out.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.980
I heard translation.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.720
Well, let's put down
what it could be.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:07.720
We know that only translation
and rotation leaves the

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.550
chirality of the motif
unchanged.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.263
So it's got to be one
or the other.

00:31:12.263 --> 00:31:14.187
AUDIENCE: Since there's no
reason for the general

00:31:14.187 --> 00:31:16.592
orientation of the two to say
it has to be rotation around

00:31:16.592 --> 00:31:18.035
the third axis, so
the question is

00:31:18.035 --> 00:31:19.385
what angle and what--

00:31:19.385 --> 00:31:19.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.790
That is exactly the problem.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.080
Now that we know the problem,
we can go home early because

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.380
we know what we're going
to do next time.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:32.030
Well, let me expand
a little bit.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.080
It can't be translation because
clearly the separation

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.030
of number one and number three
depend on exactly where I

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.230
place the first one.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.350
If I place it a little further
out from A, then it's going to

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.620
rotate to here.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.230
And then B is going
to swing it off to

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.960
some different location.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.160
So it can't be translation.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.220
And I don't think these guys, if
I rotate this way and then

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.600
I rotate this way, are going to
be parallel to one another.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.200
I doubt that very much.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.450
So it's got to be a rotation.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:08.500
So without knowing how to find
it, let's say that we can get

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.520
from number one to number three
in one shot through

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:20.340
rotation of an angle gamma about
some third axis, C. So

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.575
the answer, in general, without
being specific, is A

00:32:23.575 --> 00:32:26.650
alpha followed B beta has got
to be equal to a third

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.980
rotation, C, about a direction
that has the same point of

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.870
intersection with the
first two axes.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.163
Now we've got some really,
really tough constraints.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.860
Alpha is restricted to
one of five values.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.785
Beta is restricted to
one of five values.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.290
The third rotation, gamma,
jolly well better be a

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:03.360
crystallographic rotation and
not something that is not a

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.720
sub-multiple of 2 pi.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.730
And even if it is a sub-multiple
of 2 pi, it has

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:13.830
to be either 0 degrees,
120, so on.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.580
It has to be one of the

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:16.530
crystallographic rotation angles.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.690
So what sort of relation can
we get that would give us,

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:26.180
first, the value of gamma in
terms of alpha, beta, and the

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.560
angle at which we
combine them?

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.890
So taking A and B as the five
crystallographic rotation axes

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:40.460
two at a time, we want to put
them together, if we can, such

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.630
that the angle makes the third
rotation axis also be

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.820
crystallographic.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.580
And then we would have
to find its location.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.810
It looks like an impossible
constraint .

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.010
It looks absolutely
impossible to do.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.280
We've got to put this first in
quantitative form and then

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.400
simply put in the values for
alpha, beta, and gamma and

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.360
find the angle that they have
to be combined on to make

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.010
this, if possible, be one
of the crystallographics

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.260
sub-multiples.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.830
That is not an easy problem
to formulate.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.449
And, as I said a couple of times
ago, the geometry that

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:25.219
is the basis of this derivation
was originally

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:27.889
proposed by Euler.

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:30.659
And it's known as Euler's
Construction.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:35.090
I will have for you next time
my own set of notes on this.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.010
We have finished with
two-dimensional

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.780
crystallography.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.850
So we are back to Buerger's
book again.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.260
We had that little interlude.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.659
Buerger deals with Euler's
Construction.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.850
But I don't think he's
at his best in

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.380
this particular section.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.300
So we'll take it a little
more slowly.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.820
And next time we'll get around
to deriving Euler's

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.070
Construction.
