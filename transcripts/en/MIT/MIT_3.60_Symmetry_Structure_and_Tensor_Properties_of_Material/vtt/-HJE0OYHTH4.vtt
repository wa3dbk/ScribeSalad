00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.330
PROFESSOR: All right, we've been
slogging our way through

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.460
derivation of the
plane groups.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.400
And I think I'll do a few more,
because we'll stumble

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.620
across some major tricks in
deriving a subfamily of them.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.440
But to not get lost in the
forest because of all the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.090
trees, I have a set of notes.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.200
They are handwritten because my
secretary would resign if

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.200
she had to fit in all these
figures and subscripts and

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.810
strange symbols.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.880
So, they are as neat as
I could make them.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.350
Sorry to say that, in running
them through the Xerox machine

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.530
in an attempt to get everything
on one sheet, some

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.100
of the last lines got clipped.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.050
So I'll run these through again
and give you a copy

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.180
that's minus those
truncations.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.500
All right.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.860
What we've been doing so far,
to have a brief reprise, was

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
to take the symmetries, the 10
two-dimensional plane group

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.150
symmetries.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.410
And they were one-, two-,
three-, four-, or sixfold

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:37.850
axes, a mirror plane,
2mm, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.100
So there are 10 of them.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.240
And these are the so-called
crystallographic point groups.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.330
Crystallographic because we
considered only those rotation

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.790
axes that are compatible
with a lattice.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.360
And they are point groups
because they leave at least

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.910
one point in space,
invariant--

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.780
stays there rigidly fixed.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.510
And they are groups because the
collection of operations

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.130
that are present satisfies the
postulates of the mathematical

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.020
entity called a group.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.190
We've then are in the process of
taking these 10 symmetries

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.670
and adding them to the 5
two-dimensional lattices.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:34.480
The parallelogram net, the
rectangular, the centered

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:50.605
rectangular, and the square,
and the hexagonal.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.950
And clearly, we can't put each
of those point groups in every

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.380
one of the lattices.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.550
For example, the lattice has to
be square for either 4 or

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.110
4mm, so we would attempt to
place only those two of the 10

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.480
point groups into
a square net.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.760
We've gone through quite
a few of them.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.900
I won't bother to draw
the pattern of

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.980
the symmetry elements.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.680
But we put no symmetry
at all in the general

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.250
parallelogram net.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.240
And that is plane group P1.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.310
Maybe I will draw the
figures, after all.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.340
P2 was a twofold axis dropped
into a net, which had to have

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.315
no specialized shape, simply
because a twofold [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:41.150
axis requires nothing but a
lattice row if one translation

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.400
is combined with it.

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:52.060
The threefold axis could fit
into an equilateral net.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.590
And there's the threefold axis
we added to a lattice point.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.740
And we have two additional
threefold axes in the centers

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.440
of those 2 equilateral
triangles, which each make up

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.350
half the cell.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.750
P4 was the square net.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.589
We put a fourfold axis at
the corner of the cell.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.680
We've got another one
in the middle.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.945
Two folds in the middle of
the edges because of the

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:27.520
180-degree rotation that is
built into the fourfold axis.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.430
And P6.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.130
We put that into a
hexagonal net.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.900
We've got sixfold axes that we
dropped in at the lattice

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.430
point only, nothing else.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.430
There's a 120-degree rotation at
the lattice point, and that

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.510
gives us the threefold
axes that are

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.530
present in P3, as well.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.510
There's a 180-degree rotation
contained in a sixfold axis,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.180
and that gives us the twofold
axes in all of the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.430
locations of P2.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.190
OK, I haven't drawn in any
representative patterns, but

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.360
let me remind you again.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.550
The pattern that is
characteristic of every one of

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.610
the plane groups is just the
pattern that the point group

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.460
that you've placed at the
lattice point would produce.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.810
And that pattern is, in turn,
hung at every lattice point of

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.580
the two-dimensional cell.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.880
So even though the huge number
of symmetry elements that's

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.710
present in the higher symmetry
point groups is rather

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.820
intimidating--

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.560
you say, wow, how would one
draw a pattern for that--

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.840
the pattern is nothing more
complicated than the pattern

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.530
of the symmetry that you've
placed at the lattice point.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.290
And all of these other symmetry
elements arise to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.280
express relations between the
motifs that you've placed at

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.590
the initial representative
lattice point.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.220
Deriving these, we used one
theorem, which it's well to

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.150
remind you of.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.050
And that is that if I have a
rotation operation A alpha,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.290
follow that by a translation
that's perpendicular to the

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.730
rotation axis, what I get
is a new rotation

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.790
operation is B alpha.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.880
And it's located in a very
specific location.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.650
And that is at a location that's
a distance x equal half

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.050
the magnitude of the translation
times the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.570
cotangent of alpha over 2.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.320
So this combination term, if
nothing else, reminds us that

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.250
these combination theorems, as I
call them, are not equations

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.890
in symmetry elements.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.680
They are equations in individual
operations.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.160
So, for example, if I combine
the fourfold axis with the

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.750
translation, the 180-degree
operation that's present in a

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.610
fourfold axis puts B pi here.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.650
The 90-degree rotation puts
B pi over 2 here.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.270
And the 270-degree rotation--

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.750
which I can define just as well
as A minus pi over 2--

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.950
puts the operation A minus
2 pi over 2 down here.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.480
So it's not an equation
in symmetry elements.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.960
It's an equation in individual
operations.

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:20.680
Then some peculiarities started
to arise, which we

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.930
perhaps might not think of.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.400
If we put a mirror plane in a
primitive rectangular net,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.980
that gave a group that
we called Pm.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.180
If we combine that with a
translation, we need a theorem

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:42.590
that says what happens if you
combine a mirror reflection

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.610
operation with a translation
that's perpendicular to it.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.370
We sketch that out, and once and
for all could decide that

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.670
it's going to be a new
reflection operation that's

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:58.010
located halfway along this
perpendicular translation.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.670
So this reflection operation
sigma, combined with this

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.830
translation, gave us a new
reflection operation, sigma

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.710
prime, halfway along the cell.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.440
And, of course, we have
this one hanging at a

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.340
lattice point as well.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.730
And then came the
interesting one.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.920
When we combined a mirror plane
now with the centered

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:25.500
rectangular net, we have all of
the mirror planes that we

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.590
have here, because this
primitive rectangular lattice

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.745
is a subgroup of the
centered lattice.

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:34.049
Then the interesting thing
happened when we combined the

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:39.850
reflection operation sigma with
this translation that

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.340
went to the center
of the cell.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.600
And that gave us a
transformation that was

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.150
something we had not
encountered before.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.940
We took an object, reflected
it in this plane, and then

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.030
translated it down
to a centered

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.760
lattice point over here--

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.440
to give us one that sat here--

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.005
and then asked, how did I get
from the first one, a

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:10.020
right-handed one perhaps,
to a second one that's a

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.425
left-handed one, and then a
third left-handed one that

00:09:13.425 --> 00:09:14.890
sits down here?

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.220
The answer is that we found
there was no way we could

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.230
specify getting from number 1 to
number 3 in a single shot.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.880
We had to take two
steps to do it.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.890
And there was nothing more
simple than that.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.020
We had to first translate
down by the part of the

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.880
translation--

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.920
let me call it tau--

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.870
which is equal to that part of
the translation t, which is

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.160
parallel to the reflection
operation.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.430
And then we had to reflect
across, and that would get us

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.920
from the first to the third.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.380
That was a new sort
of operation.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.670
We'd indicate its locus by a
dashed line to distinguish it

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.860
from a mirror plane.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.760
And it has a translation part
and a reflection part.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.650
Doesn't matter what order
in which we do them.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.787
We get to the same location if
we reflect first and then

00:10:03.787 --> 00:10:06.880
slide or slide first
and then reflect.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.180
So this was a new operation
that I'll

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.360
represent by sigma tau--

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.790
looks sort of like a symbol
for reflection, but the

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.990
subscript reminds us you've got
to translate by an amount

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.050
tau that is parallel to the
initial mirror plane.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.010
And this gave us a new theorem
that a general translation

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.020
that had a part t perpendicular
and a component

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.520
t parallel, when it followed
a reflection operation, was

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.125
equal to a net effect of
reproducing the object by a

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:41.220
glide plane, sigma tau prime.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.840
It had tau equal to the part
of the translation that was

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.540
parallel to the reflection
part of the locus.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.145
And it was located always at
one-half the perpendicular

00:10:52.145 --> 00:10:53.395
part of the translation.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:02.180
So using that theorem and
completing the mirror planes

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:08.360
that hang at the lattice
points, we have a very

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.410
interesting group that consists
of a centered

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:16.610
lattice, mirror plane hung at
the corner lattice point--

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.965
this is also a lattice point,
so we automatically get the

00:11:19.965 --> 00:11:22.040
mirror plane in the middle
of the cell--

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.260
and then in between, we get this
new 2-step operation, the

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.050
glide plane.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.400
And the pattern that's
representative of this plane

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.960
group is, as advertised, just
what a mirror plane does.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:40.340
And that is hung at every
lattice point of the centered

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.350
rectangular net.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.310
So the glide plane, this new
operation that popped up, does

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.190
what the new operations
did in all of the

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:51.950
other preceding groups.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.220
It tells you how do you get from
the pair that you've hung

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.920
at the lattice point to
these that sit in the

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.340
center of the cell.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.660
They're related by translation,
but the relation

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.910
of one to another of these
motifs is by the glide plane.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.270
So that is an operation which
has arisen in the group.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.840
And this, then, is a group
that we would call Cm.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.210
C for a centered rectangular
net, as opposed to the

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.255
primitive net, which is the one
we got immediately before.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.330
Again, I sound like a cracked
record sometimes, but let me

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.160
emphasize the simplicity
of these patterns.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.140
Again, the pattern consists of
what you would get when you

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.730
hung a motif on one lattice
point, and then that is

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.470
repeated by m, which is the
symmetry you've placed at a

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.280
lattice point.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.500
And that's hung at every lattice
point of the centered

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.420
rectangular net.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.540
The glide planes just express
relations between things that

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.580
you already have when you've
hung the motifs

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.760
on the lattice point.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.740
Any questions after this
brief reprieve?

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.980
Comments?

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.545
Yes, sir.

00:13:02.545 --> 00:13:06.790
AUDIENCE: You called those
[INAUDIBLE] glides,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.990
that's a sigma tau?

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.220
The relation between
this one and this

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.180
one, I've called sigma.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.050
That's the reflection
operation.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.290
The relation between this one
and this one down here would

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.290
be the operation that has
a reflection part and a

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.540
translation part, tau.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:36.630
Let me point out something
that's worth observing when we

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.020
start making some more
complex additions.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.220
We said early on that we only
have to consider translations

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.920
that terminate within
the unit cell.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.570
Because everything is
translationally periodic--

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.120
not only the atoms in the
motifs but the symmetry

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.730
elements as well.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.760
But the observation that I want
to make is that if we put

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.780
a glide plane in.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:13.340
And let's do that for the direct
addition of a glide

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.070
plane to a lattice point.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:21.940
And having done that, we have
the potential of possibly

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.941
having derived a group that
we would call Cg.

00:14:31.194 --> 00:14:31.680
OK.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.570
This diagonal translation--

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.030
this is T1, and this is T2.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.850
We might ask, what is the
reflect [INAUDIBLE] glide

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.980
operation that sits at the
origin lattice point, followed

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.540
by T1 plus T2.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.480
Well, what does our
theorem tell us?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.250
It says that we should get
a new glide plane.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.250
It should be at one-half of the
perpendicular part of the

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.950
translation.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.720
And the perpendicular part
of the translation is T2.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:16.710
So this is at one-half of T2,
and it should have a glide

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.880
component equal to the
parallel part of the

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.280
translation, and that is T1.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.780
T1 plus the original glide
component, tau.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.510
What is this?

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:41.350
A glide component of half of
T1 plus the entire T1.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.060
If we ask, does that
make sense?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:51.360
Yeah, we would glide down to
here and then we would

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.240
translate down to here.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:16:03.960
And that would give us sitting
at half of a path of T1, a new

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.280
object that sat here.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.935
Is that a glide operation?

00:16:16.445 --> 00:16:17.560
Yeah, it is.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.700
But it is one that is not really
distinct from the glide

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.210
plane that sits here.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:29.130
Because if we have a glide
operation with tau equal to

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:34.310
one-half of T1, and if this
sits in a lattice, then

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.020
there's going to be a glide
plane has tau equal to 1 plus

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.410
one-half of T1.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.910
And there will have to be
another glide operation that

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.380
consists of 2 plus
one-half of T1.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.920
And the reason is that
everything is periodic at an

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.290
interval T1.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:56.660
So the moral that I'm trying to
draw here is that one can

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:04.069
add or subtract to identify the

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.589
actual nature of a symmetry.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:09.440
One can add or subtract
an integral number of

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.690
translations.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:33.960
And that permits one to reduce
any tau to a sigma tau prime,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.170
such that tau prime is always
less than the translation

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.470
that's parallel to the tau.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:43.190
In other words, lop off this
translation of an entire T1,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:47.790
this translation of the entire
T2, and you have identified

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.610
the basic nature of the glide
operation that sits here as

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.830
something with a translation
that's half of T1.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.750
The translations that move
motifs out of the cell may be

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.530
related by a glide operation
that involves an integral

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.720
number of T1s plus half of T1.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.290
But it doesn't change the basic
nature of the simplest

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.450
glide step that's in there.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.950
That's a very obscure
explanation of probably

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.510
something that didn't puzzle
you in the first place, but

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.630
it's worth saying when we make
some of these additions.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.000
Let's finish this off.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.340
We have another translation
in here, and that's the

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:30.240
translation T1 plus T2 over 2.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:36.840
So, what would we get if we took
the glide operation sigma

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:43.740
one-half of T1 and followed
that by a translation T1

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.920
plus T2 over 2.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.520
And that operation, again,
would be equal to a glide

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:55.250
plane sigma prime with the tau
equal to the original glide

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.500
component plus the part of the
translation that is parallel

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.040
to the glide plane.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.980
And it'd be located at one-half
of the perpendicular

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.330
part of the translation,
which is T2.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.820
So it'd be at one-half
of one-half of T2.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.050
So this says that the
combination of the glide

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:22.060
operation with the centered
translation is a glide plane

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.900
with a glide component T1.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.920
And it's located at
one-quarter of T2.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:42.390
And that, indeed, is what you
would do if you reflected and

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.160
reproduced the object by a glide
down to here and then

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.900
translated by T2 over to here.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:54.810
OK.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.270
No, I'm sorry.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.920
We glided and then we added on
the parallel part of the

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.810
translation.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.840
So we would end up down here.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.760
And if one sits here,
there has to be one

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.130
repeated by T1 up here.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.270
And this is exactly the same
thing as a reflection plane

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.550
that's been introduced.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.260
So here is a case where we could
subtract off the entire

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.640
translation T1 and say this is
identical to a mirror plane

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.090
passing through the origin, a
pure mirror plane sigma that

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:35.010
is at one-quarter of T2.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:42.260
So, let me clean this up and
show you what we have.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:48.350
Completing the operations, we
would have a pair of objects

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.820
related by glide, like
this, that is hung at

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.070
every lattice point.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.420
It's also hung at the centered
lattice point.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:21:00.330
And what that is going to give
us is a pair of objects that

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.500
sit like this.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.730
And what has come in as a result
of those combinations

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.245
is a mirror plane interleaved
between the glide planes.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:23.020
And this is exactly what we
have in Cm, which was also

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.100
interleaved mirror planes and
glide planes with the origin

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:40.820
shifted by one-half
one-quarter of T2.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.660
So this is not in a group.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.020
Proceeding logically, we'd take
Cm and replace the mirror

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.450
plane by a glide.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.400
When we do that, we have
a consistent group.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.950
But it turns out to be exactly
the same arrangement of

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.830
symmetry elements and exactly
the same pattern as Cm, but

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.500
with a little nudge over along
T2 by one-quarter of that

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.750
translation.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.070
Yes.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.284
AUDIENCE: But in Cm, didn't we
have mirror planes going

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:09.010
through the lattice points?

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.750
And what I'm saying is here
there are glide planes going

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.780
through, but the lattice
point is arbitrary.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.040
I can put it anywhere I like.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.550
And if I decide to put the
lattice point here, that turns

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:21.800
it into Cm.

00:22:24.136 --> 00:22:25.520
OK?

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.130
So, let's put the two of
them side by side.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:37.140
Cm was this mirror plane, mirror
plane, mirror plane

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:42.685
glides, and the atoms
motifs did this.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.340
A lattice point here
in the center.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:55.010
And I'll deliberately, to make
my case, offset the cell by

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.130
one-quarter of T1.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.870
Now I've got a glide plane
here, same as this one.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.970
Mirror plane at a
quarter of T1.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.210
Glide plane here at the centered
lattice point.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:09.610
Mirror plane here, glide
point T2 away.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.640
And here are the
lattice points.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:21.670
But the pattern of objects
looks like this.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.920
Armed in advance on what the
thing has to look like.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.710
Looks like this.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.240
And this is exactly the same
pattern of motifs.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.840
OK.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.410
So, coming out of this
consideration, we have with

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:56.400
the rectangular nets
Pm, Cm, Pg.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:04.090
But Cg, if we try to construct
it, was the same as Cm.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:07.120
And that exhausts the
possibilities for a single

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.555
symmetry plane and the
rectangular nets.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.490
OK.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.510
Let me move on then
to the next step.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.170
And I'm going to skip over
a threefold axis.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:36.190
And I'm going to look at the
square net combined with the

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:38.900
other symmetry that would
require a net with this

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.770
dimensionality.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:47.280
And this would be a primitive
square lattice plus 4 mm.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.030
We've already done almost
all the work.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.130
So as we derive the symmetries
that are subgroups of these

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.840
higher symmetries,
we've done P4.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.525
And that says that if we put a
fourfold access at the origin,

00:25:06.525 --> 00:25:09.090
that fourfold axis, we'll
get another one in the

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.400
center of the cell.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.790
And we'll get twofold axes in
the midpoints of all the edges

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.770
of the cell.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:21.200
And then 4 mm has one kind
of mirror plane.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.230
Two Ms because there are two
kinds of mirror planes.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.000
The mirror plane says, hey, if
I'm in a lattice, I want to be

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.060
at right angles to a rectangular
or a centered

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.080
rectangular net.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.010
Well, OK.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.320
This one is happy, because a
square net is a special case

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.490
of a rectangular net.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.820
The two translations
are merely equal.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.620
So he is happy.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.540
Combine that with T2, and we'll
get another mirror plane

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.930
like this, and another mirror
plane like this.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.000
Fourfold axis is going to rotate
that mirror plane, so

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.230
we'll have mirror planes
running this way,

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.480
and this way as well.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:08.110
And now we have a different kind
of mirror plane that we

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.290
tried to put in in
this location.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.190
This mirror plane says, hey, I
have to be parallel to the

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.520
edge of a rectangular net or
a centered rectangular net.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.530
So if we look at the
translations that are parallel

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:33.060
to and perpendicular to this
translation, lo and behold,

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:41.080
this mirror plane is aligned
along the edge of a centered

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.830
rectangular net that has the
additional specialization of

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:48.480
being a centered square.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.040
But that mirror plane now
is perfectly happy.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.520
And he says, OK, I'll
hold my piece.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.820
I have the arrangements of
translations relative to my

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.560
orientation that
makes me happy.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.160
So I can say now that there
is a mirror plane

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.330
running this way.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.070
There has to be another mirror
plane 90 degrees away from

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.320
those orientations.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.192
And this, then, is going to be
the location of all the mirror

00:27:13.192 --> 00:27:16.150
planes in that net.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.840
And at no time did the chalk
ever leave my fingers.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.190
Just doing what we
said we're doing.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.830
Putting in 4 mm, making sure
the requirements imposed on

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.950
the lattice are those that that
symmetry element demands.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.200
And here we go.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.080
Except that there is now one
other combination that we have

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.410
not considered.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.940
Here is a mirror plane.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.870
And now this mirror plane
is diagonal to

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.360
our translation T2.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.970
And here is a mirror plane.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.130
And that mirror plane
is diagonal to

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:56.440
our translation T1.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.810
So what is that going
to require?

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.450
Here is the mirror plane, that's
the operation sigma.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:08.240
And here is our translation,
T1, down to here.

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.770
We have a theorem that says that
a reflection followed by

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.550
a translation that has a general
orientation is going

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.560
to give me a new reflection
operation, sigma prime, that's

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.420
located at one-half the
perpendicular part of the

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.910
translation.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:30.450
And it's going to have a glide
component that is equal to

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.690
one-half of the parallel part
of the translation.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.550
So what has that told us?

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:45.860
To get from this mirror plane
down to here, we've gone this

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:53.210
far in a sense that is
perpendicular to the mirror

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.880
plane, so this is
T perpendicular.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.830
And we have a part of the
translation that is parallel

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.670
to the mirror plane.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.840
This is T parallel.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.040
So the plane that results
is going to be a

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.010
glide plane in here.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.500
It's located at one-half of the
perpendicular part of the

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.400
translation.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:29.740
And that is one-half of one-half
of T1 plus T2.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.440
And it has a glide component
equal to T parallel, which is

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.640
equal to one-half
of T1 plus T2.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.200
So we get a new glide
plane in here.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.280
And that will require glide
planes through similar

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.480
arguments that go down
the diagonals of

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.780
the cell, like this.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.170
And let me convince you that
that, in fact, is an operation

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:09.400
that must arise if I place, at
the origin of the cell, a set

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.950
of objects that have
4 mm symmetry.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:19.350
We have one like this, one
like this, one like this.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.530
Another pair hanging here.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.080
Another pair hanging here.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.330
And if we do a reflection
operation, let's say this pair

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.290
up to this pair, and then slide
it down by the diagonal

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:34.540
translation--

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.320
and we have the same set, again,
hanging down here at

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.470
the diagonally opposed
lattice point.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.820
Reflect across, slide
down to here.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:31:00.440
The way in which you get that
is, believe it or not, to

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.250
reflect across this
glide plane.

00:31:07.194 --> 00:31:11.020
How do we get there?

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.810
We reflect across.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.150
We translate down to here.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.180
And the way I do that is by
reflecting across this

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.170
diagonal glide.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.020
That probably has convinced
no one.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.780
But map it out with your
own pattern, and I

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.970
think you'll agree.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:35.840
Let me observe, while you're
considering that.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.770
When we derive groups based on
3m or 6mm, we're going to have

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:44.210
other cases where a translation
along the edge of

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:49.560
the cell is inclined
to a mirror plane.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.550
And the effect of combining a
translation with a mirror

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.120
plane that's inclined to that
translation always has the

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.710
effect of interposing a glide
plane halfway in between the

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:05.160
mirror planes that are related
by translation.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.500
So, let me say that in general,
because that will be

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.690
an observation that'll let us
identify glide planes quickly.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:25.790
So the general resolve is if we
have a translation inclined

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:36.180
to a mirror plane, which of
necessity is repeated by

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:54.450
translation, a quite general
result is that a glide plane

00:32:54.450 --> 00:33:06.590
is interleaved always
between the two.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.360
And they'll be parallel because
they're related by

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.610
translation.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:22.780
So we'll see some more cases
where we can immediately state

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.134
that without further thought.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:46.460
OK.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.160
There is something that we
might consider doing.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.900
I'd like to put it
off, though.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.230
Here we start with
a mirror plane.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:58.470
Can we replace the mirror plane
with a glide plane?

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.400
The answer is yes, we can.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.740
But it's not at all clear if I
take a fourfold axis and put a

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.840
glide plane through it, what
this plane has to be.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.710
So I'd like to leave this one
for now and come back to that.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:18.670
OK.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:24.560
In the notes, I've tried to do
all of these derivations

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.520
thoroughly and logically.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.489
So if this is a bit fast or me
waving my hands, saying a

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.540
glide plane is here, and this,
that, and the other thing,

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.980
when you can't really see what
I'm pointing at, I think if

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.570
you refer to the notes
that'll be clear.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.699
But yes, you had a question?

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.184
AUDIENCE: So you said that this
glide plane [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:40.184 --> 00:34:41.675
one-half T perpendicular.

00:34:41.675 --> 00:34:43.663
What did you write
underneath that?

00:34:43.663 --> 00:34:48.384
I guess that maybe is where
your T and one-half T

00:34:48.384 --> 00:34:49.850
perpendicular is where
the glide plane is.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.380
I was just demonstrating that,
in fact, for this mirror plane

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.760
with the diagonal translation,
the glide plane would come in

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.570
at one-half of the perpendicular
part of the

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.560
translation.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.000
And the part of the
translation that--

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.610
we were combining this fourfold
access with this

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.880
translation.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.310
So the perpendicular part of the
translation is half of the

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.770
body diagonal.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.840
And if a glide plane comes in
one-half of the perpendicular

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.335
part of the translation, that
put it parallel to the mirror

00:35:24.335 --> 00:35:27.760
plane and at one-quarter of the
way of the translation.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.640
So this little scrawl here
says it one-half of T

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:40.570
perpendicular and one-half of
one-half of the body diagonal.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.490
So it's one-quarter.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.170
All this equals one-quarter
of T1 plus T2.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:58.960
OK.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.480
Now something unexpected
happens.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.770
If we would move along,
I skipped over 3m.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.690
We know what P3 looks like.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:20.420
And that is a hexagonal net,
an equilateral net.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.750
And we have a threefold axis
that we've added to the

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.270
lattice point.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.020
And then we found additional
threefold axes in the center

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.700
of these triangles.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.410
And, once again, the pattern
that has this symmetry is just

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.310
a triangle of objects hung
at every lattice point.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:46.560
And now we want to add
a mirror plane to

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.010
that threefold axis.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:57.240
So we have a primitive
equilateral net plus the

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:05.560
two-dimensional plane
point group 3m.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.930
The question is, which
way should we

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.220
orient the mirror plane?

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.950
Well, a mirror plane says, I
want to be along the edge of

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.110
either a centered rectangular
net or a

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.760
primitive rectangular net.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.250
There's nothing about this
lattice that looks

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.920
rectangular.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.346
Yeah, there is.

00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:30.020
I see a couple of people
doing this, and they

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.460
have the right idea.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.560
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:39.340
If we go more than one unit cell
in this diagram, here's a

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.140
lattice point.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.120
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.270
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.740
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:51.090
Go down to here and
go over to here.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.350
And lo and behold, here is a
centered rectangular net,

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.320
hiding incognito in
a hexagonal net.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.010
Well, that helps.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:09.800
I can put in the mirror plane.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.680
But let me point out-- this is
getting very messy, so I'll

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.090
redraw it on a smaller scale.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.825
This will be worth doing so that
it's perfectly obvious.

00:38:30.825 --> 00:38:35.155
I'm going to draw a number
of equilateral nets.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.880
The reason I'm drawing more than
one cell, I would like to

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.640
point out that here is one
centered rectangular net.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.240
And it has its edge
perpendicular to the

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.830
translations in the
hexagonal net.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:03.290
But there is also a rectangular
net that

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.835
goes down like this.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.740
That's a centered rectangular
net that has its edge along

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.790
one of edges of the unit cell.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.310
So I have two possibilities.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.340
One is to draw the rectangular
net like this.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.470
The other one is to draw the
rectangular net like this.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:31.500
And having confused you
thoroughly, let me simply draw

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.415
this larger cell again.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.430
And say that I could, if I
wanted to, put the mirror

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:47.210
planes in in these directions,
along the edges of the cell.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.470
OK.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.470
And in this case, if you're
convinced that there's a

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.285
centered rectangular
net sitting there.

00:39:59.285 --> 00:40:02.220
Let me clean this up.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.970
And here's one mirror plane.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.300
60 degrees away is another
mirror plane.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.580
And there'll be another mirror
plane at this lattice point

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.830
doing this.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:21.540
So now I've got 3m at every one
of these threefold axes.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.175
And I got all those simply by
repeating these mirror planes

00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.380
by translation.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.940
But in one case, the mirror
planes are perpendicular to

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.120
the cell edge.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.350
This being T1, let's say,
and this being T2.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.600
In this case, the mirror
planes are along the

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.350
edges of the cell.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.000
This being T1, and
this being T2.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.880
So, holy mackerel!

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.220
One point group.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.220
Two different space groups,
which differ in the way in

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.845
which the symmetry is oriented
relative to the lattice.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.370
And if you think back a little
bit, this particular net, with

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.790
this dimensional specialization,
was happy with

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.840
a sixfold access as well, and
will be compatible with 6mm.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.825
So, really, these two different
orientations for the

00:41:14.825 --> 00:41:17.600
mirror planes, even though we
haven't got there yet, are the

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.120
two different orientations
which are both present

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.970
simultaneously if we were
to put 6mm into

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.720
this hexagonal net.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.090
So, same point group.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.530
Same lattice.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.430
Two different plane groups that
depend on the orientation

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.490
of the symmetry relative
to the lattice.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.250
So there isn't even a one-to-one
correspondence

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.045
between the point groups
and the plane groups.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.340
The pattern for either of these
is, once again, going to

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.870
be just what the pattern of
the point group does.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:03.120
If we start with a motif here
and repeat that by the

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.640
threefold axis and the mirror
planes, we would

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:14.250
have motifs like this.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:21.560
And here the translation points
out in between the

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.890
mirror planes.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:27.060
In this case, the mirror
planes would repeat the

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.495
objects in two locations,
like this.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:38.290
So, indeed, both patterns
have 3mm symmetry.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.600
And what's different is the way
the translations come out

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.780
in between those
mirror planes.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:44.990
OK.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.300
Now our notation has come
up against an impasse.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:55.040
We said that the notation for
the plane group should be the

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.250
symbol for the lattice type,
which the initiated know has

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.300
to be a hexagonal net.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.350
The point group that we've
added, which is 3m, but now

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:08.873
how do we distinguish the two
different orientations of the

00:43:08.873 --> 00:43:10.150
mirror planes?

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:16.630
And the way around that is to
actually use three symbols.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:22.420
And the second symbol
will be what is

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.320
perpendicular to the cell edge.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.560
And the third symbol
will be what's

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.180
parallel to the cell edge.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.325
So this one would
be called P3M1.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.330
And this one, just to
distinguish it, would be

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.060
called P31M.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.900
So if this weren't bad enough,
now you've got almost the same

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.590
symbol with a permutation of
two of the terms in it.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.920
In this case, the mirror plane
is along the cell edge along

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.270
the translations.

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:02.720
In this case, it's
perpendicular.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:14.042
But we're not quite yet done,
because we've got translations

00:44:14.042 --> 00:44:17.460
that are inclined to
mirror planes.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.580
And now you can see how prudent
I was in saying quite

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.090
generally, without trying to
figure out what is the

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.220
perpendicular part and what is
the parallel part, here's a

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:31.920
translation and it's at an
angle to a mirror plane.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:38.580
And therefore we get a glide
that has to be halfway between

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.030
these mirror planes.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.490
And there'll have to be a glide
halfway between these

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.750
mirror planes, and a glide
that's halfway between these

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.150
mirror planes.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:50.060
In this case, the mirror
planes are this way.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.980
Again, a translation that's
inclined to the mirror plane.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.630
We have to have a glide
that is midway between

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.070
these mirror planes.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.850
In this case, they're a little
easier to identify.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.450
They sort of make a triangular
box that surrounds the

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.230
threefold axis.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:16.390
So now we see another difference
in the plane groups

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.390
and the reason why they're
so very distinct.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.010
And that is the rearrangement of
the glides relative to the

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.560
threefold axes are quite
different in these two cases.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.500
So these are two quite
different symmetries.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.560
Notice that when we start
identifying special locations

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.910
in these two plane groups, here
there is a location only

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.520
of symmetry 3mm for a point
group, 3m for a point group.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.560
Here there are two different
locations, one that's symmetry

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.240
3m, the other one is
just symmetry 3.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.720
So this is location of point
group 3 and a location of

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.940
point group 3m.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.960
So the sort of special positions
that exist in these

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.610
two plane groups will be
very, very different.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.010
One more addition, and then I
think we can leave with a

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.950
light heart because
we should be done.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:35.190
What about a primitive
hexagonal net

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.980
combined with 6mm?

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.880
And if you think I'm going
to try to draw

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.730
that, you're crazy.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.410
But I can say quite simply and
hopefully convince you that

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:57.410
this looks like P31M plus P3M1
right on top of one another,

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:01.370
because we've got mirror
planes that

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.830
are 30 degrees apart.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:09.840
So, as a schematic direction and
an invitation to do this

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.030
at home in your spare time, is
to take what P6 looks like.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.130
And that's sixfold axes
at the lattice points.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.660
Threefolds here.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.010
Twofolds here.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.060
And then, directly on top of
this, place the mirrors and

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.910
glides in this orientation, and
the mirrors and glides in

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.090
this orientation.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:42.200
So we will have mirror planes
coming out like that, and

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.230
glide planes in between all the
parallel mirror planes.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.910
As I say, I'm heroic
but not foolish.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:53.305
Yes.

00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:55.110
AUDIENCE: Can you just explain
that derivation again?

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.990
Your P3 [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.380
The object of this additional
bit of confusion is to put in

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.180
the symbol the point group,
which is 3m, and then tell you

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.600
how the mirror plane in a
point group is oriented

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.090
relative to the edges
of the cell.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.410
And we could call them anything
we wanted to.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.590
We could call them P3M
perpendicular, subscript

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.580
perpendicular.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.970
Or P3M subscript parallel to
indicate mirror plane parallel

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.010
to the cell edge.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.050
And mirror plane perpendicular
to the cell edge.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.840
Or we could call them some
obscenity, which would be very

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.580
descriptive, as well.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.660
But this is just a way of
keeping track of what's

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.210
parallel to the cell
edge and what's

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.460
perpendicular to the cell edge.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.510
So, this middle symbol is what's
oriented perpendicular

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.600
to the cell edge.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.910
And in this case, this is the
mirror plane and that is

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.820
perpendicular.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.460
All the mirror planes are
perpendicular to the

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.920
edges of the cell.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.770
And then parallel to the
cell edge, there's

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.350
no symmetry at all.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.500
So that's 1.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.020
1 stands for no symmetry.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.050
In this case, the mirror plane
is along the cell edge, so

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.520
there's an M in the
third position.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.360
And perpendicular to the
cell edge, there's

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.130
no symmetry at all--

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.380
no symmetry plane at all.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.690
So it's purely arbitrary, but
we need some mechanism for

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.380
distinguishing which one
we're talking about.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.750
That pretty much works
as well as anything.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.570
And it's a minor perturbation
of what we've done for the

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.520
additional plane
group symbols.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.100
All right.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.956
It's time for our midafternoon
break.

00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:55.020
It's a nice place to quit,
because you're probably

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.680
feeling good.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.530
We've done this, and we can
move on to something new.

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.460
Actually, there's
one more trick.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.810
And unless you were really
clever, you wouldn't have

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.730
thought of it.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:09.510
But there's another small family
of plane groups that we

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.510
can get through one
particular device.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.420
I shouldn't have told you that,
because you'll be less

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.860
inclined to come back now.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.730
But we're almost through.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.630
And I think it'll be very clear
what these additional

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:21.880
possibilities are.
