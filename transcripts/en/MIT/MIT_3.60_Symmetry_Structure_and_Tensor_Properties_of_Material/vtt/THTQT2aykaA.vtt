00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:14.420
PROFESSOR: I wanted to make a
few comments on the third

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.530
problem set, which was
a funny puzzle.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.320
And it was intended to be
entertaining and get you

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.320
thinking about things
related to symmetry

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.250
in an amusing context.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.640
And there were two problems.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.030
The first problem had a platter
on which there were

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.650
arranged cherries with either
two or three berries to a

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.940
spray, and apples and pears.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.300
And they were either black or
white, which didn't make then

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.130
particularly appetizing.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.140
But in any case, there were
three platters and the fruits

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.020
marched around on the platter.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.760
And the puzzle was, what
would be the fourth

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.280
platter in the sequence?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.090
This didn't involve symmetry
in any sense of the word.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.120
But yet, what was going on from
picture to picture was a

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.410
mapping of the motifs from
one location to another.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.430
Not just rotation or translation
or anything nice

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.870
in the crystallographic, but
still they were being moved

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.010
from one location to another.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.300
And just about everybody
got the right

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.420
answer just by deduction.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.430
But the reason I liked that
problem, and the reason I gave

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.030
it to you, is that it introduced
another sort of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.660
transformation.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.000
One of the pairs of fruits not
only change locations, but

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.150
they switched from black to
white as you went from one

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.260
position to the other.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.880
And that is another sort of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.250
transformation we can introduce.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
And this is something we could
call color symmetry.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.230
And I would observe that this
is something that you are

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.830
already very familiar with in
patterns, in particular, in

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.760
the pattern that is represented
by a checkerboard

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.140
where you have black squares
and white squares.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.450
This location here is a bona
fide four-fold axis, as is

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.010
this location here.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.670
But there other locations, such
as the corners of the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.180
black and white squares, where,
indeed, there is a 90

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.390
degree rotation that takes this
square and transforms it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.360
into this square.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.680
But in doing that
transformation, you change it

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.360
from a black one to a white one,
and then from a white one

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
to a black one again,
back to a white one.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.962
And that is a color symmetry.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:55.880
You could make it red and green
if you like to be a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.280
little more attractive.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.190
Similarly, there are mirror
lines like this that are true

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.240
mirror lines.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.030
The pattern is left invariant.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.140
There's another locus such as
this one here where when you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.050
reflect you go from a black one
to white one and then back

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.600
to a black one when you do
the operation twice.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.230
So there are black-white mirror
planes as well as

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.830
regular mirror planes.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.160
There are two-fold axes but all
of the two-fold axes are

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.390
black-white axes, white to
black, black back to white.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.070
So that's a new sort of
transformation that we can

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.540
develop if we wanted to,
switching the color.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.910
Does this is have any utility
in the physical sciences?

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.510
Be nice for wallpaper designers,
but does it have

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.360
utility in physical sciences?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.990
And the answer is yes.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.760
Because what is going on here
is that there is a binary

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.500
character assigned to
each of the motifs.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.990
So any time the atom or
whatever you have, the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.240
molecule, has some sort of
binary characteristic that it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.840
can exist in two distinct
states, the arrangement of

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.080
that sort of motif requires
a black-white symmetry.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.080
And one example in crystals
that requires this sort of

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.610
symmetry is the case of
a magnetic structure--

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.480
and I think I mentioned this
last time-- where the magnetic

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.760
moment can either point
up or down.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.500
Well, saying that you have an
atom with spin up and an atom

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.470
with spin down is the same thing
as saying, in terms of

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.140
transformations, having a black
atom or a white atom.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.270
It's a binary character that
switches from atom to atom.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.314
Could you have three
color symmetries?

00:04:36.314 --> 00:04:36.746
Yeah.

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:37.830
You can.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.020
There is a Dutch artist named
Maurits Escher who spent much

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.280
of his, career deducing
patterns, and did this in a

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.080
purely intuitive way.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.100
I mean you look at these
patterns and say, wow, that

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.470
guy is some crystallographer.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.310
But I heard him, while he was
still alive, speak twice.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.700
And he describes it in
metaphysical terms.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.330
This is the twoness merging with
the fourness, and just

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.580
completely intuitive.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.790
But his patterns are gorgeous.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.650
And he has a number of very nice
ones that are three-color

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.790
symmetries.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.410
And maybe later on in the
term, I'll bring in a

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.520
projector and show you examples
of some of these.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.770
They're very entertaining.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.520
All right.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.420
So the purpose of that first
puzzle was to introduce you to

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.670
black-white symmetries.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.390
Then the second puzzle on the
sheet was a pretty dumb thing.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.310
There was a stack of blocks
and you said how many--

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.070
I asked how many blocks are
there in the stack?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.250
And you could count them
up, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.790
And If you did it right,
you came out with 32.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.570
So that was pretty dumb.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.090
Well, this was intended as an
example of how one can use

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.610
symmetry in the solution
of a physical problem.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.140
Let's suppose that you were a
cowboy and you had to go out

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.230
and buy horseshoes for
a herd of horses.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.660
Would you count the
number of feet?

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.960
No.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.924
You'd count the number of horses
and multiply by four.

00:06:08.924 --> 00:06:09.750
OK.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.061
So there you'd be
using symmetry.

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:15.826
Now The point of this
problem really was--

00:06:15.826 --> 00:06:17.535
You could have had this one.

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:20.600
We have just the exact
number seats.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:27.092
The point of this problem was
that you have to, in assigning

00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:31.140
a symmetry to a system,
usually make physical

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.290
assumptions.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.470
When you do a derivation, as
we've been doing for the last

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.490
several days, we say this is a
four-fold access, and there's

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.410
no ambiguity whatsoever.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.110
Because it's my ball game, and
I want it to be a four-fold

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.720
axis,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.480
But when you're given a pattern
or given a crystal and

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.500
you have to assign a symmetry
to that crystal, you

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.840
invariably have to
make assumptions.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.410
The person buying the
horseshoes, for example, has

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.390
to assume that five- and
six-legged horses are pretty

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:07.350
rare articles and that a horse
with only three or two legs is

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.905
going to be of little utility
to the rancher.

00:07:09.905 --> 00:07:12.680
It Would probably have a limited
existence at the

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.960
ranchers expense.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.240
So you're assuming that all
horse have four legs.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.110
In looking at a crystal, though,
things are not that

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.460
easy to decide.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.140
And let me give you a few really
practical examples.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.490
A lot of mineral crystals grow
in fissures in the rock.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.970
And let's suppose we've got a
crack, and bubbling through

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.050
this crack is a solution
that contains silica.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.690
And as the solution cools
off, it will deposit

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.140
a crystal of quartz.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.010
And this crystal of quartz would
probably grow looking

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.370
something like this.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.440
And you would knock the crystal
out of the rock.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.075
And you would say, what is the
symmetry of this crystal?

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.890
It doesn't appear to be anything
hexagonal about it.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.990
But what's happened is this
crystal if it had developed in

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.660
a uniform environment would have
had a hexagonal shape.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.040
But because the nutrients are
flowing in from one direction,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.990
it tends to elongate
in that direction.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.640
So how could you assign the
symmetry to that crystal that

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.840
you dug out of the rock?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.330
Unfortunately, crystals do not
come with a legend on the

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:37.409
bottom that says quartz SIO2
space group P3 subscript 121,

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:38.960
made in USA.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.860
You have to yourself assign
the symmetry.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.500
And what you would do is you
would look at this face and

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.050
this face and you say, gee,
these angles, when I measure

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.720
them, all turn out to
be 120 degrees.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.610
This face has a luster on
it that looks like the

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.190
luster on this face.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.360
This face has little edge pits
on it, and they point in the

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.820
same way as the edge
pits on this face.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.190
I can measure the electrical
conductivity and find that it

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.830
varies in a fashion consistent
with a hexagonal crystal.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.390
And you would do any physical
test that you decided you

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.430
would need to make.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.650
And then when you were all done,
you would say everything

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.810
that I can measure about this
crystal other than it's shape

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:28.060
is invariant to a 120
degree rotation.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:34.100
Quartz has a hexagonal shape
very often, but actually only

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.120
this face, this face, and this
face are symmetrically

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.760
equivalent.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.350
And there's only a three-fold
axis in there.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.550
And if you look very carefully
at this crystal, you could see

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.130
some difference there, too.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.085
The neighboring faces very often
have striations, very

00:09:50.085 --> 00:09:53.210
faint striations on one face,
no striations on the

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.890
neighboring face.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.540
So you find out all that can.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.550
You have to make some
assumptions, and then on that

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.860
basis decide the symmetry.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.920
Let me give you another
example.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.960
This is a real one.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.210
And one of the things that
it's fun to do is to grow

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.780
crystals from solution.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.040
The Science Museum has little
kits that you can buy that

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.150
have some powder that you could
heat up in water and

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.420
then put it in a beaker and put
a string in there, maybe

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.480
with a little crumb of the
stuff that you dissolved.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.340
And one of the crystals
that is nice for

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.410
this purpose is alum.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.790
It's a cubic crystal.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.810
And if you let the stuff set
there, it will form a nice,

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.063
lovely equiaxed cubed.

00:10:39.063 --> 00:10:43.190
Science Museum usually puts a
pinch of another salt in there

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.330
so the crystal is not only
pretty and shiny, it's purple

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.725
or it's the orange.

00:10:48.725 --> 00:10:52.830
Now, unless you attach this
little seed crystal carefully,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.230
there would be a good chance
that it would fall off and

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.850
land on the bottom
of the beaker.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.180
When that happened, your crystal
would not have the

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.670
shape of a cube.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.060
It would have a shape in which
these two top edges had length

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.970
L and these faces on the side
were exactly half that length.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.560
And what's happening is that
this crystal is growing in an

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.335
unconstrained environment.

00:11:18.335 --> 00:11:21.640
The nutrient is coming on and
crystallizing from all

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.820
directions.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.830
In this case, nutrient can't
get in from the directions

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.270
that are below the crystal.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.780
So the growth in that direction
is eliminated, and

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.100
this height is exactly
half that at

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.880
the edge of the crystal.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.480
So that's sort of a very
specialized case of a crystal

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.225
growing in a constrained
environment.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.110
I'm digressing now, but let me
make a few more remarks.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.485
The shape that a crystal has--

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.170
and the shape is in
crystallography designated by

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.460
a special term.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.710
It's called habit.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.960
Crystals that undergo plastic
deformation never die, they

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.280
just develop bad habits.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:15.590
Oh, come on.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.070
This is a tough crowd.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.510
I thought that was
pretty funny.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.810
Anyway.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.420
The habit that a crystal has
can depend very much on

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.730
impurities in the solution or
melt from which it grows.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.340
And let me suppose I start with
a little crystal that

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.650
looks like this.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.640
And there are two different
kinds of faces on there.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.540
And let's suppose one of them
grows rapidly and one of them

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.060
grows slowly.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.050
Which face do you think would
be the one that eventually

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.000
forms the boundaries to
the crystal volume?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.714
The fast-growing face or
the slow-growing face?

00:12:54.714 --> 00:12:55.670
AUDIENCE: Fast-growing face.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.640
PROFESSOR: Fast, slow are
both possibilities.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.320
Let's do a time lapse
experiment.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.840
Let's suppose that this is
the fast-growing face.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.070
And, after a certain amount of
time these faces would have

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.260
all advanced to this location.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.820
And this is the slow-growing
face.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.210
And after the same amount of
time, it will have advanced to

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.550
this location.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.650
After the next time increment,
this one would

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.100
have grown up to here.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.270
This would only have
grown that far.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.620
And you could see the only thing
that's gonna be left is

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.350
the slow-growing face.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.480
So it's sort of counter
intuitive.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.740
The faces that survive to bound
the crystal as rational

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.430
planes are the slow-growing
faces, not the

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:36.680
rapidly growing faces.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.670
This is of great use to the
people who want to control

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.330
crystal shape.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:51.020
And this is very often in very
every day, ordinary contexts.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.890
The people who grow table salt,
for example, want to

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.360
grow a crystal that has nice
pointy edges so when it comes

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.880
down on your tomato, it
doesn't bounce off.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.110
It sticks to it.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.930
So the shape of table
salt makes a

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.260
difference in how it behaves.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.250
And the way you change the shape
is to find something

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.760
that will be absorbed
preferentially on one set of

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.060
faces that you would like to
have be the faces that appear

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.470
on the crystal.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:22.980
And that will do the
job for you.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.070
I'll close with just one final
example of this in real, every

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.230
day industry or technology.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:35.790
I once had a phone call from a
company that made salt for

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.240
sprinkling on roads in the
winter time, particularly

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.830
around New England when the
roads tend to ice up.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.070
And in an earlier era it, was
politically correct to use

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.760
sodium chloride.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.760
But you wanted the sodium
chloride, if you could, to

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.270
have an acicular, a needle-like,
shape to improve

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.680
its flow properties so you
didn't waste a lot when you

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.120
shook it out of the
back of the truck.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.680
And the material that they use
for that-- you think rock salt

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.450
in the environment is bad--

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.580
they used a cyanide compound to
modify the growth habit and

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.430
make it needle-like.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.970
And they wanted to get away
from that before they were

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:22.330
really dragged into some sort
of trial by the EPA.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.420
And did I know of something that
could change the shape of

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.025
the salt crystals for them?

00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:30.720
And the answer to that
question was quite

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.560
straightforward.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.450
No.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.100
That was the end of
the conversation.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.760
But it was an interesting
example of how surface

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.090
chemistry can change
crystal shape.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.260
OK.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.480
So all that long-winded
explanation was a

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.130
justification of the
meaning of those

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.490
two final two puzzles.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.010
And the final thing I have to
say about them is that these

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.810
puzzles were lifted
from a puzzle book

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.030
published by MENSA.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.790
Have any of you heard
of MENSA?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:07.880
MENSA is an association of
self-declared geniuses.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.120
So this was a puzzle
book for geniuses.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.200
And you all did horribly well
on that third problem set.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.810
Everybody at MIT is bright.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.410
But you folks are not only
bright, you are geniuses

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.294
because you cracked
the MENSA puzzles.

00:16:24.294 --> 00:16:25.270
OK.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.080
Enough enjoyment and
fun and games.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.070
Let's get serious, back down to
what we were doing earlier.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:35.320
We had established in earlier
discussion that there are a

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:43.800
very limited number of ways in
which we can arrange a mirror

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.040
plane and a rotation
axis about one

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.690
fixed point in space.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.440
And these, accordingly, are
called the point groups.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.640
And in particular, they are
the two-dimensional

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.215
crystallographic point groups.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.859
We had rotation axes by
themselves, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.730
And these are the only ones we
need worry about because these

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.720
are the only rotational
symmetries that are compatible

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.369
with translation.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.679
Then we had a mirror plane.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.240
And then there was no reason
why we could not combine a

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.319
mirror plane with these
rotational symmetries.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.500
And in doing so, we used a
theorem that said if you take

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.590
two reflection operations,
sigma 1 and sigma 2-- and

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.510
again, I use sigma to represent
an individual

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.350
operation of reflection--

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.540
and a mirror plane is the
locus of operations of

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.415
reflection, and then reflecting
back again, there

00:17:47.415 --> 00:17:49.200
are two operations involved.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.920
And if these are combined at
some angle mu, sigma 1

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.480
followed by sigma 2, when they
are separated by an angle mu

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.940
is the same as the net
transformation of a rotation

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.300
about their point of
intersection through twice the

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.780
angle which the mirror
planes are combined.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.560
And that led us--

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.730
in addition to a one-fold axis,
a two-fold access, a

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:18.260
three-fold axis, a four-fold
axis, and a six-fold axis--

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.440
let us combine reflection with
these axes to get symmetry

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.080
combinations that we named
according to the symmetry

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.130
elements which were present
in the final combination.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.990
We used two mirror planes if the
mirror planes that arose

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.410
where independent.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.770
Independent in the sense that
the two-fold axis never turned

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:42.750
one into another.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.750
And independent in the sense
that if we draw a

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.970
representative motif, the way
those motifs were disposed

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.900
about one mirror plane was
different from the way they

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.730
were arranged about
the other one.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.830
For a four-fold axis, we could
add mirror planes.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.830
And they would have to be
at half the angle of the

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.380
four-fold axis.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.450
And as we saw, it was
kind of a mouthful

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:10.700
to call this 4MMMMMMMM.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.210
There were just two kinds of
mirror planes, so this one was

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.240
called 4MM.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.300
6MM, analogously, was a six-fold
axis with mirror

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.490
planes separated by 30 degrees,
half the throw of the

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.400
six-fold axis.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:35.370
And the one that I left out is
3, not m m but 3M because a

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:41.540
three-fold axis has
mirror planes

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.750
separated by 60 degrees.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:49.190
And the same thing goes on at
each of these mirror planes,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.730
pair of objects hanging at one
end of the mirror plane, the

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.730
other end is unadorned.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.180
So they all behave the same.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.060
There's only one kind
of mirror plane.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.530
The three-fold axis maps one
mirror plane into another, and

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.360
so they have to be the same.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:11.130
So therefore, only one M
appears in the symbol.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:17.050
Independent of this, we had,
when we combined reflection or

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.230
rotation with a lattice, found
that there were a very limited

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:24.990
number of lattices in two
dimensions, the oblique

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:33.560
lattice which had T1 not equal
to T2 and T1 inclined to T2 by

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.690
some general angle.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.600
The next degree of
specialization was for a

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.580
two-fold axis-- so either a
one-fold or a two-fold axis

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.622
could fit in here.

00:20:46.622 --> 00:20:51.960
For a three-fold axis or a
six-fold axis, we had to have

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.390
a lattice in which the two
translations were identical to

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:01.230
one another, identical in
magnitude and identical in the

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.060
way the atoms were ranged
relative to these

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.300
translations.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.740
And the angle between
T1 over T2 had to be

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.560
identically 120 degrees.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.920
And by convention, we take the
larger of two angles, 120

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.806
rather than 60, to define
the inter axial angle.

00:21:21.806 --> 00:21:27.130
A four-fold axis required a net
that was exactly square,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.240
not approximately square
but exactly square.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.930
So T1 and T2 had to be identical
in magnitude.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.960
The angle between them had
to be exactly 90 degrees.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.300
And close is no cigar.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.700
It has to be exactly 90 degrees
because that angle is

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.700
generated by symmetry.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.930
And then at the place in which
I'm gonna pick up today in

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:53.975
just a moment is the case of a
mirror plane and reflection,

00:21:53.975 --> 00:21:57.970
we saw depending on how we
arranged the translations

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.090
relative to the reflection
plane, could give us either a

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.290
lattice in the shape
of a rectangle--

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:11.480
and here T1 and T2 made an angle
of exactly 90 degrees.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.210
But the magnitude of T1 could be
anything it liked relative

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:20.400
to the magnitude of T2, and then
a double cell, which had

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.140
the shape of a diamond.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.820
But it was operationally much
to our advantage to pick a

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.200
double cell which had
a right angle in it.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.940
And the reason for that was that
it is a nightmare to do

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.750
calculations of inter-atomic
distances and angles or angles

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.040
between faces in an
oblique system.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.980
The right angle makes these
calculations very simple.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.270
And the fact that this cell
tells you twice as much of the

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.330
area as you really need
to know about is a

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.650
small price to pay.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.810
So this is the rectangular
net, as

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.550
we'll call it in words.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.480
And this is one that
we'll call the

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.730
centered rectangular net.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:15.170
OK.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.660
So let me pause here and suck
in air and see if there are

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.766
any questions.

00:23:19.766 --> 00:23:21.590
This is where we left off.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.500
And now having everything spread
out on the board, we're

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.320
going to start to make
combinations and

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.310
continue that process.

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.090
Yes, sir.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.743
AUDIENCE: So the centered
rectangular has the same exact

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.961
[? intercept ?] as the
rectangular but the only thing

00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:34.180
you're doing is you're deriving
it based on symmetry

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.645
that you're using like a diamond
kind of thing to get

00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:37.138
the center one?

00:23:37.138 --> 00:23:37.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.760
So all these arose when we did
it slowly and systematically.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.930
We said let's let this be the
location of the mirror plane.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:49.210
What happens if we combine
it with a translation?

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.820
We can take one lattice point
on the mirror plane since

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.740
there's no unique
lattice point.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.530
And then the mirror plane
is gonna reflect

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.710
this over to here.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.340
So here's a first translation.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.170
I've got a second non-colinear
translation.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.420
Wham-o.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.530
Instant lattice.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:09.720
So what I'm doing is taking this
diamond shape and I am

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.530
taking one translation here--
let's put some labels on this.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.870
Let's call this T1
and this T2.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.930
So this translation here, call
it T1 prime, is my original

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.490
translation T1 plus T2.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:30.778
In this translation, T2 is
the negative of the--

00:24:30.778 --> 00:24:31.004
Yeah.

00:24:31.004 --> 00:24:34.660
It's gonna be minus
T1 plus T2.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.130
So I've taken linear
combinations of the two

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.950
vectors of the diamond-shaped
cell.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:46.870
And again, this is contrary to
the rules we have that say

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:48.980
pick the shortest two
translations.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.010
Why?

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.295
The final larger area of
volume then you need.

00:24:52.295 --> 00:24:56.990
And the answer to that is
occasionally the provision of

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.970
a coordinate system, which is
far easier to work in, is a

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.375
small price to pay for
that redundancy.

00:25:04.375 --> 00:25:04.800
OK.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.770
And then the primitive
rectangular net, just to

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.855
remind you again, we said is
there any case in which this

00:25:09.855 --> 00:25:11.100
is not true?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.380
And that case was if you take
T1 exactly perpendicular to

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.200
the mirror plane and then you
define only a lattice row.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.110
So that gives you a second
choice for T2.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.960
You can't pick it anywhere you
like, otherwise it gets

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.970
reflected across just as in the
first case, and you have

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.800
two translations that
are not compatible.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.850
And the only way that they are
compatible is that if you make

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.870
the translation T1 straddle
the mirror plane.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.810
And that's what we've
already got up here.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.870
So that's how we got the
rectangular net.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:46.320
We could get a second distinct
sort of lattice only if this

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.460
translation was exactly in the
plane of the mirror line.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:49.880
Yes, sir.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.039
AUDIENCE: But the number and
kind of symmetry elements are

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.740
the same for both, right?

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.684
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:56.684 --> 00:25:58.640
AUDIENCE: Uh, so--

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.670
PROFESSOR: So there's a curious
sort of duality here.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.610
Here in the case of a hexagonal
net, this is just a

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.030
lattice of a very specialized
shape.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.790
And does that have a six-fold
axis in it?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.870
No, not unless I decide
to put one in.

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.660
I could put in a three-fold
axis, alternatively.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.700
So here, I have one lattice that
can accept two different

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.900
kinds of symmetry.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.950
Here I've got the reverse
situation.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.500
I have two distinct kind of
lattices, both of which are

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.860
happy and content with the
same symmetry on them.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.560
So there's going to be a far
greater number of combinations

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.180
of lattice with symmetry than
simply a one-to-one

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.600
correspondence between lattice
types and point group types.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.440
OK.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.690
Any other questions?

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.460
All right so let me now shift
down to low gear and remind

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.930
you of one thing that
we did last time.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:14.060
We asked what happens if I can
combine a rotation operation,

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.690
a alpha, with a translation?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.510
Call this T1.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:25.900
Sounds like something I already
did in showing that

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.490
the values of alpha are
restricted to values.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.480
But what I'm going to do now is
use something that looks as

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.220
though it's a similar starting
point to arrive at a different

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.270
result that we saw last time.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:47.760
I'm going to deliberately look
at a line that is alpha over 2

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.410
on one side of the perpendicular
to T1.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:58.730
And then the operation of the a
alpha is going to take this

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.930
translation with a lattice point
of necessity at the end

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:06.530
of it, and it's going to move it
over to here, alpha over 2,

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:10.540
on the other side of the
translation of the

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.470
perpendicular.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.850
Then I'm going to pick this up
with the translation T1 and

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:21.050
move it and everything along
it to a location like this.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:28.280
And my question now is, what
is a alpha followed by the

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.805
translation T1?

00:28:31.805 --> 00:28:34.540
The handedness of the objects
have not changed.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.900
So this has to be either

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.530
translation or another rotation.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.510
And what we can very quickly
show is if upon dropping a

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:48.050
perpendicular down to the
original translation, these

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.310
lines are parallel.

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.800
This line cuts across it.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.470
So this angle is alpha over 2.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.730
And this line is inclined
to the perpendicular

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.140
by alpha over 2.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:05.580
So this angle in here is
also alpha over 2.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.900
So the answer is that if I
rotate from one location to

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.420
another by rotation alpha and
then pick up that motif or the

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:22.710
entire space and translate it by
the original translation T1

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.010
to get a third one-- this is
number 1, right-handed, say,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.040
number 2, right-handed.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.150
This is number 3.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.470
Stays right-handed.

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.750
Has to be related
by a rotation.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.540
And we next ask, what point is
the point about which the

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.230
rotation occurs?

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:40.110
Then we used--

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.240
what at the time seemed like
a trivial observation--

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.830
that a rotation axis in space
or a rotation point in two

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.080
dimensions is the locus
that is left

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.500
unmoved by the rotation.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.460
So if rotating from here and
translating over to here is

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.770
equivalent to a rotation and if
the locus of the rotation

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:08.530
has to be the point that's
left on moved, bingo.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.370
That's where the rotation
occurs.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.260
And it's through the same angle,
so we can label this an

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.870
operation b alpha.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.050
And we know exactly where
that point is gonna be.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:24.080
It's gonna be along the
perpendicular bisector of the

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.300
original translation.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.180
And it's gonna be up a distance
x which is T over 2

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.185
times the cotangent
of alpha over 2.

00:30:33.185 --> 00:30:38.490
So now we've got another, what
I call, combination theorems.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.260
And again, this is nothing
more than knowing how to

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.490
complete the product of two
operations in establishing the

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.130
group multiplication table.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:51.970
so let me write it down in the
form of a combination theorem.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:59.060
This says that a alpha followed
by a translation is

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.570
another rotation--

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.190
in the same sense, both counter

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:06.550
clockwise in this example--

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.280
another rotation b alpha in the
same sense about a point

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:15.550
that is always T over 2 times
the cotangent of alpha over 2

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.310
along the perpendicular
bisector.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.870
So that's how you would go about
making an entry in the

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:24.050
group multiplication table.

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:24.260
Sorry.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:24.890
I put you off.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.316
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.840
Can you just, like, I just
want to see what you did

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.830
actually to the motif
in that drawing.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.520
Rather than taking an
abstraction, an arbitrary line

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.210
that is at alpha over 2, I put
a motif in the space that

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.240
doesn't necessarily hang on this
particular locus that I

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.550
drew for reference.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.650
And the rotation through alpha
would move it to here.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.600
It's lagging behind
this first line.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.550
It lagged behind the second
one by the same amount.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.850
Then I pick it up and I move it
by the same translation and

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.780
that slides it over here, still
canted over to the left.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:06.260
And now what I claim is that I
get from the first one to the

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.170
third one--

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.740
and actually should have
raised your hand on a

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.470
different matter.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.540
This is out in front
of the translation.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.380
So number 3 should sit here,
also to the right to the

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.720
translation.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.590
And the way I get from 1
to 3 in one shot is by

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.919
rotating alpha b.

00:32:23.913 --> 00:32:26.408
OK.

00:32:26.408 --> 00:32:31.840
Now, a cautionary note just so
you do not use your new power

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.330
recklessly.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:47.710
Let me emphasize that this is
an escalation in operations,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.183
not in symmetry elements.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:04.990
And the reason for that is
that a rotation axis, in

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.190
general, contains a number
of different rotations.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.840
An n-fold axis has n different
rotation operations implied in

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.760
it, including the identity
operation of

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.850
rotating 360 degrees.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.460
So if I say I'm gonna drop a
four-fold access in a lattice,

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.570
what I'm doing is dropping into
the lattice a 90 degree

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.430
rotation, a 180 degree
rotation, and

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.180
a 270 degree rotation.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:35.500
And the location of the new
operations depends on alpha.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.050
So these new operations
are not gonna pop

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.560
up at the same location.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.660
They're gonna be sprinkled
over different locations.

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.740
So as an abstraction, that may
be hard to appreciate.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.960
But we're going to straight
away derive a

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.560
couple of more additions.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.320
And then when we see what
happens upon adding a rotation

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:00.570
axis to a lattice in a couple of
nontrivial cases, I'll just

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.710
summarize the results and assume
that you'll be able to

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.450
derive them on your own.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.120
The last time we had got around
to doing just one of

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.460
these combinations.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.730
And we ask what happens when you
combine with a translation

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.290
a rotation operation a pi.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:24.760
So we'll take some motif that
sets up here, right-handed,

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.960
rotate it by 180 degrees to
get a second one, and then

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:35.020
pick that up and translate it by
T. So I'll get a third one

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:39.650
sitting down like this of
the same handedness.

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.750
And the question now is
how do I get from

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.449
1 to number 3 directly?

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.020
Well, let's use our theorem.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.010
Our theorem says we should
go a distance x along the

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.989
perpendicular bisector, which
is half the magnitude of T

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:57.310
times the cotangent
of pi over 2.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.120
The cotangent of pi
over 2 is zero.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.760
So we go up a distance x.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.860
That's equal to 0, all in the
perpendicular bisector, which

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.680
means we stay put.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.860
And--

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:13.060
in this class, there is always
truth in advertising.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.580
Around this locus here is a
rotation operation b pi, which

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.820
takes the first one into
the third one.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.720
OK.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.450
And now, lickety split, I will
derive again-- and I apologize

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:33.500
for going fast because I
did do it last time.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.730
Let's ask what happens when we
combine a two-fold axis with a

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.160
parallelogram net?

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.030
So we're taking a two-fold axis
plus a parallelogram net.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.070
In this two dimensional
lattice there are two

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:54.880
translations, T1 and T2, of
arbitrary magnitude with some

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.960
angle between them
that's arbitrary.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.440
And to this lattice point,
I'll add a two-fold axis.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.880
A two-fold axis involves the
presence of two operations,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.490
the identity operation, and that
we can forget about, and

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:14.520
then there's the
operation a pi.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:19.250
By combine a pi with T1, I'll
get an operation b pi that

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.910
sits at the midpoint of T1.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:28.340
If I combine a pi with T2, we
get an operation c pi at the

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.900
midpoint of T2.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:37.540
If I combine a pi with T1 plus
T2, I'll get another operation

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.680
d pi at the center
of the cell.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.540
And we don't have to ask what
happens when we go three

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.160
translations over.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.730
There's gonna be another
operation of 180 degree

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.340
rotation on that translation.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:55.420
But we really only need bother
about what goes on on the

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.720
edges and in the interior of
one unit cell, because

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.340
whatever's there has to be
repeated by translation.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:15.270
So, in making these additions,
we need consider only

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.740
independent translations--

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.110
that is, not related
to one another by

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.660
the rotational symmetry--

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:28.050
independent translations
that terminate

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.300
within the unit cell.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:45.860
And that means for the addition
of a two-fold axis, I

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.570
need do only what I have,
in fact, just done.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:57.850
I want to consider a pi with
T1, T2, and T1 plus T2.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:07.010
If I have the operation a pi
or b pi or c pi or d pi at

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:15.720
these four locations, that is
all I need have present to say

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.250
that I have, in addition to the
two-fold axis that I added

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.390
to the lattice point, a two-fold
axis halfway along

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:28.230
T1, a two-fold access halfway
along T2, and another one

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.680
smack in the middle
of the cell.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.140
These are lattice points.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.050
So those axes have to be
repeated by translations, this

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:40.560
one from here to here, this one
from here, this one from

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.600
here to here.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.240
So I'll have two-fold axes in
the middle of all of the edges

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:51.150
of the cell plus this fourth
one right in the middle.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:56.610
So this is an example of a two
dimensional space group.

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.470
It's a symmetry that acts
on all of space.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:10.400
And the names that we will give
to these combinations is

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.820
a symbol for the symmetry
element that we added, in this

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.930
case a two-fold axis.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:21.480
And then we'll specify the
nature of the lattice to which

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.630
we've added it.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:25.930
And all that I have to say is
that the lattice is primitive

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:30.200
because you're all aware at
this point that a two-fold

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.540
axis requires only
a primitive, a

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.990
parallelogram net.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.770
The only place we'll need a
special symbol is when we add

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.610
a mirror plane to either the
rectangular net or the

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:41.910
centered rectangular net.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.450
And then we'll have to specify
which type of lattice of that

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:48.023
shape, primitive or centered,
we're dealing with.

00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:48.790
Yes, sir.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:50.511
AUDIENCE: So all you did with
that derivation there is prove

00:39:50.511 --> 00:39:52.115
that you don't have
to worry about any

00:39:52.115 --> 00:39:54.039
rotations outside of that?

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:54.520
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.482
AUDIENCE: That's correct?

00:39:55.482 --> 00:39:57.410
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:59.640
Which is very fortunate 'cause
there's an infinite number

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.730
lurking outside the boundaries
of the cell.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:05.300
I'll show you another
general truth.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.650
What does a pattern look like?

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:12.780
The pattern looks exactly like
the pattern of a two-fold axis

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.530
with that pattern of motifs hung
at every lattice point.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:29.250
These new two-fold axes don't
do any further repetition of

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.610
the motifs.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.040
They don't do any repetition
of the motif.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.770
They just express relation
between things that you get

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.820
when you take this pair and
then repeat it by the

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.250
translations.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.500
So this two-fold access, for
example, relates this to this.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.460
This two-fold axis relates this
one to this one, and this

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.130
one to this one, and so on.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.280
They're just relations that
exist between the things that

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.260
you get when you add the pattern
of a two-fold axis to

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.090
a lattice point.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:02.420
So another generalization of
what we're doing here that

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:17.100
turns out to be valid, the
pattern of motifs for a

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:43.460
particular plane group is
nothing more than the pattern

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.760
of the symmetry element--

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.670
symmetry element or symmetry
elements, sometimes we'll be

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.920
adding more than one--

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.330
that we've added to
a lattice point.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.330
So in other words, if we take
2MM and drop that into a

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.700
rectangular lattice, the pattern
is simply gonna be

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:33.400
these four atoms related by 2MM
hung at every corner of

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.385
the lattice.

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:37.700
If you add it to a centered
lattice, these would be hung

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.890
at every corner of the lattice,
and also at the

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.330
centered lattice point.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.790
So it's that simple.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.490
If you look at some of these
high symmetry space groups or

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.050
plane groups, wow, there's
symmetry all over the place.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.960
You say, how can I draw
a pattern for that?

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.550
Easy.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.060
Just do what the point group
does and drop it in at the

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:55.300
lattice points.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.530
So that turns out to be a
universal feature of all space

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:00.780
groups and plane groups.

00:43:03.187 --> 00:43:03.670
OK.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.320
Somebody had a question over
here and I cut you off.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:05.750
Yeah.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.871
On that two [INAUDIBLE] diagram,
wouldn't you want to

00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:11.642
use four of those because you
said it was-- you don't

00:43:11.642 --> 00:43:14.255
concern ones that are-- you're
only concerned independent

00:43:14.255 --> 00:43:15.690
ones, the ones you
can't get by--

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.090
PROFESSOR: You're absolutely
right.

00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:19.070
And let's look at this
pattern again.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.610
Here are a pair that are
hanging close to

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.680
this two-fold axis.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.910
Here's a pair hanging close
to the two-fold axis, very

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.520
different arrangement, different
arrangement relative

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.780
to this two-fold axis, different
arrangements

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.260
relative to this
two-fold axis.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.660
So what we're saying is-- and
this is the way, in fact, we

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:37.680
derive them--

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.640
that these four two-fold
axes are all distinct.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.210
But the ones that are along the
edges are just related by

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:47.800
translation.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.420
So why do I have
to put them in?

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.240
AUDIENCE: You just put them in
to just show the symmetry?

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.710
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:53.490
Exactly.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:57.080
Exactly. 'Cause if I say this
is a lattice and I have

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:03.900
two-fold axes here, that's an
incomplete representation

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.980
because if these are
translations, I jolly well

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.290
better have the same thing at
all the lattice points.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.230
I'm just emphasizing the
property of a lattice which is

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.930
understood to be present in
all of these combinations.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.330
OK.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.580
Other questions?

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:30.060
And I would remind you that a
reasonable question or request

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.890
would be, could you
do that all again,

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.800
please, at half speed?

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.700
And I'd be happy to comply.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.500
But really this is ground that
we covered last time.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.100
And I'm just reinforcing it.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.650
So now that we've run out
of time, we can go on to

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:43.910
something new.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.940
Let me do, in the couple minutes
remaining, let me make

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:52.130
one more addition just to show
you how things change when you

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.930
add a rotation axis
that has more than

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.745
one rotation operation.

00:44:58.745 --> 00:45:01.970
Let me ask what happens
when you add a

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.430
four-fold axis to a lattice.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.050
We've seen that a four-fold
axis can coexist with no

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:15.940
lattice other than 1, which is
dimensionally square and which

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:22.940
has the same thing hanging
about, two translations that

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.400
are exactly 90 degrees apart.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:32.030
So what we're doing is taking
a four-fold axis and drop it

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.030
in at the corner lattice point
and then step back before all

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.872
hell breaks looks.

00:45:37.872 --> 00:45:40.510
Now, first thing we're gonna
do is to get the four-fold

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:44.980
axis at every corner
lattice point.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:48.970
And then we're gonna use our
theorem, taking into account

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.910
that when I say I'm adding a
four-fold axis, I am adding

00:45:52.910 --> 00:46:01.010
the operations a pi over
2, a pi, a3 pi over 2.

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:06.490
But let me call that, instead,
a minus pi over 2, the same

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.900
thing and a little easier
to deal with.

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.860
And then the operation a2 pi,
which is the same as the

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.020
identity operation.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.950
And that's dull and
uninteresting, so we won't

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.580
consider that addition.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:22.820
We've already done this,
a pi, in deriving P2.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.810
And that's the nice thing
about this derivation.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.400
It's gonna snowball because as
the symmetry gets higher,

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.220
we've already done the work for
the subgroup that contains

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.955
the elements that are present
in the higher symmetry.

00:46:34.955 --> 00:46:39.550
So we'll get an operation
a pi over a pi here.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.010
We'll get an operation
a pi here.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.950
And if we take the diagonal
translation, T1 plus T2, I'll

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.600
get the operation a pi here.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.260
Or I should probably call them
a pi, b pi, and c pi to

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:58.050
indicate that these are
different two-fold axes.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.510
OK.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:03.580
Let me emphasize again that this
theorem that we have is a

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.330
theorem in individual
operations and

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.760
not symmetry elements.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.670
If I say a four-fold axis is
present, it means that all of

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:13.560
these operations exist
about that locus.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:18.260
I cannot say that a four-fold
axis sits here.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.550
I cannot say a four-fold
axis sits here.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.740
I'm gonna have to take each of
these combinations in turn and

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:29.250
then step back and see what
operations exist about the

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.720
various loci within the cell.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.890
So the one that's really
different is the combination

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:40.465
of a translation T with the
operation a pi over 2.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:52.300
And my theorem says if I put in
a motif and rotate it by 90

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.550
degrees to here--

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:56.770
so this is number 1 and
this is number 2--

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:02.780
and then translate it to a
location that's related to the

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.010
first by symmetry--

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.030
by translation to
get number 3--

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:15.240
they will be related by an
operation b pi over 2 that

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.020
sits up along the perpendicular
bisector by an

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:25.100
amount x, which is T over 2
times the cotangent of alpha

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:36.483
over 2, T over 2 times the
cotangent of 1/2 of pi over 2,

00:48:36.483 --> 00:48:37.780
45 degrees.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:43.660
The cotangent of 45 degrees is
unity because the two edges of

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.220
the triangle are equal
in length.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:50.860
So this says I should go up
along the perpendicular

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.760
bisector by an amount that is
half the length of the cell.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:01.410
And that puts me right in
the middle of the cell.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:08.330
So the operation b pi over 2
sits not at the edge of the

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.290
cell, but at the center
of the cell.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:17.660
And that, I think you will
agree, even in this hastily

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.950
sketched diagram, is the way
number 1 is related directly

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.860
to number 3 in one shot.

00:49:26.686 --> 00:49:29.970
Now I could do it on the
cheap from here.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.260
But let's show that
we have first an

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.340
operation a pi over 2.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.520
We've already got the
operation c pi.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:43.070
Let's now combine the operation
a minus pi over 2.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:54.480
And that says that for c minus
pi over 2, I would go up the

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.270
perpendicular bisector a
distance T over 2 times the

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:03.400
cotangent of minus
1/2 of pi over 2.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.010
And the cotangent of a negative
angle is minus that.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.520
So I go a distance minus
T over 2 along the

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.710
perpendicular bisector.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:19.870
And what that is gonna do is to
bring me to the center of

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:22.510
the cell that's directly
below.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:30.000
And this will be the rotation
c minus pi over 2.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.650
But everything has to be
translation equivalent at the

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:38.460
interval T. So I can just move
this operation c minus pi over

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:42.160
2 up to the center of
my original cell.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.780
So now I have at the center of
the cell all the operations of

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.700
a four-fold axis.

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:53.370
So a four-fold axis exists in
the middle of the cell.

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.660
And let me write the
results in here.

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.420
I've now got all of the
operations of a four-fold axis

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.540
sitting here.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.030
I've got all the operations
of a two-fold axis

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.430
sitting here and here.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:08.650
So this is the final result,
if I translate the two-fold

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:10.950
axes over to the other
edges of the cell.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:18.846
AUDIENCE: What is that angle
[? by the d project? ?]

00:51:18.846 --> 00:51:21.080
That should be 90 degrees?

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.410
PROFESSOR: That should
be 90 degrees,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.580
if I drew it carefully.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.090
Yeah.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:32.250
So let me give the final result
with a pattern in it.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.350
These are the two translations,
equal in length,

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.800
four-fold here, four-fold
here, four-fold here.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.620
They are all the same
four-fold axis.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.180
Four-fold axis in the
middle of the cell.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.970
Two-fold axis in the middle
of the cell edges.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:51.780
And the pattern of objects is
the set of things that are

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:56.330
rotated by 90 degrees that form
a square about the corner

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.580
of the cell.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:00.960
Another one here.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.760
Another one that sits up here.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.000
And another one that
sits like this.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.060
Four of them on the corners
of the square.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.830
And that's all we're going
to get in this pattern.

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:19.440
Again, it's just a pattern of a
four-fold axis that is hung

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.970
at every lattice point
of the square net.

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:34.010
And these other symmetry
elements that arise simply are

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.360
things that relate to the
squares that are hanging at

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.350
every corner of the
square cell.

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.180
OK.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.970
So the square in the center of
the cell, for example, relates

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.520
these four.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.030
And you can pick any other
four and they'd

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.230
be related as well.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.780
The two-fold axis relates
this to this.

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.490
This two-fold axis relates this
to this and this to this.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.910
So the pattern is just the
square produced by four

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:09.620
stamped out at every corner
of the square net.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.870
And it's that simple.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.164
The name of this thing--

00:53:17.164 --> 00:53:18.080
what have we done?

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.740
We've taken a four-fold
axis, we've put it

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.390
in a primitive net.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:26.520
I don't have to tell you it's
squared because in your heart

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.455
of hearts know that
that is what a

00:53:28.455 --> 00:53:30.480
four-fold axis requires.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.050
So this describes
completely the

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.810
combinations that's been made.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.010
And this is a representative
pattern.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:38.680
A pattern of this sort is one
that we've seen several times

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:40.620
already in describing
sample symmetries.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.610
That is the plane group
of square floor tiles.

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:50.900
It's the plane group of the
square mesh that's in the

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:54.540
overhead lighting fixtures.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.380
It's the pattern that is present
in the tiles up above

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.060
the lighting fixtures.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.160
It's a pattern that is very
commonly present in square

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.820
shirts, but not too often.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.070
It's kind of dull and
uninteresting.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:09.890
Yes.

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.560
Fellow back there against the
wall wearing P4, probably

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.410
didn't know until now.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:17.660
Thank you.

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.050
Actually, he's a shield.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:21.710
I made him come in.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.280
I called him up last night
and said be sure

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.610
you wear the P4 shirt.

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:27.530
And he said, OK, I will.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.090
All right.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:28.890
I'm getting silly.

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:31.190
So that's tells me it's
time to quit.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.550
So let's take our usual
10 minute break,

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:34.950
And then we'll resume.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:38.120
And I think I'll go lickety
split through the remaining

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.610
plane groups that consists of
combinations of a rotation

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.690
with a lattice.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.580
OK.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.830
So do come back.
