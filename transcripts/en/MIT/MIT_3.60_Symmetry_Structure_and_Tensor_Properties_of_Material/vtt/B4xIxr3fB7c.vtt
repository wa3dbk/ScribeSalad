00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.710
PROFESSOR: We are thundering
rapidly to the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.620
midpoint of the term.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.720
I think a week from this
coming Thursday will be

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.020
exactly halfway, and the
halfway point is when I

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.380
usually try, give or take a
day, to change gears very

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.080
abruptly and start looking at
the symmetry of physical

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.980
properties and tensors and
actual discussion of physical

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.100
properties that are
anisotropic.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860
So we'll be finishing
up our discussion of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.370
symmetry fairly quickly.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.520
We still have, however, some
major derivations to perform,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.430
and we'll get into one
of these today.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.810
Last time we had begun the
process of deriving what are

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:06.220
called the point groups as
opposed to the plane groups.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
The plane groups were
combinations of symmetry with

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.950
a lattice that extended
throughout a plane in space.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.510
A point group we've seen in the
form of two-dimensional

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.340
point groups.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.620
We're now going to today derive
the three-dimensional

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.630
point groups.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.920
And, again, the name stems from
the fact that these are

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710
clusters of symmetry about a
common point so that at very

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
least that one point
in space stays put.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770
So, hence, point groups--

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.800
these are symmetries
about a point.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.150
And to put some embellishing
adjectives on here, these will

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.670
be the three-dimensional
crystallographic point groups.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.190
Because there are an infinite
number of point groups, we're

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.930
considering just those
symmetries that can be

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.340
combined with a lattice
and therefore are

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.970
permissible to crystals.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.530
I'd like to point out in case
you've not been making much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.580
use of Buerger's book that we
actually are getting back to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.570
Buerger's treatment.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.759
We'll do some of the derivations
over the next few

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.810
days with a little bit more
detail and with a slightly

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.420
different procedure
than Buerger.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.680
But the bases covered
are the same.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.920
So let me just point out where
some of this material is in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.790
Buerger's book.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.420
Buerger does Euler's
Construction, and he does this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.540
in a once over lightly.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.660
I think this is not the
best part of the book.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.080
This is on pages 35 to 43.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.730
In particular, he sort of leaps
ahead quickly and just

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.740
looks for one angle between
rotation axes and doesn't get

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.860
the-- do specifically the ones
that are 90 degrees and are

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.620
not as interesting.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.860
Some of the combination theorems
are in Chapter 6, and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:12.300
there you'll find the statement
that two reflections

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.600
at an angle mu is equivalent
to a net rotation of mu,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600
except Buerger doesn't
call them sigmas.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.640
He calls them m's.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.070
He uses the same symbol for
individual operations and for

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.500
the symmetry of them, and I
think that's a little untidy.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.470
Also, the theorem that says that
if we have a mirror plane

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.360
that's perpendicular to a
twofold rotation axis, that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.280
gives rise to inversion center
at the point of intersection.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.210
And then he launches into a
rather condensed version of

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.180
the derivation of the point
groups on pages 59 to 68.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:05.905
Then, in Chapter 7, derives the
two dimensional lattices

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.740
or the plane nets.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.330
This is on page 69 to 83.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.520
We've done that differently and
much more exhaustively by

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.100
deriving the two-dimensional
plane groups and the lattices

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.440
are part of the plane groups,
and we've gotten them

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.240
automatically.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.550
There is a place where in the
derivation of the space

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.190
lattices, he's a little bit
incomplete and actually does

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.480
something that's wrong A-ha--

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.400
I showed Buerger was wrong
at one place in his book.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.020
But anyway, this is where the
material that we're covering

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.730
now is mentioned in
Buerger's book.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.050
Last time, we had hit
a new surprise.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.230
We had asked if we take the
basic rotational symmetries

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.250
and add an inversion to
something like three--

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.230
so, three is a subgroup,
the operation of

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.760
inversion is an extender.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.560
We found that there was a new
operation that came up, and

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.805
this was a rotoinversion
operation.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.870
And then the resulting point
group, which we called 3-bar--

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.090
the symbol itself, 3-bar, is
a threefold rotoinversion.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.180
And if we were not clever
enough to invent a

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.040
rotoinversion operation, we
would have stumbled headlong

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.760
over it in adding inversion
as an extender

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.170
to a threefold axis.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.720
And a rotoinversion axis is
something that involves in

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.030
general rotating through some
angle alpha to get from a

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.360
first object to a second object
of the same handedness

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.310
and then not yet putting it
down, first inverting it

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.480
through axis--

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.050
through a point on the axis--

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.520
to get a second object.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.080
I shouldn't call this second
because this is not rotation

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.530
with inversion simultaneously
but a two step operation.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.450
So we rotate from 1 to this
virtual object also of same

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.880
handedness and then before
putting it down, we invert it

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.620
to get number two, which
is left handed.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.020
And the operation of getting
there in two steps but in one

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.920
repetition is the operation
of rotoinversion.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.280
That operation was one of the
members of the group that

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.360
results when you add inversion
as an extender to 3.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.570
But, really, this was not
something that was a new sort

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.465
of symmetry element.

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:59.960
It was an operation that came
up, but we could regard the

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.040
point down that we've labeled
3-bar as simply a threefold

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.910
axis with an inversion
center sitting on it.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.100
But then we looked
at another one.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.670
And by anticipation, I said
we ought to look at these.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.640
And we looked at what happened
when we took a fourfold

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.780
rotoinversion operation where we
would take the first object

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.060
number one, rotate it through
90 degrees, and

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.410
not yet put it down.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.390
We'd first invert it through a
point on an axis, and we got

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.090
one that was 90 degrees away
but pointing down in of

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.510
opposite handedness.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:41.370
If we repeated that operation
several times, we found that

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.740
we got two objects up above a
plane normal to the rotation

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.860
part of the operation and
passing through the point,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.810
which we inverted.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.780
So there's one right handed one
up here, a second right

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.830
handed one up here, and then two
down below, which were of

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.870
opposite chirality,
number 3 and 4.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.010
And that is an entirely
new beast.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.510
We have no way of describing
the relation between these

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.230
four objects other than saying
rotate, don't put it down,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.670
first invert.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.070
Rotate, don't put it down,
first invert again.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.370
So this is something
entirely new.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.200
It's a two step operation.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.780
You cannot describe it any more
simply than saying take

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.660
two steps to do the repetition
in the same sense that the

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.220
glide plane that we discovered
in the plane groups had a step

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.200
of translation followed
immediately by reflection, and

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.120
that was a new sort
of operation.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.630
So here's another example
of a two-step operation.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.110
The symbol for this point group
is 4-bar, and the symbol

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.140
for it-- if you want to indicate
its locus, is, it's

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.450
got a squareness to it because
these objects as mutually are

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.630
separated by 90 degrees, but it
really has only a twofold

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.310
symmetry, so the symmetry
for a 4-bar axis.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.790
It's not really an
axis at all.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.840
It's a 4-bar point,
because only a

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.660
point is left invariant.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.390
But the symbol for a 4-bar
"axis" is this square with a

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.270
little twofold axis
inscribed in it.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:14.940
Alright.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.090
We ought to really, then, step
back and ask how many

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.540
different rotoinversion axes
there might be, and add these

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.170
to our bags of tricks.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.350
And what I'm going to invite you
to do is to examine this

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.840
systematically on a problem set
which I will pass around,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.850
along with several other
problems for your

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.100
consideration, as well.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.770
And having stumbled onto that
combination, another thing we

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:53.350
might ask to broaden our bag of
tricks still further is to

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.665
say is there such a thing as
a rotoreflection axis?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.240
And we called n-bar
a rotoinversion.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.140
I wrote a reflection axis is
indicated by an n with this

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.590
little squiggle on top.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.610
Anyone who has studied Spanish
realizes that the proper name

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:28.240
for the squiggle is a
tilde, T-I-L-D-E.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.480
And this would be an operation
where there's a locus in which

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.130
we'll perform the reflection
part of the operation, so this

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.550
would be a 2 step operation that
involves taking a first

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.080
one and rotating it to a virtual
object number two but

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.490
not putting it down.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.500
Before putting it down, we will

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.080
reflect in a planar locus.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.270
So this is number two, and it
will be of opposite chirality.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.550
So that's another operation that
involves rotation coupled

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.020
as one part of a step that
involves R, the second of our

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.410
three translation free
operations, namely reflection

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.710
and inversion.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.830
So are these something
we should consider?

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.820
What I've invited you to do is
to draw out for n equals 1 to

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:26.700
8 the patterns produced by
rotoinversion and the patterns

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.220
created by rotoreflection, and
then see if you regard these

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.830
as new operations or whether
they can be broken down into

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.530
the simultaneous presence of
more than one of our old

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.970
friends such as 3-bar being a
plain old threefold axis with

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.560
an inversion sitting on it.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.940
The fact that I'm asking you
take your time to do this

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.410
suggests that yes, you are
going to find some

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.970
rotoinversion and rotoreflection
axes, which are

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.790
inherently 2 step operations
and can't be decomposed.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:13.110
What I'd like to do now, then,
is to systematically look at

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:17.100
the axial combinations.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:26.548
These are of the form n one,
two, three, four, and six and

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:29.220
the dihedral symmetries.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.780
These are of the form n22, or
just 32 in the case of the one

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.180
with the threefold axis.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.350
And then the two cubic
arrangements 23, twofold axis

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.980
out of the face normal to a
cube, threefold axes out of

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.990
all of the body diagonals,
and 432.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.320
And what I'm going to do with
you is to use these as

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.610
worksheets to guide the logic
of what we're doing, and we

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.260
won't do every single
one of them.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.970
I think once we do a few, the
general principle is clear and

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.990
the results there
are before you.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:15.940
But what we'll take, then, is
the axes n, the axes n22, and

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.410
then the two cubic symmetries
23 and 432.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.080
Then, finally, we found 4-bar
as a different rotation

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.650
axis-like symmetry element, so
I'll add that to the list.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.570
Then consider what we can add
to these symmetries as

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:43.150
extenders, and these are an
additional element that we can

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.590
add to what is already a

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.080
self-contained nice little group.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.070
We muck things up by introducing
another operation,

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.000
and then we'll have to take
combinations of that operation

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.720
with all the symmetry elements
that are there in the parent

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.780
subgroup and see what new
symmetry elements arise.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.860
The ground rules in these
additions are fairly simple

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.930
but nevertheless profound.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:21.730
The addition of the extender
cannot create any new symmetry

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:45.140
axes by its operation, and the
reason for that should be

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.150
quite clear.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:52.730
We obtained these combinations
of rotation axes using Euler's

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:59.110
principle, and that was
thorough and orderly,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.140
systematic and complete.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.810
These are the only
arrangements of

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.550
crystallographic rotation
axes that are possible.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.940
So if we add an extender that
creates, for example, a new

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.120
twofold axis in n22, it's either
going to be something

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.270
that we already have in this
list, and therefore not

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.710
interesting, or something
that just cannot

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.140
constitute a group.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.350
We'll take combinations of
operations and we will never

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.450
find a closed finite set.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:35.180
So if we add a mirror operation,
a reflection

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:41.960
operation as an extender, the
addition of the reflection

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:48.430
operation sigma must be either
perpendicular to the axis.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.040
And what that's going to do is
just flip the top part of the

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.840
rotation axis and reflect it
down to the bottom axis.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.080
Nothing new was created.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.200
And it could alternatively be
parallel to the axis and

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.700
passing through it.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.200
In that case, we've already seen
the consequences of this

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.440
addition in deriving the
two-dimensional point groups,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.540
namely to 2mm, 3m,
4mm, and 6mm.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.740
No new axis is created.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.720
One of the additions that is
something we mentioned last

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.750
time is that in the case of the
dihedral groups where we

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:31.130
have an n-fold axis and
then twofold axes

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.400
arranged in some fashion--

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.050
not in some arbitrary fashion.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:39.740
It's going to be 2 pi over n
times 1/2, depending on the

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.380
n-fold axis--

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.460
we could pass the
mirror operation

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.040
through the twofold axis.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.570
And that's what we'll call
a vertical mirror plane.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.990
But when there's more than one
axis present, we could also

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:59.450
put the reflection operation
diagonally in between the

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.560
twofold axes.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.609
So we're going to refer to this
as a diagonal mirror.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:11.079
It's snaked in between the
axes that are present.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.849
So, perpendicular reflection
operation as an extender, one

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:17.970
parallel to the axis and passing
through it, or one

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.220
that is diagonal passing
in between them.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.829
And finally, that exhausts
what we can do with

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.850
reflection, but we could
add inversion.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.340
And if we're not going create
new axes, and we're going to

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.730
get a point group-- a finite
set of objects--

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:46.740
the inversion center has to be
on one of the single axis,

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.260
namely these groups n, or at the
point of intersection, if

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:51.510
there's more than one.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.700
So there's the job
laid out for us.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.650
And we've got two theorems to
aid us in quickly finding the

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.030
new operations that arise--

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.870
in effect, taking a shortcut
to establish the group

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:20.050
multiplication table, and the
two theorems are as follows.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:27.390
We saw that if you take a
rotation operation A pi, that

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.030
takes a first object that's
right handed and rotates it to

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.690
a second object that is
also right handed.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:43.070
Then follow that by reflection
in a mirror plane that is

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.030
perpendicular to the axis.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.990
The net effect of going from 1
to number 3, which is left

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.870
handed, is to create an
inversion center at the point

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.120
of intersection.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.880
So there's a theorem that we
can write down once and for

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:09.870
all and say that A pi followed
by reflection in a mirror

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.480
plane that's perpendicular to
axis A has, as a net effect,

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.800
the operation of inversion.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.620
And if this is not a twofold
axis, it's something like a

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.480
fourfold axis or a sixfold
axis, that contains the

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.190
operation A pi as part of the
operations contained in that

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.310
axis, and that's going
to create an

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.430
inversion center as well.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.470
So for any evenfold axis, add a
perpendicular mirror plane,

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.670
and automatically the inversion
center comes up.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.180
And we can permute the order
of these operations if we

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.540
rotate by 180 degrees and then
invert the net effect is

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.940
reflection in the perpendicular
mirror plane.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.570
So this is something that you
permute around into three

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.820
different combinations.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.470
Does the order of the operation
make a difference?

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.815
And the answer is no, the
order is not important.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.290
For example, rotating and then
reflecting is the same as

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.180
reflecting and then
rotating it.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.880
It went up at the same
point, number 3.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.190
Remember a fancy word for this
when we define what's meant by

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.640
a group, that these groups are
going to be what's called

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:49.160
Abelian, and an Abelian group
is where any combination of

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:56.090
operations a followed by b is
identical to b followed by a.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:01.190
I told you that great joke among
mathematicians, what is

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.920
purple and commutes?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.380
And the answer is an
Abelian grape.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.400
Ha, ha, ha--

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.600
I think that's stupid, but it
drives mathematicians into

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.050
guffaws of laughter.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:22.530
A second theorem, and this is
one that we've already seen in

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.720
two dimensions, is that if you
take an operation A alpha,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:34.780
pass a reflection operation
sigma 1 through it, that to

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.140
the effect of that is going to
be another mirror plane that

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.490
is alpha over 2 away
from the first.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:48.080
Notice I'm a little bit sloppy
in talking about reflection

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.590
operation and mirror plane
because if a reflection

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.700
operation is there, that's all
I need to have to say that

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.440
this is the locus of a symmetry

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.450
point, a mirror plane.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.280
So this is another one.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.080
Do you think that this an
Abelian combination to say

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.840
that A alpha followed by sigma
1 is equal to sigma 2.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.490
Is this Abelian?

00:22:17.886 --> 00:22:18.858
AUDIENCE: No.

00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:20.480
PROFESSOR: No, it's not.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.630
And how do you answer that?

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.660
Not through any means more
profound than just drawing it

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.200
out and seeing what you get.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.490
Let's take 3n as an example.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.050
So let's do the operation.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.240
In this order, do the rotation
A 2 pi over 3 to go from this

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.200
one up to this one, and then
let's reflect across this

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.460
horizontal mirror plane.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.930
So this is 1 right handed,
this is 2 right handed

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.040
reflect, here's number three
and it's left handed.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.990
So that's A 2 pi over
3 followed by

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:59.420
reflection in sigma 1.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.060
And if we do the operations in
reverse order, reflect in

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:10.410
sigma 1 to go up to here, so
this would be 2 prime and then

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.070
rotate by 120 degrees.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:20.370
We would go to here to here,
and that is not the same

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.730
location as this one.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.920
So this is not equal to sigma
1 followed by A 2 pi over 3.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:34.530
How can you tell when is the
combination of operations is

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.930
going to be Abelian and
when is it not?

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.480
It sounds rather clumsy to
state it in words, but

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.910
whenever the two symmetry
operations leave each other

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.550
unmoved, then you can
permute the order.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.330
For example, in this combination
here the rotation

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.730
leaves the mirror
plane unchanged.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.150
It just spins around
in its own plane.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.970
The mirror plane leaves the
rotation unchanged, it just

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.110
reflects it end to end.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.510
Here this rotation axis and
these mirror planes obviously

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.680
do not leave each other
unchanged because the

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.160
threefold axis rotates
the mirror plane to

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.180
two other new locations.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.100
So whenever that's the case, if
the operations do not leave

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.870
each other unchanged, the order
makes a difference.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:23.560
So that's a useful thing
to keep in mind.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.730
Let's now turn to these sheets
that I passed out, and you

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.020
might want to unstaple them
because they're designed to go

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:37.310
side by side, and there
are three pages.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:48.360
What I've done across the top
of the pages is to give the

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.880
different combinations of
crystallographic rotation axes

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.560
that are possible.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.810
So going from the first sheet
across to the last, there's

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.200
the rotation axes
by themselves--

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.940
one, two, three,
four, and six.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:07.390
Then there are the groups of
the form n22, 222, 32, 422,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:12.670
622, and then the two cubic
combinations 23 and 432.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.960
So there are the 11 possible
combination of

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.110
crystallographic rotation axes,
and stuck off by itself

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.040
at the end is the
oddball 4-bar.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:37.400
For the axes by themselves, the
diagonal mirror addition

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.530
is not defined.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.710
The diagonal mirror position
by definition snakes in

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.150
between axes that are there
in the axial combination.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.500
If there's only one axis,
that's not defined.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.250
But you could add a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.010
A horizontal mirror planes
adds a onefold axis.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.330
It's just a mirror plane.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.490
So that's called m in
the international

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.500
notation for mirror.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.650
And it's called C sub S, C
because it's a cyclic group,

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.720
and the S stands for Spiegel.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.150
That's the Schoenflies
notation.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:16.400
If we add a--

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.570
take two and add a horizontal
mirror plane--

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.530
this is the thing that we
sketched out here--

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:29.430
this gives a pattern of four
objects, two that are up above

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.740
the mirror plane of one
chirality, two down below the

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.150
mirror plane of opposite
chirality.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.850
These projections of the
patterns are down along the

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.620
rotation axis, and when you
see a dot in a circle, the

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.010
circle represents the point that
is down and the dot is

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.500
one that's up on top.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.200
So there are two pairs
of objects--

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.190
two right handed ones that are
up and two left-handed ones

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.790
that are down.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.800
And that, in international
notation, is 2/m the twofold

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.930
axis is over a mirror plane.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.840
So that's the way to make
sense of the symbol and

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.500
remember what it means.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.580
In the Schoenflies
notation at C2.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.220
You've added a horizontal mirror
plane as an extender.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.970
Going down the remaining ones
in that list because they're

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.420
all very, very similar--

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.990
add a mirror plane to a
threefold axis, the triangle

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:33.410
is reflected down to a triangle
of motifs of opposite

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.310
chirality, so that's 3 over m.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.552
For sure, it's called 6-bar, but
let's forget about that.

00:27:40.552 --> 00:27:45.280
The Schoenflies notation C3H,
and similarly there's a 4 over

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.970
m, a square above, and a square
of opposite handedness

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.770
below the mirror plane.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:56.700
The horizontal mirror plane in
all of these cases is shown as

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.490
a bold line.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.060
They've added fainter vertical
lines to give

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.040
you an angular reference.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.560
Don't be confused by that
in the Xerox copy--

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.290
the weight of the lines
is not distinguished.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:13.460
So the only symmetry element
in 4 over m, for example,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.670
should be shown by this solid
bold circle that is in the

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.920
plane of the paper.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.250
The two crossed lines are
lighter and those are just as

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.180
mutual orientations.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.430
And finally, there's another
one of this form

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.485
which is 6 over m.

00:28:31.485 --> 00:28:34.640
On all of the evenfold
additions-- that is, to say

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.320
everything but 3m--

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.040
if you add that horizontal
mirror plane, it's going to be

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.910
perpendicular to an
operation A pi.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.870
Therefore, inversion pops up
as one of the operations in

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:54.340
the group, and 2 over m, 4
over m, 6 over m, those

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.550
regular polyhedra of objects--

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.380
can be inverted through the
point of intersection of the

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.340
axis in the mirror plane, and
that leaves the set unchanged.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.770
So if we go down to the bottom
of the list and say, can we

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:13.320
add inversion to these axial
arrangements, in the case of

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.120
2, 4, and 6--

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.550
no, adding inversion doesn't
give you anything new, because

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:30.490
that's already there in the
groups of the form CNH, or

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.760
2/m, 4/m, 6/m.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.410
Diagonal is not defined, so the
only additional one that

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.300
we could pick up by adding
inversion is adding inversion

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.930
to a threefold axis,
and that's one we

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.700
did the other day.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.010
Adding inversion to a threefold
axis gives us three

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.480
that are up of one handedness,
three that are down of

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.690
opposite handedness, and
the orientation of

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.220
the triangle is skewed.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.460
That is called 3-bar.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.270
But it's just nothing more than
a threefold axis with an

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.300
inversion center
sitting on it.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.815
Schoenflies' notation is C3i.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.750
Then the only other additions to
the single axes are adding

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.360
the mirror plane in a vertical
fashion passing through the

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.720
axis, and these we've already
seen in two dimensions so we

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.870
don't have to spend
much time on them.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.910
There's 2 mm, which is C2V.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.210
3m--

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:32.280
all the mirror planes result
upon adding a single mirror

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.960
plane to the threefold axis--

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.330
4 mm, and 6 mm.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.650
These are just three-dimensional
extensions

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.700
parallel to the axis of the
symmetry that we already

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.110
derived for a plane
in space in the

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:50.290
two-dimensional point groups.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:51.650
So we're almost half done.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:52.850
It's easy, isn't it?

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.100
Any questions at this point?

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.000
So the only ones that are really
new that we haven't

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.600
seen already in two dimensions
are the rotation axis

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.170
perpendicular to the
mirrored plane.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.060
That brings us to roughly the
middle of the second sheet,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:22.180
and the arrangement of axes 222
represents three mutually

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.020
orthogonal twofold axes.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:33.050
If we add a horizontal mirror
plane, that's going to put an

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.070
inversion center at the point
of intersection because that

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.220
horizontal reflection is going
to be sitting normal to a

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.620
twofold axis.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.845
And then since the other twofold
axes see an inversion

00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:48.250
center sitting on it, there's
a mirror plane perpendicular

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.600
to those other twofold axes.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.020
So adding again to go through
that again, adding inversion

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.170
to the point of intersection of
the twofold axes creates a

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.820
mirror plane perpendicular to
each of those twofold axes.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.900
So it becomes 2/m 2/m 2/m--

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.910
each of the twofold axes
acquires a different sort of

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.740
mirror plane perpendicular
to its orientation.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.310
And 2/m 2/m 2/m, even though
I love saying it,

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:18.960
is kind of a mouthful.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.470
So that's very often abbreviated
to just mmm, which

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.430
really is a nice exclamation
when you see what a lovely

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:29.510
symmetry it is.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:35.620
The pattern shown in the diagram
to the left is just

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.060
the pattern of 222 with the
objects reflected up or

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:43.700
reflected down, and you
get a total of 8.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.240
That means that there are eight
operations in the group,

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.380
and you can add up quickly
what they are.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.250
They are the three operations
of rotating by pi, the

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:59.300
operation of identity, then
three mirror planes because

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.150
the mirror planes all
indistinct, and then the

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:02.240
operation of inversion.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.390
So there are the eight
operations that are present

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.300
that generate the objects
from a single one.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:20.590
Add a horizontal mirror plane to
32 and you get a threefold

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.330
axis perpendicular to the
threefold axis, so you write

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.200
that as 3m.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.520
That mirror plane now passes
through the horizontal twofold

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.470
axes, and a twofold axis with a
mirror plane passing through

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.330
it wants another mirror plane
90 degrees away, so a new

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.060
mirror plane pops up passing
through each of the twofold

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:46.150
axes and perpendicular to the
horizontal mirror plane.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.150
Those mirror planes are
in the same direction

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.300
as the twofold axis.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.610
They're not perpendicular to it,
and when symmetry elements

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.400
are parallel to a common
direction you write them out

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.670
on the same line, so here's a
case of a mixed metaphor.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.350
One mirror plane that's
perpendicular to an axis, the

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.460
threefold axis, so you write
that as 3 over m.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.320
The other twofold axes have
mirror points passing through

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:14.699
them, so you write that as 2m
and the threefold axes makes

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:20.380
all of those 2m symmetries
equivalent to one another.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.489
Pattern, and this is true for
all of these symmetries, is

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:29.790
nothing more than the pattern
of the subgroup repeated by

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:33.520
the one operation that you've
added as an extender .

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:37.949
So if you look at the pattern of
32, object all of the same

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.710
chirality, all apparently
up and down, and add the

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.139
horizontal mirror plane.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:45.330
The one that is up goes down,
the one that's down goes up,

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:47.550
and you get a set of
four around each

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.800
of the twofold axes.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.989
422 behaves very similarly.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.500
The pattern is just the pattern
of 422 reflected in a

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:08.040
plane, so you have a
set of 16 objects--

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.910
eight of them up of one
chirality, those are the solid

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:15.250
dots, if you will, and then
another two, four, six, eight

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.460
that are down of opposite
chirality.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.190
You have a mirror plane that
you added as the horizontal

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.070
mirror plane perpendicular
to the fourfold axis.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.880
All of the horizontal twofold
axes see a mirror plane

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.700
passing through them.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.300
So they've got to have a mirror
plane that's 90 degrees

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.510
away, and those are the vertical
mirror planes.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.640
Either the point is obvious now
or you're not following me

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.770
at all, so I'll simply say on
the left-hand column of the

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:46.000
final sheet, 622 with a
horizontal mirror plane goes

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.050
to 6/m, 2/m, 2/m, called
D6h in Schoenflies.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.700
I'll leave the cubic
ones until last.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.250
They're not nearly as
bad as they seem.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.760
But obviously they have a lot
of symmetry all over the

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.285
place, and we'll want to take a
closer look at the patterns.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:21.970
The next extender is a vertical
mirror plane, and

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:27.410
we've already got the groups of
the form cnv, because they

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.860
are just extensions in a third
dimension of one set we've

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.705
seen in two dimensions.

00:36:33.705 --> 00:36:39.610
If we try adding the vertical
mirror plane, which is defined

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:42.560
as passing through the principal
axis of high

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.740
symmetry and perpendicular to
the twofold axes, we've

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:54.990
already encountered those in
every group except 32.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:37:00.300
2/m, 2/m, 2/m already has the
vertical mirror plane.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:05.570
The same is true of 3/mm2.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:10.940
The same is true of 4/m, 2/m,
2/m and 6/m, 2/m, 2/m.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.600
The vertical mirror plane comes
in automatically when we

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.550
add the horizontal mirror plane
as the extender, So

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.270
nothing new there at all.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.780
And now we come to one
that is interesting.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.210
This is the diagonal
mirror plane.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:33.660
And I'll do this one slowly
and then in some detail

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.090
because it's another example
of how we would trip over

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.600
something if we were not clever
enough to think of it.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:56.280
Let me begin by drawing the
three orthogonal axes of 222.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.660
So we have one object that's up
and one object that's down.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.550
The twofold axis perpendicular
to the board will take this

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.300
one that's down and rotate it
to here and take this one

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.630
that's up and rotate
it to here.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:15.770
So that is the pattern of 222.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:25.360
We can snake a mirror plane in
between the twofold axes, and

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.090
a mirror plane passing through
the vertical twofold axis has

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.130
to be accompanied by one that's
90 degrees away, half

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:37.000
the throw of the axis, which
comes from our theorem that

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.580
says A pi dot sigma vertical
has to be equal to a sigma

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.070
prime that's vertical and pi/2
away from the first.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:52.470
In terms of the pattern, this
second mirror plane that comes

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.500
up is going to reflect this one
across to here, it's going

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.680
to reflect this one across to
here, it's going to take this

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.730
one and reflect it over to here,
and take this one and

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.200
reflect it to the
right, as well.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:11.590
So now we've got a total
of eight objects.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:16.520
This one is right handed, and
this one is also right handed

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.660
because we repeated
it by rotation.

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.650
Then we reflected that pair, so
these two are left handed,

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.500
and reflect it across the other
diagonal mirror plane.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.340
They're back to right handed
again, and these have to be

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.370
left handed as well, so
there's the pattern.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.990
Is there an inversion center
in this pattern?

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.870
The answer is no, because there
is no mirror plane that

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:50.060
is perpendicular to a twofold
axis, so this point group has

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.560
no inversion in it.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:56.500
It's said to be acentric,
without a inversion center.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.040
Do we know how everything is
related to everything else?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.300
We know how this one
is related to this

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.460
one by twofold rotation.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:06.260
We know how this one is related
to this one, and

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.740
that's by reflection across
the mirror plane.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.340
How is the first one related
to this one?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.510
How do you get it through 90
degrees and then pop it down

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.306
and change the chirality?

00:40:25.306 --> 00:40:26.614
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:26.614 --> 00:40:29.580
PROFESSOR: You can't do
that in one step.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.720
You've got to do just what
I said in words.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.020
Rotate it 90 degrees, don't put
it down yet, and reflect

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.430
it down in a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.170
This horizontal mirror plane
is not a symmetry element,

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.270
it's part of the operation
that's necessary to get us

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:48.050
from this guy over to this guy
of opposite chirality.

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.330
So this is an example
a new type of

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:53.970
operation, a 2 step operation.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.480
This is a 90-degree
rotoreflection axis.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.940
And again, I feel compelled to
put the axis in quotation

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:10.090
marks, because really it's a
pair of operations that leaves

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.390
only a point unmoved,
so it's really a

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.640
point symmetry element.

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.020
There's another way of
describing the same thing, and

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.220
that would be rotoinversion.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:37.720
We could rotate by 90 degrees in
the reverse sense, not yet

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:45.800
put it down, and invert,
and we get, again,

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.940
the relation between--

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.460
what did I do?

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.940
Rotate it here, yes--

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:55.375
rotate to here and then invert,
and we got that one.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:02.240
So that's another way of
defining the relation.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.650
A 90-degree rotoreflection
is a minus 90-degree

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.900
rotoinversion.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:21.260
So you pays your money and you
takes your choice, and what

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:26.080
the groundbreakers who went
before us did was to take

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.390
rotoinversion.

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:31.030
as the operation to survive.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.270
So here is, if we were not smart
enough to invent it, our

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.530
4-bar rotoinversion axis.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.100
So if we hadn't been clever
enough-- and it would take a

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.290
pretty clever, devious mind to
invent a 2 step rotoinversion

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.060
operation--

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.680
as soon as we added this sort of
extender, a diagonal mirror

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.540
plane to a group of the form
n22, we would have found that

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.600
there was a new sort of
transformation that could not

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.190
be described any more simply
than to say take

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.730
two steps to do it.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:14.750
Rotate 90 degrees
and then invert.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:20.960
So we have to add the operation
of A pi over 2-bar

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.675
to our basic bag of tricks
for generating patterns.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:43.790
The group 32 is also a group to
which we can add a diagonal

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:45.810
mirror plane.

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:51.390
And if you do that, again, the
bold lines that are mirror

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:56.760
planes in that group and the
axes that are faint lines are

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.560
easy to mix up.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:15.700
But if we examine that group
without the confusing lines,

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:18.342
here are the twofold axes.

00:44:18.342 --> 00:44:22.780
And remember that they are all
equivalent to one another by

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:23.900
the threefold axis.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.700
So this axial group
is the group 32.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.330
If we put down a mirror plane
interleaved between the

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:36.170
twofold axes, notice that
each of those mirror is

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.960
perpendicular to
a twofold axis.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.040
So we can write this as 2/m.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.700
2/m means there's an inversion
center at the intersection of

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.430
the twofold axes with
the mirror planes.

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:54.260
And a inversion center sitting
on a threefold axis makes it a

00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:00.100
3-bar axis, so this group
is called 3-bar 2/m.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:05.600
And the pattern is what a
twofold axis would do.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.990
These would be up-down-right
ones.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:13.490
Reflect those and you get an
up-down pair of left ones.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.870
Reflect again and you get
an up-down pair of

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:18.330
right-handed ones.

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:24.720
Reflect yet again, and you
get an up-down pair

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.590
of left-handed ones.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:32.150
Reflect still once more, and
you get a down-up pair of

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:33.160
right-handed ones.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:38.030
One more time, up-down
left-handed ones.

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:43.410
So you get a total of 2,
4, 6, 8, 10, 12 points.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:49.010
So this is 3-bar 2/m in
Schoenflies notation D3--

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.150
that's the symbol 32--

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.140
with a diagonal mirror
plane added.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.475
You indicate that by a
d in the subscript.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.400
OK.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.110
I think that's probably a point
where you're more than

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:13.650
ready for a break.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.705
We've got very few yet to do.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.450
One surprise is that if you add
diagonal mirror planes to

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:27.530
422 and 622, you get perfectly
lovely exquisite groups but

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:30.030
they're not crystallographic,
so we don't

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.530
include them in our list.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.330
But we'll discuss them when we
come back, and then take a

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:38.970
look also at the cubic
symmetries.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.270
Impossible to draw, but really
not all that difficult to

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.800
understand.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.760
So let's stop at this point
and take a stretch.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.080
People are stretching already.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.330
They need it.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.360
We'll resume in 10
minutes' time.
