00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920
PROFESSOR: Everyone
seems to be here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.610
At least all the seats
are filled up, so

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.860
why don't we begin.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.090
One thing that I did finally,
to be specific, I told you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.250
that we would have three quizzes
and that they would be

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.240
uniformly spaced one third, and
2/3 and 2.89 thirds of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.910
way through the term.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.520
And I figured out where
those dates would be.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.140
So since I have them, let
me give you the date.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:50.090
So Quiz 1 is going to be
on Thursday, October 6.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:01:04.860
Quiz 2 will be on Tuesday,
November 8, and Quiz 3 will be

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.372
on Thursday, December 8.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.380
And this, as advertised, is
exactly one third of the way

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.650
through the lectures.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.050
This is exactly 2/3 of the way
through the lectures, and this

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.660
is the next to the last meeting
that we'll have.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.370
This is the week before the
final week of the terms. so I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.330
deliberately kept it a little
bit away from the usual

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.430
end-of-term crunch.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.780
Being person who is sensitive to
symmetry and order, I find

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.220
it highly regrettable that
we cannot have the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.000
quiz on October 8.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.920
Then you would on the 8th of
October, November, December,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.650
you have a quiz.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.190
Unfortunately, October 8, much
as that would beautify the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.780
schedule, is on a Saturday,
so we can't do it so.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.660
I could do it, but I don't
think anybody would come.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.480
I've been, believe it or not,
going through these problem

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.960
sets in great detail.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.860
I didn't want to hand them out
until I had the list--

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.260
and you may or may not know--
that is made up for the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.410
registrants in each class, And
we get a nice array of

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.210
photographs with names and
department numbers and years

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.160
numbers under them.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.250
That something, by the way, that
only the instructor in a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.170
class requests, not even the
secretary can do it.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.500
So this is not widely
broadcast.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.090
I found to my dismay though
when I finally got it that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.650
about one third of the
pictures are missing.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.480
And I don't know whether you
folks have been photographed

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.580
fairly late on the term,
but a third of the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.520
pictures are missing.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.410
I already been putting some
faces in my memory banks, but

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.290
to match up names and faces
so that I can hand out the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.170
problem sets individually,
I need more photographs.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.470
So I'll do it one way or another
next time, and we'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710
see some photographs, additional
photographs, have

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.160
appeared in the interim.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.060
I've given you three problem
sets so far, and they were

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.120
really just for fun as well as
to get you thinking about the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.193
right sorts of things, but
there were little puzzle.

00:03:25.193 --> 00:03:28.870
I'm, unfortunately, going to
have to tell you from now on

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930
no more cutesy little puzzles.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.050
You're going to get
real problem sets,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.100
long, tedious, drudgery.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.250
They're optional though, so
that's the saving grace.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.410
So I'm going to pass it around
the problem set 4.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.340
And this asks you to demonstrate
some of the things

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.250
that we talked about last time
and convince yourself that

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.020
they really work and ask
you to make some simple

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.550
applications of Miller-Bravais
indices to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.910
two-dimensional lattices.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.220
And then finally, the last
problem is to get you thinking

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.330
about patterns.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.630
And I've asked you to identify
the lattice points and the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.245
symmetry elements
in two patterns.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.515
I'm almost willing to wager that
not one of you will get

00:04:16.515 --> 00:04:20.490
it completely right, that
there's going to be some

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.190
little thing that you
missed or did wrong.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.480
At one time, I bet a bag of
potato chips for everybody in

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.290
the class against the class
wagering against me one bag of

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.890
potato chips.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.060
Well, I'm going to watch my
weight, and I've won that

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.730
invariably, and I really can't
eat that greasy sort of stuff.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.620
In any case, you'll see that
in the case of symmetry and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.050
patterns it is immensely
simplified when you know

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.100
exactly what to look for, when
you know the number of

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.120
possibilities was finite,.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.110
And when we're through with
this, you can ask just one

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.450
question about a pattern and
then know exactly what the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.120
symmetry of that pattern has
to be and exactly where to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.750
look for everything else.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.250
I can guarantee you that by the
time you finish this class

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.700
you will never sit in a bathroom
and stare at the tile

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.700
floor and see it in exactly
the same way again.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.190
I think that's a good
observation because I like to

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.270
think that that's what education
is all about, not

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.390
sitting in the bathroom, but
seeing things differently

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.920
after you've had the experience

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.850
than you did before.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.690
That's what education
is all about.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.580
So have fun with the patterns.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.260
And again, it will become--

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.510
one seat up here.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.300
Today then we're about ready
to embark on an adventure.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.330
As I said last time, we'll
develop two-dimensional

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.470
symmetries first because there
are relatively few of them,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.205
and one could do
this rigorously

00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:08.510
and in great detail.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.420
We're going to have to touch on
things more lightly when we

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.860
get to three-dimensional
symmetries so we can finish at

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.270
a decent point in the term.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:27.680
Let me remind you that we have
so far identified two types of

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.030
symmetry that can exist in a
lattice, onefold, twofold,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.550
threefold, or sixfold
rotation axes.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.730
Any number of different
rotational symmetries are

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.640
possible, but if you're going to
want them to be compatible

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.200
with a lattice, you must
restrict the rotation axis to

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.710
one of these five, including
a onefold axis, which is no

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.320
symmetry it all.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.150
And in two-dimensions, besides
translation, we saw the

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.210
operation of reflection.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.370
And now we're going to begin
to put things together and

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.470
make elaborate combinations.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.530
The first thing I will ask is
can we have more than one of

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.470
these symmetry elements present
and operating about

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.084
the same locus at
the same time.

00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:19.600
The answer to that would
be, why not.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.310
Because if we look at a sixfold
rotation axis, that's

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:31.100
really what a twofold rotation
axis does combined with what a

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.080
threefold rotation axis does.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.680
And we plot these on top of one
another, and what we end

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.120
up with is the arrangement of
motifs that is generated by

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.330
sixfold axis.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:55.160
So in a sense, a sixfold axis is
a twofold axis superimposed

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.410
on a threefold axis.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.460
That kind of a naive way about
thinking of this though.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.510
What we're really saying is that
what a sixfold axis has

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:18.690
is the set of operations 1 A
2 pi/ 6, A twice 2 pi /6 --

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.190
that would be 120 degree
rotation--

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:29.840
and A pi, A 5 pi/6.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.350
And there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.624
And we're missing one.

00:08:33.624 --> 00:08:38.470
60, 120, 240.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:50.680
So that would be A twice
2 pi/3, 4 pi/6

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.350
So what we're really saying is
a sixfold axis consists of

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:59.760
these six elements, and these
elements constitute a group

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:06.010
because I can combine any two
of these rotation operations

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.440
and find something that's
already a member of the set.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.350
By saying that a sixfold axis
consists of a threefold axis

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.400
sitting on top of a twofold
axis, what we're saying is

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.630
that there's one collection
of elements here, namely

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:27.430
identity, or same thing as A 2
pi and A pi, that is a subset

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.705
of these, or we could
say a subgroup.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.930
So what we're doing in saying
that these two sets of

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.040
rotation operations exist
simultaneously, we're saying

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.470
that the twofold axis is a
subgroup of the sixfold axis.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.160
And similarly, we can separate
out three other elements, a

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:59.470
onefold axis, same as A 2 pi;
a 120-degree rotation, A 2

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:08.360
pi/3; and a 240-degree
rotation, A 4 pi/3.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.770
And these three operations,
a group of rank 2, is what

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:20.530
constitutes another subgroup, a
subset of elements which by

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:26.980
themselves satisfy all of the
requirements of a group.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.360
So this is one example of how
we can have more than one

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.730
symmetry element, a set of
operations existing about the

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.550
same locus and space.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:44.640
This is not how one would go
about the deriving these

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.110
higher symmetry however.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.090
Because what we have to do is
to add something to the set,

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.680
something that's called an
extender, and then show that

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.150
all the requirements of a set
being a group is satisfied;

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.190
namely, that a combination of
any two elements in the group

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.030
is also a member the group, that
for every operation an

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.840
inverse exists, and the identity
operation is a member

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.570
of the group.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.670
So you can build up more
higher symmetries, more

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.270
complex symmetries by adding
some operation called an

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.680
extender and then taking all
of the products of these

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.120
elements and see what new
operations arise.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.840
So we can have more than one
symmetry element operating

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.080
about the same locus and the set
of individual operations

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.480
that it embodies.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.970
And here sitting all by itself
is a mirror plane.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:50.210
Why don't we combine a mirror
plane with the rotation axis?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.210
And we've already seen
examples of that.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:57.350
For example, in the square
pattern that these tiles make

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.220
up, there's a fourfold axis in
the middle of each of the

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.440
squares that are also mirror
planes that pass

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.200
through that location.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.570
So let me look at a combination
that is a little

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.410
simpler to handle.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.860
And what I'm going to say is
here sits a mirror plane with

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.300
a reflection operation that
I'll call sigma 1 for the

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.640
individual operation.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.790
And let me say that I combine
now in that space a second

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.390
reflection operation
about a line that

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.780
intersects the first one.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.610
And the question I'm going to
ask now is happens when I take

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:41.240
a first motif, number 1,
reflected in the locus of the

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.180
first mirror plane to get number
2, and then reflect

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.455
that a second time in the locus
of the second mirror

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:52.100
plane to get one that
sits up here.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.360
So the question is now what is
the operation sigma 1 followed

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.530
by the operation sigma
2 equals to?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.750
We can almost answer by the
process of elimination.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.650
If this one is left handed,
reflection changes the

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.080
polarity, so number
2 is right hand.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.970
And if we reflect a second time,
the right-handed one

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.510
goes to a left-handed one.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.770
So what we're asking is how do
I get from one left-handed

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.210
motif to another left-handed
motif?

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.850
Of the three operations that
exist in a two-dimensional

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.640
space could be translation.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.860
But, clearly, I can't take the
first one and slide it

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.240
parallel to itself and make it
coincide with the third.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.490
So translation would not change
chirality, but that

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.090
won't work.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.070
What's left?

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:53.370
Rotation.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.310
Yes.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.110
You want to clarify
something first?

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.745
AUDIENCE: That third one, it
looks kind of left-handed.

00:13:58.745 --> 00:13:59.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.390
PROFESSOR: Oops.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:13:59.810
It does.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.050
It does indeed.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.050
Sorry about that.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.350
When you've got your nose poked
right in these things,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.340
it's easy to overlook it.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.650
Yes.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.570
Absolutely right.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.390
That should be over canted over
a bit more like I had it

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.010
the first way.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.190
Very good thank you.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.270
I don't want to proceed much.

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:12.580
Yes?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.710
AUDIENCE: What did
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.120
axis [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.220
PROFESSOR: We could do that.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.970
And let's do it, and we're
going to encounter

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.050
this sooner or later.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:30.240
So we have a first mirror plane
reflect from a first

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.050
one, which is right handed, to
second one that's left handed.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.710
And then define a second locus,
and that one would take

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:43.020
the second one and move it
over to here, the same

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.970
distance on the other side
of this mirror plane.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:51.430
And I'll let you answer the
question since you asked it.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.720
How is the first one related
to the third one?

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.480
AUDIENCE: Translation.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.890
PROFESSOR: Translation.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:55.790
Yes.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.525
AUDIENCE: It's translated.

00:14:56.525 --> 00:15:03.010
PROFESSOR: Exactly So if this
distance is delta, the first

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.155
and the third are related
be a translation

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.800
which is twice delta.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.020
So that would be in addition
where we'll eventually want to

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.200
consider when we have patterns
that are based on a lattice.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.160
But right now, I want to
consider symmetry operations

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.940
that leave at least a point in
space and move perhaps a line

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.730
in the case of the
mirror plane.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.130
But back to the original
question, what is this first

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.020
reflection followed by
a second reflection?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.610
We've just thrown
out translation.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.970
That won't work unless the
mirror planes are parallel to

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:37.460
one of those.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.220
The only thing left
is rotation.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.380
And in point of fact, even
looking at this diagram, you

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:50.010
can get from the first one to
the third one by a rotation.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.930
So the answer to the question
is that a combination of two

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:59.200
reflection operations is a
rotation operation about the

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.740
point of intersection of
the mirror planes.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.940
But we can go further and say
exactly how large this

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.440
rotation is.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.580
Let's draw an extra
line in here.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.610
And let's say that this
angle is alpha.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.790
And if I repeat this
by reflection, that

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.410
angle is also alpha.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.860
Let's label this angle beta.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.630
Repeat that by reflection, and
that angle must also be beta.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:31.360
The angle between the two mirror
planes is the angle mu.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.860
And clearly mu is equal
to alpha plus beta.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.130
So the answer to the question
quite generally is have two

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.410
mirror planes intersect at an
angle mu, and their successive

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.200
operation is going to be
equivalent to the net result

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.050
of rotating through
twice of the angle

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.580
between them mirror line.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.600
So we don't have to think
about that anymore now.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.250
We know if we combine
to mirror planes

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.500
we get a net rotation.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:09.420
So that is a basic result, and
that's a first example of

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.160
something that I'm going to
call by my own pet term.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.859
I'm going to call them
combination theorem, the

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.190
theorem that tells you what you
get when you combine two

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.380
operations.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.079
And what this is going to give
us is a way of filling in one

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:25.160
box in the group multiplication
table.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:35.860
So knowing what two mirror
planes combined at an angle

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:42.500
should be, I can now combine
the mirror planes at angles

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.660
which gives me a rotation
operation which is one of the

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.010
ones that's allowed
for a lattice.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.500
In general, if I'm not yet
putting these symmetry

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.850
elements in a lattice, I could
combine them in such a way

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.940
such that I got a 17-fold
rotation as the angle.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.540
And then the angle between
the mirror planes would

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.810
be half of 2 pi/17.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.170
Could be a lovely symmetry, nice
for a pendant or a ring,

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.820
but not for a lattice and
not for a crystal.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.130
So I'm going to want to combine
mirror planes at

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:19.040
angles that correspond to
rotations that are compatible

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.100
with the lattice.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.660
So what I could do is take
a first reflection

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.695
locus, sigma 1.

00:18:26.695 --> 00:18:32.280
And if I want the rotation angle
to be 180 degrees for a

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.550
twofold axis, I would want the
second mirror plane with the

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:45.100
operation sigma 2 to be
at one half of pi with

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.230
respect to the first.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:52.190
And for this specific
combination then, reflection

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:59.130
in the first mirror planes
followed by reflection in the

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.480
second mirror planes to give me
a third one, is going to be

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.500
equivalent to--

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.160
Oops.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.390
Back here--

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.065
it's going to be equivalent
to a twofold axis.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:22.460
So sigma 1 followed by sigma 2
at an angle one half of pi is

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.010
going to be equivalent to the
rotation operation A pi.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.990
This is not yet a complete
pattern because here's a

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.395
mirror planes that wants to
reflect this motifs as well.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:55.500
So let's just reflect number 3
across the mirror planes 1.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.390
And then we're going to
get a fourth object.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.880
Now let's show that this
constitutes a group.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.100
We've got the identity operation
doing nothing.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.490
We've got the operation
sigma 1.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.730
We've got the operation
sigma 2, and we've got

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.820
the operation a pi.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:23.380
I'll put the same operations
again in the vertical column.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.310
Here's operation 1 doing
nothing, sigma 1,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.360
sigma 2, and A pi.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.090
So doing nothing and following
it by one of these four

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.600
operations just gives you the
same thing back again.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.790
And doing these operations
followed by 1 will give me the

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.535
same operation back again.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.940
If I reflect twice across sigma
1 from left to right and

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.690
right to left, I'm back to
where I started from.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:03.250
So sigma 1 followed by sigma 1
is the identity operation.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.150
Sigma 1 followed by sigma
2 is what we just did.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.520
That turns out to be
the operation A pi.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.800
And sigma 1 reflection and
following that by A pi is the

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.890
way in which I get to
the fourth one.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:25.210
So that is going to be
equal to sigma 2.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.320
Well, let me rips through the
last ones fairly quickly.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.060
Sigma 2 followed by signal 1.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.720
Sigma 2 followed by sigma
1 is the same as A pi.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.590
Sigma 2 followed by sigma 2
gets us back to where we

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:41.220
started from.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.400
That's the identity operation.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.290
Sigma 2 followed by A pi reflect
from here to here and

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.290
then rotate.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:53.150
That's the same as sigma 1.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.090
And the final sequence,
rotation followed by

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.930
reflection would give
me sigma 2.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.430
Rotation followed by sigma
2 will give me sigma 1.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.120
And doing the rotation operation
twice is the same as

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.890
the identity operation.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.823
So are the group postulates
satisfied?

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.270
Yes.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:25.190
The combination of any
two elements is a

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.440
member of the group.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.813
For every operation,
an inverse exists.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.670
And we can answer that question
very easily by merely

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.950
looking at the column under
a particular element, and

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.700
somewhere we find the
identity operation.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.090
So sigma 1 is its own inverse.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.690
So, yes, an inverse exists
for every operation.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.715
And then finally, identity
is a member of the group.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.430
So everything's lights up.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.260
Bells ring.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.940
This set of four elements
is entitled to

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.680
call itself a group.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.490
And in particular, it is a group
of rank 4 because there

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.370
are four elements
in the group.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.900
I show you a cool thing.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.560
I noticed that the number of
objects in the pattern, the

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.550
number of motifs in the pattern,
is exactly the same

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.480
as the order of the group.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.520
Why?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.390
Because these four operations
tell you how to get from any

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:01.500
operation to the remaining three
and tell you how to get

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.260
it into itself.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.290
So identity relates
it to itself.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.080
Sigma 1 reflects it to here.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.190
A pi rotates it down to here.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.740
Sigma 2 reflects it
down to here.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.300
So there's always a one-to-one
correspondence between the

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.770
elements that are in the group
and the rank of a group and

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.050
the number of objects that
are in the pattern.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:21.380
Yes, sir?

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.970
AUDIENCE: How do you show if
the inverse exists again?

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:29.660
PROFESSOR: The inverse exists
if I can find something that

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.170
combined with an element in
my basic set gives me the

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.192
identity operation.

00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:39.860
So it's the operation followed
by its inverse has to be the

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.630
same as doing nothing.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.530
So if I look under each element
and find the identity

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.655
operation, then sigma 2
is its own inverse.

00:24:48.655 --> 00:24:52.680
If I look under A pi, A
pi is its own inverse.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.970
This is generally
not the case.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.535
This is a very simple
symmetry.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.250
So really we can work with
commas and little figures, and

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.970
that's one way of getting
these symmetries.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.050
But group theory I think you can
see is a very nice, very

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.840
elegant language for
describing some

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.135
characteristics of
these patterns.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.890
Now little bit of jargon.

00:25:23.485 --> 00:25:27.370
As if this material were not
confusing enough, there are

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.780
two different languages that
are used to denote these

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.560
unique combinations.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.530
This notation where we simply
have a number for a rotation

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:45.310
axis or an m for mirror plane
is something that was first

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.290
proposed by two

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:52.170
mathematicians, Hermann and Mauguin.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:03.360
And this was adopted as the
preferred notation in the

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.660
international tables, that hefty
tome that I brought it

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.715
on the first day of classes.

00:26:08.715 --> 00:26:12.410
So this is also referred
to synonymously as the

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.660
international notation.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.370
Let me put these things
out horizontally.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.930
For rotation axes by themselves,
the symbol in

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.280
Hermann notation is simply n.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.710
And for lattice, n--

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.030
as we've seen many times--

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:45.090
is restricted to what in
Hermann-Mauguin notation would

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.475
be either 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:57.670
There's another type of notation
that is use quite

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:03.630
frequently by condensed matter
physicist, and this is called

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:12.380
the Schoenflies notation after
one of the mathematicians who

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:20.660
was the first to derive the
three-dimensional symmetries.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.130
This was a curious thing.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.530
There were three people in
different parts of the world

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.830
about the turn of the century--
and this was before

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:30.170
email or even air mail--

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.520
who were trying to derive the
three-dimensional symmetries.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.450
Schoenflies was one of them.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:40.430
And all three of them got to
the same place at about the

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:45.220
same time, and the results
were obtained.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.090
But each one used his
own method and had

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:48.350
his different notation.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.470
Schoenflies was one of the
people who did this.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:58.190
Schoenflies was a mathematician
and based his

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.990
notation on group theory.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.190
Something called a cyclic
group is what

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.610
the C stands for.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:16.170
And a cyclic group is one in
which all elements are power,

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:29.660
so to speak, of some
basic operation.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.390
For example, a fourfold axis
consists of the set of

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:50.010
operations A pi/2; a 90 degree
rotation; A pi, which can be

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:55.160
written as A pi over 2 squared;
A pi over 2 squared;

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.750
[? then we need ?]

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:04.470
A pi/2; and A pi/ 2 again; A 3
pi/2, which can be viewed as

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.660
doing A pi/2 three times; and
finally, the identity

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.450
operation, which is the same as
A 2 pi, which is equivalent

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:18.160
to doing the basic operation
A pi/2 four times.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.830
So the group of rank 4, there
are four elements in the

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.790
group, each one is a power of
the basic operation A pi/2.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:30.840
So a rotation axis by itself
as a cyclic group.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.740
Schoenflies indicates these
generically by C subscript n,

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:36.890
where n is the rank
of the axis.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.870
Hence, this is C1.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.540
This is C2.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.230
This is C3.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.400
This is C4.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.650
And this is C6.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.670
A mirror plane by itself
is indicated m in the

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:02.300
international notation.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.810
A mirror plane is also
a cyclic group.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:08.240
There are two operations,
reflection and reflection back

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.290
to where you came from.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.730
Doing the reflection operation
twice is the

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.160
same as doing nothing.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.990
So Schoenflies also call this
one C. And the one thing that

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:27.520
is without meaning in English
is his subscript S. And

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.880
Schoenflies was German, and
the S stands for spiegel,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.020
which is the German
word for mirror.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.170
We have in many cities
a paper that's

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.770
called the Daily Mirror.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.252
In Germany, there's a paper
called Der Spiegel.

00:30:44.252 --> 00:30:46.950
So they use it the same
way in everyday life

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.620
as well as in notation.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.840
So C sub S in the Schoenflies
notation is a mirror plane.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.340
Cyclic group the S stand
for spiegel.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:07.990
For the combinations of which we
have seen only one, in the

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:12.560
Schoenflies notation these are
all of the form Cnv, a

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.180
rotation axis Cn with a vertical
mirror plane passing

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:16.940
through it.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.310
So this one, for example--
we've yet

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.000
to look at the others--

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.620
would be C2v.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.170
So we'll have to draw the first,
and then I'll give you

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.630
the complete set.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.410
So this is a rotation axis with
a mirror plane passing

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.170
vertically through it.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.450
Let's do a few more.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.210
And I think having done a couple
in great detail, we'll

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:46.040
see what the others will look
like quite readily.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:51.630
Let's take a fourfold axis and
add to the rotation operations

00:31:51.630 --> 00:32:00.870
A pi/2, a first mirror plane
that I'll label sigma 1.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.630
I can permute the order of
operations and say that sigma

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.430
1 followed by the rotation
operation A pi/2 is going to

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.120
be equal to a second reflection
operation that is

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:20.830
equal to one half of pi/2
away from the first.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:26.590
So I'm claiming that if I
reflect in the first mirror

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.610
plane and then rotate by 90
degrees that should be another

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:35.010
mirror plane at 45 degrees
to the first.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.110
So let me do exactly
what I advertised.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.150
Here's the first, one
right handed.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.640
Reflect across to get a second
one, which is left handed.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:50.820
Reflect, then rotate, and that
would bring my left-handed one

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.610
up to this location here.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.860
So here's 3, and it's
left handed.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.700
And lo and behold, just as
advertised, I get from the

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.720
first one to the third one by
reflecting across a mirror

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:05.020
plane, which is one
half of pi/2.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.890
If let these symmetry elements
operate on each other, what

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.990
I'll end up with is a
set of mirror planes

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.090
at 45 degree intervals.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:25.960
And what I'll have is a pair
of objects hung in the same

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.625
fashion at every mirror plane.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.550
Is that too fast?

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:36.870
You want to go through
that a little slower?

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.160
Oh, go ahead say, go through
it more slowly.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.810
Everybody's afraid to say, yeah,
yeah, and been seem like

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.620
a class dummy.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.870
Do you want me to do
it more slowly?

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.430
I see people still writing, so I
think what you'd rather have

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.200
is me be quiet for a bit while
you catch up to where I am.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:14.679
In the Schoenflies notation,
this lovely thing here is C4.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:19.860
It's a rotation axis of rank 4
with a vertical mirror plane

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.860
added to it.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.290
And the international
notation, now the

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.929
Hermann-Mauguin notation, is
just a running list of the

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.830
individual symmetry elements
that are present.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:37.770
And now I really are going
to have a mouthful.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:41.040
This is a fourfold axis, so
the symbol for that is 4.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.150
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.239
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.260
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.190
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.515
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:46.515 --> 00:34:48.199
This is a mirror plane.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:49.820
That's a mirror plane, and
that's a mirror plane.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:58.750
So it looks as though I should
call this 4mmmmmmmm, which

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:00.000
comes 4mmmmmmmm.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:04.460
Well, that is a typical
reaction.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.880
It's a lovely symmetry.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.120
But that is a mouthful.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.630
So it isn't really necessary to
give all these m's So the

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:24.370
international notation is
a running list of the

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:28.210
independent symmetry elements,
and that's the new wrinkle

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.110
that I'm introducing.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.305
It's a running list of the
independent symmetry elements.

00:35:41.254 --> 00:35:46.570
And all these mirror planes are
just different sigma that

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.090
exist as operations
in the group.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.390
But how many different kinds
of mirror planes are they?

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:57.060
Well, there are two different
kinds of mirror planes, both

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.630
in terms of the way in which
they function in the pattern.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.380
The two motifs related by
reflection hang close to this

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.550
mirror plane, but they're widely
separated for this

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.850
mirror plane.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:15.100
So the motifs do different
things relative to those two

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.630
kinds of mirror planes.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.420
Another way of asking what's
independent is if I start with

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.210
this 1 mirror plane and repeat
it by 90-degree rotations,

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:29.660
I'll get these 4 mirror planes
90 degrees away.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.950
So they are not independent in
that these mirror planes are

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.140
all related by the rotational
symmetry that's present.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.630
You don't get this mirror plane
in any fashion other

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.730
than saying, if I combine the
rotation operation with this

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.970
reflection operation sigma,
the net result is this

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.230
reflection plane.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.310
So there are two mirror planes
that are distinct in this

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.440
arrangement of symmetry
elements, distinct in the

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:01.550
sense that they function in
different ways in the pattern;

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:05.380
distinct in the sense that no
other operation that is

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:10.160
present will throw these two
operations into one another.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:15.660
Another example, and this is in
fact symmetry 4mm, is the

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.300
square tile.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.670
If you look at the mirror planes
there, they are 45

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.730
degrees apart.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.850
But one of those mirror planes
comes out normal to the edge

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.060
of the tile.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.710
The other mirror plane comes out
of the vertex of the tile.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:32.390
So they are different in the way
they function in the space

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.450
which has this symmetry.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:38.110
So, mercifully, we don't have
to call this 4mmmmmmmm.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:42.750
We drop the last 6 m's, and this
one is called simply for

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.360
4mm, 2 kinds of mirror planes
with a fourfold axis.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.990
If you're familiar with the
way in which these were

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:55.780
derived, the symbol tells you
exactly what you've got.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:00.510
So it's a very useful notation
for these symmetries.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.820
Let me pause here, give you
a chance to catch up.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.302
Yes, sir?

00:38:07.302 --> 00:38:09.471
AUDIENCE: So wait, all you did
here is take two separate

00:38:09.471 --> 00:38:12.122
mirror planes at an angle of
45 degrees between, and you

00:38:12.122 --> 00:38:13.770
ended up with a fourfold
symmetry.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.030
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.564
AUDIENCE: But you didn't put on
the fourfold symmetry, it

00:38:17.564 --> 00:38:19.060
was just what fell out of it?

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.545
PROFESSOR: No.

00:38:20.545 --> 00:38:23.730
I Got this mirror plane to begin
with by combining this

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.770
reflection operation sigma with
the operation A pi/2, and

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.340
that's where this operation
came from.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.480
But a general theorem that
says if I have a rotation

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:43.020
operation A alpha and combine it
with a reflection operation

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.640
sigma, the combined effect is
a reflection operation sigma

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:54.510
2, which is alpha/2 away
from the first.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:57.360
So, again, showing you for this
now rather messy diagram,

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.290
if I start with the reflection
operation that takes 1 of them

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.890
throws of the 2 and then rotates
2 up to location 3,

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:12.510
the way I get from 1 to 3 in one
shot is to reflect in this

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.760
locus sigma 2.

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:16.850
Yes, sir?

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:18.188
AUDIENCE: You could have started
with any one of those

00:39:18.188 --> 00:39:20.232
two and got the third.

00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:21.690
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.250
Absolutely.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:27.370
The operations that are
present operate

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.090
everything in the space.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:33.460
So when I say that there's a
mirror plane here that relates

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.340
this one to this one, it also
relates this one to this one,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.845
this one to this one, this one
to this one, that mirror

00:39:38.845 --> 00:39:40.720
planes operates on everything.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.070
You can't say that a symmetry
operation grab this little

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.060
packet of space and moves
it to another packet

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.360
removed from it.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:52.000
To say it's a symmetry of a
pattern or of a crystal, it

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.850
has to leave everything
invariant.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.100
OK.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.630
But, again, in terms of the
language of groups theory, if

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.730
you combine this pair of
operations, then when you

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.560
combine everything that you get
pairwise, you will get in

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.720
this case a total of,
how many operations?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.390
How many operations are
in this pattern?

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.570
I said a moment ago the rank of
the group is the number of

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.130
operations that are present.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.860
It's the number of objects that
are in the group because

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.040
each operation in a group tells
you how to get from

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.520
anyone to all of the other.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.336
So, 2, 4, 6, 8, this is a group
of rank 8, and there are

00:40:34.336 --> 00:40:36.911
8 operation that are present.

00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:39.320
And I can rattle them
off quickly.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.390
Four operations, identity,
90, 180, 270 for

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.340
the fourfold axis.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:46.770
That's 4.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.230
This mirror plane.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.230
This mirror plane.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.550
The mirror plane.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.470
And this mirror plane.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.130
That's 8.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.950
Four for rotation.

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.200
Four for reflection.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.620
Other questions?

00:41:13.205 --> 00:41:13.860
All right.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:18.130
Let me then wrap up this
quickly and get

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.040
onto something new.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.715
Did I hear the hiccup
or a question?

00:41:21.715 --> 00:41:22.100
No.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.200
It was a hiccup.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.450
Not a yawn I hope.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.830
Let me do the highest symmetry
of all in two dimensions, and

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.220
this is if I take a sixfold
axis and combine it with a

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.630
mirror plane.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:52.030
So here's the first
operation sigma.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.190
This one is something
of a bear to draw.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.700
This is sigma 1.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:02.050
Sigma 1 followed by the
operation A 2 pi/6 should be

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:09.840
equal to a reflection that is an
angle one half of 2 pi/6 30

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.170
degrees away from the first.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.250
So this will be sigma 2.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:21.530
So if I reflect from 1 to 2 and
then rotate by 60 degrees,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.755
I'm going to get one
that sets up here.

00:42:24.755 --> 00:42:29.760
And the way I get from number
1 to number 3 in one shot is

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.570
by a reflection sigma 2.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.790
Now if I draw in all of those
are mirror planes when they

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:41.220
are repeated by the sixfold
axis, I shouldn't have given

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.900
this my 6mmmmmm treatment
because there

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.710
are 12 mirror planes.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:49.990
Two objects hanging on this one
in one fashion spaced in a

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:52.270
different way that are
belly to belly.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.030
They're back to back here, so it
does something different in

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.040
the pattern.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.430
A pair hanging here.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:01.920
A pair hanging in here.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.262
A pair hanging and here.

00:43:05.262 --> 00:43:06.920
A pair hanging in here.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.770
And finally, a pair
hanging in here.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:17.730
So there are a total
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.350
motifs in this pattern.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:24.900
Pairs hanging on mirror planes
that are 30 degrees apart and

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.840
hanging disposed and pointing
in different ways on the

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.360
adjacent mirror planes.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.910
So this is one that we would
call in international notation

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:39.215
6mmm and in Schoenflies
notation C6v.

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:48.270
So we're making extraordinary
progress here.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:53.370
The one that I did for you
initially was C2v, and that's

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:57.300
2mn in international notation.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:02.030
The only one that I left out to
this point is a threefold

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.070
axis compared with a vertical
mirror planes.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:20.370
And let's start with the
operation A 2 pi/3, combined

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:24.050
with that a first reflection
operation sigma 1 that passes

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:25.300
through it.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.380
And for reference, I'll drawn
in some lines that are

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:36.690
separated by intervals
of 60 degrees.

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:42.610
So this reflection from 1 to 2
followed by a rotation 120

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:46.740
degrees should give me
this one as number 3.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.280
The first is right handed.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.360
The second is left handed, and
the third stays left handed.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.950
And lo and behold, the way I get
from 1 to 3 directly is by

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:07.450
a reflection sigma 2 across
a mirror line that is--

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:08.310
I'm sorry.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:13.190
This is number 1 down here--
across a mirror line that is

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.504
30 degrees away from
the first.

00:45:16.504 --> 00:45:18.970
If I would complete the pattern,
reflect this one

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:24.840
across to here, take this pair
and reflect it or rotate it up

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.440
here, and I have six objects.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.610
So this is a group of rank 6.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.980
And it has characteristics that
are quite analogous to

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.220
those we did for the other
rotation axes in all respect

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.520
except one.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:45.915
The international symbol for
this combination is C3v.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.090
We've got a threefold axis.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.060
We've got the mirror plane
that we added.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:59.510
And then we've got a mirror
plane that is 30 degrees away

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:00.155
from the first--

00:46:00.155 --> 00:46:01.310
I'm sorry--

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.810
60 degrees away from the first,

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.370
one half of 120 degrees.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.700
I claim that this is not the
proper symbol because the

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.710
mirror planes that are
listed should be the

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:22.110
symmetry-independent, distinct
sort of mirror planes.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.890
And is that the case
with this one?

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:29.960
The answer is no.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.230
It isn't.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.550
Here is one mirror plane.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.750
It's got a pair of motifs
hanging on it.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.360
This mirror plane here is a
mirror plane that has a pair

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.270
of motifs hanging it.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.530
Same is true of this
mirror plane.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.880
So all six of these mirror
planes are doing the same

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.130
thing in the pattern.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:51.020
Each one has a pair of a motifs
on either side of it in

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.890
the same fashion.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.850
And I can get one mirror plane
and the motifs hanging on it

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.740
by a rotation of 120 degrees.

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.780
So there's only one kind of
mirror planes, so we don't

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.570
need that m.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:10.076
So all of the other rotational
symmetries, m, a onefold axis

00:47:10.076 --> 00:47:14.090
with a mirror plane; 2mm,
4mm, 6mm have two

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.970
kinds of mirror planes.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:21.670
C3v has only one kind
of mirror planes.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.830
And another way of showing
that is if I look at a

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:26.960
trigonal prism.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.800
It's got a mirror plane coming
out of a corner and out of the

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.410
opposite face.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.580
Mirror plane coming out
of the corner and out

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.920
the opposite face.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.400
Mirror plane coming out
of a corner and out

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:39.750
the opposite face.

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.920
And that's exactly the
rearrangement of symmetry

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.030
elements here.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.620
So each mirror planes when
drawn in relative to a

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.560
trigonal prism, which is a body
that has this symmetry,

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.510
each mirror planes does exactly
the same thing, as

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:57.340
opposed to the square tile or
square prism that has one kind

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.100
of mirror plane that comes out
of faces and one kind of

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.850
mirror plane that comes
out of corners.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:03.500
So there are two different
types of mirror planes.

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:18.740
Let's add them all up,
summarize, and we've got the

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.730
cast of characters that we
can be use in deriving

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.920
two-dimensional symmetries.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.650
We've got C1, which is a onefold
axis; C2, twofold

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:36.950
axis; C3, that's a threefold
axis; C4, and that's a

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:42.550
fourfold axis; C6, that's
a sixfold axis.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.690
Then we've got the additions
that involve adding a mirror

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.640
plane to a rotational axis.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:55.890
So this is simply m and CS
in Schoenflies notation.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:58.460
Then we added a mirror plane
to a twofold axis.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:07.160
We've got C2 with a vertical
mirror plane, 2mm; C3v; and

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:18.180
not 3mm, but only 3m; C4v, and
that's 4mm; and C6v, and

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.990
that's 6mm.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.890
Add them all up, and there are
10 unique possibilities, no

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:26.480
more, no less.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:26.650
Yes, sir?

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.090
AUDIENCE: I'm missing a point.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:33.810
Why is there the mirror plane
sigma 2 rather than rotating

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:36.820
sigma 1 is not different?

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.290
How do you?

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.690
PROFESSOR: The same thing is
going on, on this mirror plane

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.730
as on this mirror planes,
on this mirror plane.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:48.120
Or if you like to see it in
terms of a geometric solid,

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.420
the mirror planes here in a
trigonal prism all of them do

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.010
the same thing.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:57.360
They come out of one corner and
out of the opposite edge.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.770
Each of these has one pair
of objects hanging on it.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:04.800
And that is true of
all three of them.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:11.000
And if you like, this end of
the mirror plane here is

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.380
nothing more than one that's
related to the first one by

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.550
one of the rotations of the
threefold axis extended back

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.340
in the opposite direction.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:22.290
So the mirror plane doesn't
just work up here.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.480
It works down here as well.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.790
It works all through
the space.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.630
So any way you want to look at
it and whatever terms work for

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:32.900
you, each of these mirror planes
is the same, but they

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.860
have a different type
of end to them.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:37.720
There's something different
hanging at one end than

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.230
at the other end.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.510
Think of it in terms of actual
physical object.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.990
AUDIENCE: [? What about the ?]
case of the fourfold

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.982
[? there? ?]

00:50:46.982 --> 00:50:51.190
PROFESSOR: In the fourfold,
one comes out of the face.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.210
One comes out at the edge.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:58.360
The motifs are oriented and
spaced at a different distance

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.005
from each of those neighboring
mirror planes.

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:10.950
So these two are different.

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.970
The fourfold axis never
rotates this

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.410
one into this one.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:19.790
These two are not different
because the threefold axis

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:25.990
rotates, if you do it twice,
this end into this end of what

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:29.300
is one in the same mirror plane
as what's down on here.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.190
So what's confusing you I
think is that there's a

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.170
polarity to the mirror planes.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.930
Both ends of the mirror planes
do not have the same

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:41.990
disposition of motifs on them,
but there's nothing that says

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.650
that this has to be the case.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.630
The motifs could just
be at one end.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.360
And that, if you think about
it a little bit if it help,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.660
figure out--

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.180
not on company time though, but
on your own time-- what a

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.390
fivefold axis does.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:59.350
And a fivefold axis is a non
crystallographic symmetry.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:09.450
But it turns out that C5v, which
is a 5 with an m, has

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:13.870
only one kind of mirror plane in
it as well and for exactly

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:14.610
the same reason.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:17.670
A regular figure that has the
symmetry is a pentagon.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.300
A mirror plane comes out
a corner and out of

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.860
the opposite face.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:25.210
And that's true for all of the
mirror planes that are in

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:30.000
there and separated by
one half of 2 pi/5.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.920
AUDIENCE: That's just whether or
not the [INAUDIBLE] axis is

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.400
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:32.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:33.965
That's what I said.

00:52:33.965 --> 00:52:36.380
Yeah.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.910
So before I go through all
of the rotation axes with

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.577
vertical mirror planes, the
international notation would

00:52:43.577 --> 00:52:53.450
be 2mm, 3m, 4mm, 5m,
and 6mm, 7m.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.850
For the odd symmetries, there's
only one kind of

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:59.760
mirror plane in a pattern,
in the tile, or

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.890
whatever you want to have.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:06.680
So there are 10 distinct
possibilities, and these are

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:09.440
called the Point Groups.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:16.200
Why?

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:21.050
Because they are clusters of
symmetry elements about at

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.900
least one point that's
fixed and embedded

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.150
immovably in space.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.150
They're called groups because,
as we've seen for one simple

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:37.620
example, the collection of
operations follows the

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.810
postulates for the set of
elements which we have defined

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.060
as a group.

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:47.880
More specifically, we could
call these the 10

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.750
two-dimensional crystallographic
graphic Point

00:53:50.750 --> 00:54:01.840
Groups, which is more
of a mouthful.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.360
But it emphasizes the fact
that there are lots of

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.790
two-dimensional Point Groups,
but the two-dimensional

00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:11.470
crystallographic Point Groups
are those that involve

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.930
rotational symmetry that are
compatible with a lattice.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:18.210
Hence, they are
crystallographic.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.950
But the number of Point Groups
is actually infinite if you

00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:27.187
include the ones that are not
compatible with translation.

00:54:27.187 --> 00:54:28.660
All right.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.070
I think that's probably
a good place to quit.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:31.770
And guess what?

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.470
My internal clock has told
me that this is the

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.440
time for our break.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:42.140
This is one crossroads
in our development.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:47.180
And what we'll do next for the
faint hearted who may not want

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.510
to have more of this stuff for
one day than what we've just

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:54.020
done, we're now going to do
the final penultimate

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:59.790
combination, and say we have
also shown that there are 5

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.040
two-dimensional lattices.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:11.370
And the final step will be to
say if we have a pattern that

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.170
has symmetry and is based on
translation, we can obtain

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:19.530
these by taking each of the 10
crystallographic Point Groups

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:27.270
in turn and dropping them into
each of the five lattices that

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.560
can accommodate them.

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:32.630
We would not try, for example,
to take a Point Group like 4mm

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.880
and try to drop it into
the hexagonal lattice.

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.230
It's not going to fit.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:41.660
But there will be two, maybe
three ways in which we can add

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.250
a given Point Group to one
of these lattice types.

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:47.240
And what we've done when
we finished is we have

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:52.690
exhaustively derived the
symmetries' translational

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:57.010
lattices and symmetry operations
of reflection and

00:55:57.010 --> 00:56:01.960
rotation that are possible for
two-dimensional crystal.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.210
You might say, well
two-dimensional crystal, I've

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.310
heard that people who do thin
film work to make monolayers

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:09.950
and really make a
two-dimensional crystal.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.710
That's not something you could
say only a few years ago.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:16.350
But why do we worry about
two-dimensional symmetries if

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:18.840
we're not to be wallpaper
designers?

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.910
Well, actually, I'll give
you one example.

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:23.930
One of the difficulties you had
in conveying the nature of

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.370
a crystal structure is taking
something that's fairly

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:29.130
complicated in three dimensions
and getting it onto

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.790
a two-dimensional
sheet of paper.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:35.120
And what you invariably do is
you project the contents of

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.170
the unit cell down along
one of the cell edges.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.720
And what you have then is a
two-dimensional crystal

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.200
structure with a lattice
and symmetry.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.860
So you'll see two-dimensional
representations of

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.540
translationally periodic
arrangements of atoms quite

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:52.280
frequently when you look at
projections of actual crystal

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.150
structures, which is the only
reasonable way to convey the

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:59.300
information of any structure
once you get on beyond the

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:02.910
baby stuff of sodium chlorides,
zinc, sulfide and

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.160
body-centered iron.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.060
OK.

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.720
I'm going to pause,
suck in air.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:16.130
I am happy to turn you loose for
10 minutes and will meet

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:17.790
here again, let's say,
at 10 after 3:00.
