00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.250
PROFESSOR: I think it's time
that we got started.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.340
I haven't given a problem set
out for a couple of days.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.300
So I have one that will cover
some material that we'll go

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.720
over with and develop today
and some new material that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.880
we're not going to introduce
for a while.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.868
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.100
PROFESSOR: Yes, this
is Thursday.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.160
And this is for the
near future.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.340
I've given you two--
two a week before.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.315
So it's the adjective you're
objecting to not the problem

00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:42.565
set, of course.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.630
Today we're going undertake
another major step in our

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.930
development of three dimensional
crystallographic

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.220
symmetries.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.340
We have just completed
derivation of the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.030
crystallographic point groups,
so these are the macroscopic

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.080
symmetries that crystals
can have.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.940
And then, by analogy, to what we
did in two dimensions, the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.970
next step would be to take each
of these point groups and

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.270
hang it at a lattice point of
some three dimensional lattice

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.890
that can accommodate them.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.590
We have not as yet developed
the three dimensional

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.400
lattices, and that will be
our agenda for today.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.890
Seems like we've already
done that, haven't we?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.560
We showed that in two
dimensions, a cell can be

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.210
oblique, it can be rectangular,
it can be

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.480
centered rectangular,
it can be square,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.100
or it can be hexagonal.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.480
So these are the different kinds
of bases that one can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.750
have for the cell, right?

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.150
So there should be the same
number of space lattices.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.920
Actually it's more complicated
than that.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.770
And let me remind you by another
handout what the two

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.080
dimensional space groups, the
plane groups, look like

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.320
assembled in all of their
glory on one sheet.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.630
And there you see the different
ways symmetry can be

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.630
placed in these five different
kinds of lattices--

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.850
oblique, rectangular, centered

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.840
rectangular, square, and hexagonal.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.550
Now a lattice in two dimensions,
a potential base

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.110
for a unit cell, can be
rectangular if and only if

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.790
there is symmetry
within that net.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.860
That demands that it be
exactly rectangular.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.940
In other words, if a lattice
is to be rectangular in the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.750
base of the cell, it has to
have in it one of the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.610
symmetries that correspond to
those in the plane groups that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.830
give and require, indeed demand,
a rectangular lattice.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.490
Similarly a lattice can be
truly square, identically

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.880
square, only if there's
a fourfold axis in it.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.330
That demands that
it be square.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.350
The same could be
said for either

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.270
threefold or sixfold symmetry.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.050
One of the groups,
P3, [? P3, ?]

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.700
mP3, 1m, P6, and P6mm, has to be
in the base of the cell if

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.430
that cell is to have
the specialization.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.900
So let's give an example
with a twofold axis.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.230
Let's suppose we have a base
of the cell that has an

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.060
unspecialized shape--

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.740
two translations that are
unequal in length and an angle

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.410
between them which is a
general obtuse angle.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.260
That's about as general
as you can get.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.380
But suppose that this net has as
well a two dimensional-- a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.220
twofold axis in it.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.150
And suppose we pick our third
translation such that it picks

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.460
up this net which is going to
be the base of our three

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.260
dimensional lattice and
translates it over to this

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.850
point in the base.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.540
Well that translation
picks up everything.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.560
It picks up not only the two
translations that we've been

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.470
calling T1 and T2 to this point,
but it also picks up

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.019
all the twofold axes
that are hanging on

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.610
these lattice points.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.190
So if this is the terminus of
T3 and projection, it will

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.810
have picked up a twofold axis
and plopped down a twofold

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.490
axis here where no twofold
axis exists.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.130
And we can take one of the
theorems that we've seen,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.590
namely that the operation A pi,
followed by translation,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.630
is equal to a new rotation
operation through pi located

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.600
halfway along the translation.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.540
And turn this around and ask
what happens when we combine

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.340
two rotations through
180 degrees

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.500
about different points.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.160
And let's just draw it out
to see what happens.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.000
Let's say there's a
twofold axis here.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.480
It takes motif number 1,
moves it to number 2.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.470
And then here's a second twofold
axis and this takes

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.130
number 2, rotates it over
here to number 3.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.380
I is number 1 related to 3?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.730
But in terms of this first
theorem, not surprisingly, we

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.160
have introduced a translation
into the space which is equal

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.020
to twice the spacing between the
twofold axes, which I"ll

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.490
label as delta.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.710
So in other words, if we put
a twofold axis down in this

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.090
place in addition to the ones
that we already have, we have

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.150
created, in the base of the
cell, a new twofold axis in

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.340
this location.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.740
That just mucks everything up
because it's going to rotate

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.050
the translations that we have,
it's going to rotate the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.710
twofold axes that we have.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.110
And we will not any longer
have a group.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.310
We will not have a
set of operations

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.560
that closes upon itself.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.560
So the conclusion then is that
if we're going to safely pick

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.930
a third translation, T3, and
combine it with a net that has

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.210
twofold axes in it, in order to
get a group, we are going

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.100
to have to ensure that the
twofold axes line up in every

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.270
net in the stack.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.410
And there could be several
ways of doing that.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.650
We could pick T3 so that
it goes straight up.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.950
And then the twofold axes are
just all slit up parallel to

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.280
themselves, and they remain
in coincidence.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.780
Or we could pick T3 so that it
terminates over the point

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.020
that's halfway along T2.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.730
And then this twofold axis gets
picked up and put down

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.290
over one that's already there.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.740
This one gets picked up and
put down over one that's

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.940
already there and so on.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.710
So that's an OK choice.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.270
That's a safe choice as well.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.870
Similarly we could pick T3 such
that, within the plane of

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.260
the net, it had a component that
was one half of T1, so

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.790
that it picked up this net and
slid it over to this location.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.892
So once again all the twofold
axes lined up.

00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:17.150
Or, in the same fashion, let it
terminate over the center

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.840
of the cell.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.060
So those are the four ways we
can combine an oblique net

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.450
that contains a twofold axis in
such a way that the lattice

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:32.870
points in the existing twofold
axes remain invariant and are

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.700
not moved into locations that
create new twofold axes.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.650
OK so let's back off a
little bit and start

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.850
with plane group P1--

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.370
no symmetry at all.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.400
So this is T1 and T2.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.050
If there's no symmetry
whatsoever in the base of the

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.080
cell, we are free to pick the
third translation in any

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.420
orientation that we choose.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:02.280
So trying to sketch it
in three dimensions.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.520
If this is T1, and this is T2,
T3 can be in any orientation

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.930
such that not only is this angle
general, but this angle

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.680
is general, and this angle
general as well.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.440
And if I would try to carefully
complete the

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.900
parallelepiped so that its
geometry looks reasonable.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.900
This is going to be the general
oblique parallelepiped

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:37.960
with three translations that are
unequal in magnitude, and

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.780
three angles between
these translations.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.000
Let me write them as the angle
between T1 and T2--

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.220
not equal to the angle between
T2 and T3 necessarily, not

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.790
equal to the angle between
T3 and T1.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.452
And all of these angles are
completely general and can

00:09:02.452 --> 00:09:05.760
assume any values
that they like.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.830
So this then is the lowest
common denominator.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.760
This is a totally unspecialized
space lattice.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.020
It has the shape of the general
parallelepiped--

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.960
no special relations between
any of the translations

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.129
whatsoever.

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:22.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.890
PROFESSOR: I say they're--

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:26.920
Oh I'm sorry, magnitude
are not equal.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.130
I meant to put not equal
signs there.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.890
Yeah, they can have any
length they wish.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.140
They're not equivalent.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.010
Any other questions?

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:54.950
OK let's go back then to the
case of an oblique net to

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.400
which we've decided to
add a twofold axis.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.740
And that gives twofold axes in
the locations that we've

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.460
become familiar with
in the plane group.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:09.490
And if I pick the translation
so that it goes directly

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.880
normal to the base of the cell,
I'm going to have a new

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.580
kind of lattice.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.140
The lattice is going to have two
angles between axes that

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.880
are exactly 90 degrees, not
approximately so, but exactly

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.350
so, because only if that
translation, T3, is exactly

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.880
normal to the base of the cell
will the twofold axes in all

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.865
of these nets lineup exactly.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.370
So here we have a degree
of specialization.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.080
The translations remain
unequal in magnitude.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.420
They can be any length they wish
and not change things,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.580
but two of the angles--

00:10:52.580 --> 00:11:01.270
axial angles, T1 to T2, is
identically 90 degrees.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:06.940
The angle between T2 and T3
is identically 90 degrees.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.880
And the third angle,
the angle--

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.590
I'm sorry, T1 and T2 is
my general angle.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.865
So this can be anything.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.730
So that can be any
general angle.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:27.200
T2 and T3 and T1 and T3, want
to be exactly 90 degrees.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.590
So we're getting space lattices
that have a degree of

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.860
precise specialization.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.140
And the reason is that the
geometry of the base of the

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.110
cell is inseparable from
symmetry in the base of the

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.220
cell that demands the degree of
specialization that makes

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.470
the space lattice unique.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:02.100
So let us look at a couple of
the other choices for the

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.930
third translation that will
leave the twofold axes in

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.180
coincidence.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:13.450
Another choice would be to pick
the third translation

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.420
such that it terminated
exactly over

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.420
the midpoint of T2.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.430
So here's T1.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:22.680
Here's T2.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.090
Now what I'm going to do is
something I have not done to

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.010
this point.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.260
Having this translation T3
terminate exactly over the

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.830
midpoint of a translation
[INAUDIBLE] was clearly a

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.840
specialization.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.740
If I were to go up two
translations, T3, I would be

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.620
directly over the end of T2,
and that is a much more

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.290
convenient way of demonstrating

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.970
that special feature.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.460
So let me pick a new T3 prime.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.480
It goes up exactly normal to the
base of the cell, and in

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.780
so doing, I will have defined a
cell which is a double cell.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.400
And the catch is an extra
lattice point in the middle of

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.870
one of the pair of faces.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.750
So I'll refer to this general
sort of situation--

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.700
this is a double cell.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.695
And I'll call this, in words,
a side-centered cell.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.030
And it has, with this
redefinition of translations,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.370
exactly the same degree of
specialization as before--

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.440
magnitude of T1 not equal to the
magnitude of T2, not equal

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.620
to the magnitude of T3.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.220
And it has the same
specialization of the angles.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:04.250
The angle between T1 and T3
is exactly 90 degrees.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:11.470
The angle between T2 and T3
is exactly 90 degrees.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:18.050
And the angle between T1
and T2 is general.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.750
General, but by convention we
will assume the obtuse angle

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.000
rather than the acute angle.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.660
OK so by picking this double
cell, we've defined a cell

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.520
that has a twofold redundancy.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.130
But in doing so, we have
gained the advantage of

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:45.510
showing that this specialized
geometry is exactly the same

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.610
as this one--

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.530
in the same sense that in two
dimensions, the primitive

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.020
rectangular cell and the
centered rectangular cell were

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.820
both cousins.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.610
They were both had orthogonal
translations.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.830
But the other thing that we gain
is that even though we

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.900
can't have an orthogonal
coordinate system, if we use

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.110
the three translations as the
basis of a coordinate system,

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.960
at least we have two
90 degree angles on

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.950
our coordinate system.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.620
And operationally,
that is going to

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.400
be an enormous advantage.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.730
Yes, sir.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.104
AUDIENCE: So is T3 [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:27.220
PROFESSOR: T3 was selected so
that we picked it as 2 T2.

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:35.050
I'm sorry, 2 T3 minus T2.

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.150
That was my new T3 prime.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.630
I went up two translations in T2
and then back T2, and that

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.660
put me directly over the lattice
point from which my

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.730
translations emanate.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.410
AUDIENCE: So your T3 is
actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:55.990
PROFESSOR: It goes to the next
level up in the stack of nets.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.690
If I would draw this in
projection, which is not

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.630
nearly as clear in some
respects, this would be the

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.880
base of the cell.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.870
Let me use x's for the
next level up.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.300
So here's the net offset
by half of T2.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.820
And then if I go up two of these
T3's and then back by

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.020
T2, my next layer up is directly
over the first one--

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.330
the third layer up is directly
over the first.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.530
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't it
be T3 prime then?

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.010
PROFESSOR: Yes if I were to be
consistent, I should call this

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.040
T3 prime, which I did here.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.520
But now I should call
that T3 as well.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.160
I got a little bit careless
because we're going to forget

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.640
that we ever had this T3-- to
find this selected as a

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.890
stacking vector.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.730
OK well in P2 there
are four different

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.430
kinds of twofold axes.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.320
So we could have the third
translation terminate over

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.980
either of the remaining pair
of twofold axes as well.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.700
I think that it's apparent
that if I pick T3, the

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:17.930
original T3, as one half of T1,
so that the next layer up

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:23.030
terminates in lattice points
in this orientation.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:30.060
And then I pick a T3 prime,
which is equal to 2 T1 minus--

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:35.490
2 T3 minus T1, I will
have gotten again a

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.710
side-centered lattice.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.690
The only difference is that it's
going to be a different

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.500
pair of faces.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.080
It's going to be the O1Oa faces
that have the extra

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.270
lattice point.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.990
So that is not fundamentally a
different sort of lattice.

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:50.250
It is also side-centered.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.170
And differs from our second
result only in whether it is

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.490
the side face with the shortest
translation or the

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.430
longest translations of the
base that bears the extra

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.080
lattice point.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:11.910
One final choice though does
result in a new lattice with

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.180
special features.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.420
And this would be one where I
pick the third translation

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:24.810
such that it terminates over the
center of the net below.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:36.070
So let's let this be T1, this be
T2, and pick T3 so that it

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:41.380
moves the origin lattice point
directly over the center of

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.490
the parallelogram face below.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:51.420
And then if I go up two
translations, T3, and then

00:18:51.420 --> 00:19:01.520
subtract off T1, and subtract
off T2, I will again have a T3

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.810
prime, which is exactly normal
to the base of the cell.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.920
OK this is a type of
lattice that you've

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.180
come to know and love.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.040
In the cubic system, this
is referred to as a

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.290
body-centered lattice.

00:19:28.116 --> 00:19:31.574
AUDIENCE: So then, T3
is just [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.574 --> 00:19:38.980
PROFESSOR: T3, the original
choice, would pick this

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:47.740
original net up and move it so
that that net was moved--

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.750
such that it's corner was
over the center of

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.040
the original net.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.930
So if we go up two translations,
we have lattice

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.922
point over lattice point, and we
redefine T3 by going back 1

00:20:00.922 --> 00:20:03.390
T1 and minus 1 T2.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.420
And that makes it exactly
normal to the base.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.036
AUDIENCE: Not on the sides?

00:20:07.036 --> 00:20:09.046
PROFESSOR: Nothing
on the sides .

00:20:09.046 --> 00:20:11.810
Now in fact, if we try to do
that, we would have something

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.700
that's not a lattice.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.360
If we tried to have some
additional lattice points in

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.290
the center and the edges of
this upper level, we would

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.420
have destroyed the original
T1 and T2 in

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:23.670
the base of the cell.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.920
Let me do one or two more and
then I think the way in which

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.310
one proceeds should
be quite clear.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:50.630
If you take this list of all
of the plane groups, if we

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:55.980
would like to have a three
dimensional cell that has a

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:03.030
rectangular base, the base can
be rectangular only if there

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:09.440
is a mirror plane in that net
or a twofold axis with the

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.920
mirror plane.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.730
The two situations
are different.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:24.990
So let's examine first the case
of a rectangular net that

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.825
has either a mirror plane
or a glide plane in it.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.270
And they're both going to have
the same sort of constraint.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:49.270
If I have a mirror plane, that--
let me use a slightly

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:55.200
wiggly line so the mirror line
is not confused with the edges

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:55.870
of the cell.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.430
So here are two translations,
T1 and T2.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.630
And if I pick a T3 that moves
this rectangular net up and

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.630
over itself, we have to do so in
such a way that the mirror

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.510
planes coincide.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:17.440
Because if I have a mirror plane
in space that passes in

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.800
proximity to a lattice point,
I can turn my theorem around

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:29.350
and say that a translation,
T1, combined with a mirror

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:32.710
plane that is a reflection
operation that's removed from

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:39.910
the lattice point, I would
have to introduce a new

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.130
translation to delta which
is going to be

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.620
incommensurate with T1.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.850
So I have to pick my
third translation

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.120
in one of two ways.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.810
Let me indicate that by
drawing a circle.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.600
T3 can terminate anywhere
over this mirror plane.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.430
I could pick this net up, slide
it parallel to T2, and

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.790
as long as I put it down so that
this is the lattice point

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:08.780
in the next layer up, that will
be a legitimate placement

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.470
of the net.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.590
Because all the mirror planes
are simply slid into

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.130
coincidence with one another.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.405
So if I sketch that thing
in three dimensions--

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.950
this is the base of the
cell and it has

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.030
a rectangular shape.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.350
And the third translation
goes up at an angle.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.790
That's going to be
exactly something

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.810
that I've made before.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.940
And the only difference is that
the oblique angle is now

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.150
on the vertical plane but
that's a right angle.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.650
And this stays a right angle.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.860
So that's exactly a lattice of
the shape that we had last

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.440
time with twofold axes, except
this cell is sitting on one of

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.000
its rectangular sides
rather than sitting

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.400
on its oblique base.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.710
So that is something
that's not new.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:12.220
And if I would pick the
translations so that T3 had a

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:18.540
component that was one half of
T1, plus some amount z that is

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:23.650
perpendicular to the base, I can
redefine that in terms of

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:31.350
a cell that has one pair of
faces inclined to one another.

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.740
And the difference is going to
be that the lattice point

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.320
would be caught in the
center of the cell.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.710
This would be my original
translation T3 and I'll

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.760
redefine that as a T3 prime.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.870
And that gives me two right
angles and one general angle.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.650
So those are exactly the same
lattices that I obtained from

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.920
stacking a net with a
twofold axis in it.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.060
Let me introduce now
another piece of

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.310
jargon as we go along.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:15.820
The relative angles between the
translations are going to

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.350
determine the shape of the
coordinate system that we pick

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.570
along those translations to
specify the geometry of

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.270
features within the lattice.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.990
So we've had a first case, and
this was just a general

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.940
oblique net.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:42.690
So we had a T1 not equal to a
T2, not equal to T3, and all

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.290
three angles were general.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:53.760
All three pair of axes
are inclined.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.780
And this coordinate system, if
we want to refer to it in

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:12.386
terms of words, is called
a triclinic.

00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:14.500
This is the triclinic system.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.560
And the triclinic system is
short for coordinate system.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.890
So this is as general
as things get.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.870
And if this is the shape of the

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.795
lattice there is no symmetry.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.370
Which is the same as saying that
the point group, the only

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.750
point group that can fit
into such a lattice,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.301
is point group 1.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.900
And then we hit another
sort of geometry.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.980
And that is where the
three translations

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.992
had a general angle--

00:27:12.992 --> 00:27:17.660
a third translation that was
exactly normal to the plane of

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.850
the first two.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.410
And one pair of axes
is inclined.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.950
And you can see that this
notation is a little strange,

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.170
perhaps, but consistent.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.810
And it says something about the
nature of the arrangement

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.400
of cell edges.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:44.290
So one pair of axes
inclined is called

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.715
the monoclinic system.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:05.060
And this can contain lattices
that are either primitive,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.310
side-centered--

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.950
with either the longest or
shortest translation in the

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.140
parallelogram that's
coming out of

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.270
the face that's centered.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.190
Or we saw there was one
final possibility.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.440
And that was body-centered.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.950
So we'll refer to these lattices
subsequently as

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.290
monoclinic primitive, monoclinic
side-centered, or

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.030
monoclinic body-centered.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:44.160
These lattices were compatible
with point group 2

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.720
or point group m.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.220
We obtained a lattice of the
same shape with point group m

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.170
or with point group 2.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.680
If it works for 2 and it
works for m, why not

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.050
both at the same time.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:02.290
It would also work
for 2 over m--

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.470
twofold axis perpendicular
to a mirror plane.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.900
Any question at this point?

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.215
Yeah?

00:29:20.215 --> 00:29:21.406
AUDIENCE: Also 2m, right?

00:29:21.406 --> 00:29:22.720
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.862
Yeah

00:29:25.862 --> 00:29:28.560
PROFESSOR: No,because as soon
as you got a mirror plane,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.770
then you have to have
a rectangular net.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.230
So it's going to be--
it's going to

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.100
fall into this family.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.140
You're right, a mirror
plane by itself and

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.400
we've got that here.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.550
That's where the mirror
plane falls in

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.844
the side of the thing.

00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:49.094
You're right.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.790
But if it has a rectangular
shape, then we have to have

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.510
either orthogonal mirror planes
and a twofold axis.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.522
The base, if the base-- yeah.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.690
OK.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.300
Part of the amusing part of
this game is that you can,

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.900
upon appropriate redefinition of
cells, come up with a given

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:22.180
coordinate system that defines
more than one lattice.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.710
And I'll give you--

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.410
because you get a little
space doing this--

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.600
I'll give you a two dimensional
example.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.430
Here is one cell.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.560
This is T1, this is T2.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.820
This is a primitive cell.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.223
Nobody should bother
to write this down.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.890
Here's a T1, here's a T2.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.330
So anybody know what that is?

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.720
This is a primitive cell.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.970
This is a jail cell.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.180
Couple sniggers, thank you.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.260
Still another one--

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.530
this is T1, this is T2.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.330
Anybody guess what that is?

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.350
That's a soft sell.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.200
I got a million of them.

00:31:42.826 --> 00:31:44.220
Know what that is?

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.370
It's an underground cell.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.220
Here's one that's
kind of dated--

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.920
I don't think anybody
will get this one.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.200
Does anybody know
what that is?

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.430
That was a misadventure of the
Ford Motor Company that was

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.870
named the Ed cell.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.880
Well, I'll give you
equal time.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.420
Anybody who, after intermission,
wants to respond

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.470
in kind, I'll let you have
an opportunity to do so.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.570
But obviously these are not
standard crystallographic

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.530
cells, but they make
for a smile in an

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.910
otherwise dreary business.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.380
I don't know how to
proceed from here.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:45.050
I have a set of notes for you
which carries all this out in

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.450
incredible thoroughness.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:53.370
So let me pass this around.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.080
Let you take a copy of this
and we won't go over every

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.460
single thing, but I think just
to outline quickly the sort of

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.760
choices that we have.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.630
We haven't yet finished with the
rectangular cell, but if

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.290
it's got something
like 2mm in it.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.060
with twofold axes here
and mirror planes

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.310
running this way--

00:33:24.725 --> 00:33:42.360
P2mm in the base, P2gm, P2gg,
can be stacked only in such a

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.650
fashion that T3 brings twofold
axes and mirror planes into

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.950
coincidence with one another.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:59.560
So T3 could be 0T1 plus 0T2 plus
some amount z which is

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.930
straight up.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:11.400
Or it could be equal to one
half of T1, 0T2, plus z.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.020
That would be making the origin
twofold axis fall over

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.770
this location.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:26.989
Or T3 could be equal to 0 plus
one half of T2 plus z.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.520
And they're both going to, upon
redefinition, give the

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.780
same result.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:39.480
Or T2 could be equal to one half
of T1 plus one half of T2

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.030
plus z straight up.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.030
And upon redefinition, the
first one that would be a

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.630
brick-shaped unit cell.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.210
That's going to be
a primitive cell.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.220
Picking T3 with a component of
either one half of T1 or one

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.570
half of T2 is going to be
something that gives us a

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:10.466
cell, which can again
be redefined.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.200
This was the original T3 in
terms of a T3 prime, which is

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:31.320
equal to 2T1 or 2T2
minus [? 2T3 ?]

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.610
minus T1 or T2.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:34.860
This is going to be
side-centered.

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.900
And the final choice where it is
a T3 that's one half of T1

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.600
plus one half of T2 can once
again be defined in terms of--

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.370
redefined in terms of a
body-centered lattice.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.490
OK this is a coordinate system
where all interaxial angles

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.940
are 90 degrees.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:14.680
The translations, however, have
arbitrary magnitude with

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.100
respect to one another.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:23.180
All of these cells could be
described as rhombuses.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:27.870
In this case all angles in the
rhombus are 90 degrees, so

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:32.630
this is called the orthorhombic
system--

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.850
orthorhombic coordinate
system.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:42.620
All the angles between the
axes are 90 degrees.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:51.410
So we can get that out of any
one of the rectangular groups

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.570
that has twofold axes and
symmetry planes in it.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.930
And conversely, take one of
these lattices and let the

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.290
symmetry elements that we
found in the plane group

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.370
extend through them and
you've got a three

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:08.210
dimensional space group.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.170
So without emphasizing the fact
is we go along, we're

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.350
picking up a healthy number of
three dimensional space groups

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.600
as we go along.

00:37:29.258 --> 00:37:31.738
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:31.738 --> 00:37:34.010
PROFESSOR: This is primitive.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.590
It's also orthorhombic --

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:39.550
same dimensionality, three
translations, and they're all

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.230
mutually orthogonal.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:45.340
That's true of these other cells
except they're double

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.520
cells in the case of the
side-centered and double as

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.770
well for the case of
the body-centered.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.210
It's time we introduced some
other conventions for notation

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.610
in describing lattices.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.920
We've been using T1, T2, and
T3 to designate the three

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.940
translations that are used
to define the cell.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.430
One has to have some sort of
rules for picking a standard

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:31.330
unit cell so that two people
can do an x-ray diffraction

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:35.140
experiment, let's say, on a
particular material and end up

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.600
defining the lattice in
exactly the same way.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.210
So let me now list, so that we
can use these labels as we go

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:51.805
along further, conventions
for selecting cell edges.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.080
OK one convention is that one
should select the shortest

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.330
translations in the lattice.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:26.340
And these shortest translations,
if there's no

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.920
symmetry, will be
[? dignified ?]

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.700
by calling them a, b and, c--

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.060
standing for the x, y,
and z directions.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:45.280
One picks always, if there's
nothing special about the

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.130
translations in the triclinic
system, the magnitude of b

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.380
greater than a.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.965
And in a rational world--

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.560
every so often you come to a
point like this and it feels

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.860
almost the silliest talking
about underground cells and

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.740
jail cells--

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.540
in a logical, rational
thinking world,

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.790
you would do this.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.340
This is not what one does--

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:22.410
for reasons that have
to do with the

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:24.760
perverse nature of crystals.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:31.410
Take b greater than a, one does
that always, but you pick

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.160
c as the shortest translation.

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.180
Why?

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.340
It has something to do with the

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.260
peculiar behavior of crystals.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.630
If you were working with a
crystal that had the shape of

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:54.960
a needle, in other words,
greatly elongated in one

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.480
direction so that the crystal
looks something like this.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.870
How would you draw a
picture of that?

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:05.910
Would you put it straight up
and down like this or would

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:07.160
you put it on its side.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.110
Takes up a lot of
room this way.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:15.410
You'd almost certainly
instinctively put it this way.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.250
Now if you didn't know
anything about the

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.250
translations down inside the
innards of that crystal-- and

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.890
this was the position that the
people who did crystallography

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.910
solely on the basis of crystal
shape and morphology--

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.850
and had no idea if there was
even a lattice inside of the

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.850
crystal that caused this
regular shape.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:46.180
When you draw a coordinate
system x, y, z,

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.620
z always goes up.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:54.160
Who draws a Cartesian coordinate
system with z going

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.530
this way, x going this way,
and y going this way?

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.160
It's obscene.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.460
We always put z going straight
up and down.

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:05.020
You do the same if you don't
know what the lattice

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.720
translations are with
the labels on

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.460
the axes of the crystal.

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:16.550
So this is a, this is
b, and this is c.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:22.190
And there were tons of pages
published with drawings of

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.820
crystal morphology on them.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.500
And then along came x-rays.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.415
And when they begin to determine
lattice constants of

00:42:32.415 --> 00:42:36.520
a the material that looked like
this, almost invariably

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.370
they found the translations
inside of a needle-like

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.020
crystal corresponded to
a unit cell in the

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.270
shape of the pancake.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:52.150
Crystals, when they have a
very, very short lattice

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.740
vector, almost always grow most

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.400
rapidly in that direction.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.400
So this is a terrible pickle.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.630
Here are reams of books that
published descriptions of

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.390
crystals that had
a needle-like--

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:13.670
an acicular shape, if you want
to use a fancy term, which had

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.470
c as a direction which
corresponded to the shortest

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:18.620
translation in the crystal.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:19.760
So what do you do?

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.420
You don't want to have to redraw
all these figures and

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.570
redefine all these directions
in the crystal.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.935
So what you do is cop out.

00:43:26.935 --> 00:43:30.940
And you make c the shortest
direction in the crystal.

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.350
You think this field is rigorous
but people wimp out

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.150
and they do something that's
contrary to the

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.280
logical thing to do.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.030
Interesting question is why
crystals should grow most

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.290
rapidly in the direction of the
shortest lattice vector.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.240
And I think I know the
answer to that--

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.085
I've never seen anybody express
it in the writing.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.720
The clue comes from some early
work that looked at the growth

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.600
of the crystal from solution.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.940
And this was done first with--

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:15.120
I think it was some
sort of iodide.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.160
I can look it up-- something
like cadmium iodide.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.300
And this material in solution
grew very, very slowly in the

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.900
form of hexagonal plates.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:33.280
And continued to grow most
rapidly in this direction.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.830
This was the direction of the
shortest lattice translation.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.170
Then all a sudden something
happened.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.670
And suddenly the rate of growth
and the nature of the

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.430
morphology changed.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:47.360
The crystal took off like a bat
in these directions and

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:52.680
finally ended up in a
needle-like fashion like this.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:02.220
This was an observation that led
to the dislocation theory

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.770
of crystal growth.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.790
The interpretation was that in
the early stages of growth,

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.500
the crystal is growing by
accretion of atoms on to these

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.190
planar surfaces.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:21.660
And the probability of an atom
sticking is less high when the

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.860
atom is on the flat surface than
when an atom is on the

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.440
surface that might have a little
crevice in it so it can

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.130
bind to two planes at once.

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.410
So the original postulate--

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.350
and now we all take
this for granted--

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.200
is that if there was a flaw
such that the crystal

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:44.080
developed a dislocation on this
surface, and an exposed

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.940
ledge, atoms would accrete and
stick more tenaciously to this

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.610
exposed ledge of the
dislocation.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.990
And this is the so-called
dislocation--

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.540
screw dislocation mechanism--

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.050
for crystal growth.

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.170
And after the crystal has grown
for a while, you can see

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.790
spiral steps on the surface of
the crystal that correspond to

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:11.730
this dislocation
winding around.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.650
OK so why should crystals grow
most rapidly along the

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.290
direction of the shortest
translation?

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.580
It's going to be a lot easier to
create a screw dislocation

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.320
with a Burgers vector for a
translation that is short,

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.250
rather than the translation
that's 10 or 20 angstroms that

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.230
the Burgers vector would
have to involve--

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.960
many, many layers of atoms.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.370
If the translation is very
small, just two or three

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:40.250
atoms, it doesn't cost you
much work to make a screw

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.380
dislocation.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.090
So I think that is the reason
why crystals with very short

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:48.930
lattice translations grow most
rapidly in that direction,

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.180
because it's easier to make the
screw dislocation with a

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.220
Burgers vector that's parallel
to that translation.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.560
So here's the first flagrant
bit of logic that

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.810
flies in our face.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.050
Let me give a few more
definitions and then we'll

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.280
return to this.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.020
If we have a crystal in which
two translations are

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.050
equivalent by symmetry--

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:26.540
and we would have such a
situation if we picked a

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:34.290
translation that was
perpendicular to a square net.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:40.380
And would we call the base of
the cell something defined by

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.050
translations a and b?

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:47.240
If this is a fourfold axis, what
goes on in this direction

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.510
is identical to what goes on in
this direction by symmetry.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.500
And if these two directions are
identical, why call one of

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.890
them a and one of them b?

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.480
So if two directions are
equivalent, and this is true

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:07.300
of the square net, what you
do is call one a1 and

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.550
you call one a2--

00:48:11.095 --> 00:48:12.460
because they're the
same thing.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.060
So let's call them both a.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.740
And the third direction
then is c.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:23.740
And in such a situation here,
c is always defined as the

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.990
unique direction.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.600
What do I mean by a
unique direction?

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.590
This is the direction of high
symmetry in crystals that are

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:48.220
based on square bases
and hexagonal bases.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.320
Yes sir?

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.860
AUDIENCE: You pretty much
contradict yourself if c is

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.016
the longest [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:00.016 --> 00:49:02.380
PROFESSOR: Not always,
not always.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.134
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean
in that picture.

00:49:03.134 --> 00:49:04.930
PROFESSOR: Well I drew
it that way.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:05.430
You know why?

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.170
Because if I draw it like
this, the top of my cell

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.480
doesn't get in the way of
the bottom of my cell.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:17.810
And if I want to draw a small c
translation, then I get into

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:21.966
geometrical complications that
doesn't look nearly as nice.

00:49:21.966 --> 00:49:26.124
AUDIENCE: Well, then I'm just
saying two [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:26.124 --> 00:49:27.260
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.570
It's different for different
systems.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.590
This is what is true for
a triclinic system.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:35.370
And in the case of a
brick-shaped unit cell--

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:36.490
orthorhombic.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:39.830
So this is done for triclinic.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:41.080
It's also done for
orthorhombic.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.170
Not for monoclinic.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.630
For monoclinic, there is a
special direction because

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:59.350
there is a direction of a
twofold axis or maybe a

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:01.960
twofold axis perpendicular
to a mirror plane.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.310
In that case, if we were
rational, we'd call that 1c.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:08.290
OK

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:17.190
I'll close with an
opinion poll.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:21.060
I will invariably, and I'm sure
most people do, draw a

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.760
crystal with a square base, with
the c axis the longest.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:33.480
And if we have someone drawing
a sketch of a cell in which

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.160
the base of the cell is a
hexagonal net, we'd again call

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.240
one a1, one a2.

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.670
And perpendicular to that would
be the same direction.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:43.040
Say look, there I
did it again.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.320
I made c longer than
a1 and a2.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.700
All right.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.065
Let's look at hexagonal
crystals.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.000
Let me ask for a poll.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.960
What percent of all crystals
with threefold and sixfold

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.540
axes do in fact have the length
of c greater than the

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.790
length of a?

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.050
50/50?

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.460
How many would say equally
probable to have it the

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.710
longest or the shortest?

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:19.480
No opinion.

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.950
Let me tell you the
astounding fact.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:31.930
Seventy percent of all hexagonal
crystals have c

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:33.180
greater than a.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.390
Astounding.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.200
Let's look at the next--

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.210
haven't really defined these
terms-- tetragonal crystals.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:58.900
These are crystals that have
a fourfold axis in them.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.950
What percentage have
c greater than a?

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:06.360
This is almost a first cousin
of the cubic crystal or all

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.110
three translations are equal.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:14.110
How many would say more have c
greater than a, fewer have c

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:16.570
greater than a?

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:17.980
One vote.

00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.780
More?

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.640
That's a good answer, but it's
only about 60 some percent.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.450
So let's go down to orthorhombic
crystals.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.950
And orthorhombic crystals
are the ones that have a

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:43.380
brick-shaped unit cell.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:48.426
How many have c greater
than a?

00:52:48.426 --> 00:52:50.340
It's declining.

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:55.475
So if you extrapolate 50/50?

00:52:55.475 --> 00:52:56.357
AUDIENCE: Zero?

00:52:56.357 --> 00:52:58.500
PROFESSOR: Who said that?

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.620
Are you a wise guy?

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.880
You weren't supposed to
give the right answer.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.690
It's 0 percent.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:09.200
It's 0 percent because there's
nothing that makes one

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.180
direction more special
than any other.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.980
So you decide on the labelling
of axes on the basis of their

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.940
relative lengths.

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:22.110
And you, by definition, make
c the smallest axis.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:22.930
Congratulations.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:26.230
To the rest of you, gotcha.

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:28.400
So that's a good note
on which to quit.

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.930
And a few remaining mysteries
of coordinate systems and

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.410
lattices will be expounded
in the

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.660
second half of our lecture.
