00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.740
PROFESSOR: All right, I would
like to then get back to a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
discussion of some of the basic
relations that we have

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.390
been discussing.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.640
We didn't get terribly far, but
I'd like to start with the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.390
Cartesian coordinate system
that we set up.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.410
Rather than using x, y, and
z, I'm labeling the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.990
axes x1, x2, and x3.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.150
And we'll see that the
subscripts play a very useful

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.860
role in the formalism we're
about to develop.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.880
Now, the first thing we might
want to specify in this

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.160
coordinate is the orientation
of a vector and its

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.390
components.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.130
So let's suppose that this is
some vector P. And what I will

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.850
do to define its orientation
is to use the three angles

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.350
that the vector makes, or the
direction makes with respect

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.590
to x1, x2, x3.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.580
And we could define these angles
as theta1, that's the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.950
angle between the direction
and x1, theta2, the angle

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.590
between our direction or our
vector and x2, and finally,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.880
not surprisingly, I'll
call this one theta3.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.040
So the three components of the
vector could be written as P1,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.370
the component along x1 is going
to be the magnitude of P

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.000
times the cosine of theta1.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.080
The x2 component of P would be
the magnitude of P times the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.840
cosine of theta2.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.830
And P3, the third component,
would be the magnitude of P

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.680
times the cosine of theta3.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.450
Now, we will have so many
relations that involve the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.720
cosine of the angle between
a direction and one of our

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.770
reference axes that it is
convenient to define a special

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.820
term for the cosines
of these angles.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.450
So I'll define this as magnitude
of P times the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.400
quantity l1, magnitude of P
times l2, magnitude of P times

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.960
l3, which is a lot
easier to write.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.900
And we will define
these things as

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.150
the direction cosines.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.060
With these equations it's easy
to attach some meaning to the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.740
direction cosines.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.010
Suppose we had a vector of
magnitude 1, something that we

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.790
will refer to as
a unit vector.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.890
And if we put in magnitude of P
equal to 1, it follows that

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:35.880
l1m l2m l3 are simply the
components of a unit vector in

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:52.460
a particular direction along,
obviously, x1, x2, and x3,

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.710
respectively.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.200
Trivial piece of algebra, but
it attaches a physical and

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.870
geometric significance to
the direction cosines.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.490
Now, the vector is something
that could represent a

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.820
physical quantity.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.850
In any case, it is something
that is absolute.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.350
And it sits embedded
majestically, relative to some

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.710
absolute coordinate system.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.030
The magnitudes of the components
P1, P2, and P3 will

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.980
change their values if we would
decide to change the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.690
coordinate system that we're
using as our reference system.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.970
So the next question we might
ask is, suppose we change the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:53.345
coordinate system to some new
values, x1 prime, x2 prime,

00:04:53.345 --> 00:04:55.770
and x3 prime?

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.220
And I'll illustrate my point
with just a two dimensional

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.430
analog of this.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.890
This is x1, and this is x2.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.530
And this is my vector P.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.950
And I change x1 to some new
value, x1 prime, and change x2

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.170
to some new orientation,
x2 prime.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:21.620
Then clearly the component of
P on x1 has changed its

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.070
numerical value if I refer
it to x1 prime instead.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.050
And similarly, this value would
be the component P2.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.440
If I change the direction of x2
and draw a perpendicular to

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.100
x2, this would be P2 prime.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.670
So if I change coordinate system
along the fashion I

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.380
suggested, the three components
of a vector, P1,

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.850
P2, P3, are going to change to
some new values, P1 prime, P2

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.100
prime, P3 prime.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.280
OK.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.860
So the question I'd like to
address next is given the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.240
change of coordinate system, and
given the three components

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.750
of P in the original coordinate
system, how do I

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.670
compute the values of the
new components P1 prime,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.920
P2 prime, P3 prime?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:29.820
I'll say it in words, and then
we'll define a mechanism for

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.350
specifying the change in
coordinate system.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.780
What I'll say is-- and this
was apparent in the sketch

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.710
that I just erased--

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.500
the new component of the vector
P1 prime is simply

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:55.300
going to be the sum of the
components of P1, P2, and P3

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.530
along the new x prime
direction.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.080
So I'm saying that this is going
to be the sum of the

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:13.200
component of P1 along x1 plus
the component of P2 along x1

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:28.950
prime and the component
of P3 along x1 prime.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.980
So in short, I'm doing nothing
more complicated than saying,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.020
I can get the values of the new
components if I take the

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.380
vector P, split it up into its
three parts, and then find the

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.960
component of each of these three
parts along the x1 prime

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.340
access, then do the same thing
for the x2 prime axis, and

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.362
then the same thing
for x3 prime.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:05.490
So I'm going to need, now, a
notation for a change in a

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.060
three-dimensional Cartesian
coordinate system.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:19.670
So here is x1, here is
x2, and here is x3.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.180
And I will change them.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.580
And again, I'm always
keeping the

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.830
coordinate system Cartesian.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.250
So here's an x1 prime, here's an
x2 prime, and then x3 prime

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.520
will point out in some
direction like this.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.978
I don't want a prime on that.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:45.110
So I'm going to say now that the
component of P along the

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:51.500
new x1 prime is going to be the
magnitude of P1 times the

00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:05.500
cosine of the angle between x1
and x1 prime, plus P2 times

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:12.120
the cosine of the angle
between x1 and--

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.030
am I doing this right?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.280
P1 onto x1 prime.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:22.200
And I want P2 onto x1 prime.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.740
So this is going to be the angle
between x2 and x1 prime

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.520
plus P3 times the cosine
of the angle

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.180
between x3 and x1 prime.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.520
Well, we used C's or
l earlier on to

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.490
represent a direction cosine.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:10:14.450
Let me define Cij as the cosine
of the angle between x1

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.670
prime, xi prime, and x sub j.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:31.490
So that means I can write this
expression here in this nice

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.430
compact form.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.890
With our definition of direction
cosines, I can say

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:43.472
that P1 prime is going to be
equal to C1 1 times P1 plus C1

00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:53.490
2 times P2 plus C1 3 times P3.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.610
Can write that P2 prime
in the same way.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:04.340
It's going to be the cosine of
the angle between P2 prime and

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:10.570
P1 and x1, plus the cosine of
the angle between x2 prime and

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:16.680
x2 times P2 plus C2 3 which
is the cosine of the angle

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.710
between x2 prime and x3,
times the component P3.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.420
And in a very similar fashion,
P3 prime will be C3 1 P1 plus

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.215
C3 2 times P2 plus
C3 3 times P3.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.545
So here is the way a vector
will transform.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.190
And we can write this compactly
in matrix form.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:56.580
We can say that P sub i prime,
where this is a column matrix,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:03.920
one by three, is going to be
equal to Cij, a three by three

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.780
matrix times the original
components of the

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.030
vector P sub j.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.570
And just to cement the notation
that we're using, if

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:30.480
I put my old axes up here, x1,
x2, x3, and put the new axes,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:39.100
x1 prime, x2 prime, x3 prime,
down this way, then the cosine

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:47.010
of the angle between the
quantities that are in this

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:53.050
column and the quantities that
are in this row would be C1 1,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:03.820
C1 2, C1 3, C2 1, C2 2, C2
3, C3 1, C3 2, C3 3.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.540
Nothing fancy except
the notation.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.280
It's the description of some
very simple geometry.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.590
This array, Cij, is something
that I will refer to as a

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.190
direction cosine scheme.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.240
Let me pause here and see if
that's all sunk in, whether

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.680
you have any questions
on this.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:13.270
One of the nasty properties of
what we're going to be doing

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.740
for the next month or so is that
the notions are really

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.650
very, very simple, but the
notation is horribly

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.340
cumbersome and complex.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.820
So it takes a bit of getting
used to in application to

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.640
actual real cases before you
feel fully at home with it.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.150
OK.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.850
Just a matter of definition
so far.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.160
Let me note that this direction
cosine array is

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.510
going to be useful for defining
how a vector changes

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.800
as we go from the original
coordinate system to a new

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.120
coordinate system.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:19.040
But this direction cosine array
will also tell us how

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.630
the axes in one coordinate
system are related to the axes

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.210
in the new coordinate system.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.140
It follows from the fact that
the axes themselves can be

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.250
regarded as unit vectors.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:42.350
And we said that the components
of a unit vector

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.590
are the direction cosines of
that vector, relative to a

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.410
coordinate system.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:56.720
So let's ask, what are the new
components of x1 in terms of

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.640
the original axes unprimed.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:08.780
Well, x1 prime is going to be
the unit vector x1 times the

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:16.280
cosine of the angle between x1
and x1 prime, plus the unit

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.940
vector along x2 prime times
the cosine of the angle

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.130
between x1 prime, and x2.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.830
And that's C1 2.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:29.760
Plus x3 regarded as a unit
vector times the cosine of the

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.490
angle between x1 prime and x3.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.580
So we can actually write an
equation for unit vectors

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.480
along each of our new axes.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:45.120
And they will go as C1 1 times
x1, C1 2 times x2, C1 3 times

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:54.200
x3, plus C2 2 times x2 plus C2
3 times x3 times x3 prime.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:01.910
And x3 primal will be C3 1 x1
plus C3 2 x2 plus C3 3 x3.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:08.200
So this, then, is an equation
between the unit vectors along

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.660
the three reference axes in
the new coordinate system

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.329
relative to those in the
original coordinate system.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.829
And the direction cosine
scheme does the job.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.540
OK.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:48.750
We could, using the same
argument, give the array that

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.370
specifies the reverse
transformation.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.120
If we would change our mind, for
example, and say we don't

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.460
like what we've done, let's
write the original coordinate

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.050
system x1, x2, and x3 in terms
of the unit vectors

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.030
along the new axes.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.970
And we can use exactly
the same array.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:13.430
We can say that the original x1,
in terms of the three new

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.520
axes, x1 prime, x2 prime, and x3
prime, is going to involve

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.330
the cosine of the angle between
x1 prime and x1, and

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:28.750
that is C1 1, plus the cosine of
the angle between x2 prime

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:37.250
and x1, and that's C2 1, plus
the cosine of the angle

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.260
between x3 prime and
x1, and that C3 1.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:46.310
If we continue on this, if you
have the idea, the angle x2 is

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.390
going to be given in terms of
x1 prime, x2 prime, and x3

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:55.950
prime, as the cosine of the
angle between x2 and x1 prime,

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.205
and that is C1 2.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.060
Here we want the cosine of the
angle between x2 and x2 prime,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:13.610
and here the cosine of the angle
between x3 prime and x2.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.460
And you can see the way
this is playing out.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:22.900
C1 3 times x1 plus C2
3, x2 prime plus

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.720
C3 3 times x3 prime.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.860
So there's the reverse
transformation, using the same

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.480
array of coefficients as
we did the first time.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.480
So it turns out if we write this
symbolically in a compact

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.640
form, xi prime is given
by Cijx sub j.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.360
And the reverse transformation
using the same direction

00:19:49.360 --> 00:20:05.190
cosine says that xi is going to
be Cji times x sub j prime.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.290
In other words, the reverse
transformation, let's write it

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.900
as Cij minus 1, the inverse
transformation, turns out to

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.950
be simply Cji.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:21.100
And that, in matrix algebra, is
written as the transpose of

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.810
the original array
of coefficients.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:28.730
And transpose is either given by
a squiggle, a tilde on top

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:30.120
of the matrix.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.950
Some people like to use a
superscript T. But we'll use

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.540
this particular notation.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.820
But you can see either
notation used to

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.210
indicate the transpose.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:55.170
The array Cij, which has this
property, and it also has

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.580
another property which I won't
bother to prove, but the

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.240
determinant of Cij
is equal to 1.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.825
And this is something called
a unitary matrix.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.110
Unitary matrix has the property
that the inverse

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:16.665
matrix is the transpose.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.280
We will very, very shortly start
writing down numbers for

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.080
some specific transformations.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.670
And then I think that will give
us a little facility in

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.920
doing these manipulations.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.670
Comments or questions?

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.080
Is this old stuff or old stuff
for which the notation is

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.330
still confusing?

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:58.410
All right.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.670
Let me point out something
that is

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.640
perhaps apparent to you.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.370
And that is that not all nine
of these numbers are

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.350
independent.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.670
There are relations
between them.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.270
And let's point out some
of these relations.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:38.570
C1 1, C1 2, C1 2 represent the
components of a unit vector

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:45.870
along x1 prime, in the original
coordinate system of

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:56.470
the elements in any
row is equal to 1.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:03.010
Because these are the components
of a unit vector.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.160
And the magnitude of
a unit vector is 1.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.580
In the same way, if we look at
any column of terms in this

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:18.700
matrix, for example, C1 1, C2 1,
C3 1, these are terms that

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.100
represent the cosine of angles
between x1 in the original

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.250
coordinate system and x1 prime,
x2 prime, x3 prime, our

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.940
new coordinate system.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.520
So this gives us the magnitude
of x1, but

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.030
x1 is a unit vector.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:39.960
So it follows that the sum of
the column C1 1 squared plus

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.750
C2 1 squared plus C3 1 squared
also has to be unity, because

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:54.070
that gives us the magnitude of a
unit vector along x1, So the

00:23:54.070 --> 00:24:01.190
sum of the squares of elements
in any column of the direction

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:10.420
cosine is unity.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.000
These expressions are useful.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.120
But they have one ambiguity.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.690
That is the cosine of an angle
can be either positive or

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.760
negative, depending on whether
the angle is less than 90

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.710
degrees or greater
than 90 degrees.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.780
These relations involve the
squares of direction cosines,

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.110
and therefore we can't tell
whether the direction cosine

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.860
itself is positive
or negative.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.400
So let me put down a
limitation here.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:01.010
And that is we cannot
tell the sign.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.890
Every time I point this out
to people I wince inside.

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:13.460
Because I once spent two weeks
trying to debug a computer

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.540
program, and it wasn't
working.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.380
And it turns out the reason it
wasn't working properly was

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.010
that I didn't realize that you
cannot tell the sign when all

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.900
you know is the squares of
the direction cosines.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:31.305
So I remember this as a rather
pointed observation.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.440
Happily, there are other
relations among this array of

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.690
coefficients.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:56.610
This row of terms represents the
components of x1 prime in

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.760
the original coordinate
system x1, x2, x3.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:08.030
This row immediately below it
represents the components of a

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.020
unit vector x2 prime relative
to the original coordinate

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:18.170
system x1, x2, x3.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.290
Our coordinate systems
are Cartesian.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:27.960
Therefore, this unit vector has
to be perpendicular to the

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.580
unit vector along x2 prime.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.020
And that means their dot
product has to be 0.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.220
So let me indicate
that this way.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.090
The unit vector along x1 prime
dotted with the unit vector

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.420
along x2 prime has to be 0.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:55.710
And that dot product is going to
be C1 1 times C2 1, that's

00:26:55.710 --> 00:27:02.150
the product of these two terms,
plus C1 2 times C2 2

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.840
plus C1 3 times C2 3.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.460
And that has to be 0.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.890
And this involves only
the first product of

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.390
the direction cosine.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:17.180
So to make it come out 0 when
we add up the magnitudes, we

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.800
will get the sign of the
direction cosine.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.750
So this is a much more
powerful relation.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:28.480
And similarly, the product of
the coefficients in the first

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.470
and the third row have
to add up to 0.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.620
And the second and third
row have to be 0.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.550
So there are three different
relations we can write between

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.970
products of corresponding
coefficients in the rows.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:50.900
So to sum up in words,
the sum of the

00:27:50.900 --> 00:28:00.795
corresponding elements--

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.350
of the product of--

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:32.190
in any pair of rows
of Cij must be 0.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:41.650
But we're not done yet.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:49.680
If we look at the columns in
this array, this represents

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:57.590
the components of x1 relative
to x1 prime,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.410
x2 prime, x3 prime.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:04.410
And these terms here represent
the components of x2 relative

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.110
to x1 prime, x2 prime,
and x3 prime.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.410
And for similar reasons, the
dot product of those two

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.090
vectors has to be 0.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:20.440
So we can say that in addition,
the sum of any sum

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:36.480
of pairs of corresponding
coefficients in any pair of

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:44.980
columns must be 0.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.330
So we're working here on the
direct matrix of the

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.230
transformation.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.970
We've seen that the reverse
relation, the inverse matrix

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:07.830
of Cij is Cij transpose.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:13.290
And therefore the inverse matrix
has to have this same

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:16.840
relationship that the products
of terms and rows or columns,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.990
any pair of rows or columns
has to be 0.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.660
Now, there's one other pair
of relations among the

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:34.260
coefficients, which
is not quite so

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.050
geometrically obvious.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.920
And I won't attempt
to prove it.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.240
I'll just state it.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.820
I said a moment ago that these
are unitary matrices.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.160
The determinant of the
coefficient Cij

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.270
then has to be unity.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:59.190
But interestingly, it will be
plus 1 if one goes from a

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.925
right-handed system to a
right-handed system.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.770
That is to say the set of
axes x1, x2, x3 might be

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:15.730
right-handed.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:19.890
And if the new coordinate system
x1 prime, x2 prime, x3

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:22.450
prime is also right-handed,
then the determinant of

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.850
coefficients is plus 1.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.530
On the other hand, if one goes
from a right-handed system to

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.960
a left-handed reference system
or from a left-handed one to a

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.910
right-handed coefficient,
then, interestingly the

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.040
determinant of coefficients
is minus 1.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.380
So the determinant of the matrix
of the transformation

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.700
is plus 1 if you go
to coordinate

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.900
system of the same chirality.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.190
It's equal to minus 1 if you go
to a coordinate system of

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:49.440
changed chirality.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.580
All right, so to repeat
something I said at the outset

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:06.710
but which you now probably truly
believe, the elements in

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:10.140
the direction cosine scheme
that get you from one

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.460
coordinate system to another
have lots of inter-relations.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:17.140
And all of these coefficients
are not independent.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.036
There are these relations
that couple them.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.480
How are we doing on time?

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:47.080
We mentioned last time that a
large collection of physical

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.060
properties of materials are
properties that relate a pair

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.730
of vectors.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:00.520
So let me, to make this
specific, talk about a

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.205
particular physical property,
electrical conductivity.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:16.130
And electrical conductivity
relates a current density

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:37.715
vector, and that it charge per
unit area per unit time to an

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:40.930
applied vector, and
that vector is the

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:42.180
electric field vector.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:55.250
And the electric field has
units of volts per unit

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.870
length, so volts per
meter in MKS.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:09.850
And provided the electric field
that's supplied is not

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:15.440
too strong, it turns out that
every component of the current

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.280
flow is given by a linear
combination of every component

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.139
of the applied electric field.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:29.170
So the flow of current along
x1 will be given by a

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:35.030
proportionality constant, an
element sigma 1 1 times the x1

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.659
component of the
electric field.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.159
Let me write it out the first
couple of times we do this.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:44.600
Sigma 1 1 times E1 plus sigma
1 2 times E2 plus

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.739
sigma 1 3 times E3.

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:55.340
J2 will be sigma 2 1 times E1
plus sigma 2 2 times E2 plus

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.560
sigma 2 3 times E3.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:06.540
And J3 will be equal to sigma
3 1 times E1 plus sigma 3 2

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.960
times E2 plus sigma
3 3 times E3.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:19.370
Looks formally like the relation
between unit vectors

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.660
that define a coordinate
system.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.340
Number of subscripts is the
same, but actually this is

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.700
something that's completely
different.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.900
It's dealing with vectors
that have some physical

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.150
significance.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:39.620
So in compact reduced subscript
notation, this is

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.646
the definition of electrical
conductivity.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:54.280
This matrix that relates the
electric field vector to the

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.440
current density vector is
said to be a tensor

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.760
of the second rank.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.800
OK, tensor.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.550
First thing you might
say, why do you call

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.350
it a tensor, dummy?

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.030
It's a matrix.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.510
It's a plain old matrix.

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.060
There's a subtle but very
important difference.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.270
A tensor is a matrix
with an attitude.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.040
And I'll make the distinction
clear a little bit later on.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:33.350
But there are tensors
also of higher rank.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:37.810
These expressions where
summation over repeated

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:43.830
subscripts is implied can hide,
as I indicated last

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.080
time, some absolutely horrendous
polynomials.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:55.020
But tensor at very least is a
term that makes the faces of

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.200
all who hear it pale, and makes
the knees of even the

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.930
very strong to weaken.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.010
And in case you don't believe
that, I'll show you what I

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.155
have to wear whenever I
give these lectures.

00:37:09.155 --> 00:37:11.890
And consequently it's kind
of scuzzy and worn out.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.790
But I have to put on
these knee braces

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.100
from wobbling braces.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.620
And you can see what
it says on here.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:23.300
"Tensor." So that's a
consequence of this

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.940
frightening definition
that we've just made.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.890
Let me next set the stage for
what we ought to do next.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:41.220
E sub j represents the
components of an electric

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.980
field, x1, x2, x3, in a first
coordinate system.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.570
ji represent the components
of the current flow in a

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:57.480
coordinate system, x1, x2, x3.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:04.870
If we were to change coordinate
system for any

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.530
reason, these three numbers
would wink on and off.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:09.970
Some might go negative.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.040
The magnitudes would change.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.920
And as a result, the components
of the current flow

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.790
would have to do
the same thing.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.950
Because the components of
these vectors, without

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.860
changing anything physically,
have to change their numerical

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:31.170
values if we refer them to a
new set of reference axes.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.480
If we change coordinate system
and these numbers change, and

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.820
if we change coordinate system,
these numbers change,

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.290
we're still applying field
in the same direction.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:43.540
The current still flows
in the same direction.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.770
But the components
we use to define

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.940
these two vectors change.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.550
And it follows just
algebraically, the elements of

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:57.940
the tensor have to change and
link into different values.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.590
It follows automatically.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.040
So a question, then, is that
if we have a coordinate

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.990
system, x1, x2, x3, and we
change it into a new

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:15.056
coordinate system, x1 prime, x2
prime, x3 prime, then j sub

00:39:15.056 --> 00:39:19.690
i changes to some new values,
j sub i prime.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:24.960
E sub j changes to some new
values, E sub j prime.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.360
And therefore, of necessity,
sigma i j, the conductivity

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:35.690
tensor, has to change to new
values sigma ij prime.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.730
So I'll let you rest up to
brace yourself for this.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:44.190
The question is, how can we get
sigma ij prime, the nine

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.360
elements of the tensor in the
new coordinate system, in

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.660
terms of the direction cosine
scheme that defines this

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.160
transformation and in terms of
the elements of the original

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.710
conductivity tensor?

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:01.300
And this, my friends, is what
makes a tensor a tensor and

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.440
not a matrix.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:09.850
I can write a matrix for you,
a really lovely matrix.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.560
Let's put in some
elements here.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:21.750
Let's put in 6.2, square root
of minus 1e, and 23.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:30.590
And as other elements, I'll
put in pi 23.4, 6, and 0.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.830
It's a perfectly good matrix.

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.500
It's just an array of numbers,
any numbers, real or

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.540
imaginary, or whatever I like.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.790
So this is a matrix.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:51.430
What a tensor is, is a matrix
for which a law of

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.055
transformation is defined.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.880
And that's what makes
a tensor a tensor.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.420
What does it mean to take this
two-by-four matrix that I just

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:16.890
wrote down?

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.240
How do I transform that to a
different coordinate system?

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.660
It's meaningless, just
an array of numbers.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.270
It's an array of numbers that
has some useful properties,

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.230
like matrix multiplication
and the like.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:30.910
But to talk about transformation
of this set of

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.430
four ridiculous numbers to a
new coordinate system is

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.590
something that's absolutely
meaningless.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.910
Not so for something like
conductivity or the

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:43.310
piezoelectric moduli or
the elastic constants.

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.550
These change their values.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.130
There's a law of transformation
when we go from

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.380
one Cartesian reference
system to another.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.895
So what we will do when and if
you return is to derive a law

00:41:58.895 --> 00:42:02.440
for transformation for
second-rank tensors, and then,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.810
by implication, look at
higher-rank tensors and decide

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.920
how they would transform.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.920
But why would you
want to do this?

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.860
Why would you want to muck
things up and have to worry

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.530
about transforming
these numbers?

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.200
Well, let me give you just
one simple example.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:25.790
Suppose we had conductivity
of a plate, of a crystal.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.880
And what would you do?

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:34.140
You'd measure it relative to a
set of axes, which, if you

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.020
have a little fragment
of crystal, you have

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.100
no reference system.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:44.590
So say that the axes x of i
are taken relative to the

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:51.700
lattice constants of the
material, so relative to the

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:58.540
edges of the unit
cell, possibly.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.710
Then you decide that this
material really has some

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.890
useful properties, and you would
like to cut a piece out

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:13.270
of it so that you get a plate
for which the maximum

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:19.650
conductivity in that plate
is in a direction

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.330
normal to the plate.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.450
So you know just what sort of
plate you want to cut out.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:26.480
You know what the direction
cosines are.

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.820
But once you've cut a plate from
the crystal, the tensor

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.860
relative to the old axes, x1,
x2, x3, is not going to be

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.970
terribly useful.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:39.720
You're going to want to find the
tensor relative to this as

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.040
one set of axes, and these
perhaps as a new set of axes

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.570
within the plane of the plate.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:48.730
So there's a good example.

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:54.350
Cut a piece from a crystal and
cut that piece so that the

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.180
extreme values are along
x, y, and z for the

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.420
new coordinate system.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.840
Then you will be faced with the
necessity of transforming

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.330
the tensor from one coordinate
system to another one.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.150
Or you might measure the thermal
conductivity tensor.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.120
You might want to cut a rod out
of the material so that

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.930
the maximum conductivity
or the minimum thermal

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.380
conductivity is along the
direction of the rod.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.310
You might want to use that as a
push rod to hold a sample in

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:26.360
position and not have it be
a big heat sink for the

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.340
temperature that's inside
of your sample chamber.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.480
So I've hopefully convinced
you that there are lots of

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.010
cases where it would be
necessary and convenient to

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:42.100
transform the tensor that
describes a property to a new

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.350
coordinate system.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.770
All right, so let us
take our break now.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:55.130
Some internal clock always tells
me when it's five of the

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.560
hour, unless I get really
excited about something.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.360
And it is indeed
that time now.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.610
So let's stop.
