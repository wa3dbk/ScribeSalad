00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.470
PROFESSOR: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.590
Let me just remind
you where we are.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.120
We're describing
interaction between

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.820
the electromagnetic
field and atoms.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.620
And we had formulated
an exact approach

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.730
using the time evolution
operators and diagrams.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.200
And well, I think
we understood what

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.830
it means when atoms in
the ground state emit

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.730
photons which are virtually
absorbed and all that.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.960
So we figured out what is
really inside this formalism

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.450
and what are the processes.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.710
What we want to continue
discussing today

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.230
is one problem which you
often have such approaches.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.010
And this is the
problem of resonance.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.160
If you have a
perturbative treatment,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.600
even if you carry
to infinite order,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.860
you have, formally,
divergences if you

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.450
have resonant interaction.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.000
Because the ground
state and the photon

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170
has exactly the same energy
as the excited state.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.660
And that means if you write
down the perturbative expansion,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.650
you have a 0 in the denominator.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.730
You have a divergence.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.430
And I reminded you that
in a phenomenological way,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.570
you've seen that this
problem can be "fixed"

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.840
by adding an imaginary
part to the energy level

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.340
just saying, well,
the excited state

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.330
couples by spontaneous emission
to the radiation field.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
And the level has [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.490
Well, but you know, sometimes
putting an imaginary part

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.072
into Schrodinger's
equation means

00:01:58.072 --> 00:01:59.655
it's no longer unitary
time evolution.

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:01.350
It has its problem.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.950
But anyway, we want to
now look deeper into it.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.030
I want to show you
what are the tools

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.840
to treat those infinity
source divergences

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.450
in a consistent and
a systematic way.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.580
And one hint how we have to
do it comes by simply taking

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.200
this energy denominator and
expanding it in gamma, simply

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.420
a Taylor expansion in gamma.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.990
And then, we realize
gamma is often

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.100
calculated in second
order Fermi's golden rule.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.000
But since you have
here all orders n,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.400
that tells us that
doing something here

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.292
probably means infinite orders
in a perturbation series.

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:48.000
And that's what I want
to show you today.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.710
I want to show you that I
can go beyond this result.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.330
But I can reproduce
this result by going

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.920
to infinite order in
perturbation theory.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.750
And it means to sum up an
infinite number of diagrams.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.930
Who of you have
actually seen those kind

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.080
of diagrammatic
tricks and summation?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.660
A few, OK.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.220
So it's maybe nice
to see it again.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.110
But for those who
haven't seen it,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.030
welcome to the
magic of diagrams.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.200
I learned it from
those examples.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.115
And I really like it.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:26.050
It's a very elegant way
to combine equations

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.470
with graphical manipulations.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.510
So that's our agenda for at
least the first part of today.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.320
And OK, we want to
understand the time

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.770
evolution of this system.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.060
Our tool is a time
evolution operator.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.880
And at the end of
the class on Monday,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.600
I told you, well,
let's simplify things.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.900
Let's get rid of those
temporal integrations

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.760
and multiple integrals by simply
doing a Fourier transform.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.820
Because a Fourier
transform turns an integral

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.000
or convolution into a product.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.020
And so therefore, we introduced
the Fourier transform,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.620
or the Laplace transform, of
the time evolution operator.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.250
And this iterative equation
where we get the nth order

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.510
by plugging the n
minus first order

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.250
on the right hand side,
this iterative equation

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.950
turns now into a simpler
algebraic iterative

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.980
equation for the
Fourier transform.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.040
So this is now the starting
point for our discussion today.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.880
We want to calculate the Fourier
transform of the time evolution

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.350
operator to infinite orders.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:55.760
So let me-- well, of course,
any questions before I continue?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.410
So unfortunately, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.690
We should copy this equation.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.730
Because we need it.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.645
So OK, we want to
take this equation.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.775
And now we want to iterate it.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.730
So the resolving G
in 0's order is G0.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:49.420
Now plug G0 into the right
hand side of the equation,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.030
and you get the first
order, which is G0VG0.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.130
Now plug that into the end
of the iterative equation,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.720
and you get the second
order, G0VG0VG0.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.160
I think you've got the idea.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:14.300
It's almost like a
geometric series--

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.220
well, a geometric
series with operators.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.933
But this is already
sort of a hint.

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:23.890
A geometric series can be summed
up to infinity rather easy.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.396
So we have to introduce
now the eigenfunctions

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.660
of the unperturbed operator.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.810
So these are, let's say, the
ground state, excited state,

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.770
next excited state of
your favorite atom.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:57.010
And they have
eigenenergies Ek-- nope.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:17.640
So if you are now expressing
the equation above in the basis

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.230
kl-- so in other words,
this is an operator,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.090
and we want to know
the matrix element

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.760
between eigenfunctions k and l.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.750
The other thing we
need is that G0.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:39.120
Remember the Fourier
transform-- and I

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.990
gave you sort a mini
derivation here-- is just 1

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:54.900
over energy minus H. And if you
apply that now to the operator

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:02.480
G0, so G0 is nothing
like-- is given by that.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.055
So therefore, if you
write now this equation

00:08:06.055 --> 00:08:11.940
as matrix elements,
the first part, the G0,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.490
gives us 1 minus
1 over Z minus Ek.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.470
And since we are diagonal
in H0, it's delta kl.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.700
And well, now you
see the structure

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:37.250
if you sum over
intermediate states,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.264
or if you introduce
intermediate states.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.700
So this is how we
have to write it.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.635
So this is just writing
it down in basis function

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:53.770
of the unperturbed operator H0.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:09:01.360
But now we can formulate the
problem we are encountering

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.010
and we want to solve.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:10.030
Namely, we have the
problem with one state.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.340
Our problem is the
excited state b.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.980
And we have a
resonant excitation

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.930
from the count state a.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:32.640
So this is a discrete eigenstate
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:39.080
with energy Eb.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:55.780
And therefore, we have terms,
and actually divergent terms,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:02.840
which are 1 over Z minus Eb.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.380
And just to make
the connection, this

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.170
is sort of the description that
book Z is in the complex plane

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.080
and can have imaginary values.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.410
Sometimes, scattering
and evolution equations

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.960
are better formulated when you
do it in the complex plane.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.740
It doesn't really
matter for us here.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.000
Just remember, Z is the energy.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.030
And it is the initial energy.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.340
And the initial
energy is if it's

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.240
a ground state and a resonant
photon, we have a problem.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.260
Because the denominator is 0.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:47.300
So in other words, for
resonant excitation,

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.260
we are interested
in the case that Z

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.500
is on the order of
this close to Eb.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:09.750
OK, so what we
want to do now is--

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.160
and this is the basic idea.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.420
By looking at this
formally, exact calculation,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.410
we say the difficult parts are
those where we have this energy

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.970
denominator, which vanishes.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.940
The other parts are simple.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.610
They don't have any divergences.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.820
They are not resonant and such.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.710
So what we want to do
is now, in some way,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.570
we want to sort of
give special treatment,

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.570
factor out the
problematic terms.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.610
And the rest is easy.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.360
And for the easy part,
which has no divergence,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.320
we can make any kind
of approximation

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.250
we want without
altering the physics.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.490
But the resonant part, this
needs special attention.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.239
Because if I treat it
literally in those expressions,

00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:57.780
they don't make
sense mathematically.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.615
Because they cause infinities.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.660
I could continue to do it
completely algebraically.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.380
But because I think it's
just beautiful method,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:21.390
I want to look at this equation
and write it down in symbols.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:35.290
So we want to arrive at a
diagrammatic representation

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:41.640
for this matrix element
of the resolvent Gbb.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:51.230
And I use symbols where the
circle means the interaction.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.440
The straight line stands for
the term which is problematic,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.720
which has resonant-- the
resonant interaction has

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.410
the divergent denominator.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:13.600
And then, I'll use a dashed
line for all other terms,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.270
all other intermediate
states, where i is not b,

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.480
and therefore there
is not a problem.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.270
It's not resonant.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.395
We don't have a divergence.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:31.350
So I'm just sort of-- you
see the structure of the sum.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:38.655
We sort of propagate here.

00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:41.420
We make a transition
from l to k.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.990
And then, we propagate here.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.160
So in this kind of order,
you start in this state,

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.127
you have a vertex, you go to the
other state, you have a vertex,

00:13:49.127 --> 00:13:50.960
you go to the next
state, you have a vertex.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.170
This is how the system works.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.280
This is sort of what quantum
mechanics does for you.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.420
And what we're going to do is,
this is an algebraic equation.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.000
And now we want to order
them in the following way.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.830
We want to figure out
which of those expressions

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.710
include this problematic term
exactly twice or three times

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.010
or four times.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:23.170
So we regroup those infinite
sums, these algebraic terms,

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.550
in such a way that
we say, OK, which

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.970
one has the occurrence of
this once, twice, three times,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:29.810
four times?

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.350
So we regroup the terms, and
then we see what we can do.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.460
Now, I've picked the
matrix element Gbb.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.020
So that means over
here and over here

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.130
we start out in the state b.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:59.490
So if I write down
all terms which

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:10.070
contain this
resonant term twice,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.040
well, we start with
a resonant term.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.320
And we have to end
with a resonant term,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.910
because we have
the matrix element

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.790
Gbb, which I'm focusing now on.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.625
And so there can be one vertex.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.320
We can start with this term.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.110
And now we can do
something else in between.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.290
But we are not allowed to
go back to the state b.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.330
Because we are only
looking at terms

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.720
where the solid
line appears twice.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.930
So therefore, this can only be
a dashed line, another state.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.720
We can go through two vertices.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.150
But it can only include
dashed lines in between.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.980
So let me use another
symbol for it.

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:08.120
So we start with that state.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.260
We end with a state b.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.830
But in between, we can sort
of once, twice, three times

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.750
go through other
intermediate states.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.950
But we never are allowed to
create another divergence.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.470
And this infinite
sum over all other

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.660
states-- I don't know
how to calculate it yet.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.580
But I'll just call
it a square box.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.510
So in other words, what is
sort of in lowest order,

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.560
the operator V, with these
other infinity terms,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.210
I symbolize that kind of much
more complicated vertex, which

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:47.650
includes an infinite sum, by
a square and not by a circle.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.360
So diagrammatically--
feel free to write it down

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.170
mathematically.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.890
It's obvious how to do it.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:17:06.490
The square box is the circle
plus all terms like this.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:16.359
Let's go back to equations.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:20.480
We call this the
function Rb of Z.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.310
And what I've shown
in diagrams above

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:30.510
is nothing else than the
circle Vbb, the matrix element

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.010
of the interaction.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.980
But now we have
sums where we're not

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.830
allowed to go through
the resonant state.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.445
We have to go from b to
an intermediate state.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.590
We propagate in the
intermediate state.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.860
And then, we have to go back.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:01.820
And it's clear how to
go to higher terms.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.720
So we've just defined
this function R

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.554
by focusing on two occurrences
of the straight line.

00:18:10.554 --> 00:18:15.060
Well, let's look at
higher order terms.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:26.750
What happens when Z minus
Eb, the divergent term,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.140
comes to the power n?

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.160
Well, we just dealt
with n equals 2.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.365
Let's now look at n equals 3.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.032
Colin.

00:18:39.032 --> 00:18:41.000
AUDIENCE: I'm trying
to find the definition.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.024
Is the box a T-matrix
or the S-matrix?

00:18:45.024 --> 00:18:48.300
What's the definition
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:49.430
The S is--

00:18:49.430 --> 00:19:01.920
PROFESSOR: No, the
T-matrix is actually

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.150
the matrix, the relevant matrix,
of the time evolution operator.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.210
And if you factor out the delta
function for the energy shell,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.880
you get the S-matrix.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.580
But we're not talking about a
time evolution operator here.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.620
We're talking about
the Fourier transform.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.620
And we're looking at
the resolvent, which

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.960
is the function G. And now,
we've introduced a function R.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.080
I actually tried to
look up-- I wanted

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.840
to use the correct
word in class.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.110
I couldn't find the name.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.270
In the book, it's just
called the function R.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.660
So it is the function R.
And the function R turns out

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.350
to be the kernel of the
resolvent G. But none of it

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.720
is the S-matrix and T-matrix.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.550
It is related.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.310
Because if you do the inverse
Fourier transform from G,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.217
we go back to U.
And then, we have,

00:19:46.217 --> 00:19:47.300
I would say, the T-matrix.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.560
AUDIENCE: This is
the self energy?

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.730
PROFESSOR: We will find that R
has a real and imaginary part.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.800
One is a self energy,
and the other one

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.110
is a decay rate, has
an imaginary part.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.830
But the real part will
be the self energy.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.350
Yes, we connect a
lot of passwords

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.320
you may have heard
here and there.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.480
OK, the question is, do
we have to now define

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.575
pentagons and hexagons?

00:20:14.575 --> 00:20:18.500
Do we have to find
more and more symbols

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.530
for more and more
complicated sums?

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.820
But the nice thing is no.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:29.770
Because n equals 3 means we
have to start in state b.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.890
We have to stand in state b.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.490
And one time in
the time evolution,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.710
we can go through state b.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.450
And now, between that, we
can go from here to there

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.580
with any combination
of states you want.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.730
But one thing is not allowed--
to involve the state b.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.650
Because we are focusing on three
occurrences of the state b.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.000
And everything else
other than the state b

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.350
has already a symbol.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.020
It is the square symbol.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:05.010
So this is the exact
representation for n equals 3.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:13.710
And the contribution
to the resolvent

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.870
G, the Fourier transform of
the time evolution operator,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.890
is-- well, we have factored out
three occurrences of the state

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:23.390
b.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.500
And then, we have three
occurrences of the state b.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.450
We need two square boxes.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.010
But the square box
has already a name

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.090
and an algebraic definition.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.580
So this is nothing
else than-- I think

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.120
it's called the
kernel Rb squared.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.290
OK, I've shown you n equals 2.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.430
I've shown you n equals 3.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.070
I assume it's now absolutely
clear how to continue.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.980
It just involves
more and more power.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:09.310
So the lowest order is that.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:15.570
And whenever we ask
what happens when

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:21.690
we allow more appearances of
the state b, for each of them,

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.210
we obtain another square box.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.310
So by looking at the
terms which are bothersome

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.420
and regrouping
the infinite terms

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.370
according to one occurrence,
two occurrence, three

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.920
occurrence of this
divergent denominator,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:53.810
we have now found an exact
expression for Gb of Z.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:56.830
And since this is now
an algebraic equation

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.800
with a geometric series,
we can write it exactly

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:18.420
as this minus Rb of Z.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:22.220
Well, like with
every exact result,

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:24.140
you have to ask, what
is the use for it?

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.640
Because we started
out with U, which

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.180
we couldn't calculate
with Fourier transform.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.400
We had G, which we
couldn't calculate.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.900
And now we've expressed G in
R, which of course we cannot

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.950
calculate exactly.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.860
But there is an importance.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.935
We have made progress for
the following reasons.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:24:06.570
Namely, the first is that
those resonant terms, which

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.120
appears in the time evolution
whenever the system goes back

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.650
to the state b, is now
fully accounted for.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.640
We have sort of factored
those terms out.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.330
We've given them
special treatment.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:26.480
And therefore, and this is the
main result, the exposition

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.210
which now is the non-trivial
expression, the function

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.160
of the kernel, has
no divergences.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:51.700
And therefore, because there
is no critical part to it,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:25:07.880
rather simple
approximations can be made

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.400
and lead to physically
meaningful results.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.530
That's an idea you may
see often in physics.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.040
You have a theory whether
it's something complicated,

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.710
non-perturbative divergence.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.130
But you just rewrite the
theory, transform the equations

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.740
in such a way that
structure of the equations

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.400
now accounts for the
physics behind it.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.630
And the part which has
to be calculated now

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.390
can be calculated with
crude approximation.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.950
And you still get the
correct physics out of it.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.320
The structure of the equation
accounts for the physics.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.420
And the numerical part
has become very harmless.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.050
But what it does is even if
you do now a lowest order

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.830
approximation to
the function R, even

00:25:54.830 --> 00:26:03.360
those very simple
approximations correspond

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:11.666
to an infinite number of terms
in the original expansion.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.160
Or in other words, the message
is, you have an expression.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.460
And if you do a perturbative
expansion-- well,

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.230
maybe you should do some form
of perturbative expansion

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.230
not to the whole expression.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.450
You should do it
to some denominator

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.280
or to some part of
the denominator.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.590
Because then, the
perturbative expansion

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.775
involves no divergent
terms and can be performed.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:57.660
So therefore, we are
now in a position

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:11.580
to make approximations
to the function R.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.730
And the simplest
approximation which we can do

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:23.030
is we can just try to
see if we can get away

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.380
with very low order.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.690
It's maybe not getting
into any divergences here.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:34.940
And let me call this
now the triangle.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.540
So the circle was the
naked interaction.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.260
The square would be
the exact function

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.810
if you sum up those
interactions to all orders.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.990
And the triangle is now,
well, the step in between.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.108
We hope to get away
with a triangle.

00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:52.610
So that would mean
the following,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:28:06.130
that the exact formulation
involved-- let me get black--

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.005
had a propagator.

00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:14.480
The state b has to go
through multiple squares.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.470
This is how it propagates.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.810
This would be the exact
result after the resummation

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.300
we have done.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:43.140
And an approximate result
is now that the squares

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.915
are replaced by triangles.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.670
So that's pretty neat.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:55.330
But the importance comes now
when I pull things together,

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.810
I want to show you
what we have exactly

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.720
done for treating an
atom in the excited state

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.440
and for treating
light scattering.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.540
So in other words,
that's our result.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.050
We have derived it.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:20.420
I just go now and apply to
an excited atomic state.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.820
So the state we
are interested in

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.850
is the atomic state
b and no photons.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:46.640
And the property
of the atomic state

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.250
is obtained when we know
the function Gb of Z.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:57.280
Just to tell you what it means,
this is the time evolution

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.920
operator when we
Fourier transform,

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:12.540
an inverse Fourier or Laplace
transform, which is a contour

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.360
integral in the complex plane,
a generalization of the Fourier

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.800
transform.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.940
This would take us then
to the time evolution

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.720
for the atom in state b.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.540
So this is now the diagram
matrix element of the T-matrix.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:48.269
And this is the matrix element
between state B0B0 and the time

00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:49.060
evolution operator.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.130
So we are calculating,
of course,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.970
the Fourier transform of the
time evolution of the state

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:05.520
b by the Fourier transform
through the resolvent G.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.950
And all the work we have
done with our diagrams

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.500
means instead of
calculating G, we

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:20.790
are calculating the
kernel of Z. And if you

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:32.030
use the lowest second
order approach, then

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:48.600
diagrammatically-- just give me
one second, photon was emitted.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:17.390
Yeah, sorry, so the
process we have considered

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.700
is that we go to second order.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:31.335
We can go through an
intermediate state,

00:32:31.335 --> 00:32:34.540
can say, absorbing it and
meeting a virtual photon.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.150
That's what two vertices mean.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.390
At the first vertex,
the photon appears.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.890
At the second vertex,
the photon disappears.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:49.000
So that means now that we,
with this approximation,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.890
approximate Gb of Z, the Fourier
transform, the resolvents,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.990
in the following way.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.570
We let b just propagate,
which is problematic

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.850
because this has divergences.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:07.440
But we are allowing
now the state b

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:15.190
to go through
intermediate states a.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:26.070
And remember, since this
appears in the denominator, that

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.850
means for G, just make
a Taylor expansion in R,

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:34.770
that it has this
process to all orders.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:41.320
So that propagator, the
sort of propagation G,

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:54.970
involves now all
possibilities that we

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.580
have to end up in state b again.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.020
But we can go through
intermediate states

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:08.449
a or a prime as
often as we want.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:11.130
Or actually, we
have summed it up.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.040
Our results contain those
processes to infinite order.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.159
So the question is,
what have we neglected?

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.510
I mean, that looks like a lot.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:27.290
We allow the state b to emit
a photon, go to another state.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.110
It's reabsorbed and such.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.200
So the question is
now, what is neglected?

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.690
So what we neglect
is actually a lot.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:45.150
In this lowest order
approximation for the function

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:51.179
R, we approximated
R by second order.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.650
We have only two vertices.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.640
So what we neglect
are all processes

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.050
where we have not
just two vertices

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.850
and one intermediate
states, where

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:16.370
we have several intermediate
states between two

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:23.850
occurrences of the state B0.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.420
Or diagrammatically,
what we have neglected

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:30.445
is-- let me just
give you an example.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.430
So what we have neglected
is we have to always start

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.270
with a state b, and we
have to end with a state b.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.280
But now the idea
was that-- one, two,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.780
let me just go
through four vertices.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.545
The approximation
we have done-- you

00:35:50.545 --> 00:35:52.920
have to sort of look through
that maybe after the lecture

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.730
and see that that's
what we've really done,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:36:01.380
but trust me-- is that when the
system goes away from the state

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.940
b into an intermediate
state a, at

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.350
the next vertex it has to
go back to the state b.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:13.190
So what we have not
included is processes

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:18.980
where we go through states
a, a prime, a double prime,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.500
and then eventually we
go back to the state a.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:28.700
Or we have not included
processes where we scatter,

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.790
absorb.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.090
This is a state a.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.930
But then, we don't go back to b.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:34.640
We go to a prime.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.020
Then, we scatter again.

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.685
Here we are in state
a double prime.

00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:41.610
And then, we are back in b.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.620
So in other words, we have said
whenever something happens,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.640
and we go away from
state b, the next vertex

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.610
has to go back to state b.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.890
This is the nature of the
lowest order approximation.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:59.960
We have included
to infinite order

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.840
all processes where the
state b emits a photon,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.810
reabsorbs it, emits
and reabsorbs it.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:14.280
But the system cannot go sort
of two steps away from the state

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:14.780
b.

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.650
It's only one step,
and then go back.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.316
This is the nature
of the approximation.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:37.020
OK, so our result
for this kernel,

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:52.945
which describes the state b,
is we have-- just go back,

00:37:52.945 --> 00:37:53.820
let you see it again.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.190
I'm writing now for you down
the equation for the triangle,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.380
which is an interaction
V, an intermediate state,

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:14.390
and another interaction V, which
is nothing else than Fermi's

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:21.690
golden rule where we-- well,
with a little twist-- have

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.330
the initial state.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.020
The dipole interaction or
the [? p.a ?] interaction

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.040
takes us to an
intermediate state

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:35.420
with a photon with [INAUDIBLE]
and polarization epsilon.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.060
We propagate in the
intermediate state Ea.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.410
And now we have to go back.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.609
But we have to go back with
the same matrix element.

00:38:52.609 --> 00:38:54.400
So therefore the matrix
element is squared.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:10.420
And we have a double sum.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.480
We sum over all possible
states of the photon.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.230
And we can sum over all
intermediate atomic states.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.400
Yes, so this is
what we have done.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:37.540
This expression has in general
a real part and imaginary part.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:48.410
It's a function of
the initial energy E.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.150
And it has an imaginary part.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:09.460
Yes, let me now
interpret it in two ways.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.850
But before I do that,
are there any questions?

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.406
Yes.

00:40:12.406 --> 00:40:13.376
AUDIENCE: Just
mathematically, how do you

00:40:13.376 --> 00:40:14.792
get an imaginary
part out of this?

00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:16.894
It's all real
components, because we

00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:20.062
have magnitude squared
divided by, presumably,

00:40:20.062 --> 00:40:25.660
the energies real and so on.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.680
PROFESSOR: OK, this
is now something

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.570
to do that we have
resonant terms.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:44.910
And what we often do is we
add an infinitesimal eta,

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.540
and then let eta go to 0.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:53.060
And it's the same if you
have the function 1 over x.

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:58.280
And look at a real part
and imaginary part.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.460
It needs a little bit
of correct treatment

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.175
of functions in
the complex plane.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.770
Let me actually write it down.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.686
Then it becomes clear.

00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:11.120
But yes, thanks
for the question.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.625
So I always said, we
do a Fourier transform,

00:41:14.625 --> 00:41:17.060
but it's a Laplace transform.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.600
We do a Fourier
transform at real energy.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.805
But if you do an
integration along when

00:41:21.805 --> 00:41:23.690
you do the Fourier
transform, you

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:25.530
have to integrate over omega.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.620
But the function we integrate,
the time evolution operator,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.160
has poles in omega.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.150
So we can't just
Fourier transform.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:34.570
Because we go right
through the poles.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.210
But what we can do is we can add
an imaginary part plus or minus

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.040
eta.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.480
And we can just go
around the poles.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.990
And then, it becomes
mathematically meaningful.

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.790
And what we're doing here
is-- but I'm not really

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:49.651
explaining it
mathematically-- we

00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:50.900
have played those tricks here.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:58.860
But I hope it becomes
clear if I say

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.740
what the real and
imaginary parts are.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:13.140
So the real part is
this matrix element

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:29.260
squared, but double sum.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.350
But what we use is the
principle part of it,

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.080
which is well defined in the
theory of complex functions.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.519
And it's divergent, but you
take a certain symmetric

00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:44.310
limiting procedure.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.790
So you have to
interpret that as-- you

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.340
have to introduce a limiting
procedure to make sure

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.120
that the divergence cancels out.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.250
And the imaginary part, value of
the imaginary part of something

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:05.230
which diverges-- and if you
treat the eta correctly,

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.910
let the eta go to 0, you will
realize that the imaginary part

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.260
turns into a delta function.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:27.110
So what we get is
2pi over H bar matrix

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:30.930
element squared times
the delta function.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:36.500
So that's something
which you have seen.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:41.625
So the imaginary part gets
us Fermi's golden rule.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:52.400
And the real part has
actually-- remember

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.800
when we discussed
the AC Stark shift.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.600
The AC Stark shift has a 1
over [INAUDIBLE] dependence.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.950
And you recognize that here.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.970
So this is actually nothing
else than the AC Stark

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:16.190
shift not due to a laser beam,
but due to one photon per mode.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.710
Because we started with an
atom in an excited state.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.910
It can emit a
photon in any mode.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.980
And this photon is now
creating an AC Stark shift.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.920
And this is mathematically
the expression.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:32.910
And such AC Stark shifts
which appear as self energies,

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.300
as energy shifts created
by the state, this

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.170
is nothing else than
the famous Lamb shift.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.708
So that's what we get out here.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:58.780
I have already--
do I in this sum?

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:07.950
What we have here is
we have this function R

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.720
in the real and imaginary part,
which depends on the energy E.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.420
But remember, we worked so
hard with diagrams to make sure

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:20.670
that the triangle-- first the
square, and then the triangle,

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:22.500
and this is what
we calculate here--

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.190
has no resonant structure
at the energy Eb.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:32.270
So therefore, we can neglect
the energy dependence of that

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:38.975
and simply replace the
argument E by the energy

00:45:38.975 --> 00:45:44.130
we are interested in,
namely energies close to Eb.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:50.860
So in other words, when we had
the function, the resolvent Gb

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:56.540
of Z, all the dependence on
energy came from this kernel.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.902
But this kernel is now
so well-behaved, there

00:45:59.902 --> 00:46:02.680
are no resonant terms, that
we can neglect its energy

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.180
dependence.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.210
This actually has a name
which we will encounter later

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.320
when we discuss master equation
and optical Bloch equations.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:22.990
So this replace, neglect
E and set, or replace

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:25.630
the dependence by E,
by taking the value

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:34.160
at Eb, this corresponds to
the Markov approximation.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.300
The Markov approximation
often means

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:47.420
that some relaxation time
or some response of a system

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.350
is replaced by delta function.

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.400
Well, we've done the same here.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:58.240
Because if you replace some
temporal response function

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.830
by a delta function, that
means the Fourier transform

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.710
becomes constant.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:06.180
And by neglecting the
energy dependence,

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.430
we are now saying everything
is constant as a function

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.059
of energy.

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.600
And that means in
the temporal domain

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.047
that we have a delta function.

00:47:12.047 --> 00:47:13.380
I don't want to go further here.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.340
But when we talk about
the master equation,

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.480
we will also make a
Markov approximation

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.280
later on, but then in
the temporal domain.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.020
And the two are equivalent here.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:33.850
So what we've got
now is we found

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:40.340
a solution for the Fourier
transform of the time evolution

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:50.330
operator, which initially
had a divergence at energy b.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.950
And this was the
problem we are facing.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:57.220
But by now, calculating
the function R,

00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:05.080
we have a correction, which
is a radiative shift, which

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.330
comes from the real part.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:14.620
And we obtained, as
promised, the imaginary part,

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.750
which we can approximate
by Fermi's golden rule.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:25.700
If we now Fourier transform back
and obtain the time evolution

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:37.360
of this state, it no longer
evolves with the energy Eb.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:44.480
It has a shifted energy
by this self energy.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:54.350
And this is called
the radiative shift.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:49:03.060
But in addition, because
of the imaginary part,

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.585
it has now an exponential decay.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:14.010
And you should now-- well, this
is what we may have expected.

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.810
But there are two
things you should learn.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:21.960
The first thing is that
the exponential decay

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:27.410
would be different if we had not
made the Markov approximation.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:36.900
If we had kept a dependence of
this imaginary part on energy,

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.840
the Fourier transform
would not have simply

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.570
given us an exponential.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.900
So therefore, the
exponential decay

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.510
involves an approximation
that the R function

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.240
has no energy dependence.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.130
And you would say, well,
is that really possible?

00:49:56.130 --> 00:49:58.690
If you have an
atom, and it decays,

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:04.790
or you have the atom in state
b, at very, very short times

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:07.840
you need Fourier
transform elements

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.870
of large amounts of energy.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.470
So maybe for the first
femtosecond for the time

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:18.320
evolution of an excited
state, you need whatever,

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.110
a whole X-ray
spectrum of energies.

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:24.740
And it's obvious that the
properties of this expression

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.030
where you sum over
all states, something

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:31.190
will happen when you go
past the normal excitation

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:34.090
energy or the ionization
energy of the atom.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:36.100
So what you can
immediately read form here

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.940
is that exponential decay
is a simple approximation.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:41.330
It works very well.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.910
But at very early times,
it will break down.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.900
Because then, the energy
dependence matters.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.400
But the longer you wait-- if
you wait a few nanoseconds,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.120
the Fourier transform, the
relevant part of the Fourier

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:03.850
transform, is only a small
energy or frequency interval

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:06.050
around the resonance energy.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.220
And then, the density of
states of your photon field

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.250
is pretty much
constant around here.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:14.230
And then, this
approximation is excellent.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.510
So I hope what you have
learned from the treatment

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.970
is number one, where the
exponential decay comes from.

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.280
Of course you knew that
from coupling to all modes,

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:31.140
but that the approximation
which leads to exponential decay

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.870
would also involve
the density of states

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.300
and the density of
modes is constant,

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.380
which is excellent
for certain times

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.400
but which is of course
violated at early times.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:54.150
And finally, if we hadn't
done the infinite summation

00:51:54.150 --> 00:52:02.080
of diagrams, if we had done
a perturbative expansion,

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:08.530
we would have never
obtained exponential decay.

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.410
We would have obtained
some polynominal decay.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:32.770
Questions about that?

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:36.840
Yes.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.049
AUDIENCE: What is the
polynominal decay?

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.670
PROFESSOR: Some power law.

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:58.120
1 minus the time--
as far as I know,

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.450
it would just
involve powers of n.

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:06.080
If you do lowest order
perturbation theory,

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.610
instead of getting
an exponential decay,

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.680
you would just get
a linear slope.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.000
That's perturbation theory.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.710
And if you fix it, I think
you get quadratic terms.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.980
So it's the sum of power loss.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.000
Of course, an
exponential function

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.120
has a Taylor expansion,
which is an infinite sum

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.390
of polynominal terms.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:31.077
And therefore, we need infinite
order to get the exponential.

00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:32.910
So it's not really
profound what I'm saying.

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.451
It's pretty much an exponential
function is non-perturbative.

00:53:37.734 --> 00:53:38.400
Other questions?

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.120
So let me wrap up this chapter.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.570
What we have discussed
here is-- I haven't really

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.940
discussed resonant scattering.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.600
I've now focused
on the function Gb.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.510
I focused on what
happens to the state b.

00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:07.140
But this is-- and this is
what I want to show you now--

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:11.780
the only element we need to
discuss resonant scattering.

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.270
So when we have an atom
in the ground state,

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:31.530
and a photon comes along, and
it takes the atom to the excited

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:45.250
state b, then we go
back to the same state--

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.290
could be also another state--
by emitting a photon k

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.560
prime epsilon prime.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:57.860
And the relevant matrix element
of the time evolution operator,

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:08.860
which is the T-matrix, involves
now the matrix element,

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:22.590
the initial energy minus
the intermediate energy.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.300
And the critical
part is really--

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.900
you can do it mathematically.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.090
I just show it
here as a summary.

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.210
The critical part is really
the propagation of the state

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.300
b, which is problematic.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.840
But we have now learned,
and it transfers exactly

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.560
to the light scattering
problem, that we

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:50.870
have to include now radiative
shifts and an imaginary part

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:58.330
for the decay to
the time evolution.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:09.110
And that means that this diagram
here for light scattering

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:19.590
has been-- we have
added other terms to it.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.640
And the other terms
are, of course,

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:28.780
that when we scatter light of
an excited state like this,

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:36.080
the excited state can sort of
emit photons and reabsorb them.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:45.480
And it can do that to--
so we go to that state.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.600
It can do that to
infinite order.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.250
So in other words,
for any problem now

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.550
which involves
the excited state,

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:05.240
we replace the 0's order
propagation of the state b.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.430
And mathematically, it means
we replace this function

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:15.260
by the resolvent, which
we have calculated

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:24.960
by doing an approximation
to the kernel R. Questions?

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.211
AUDIENCE: Question, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:29.211 --> 00:57:31.175
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:57:31.175 --> 00:57:32.648
AUDIENCE: Is this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:38.135 --> 00:57:39.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
OK, what happens

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:57.120
is if you're off-resonant,
you don't have a problem.

00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:01.710
This extra term delta and
gamma, the radiative shift

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.940
and the line widths
only matter when

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.530
the black term is close to 0.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:12.100
If you have a large
detuning delta here,

00:58:12.100 --> 00:58:15.900
then the small shift in the
line widths don't matter.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:20.550
So everything we have
done by correcting

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:22.760
the naked propagation
of the state

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.470
b by the correct propagation
with this infinite emission

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:29.280
and reabsorption
of virtual photons,

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.750
this is only needed if
the denominator is 0.

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.600
And then, we have to figure
out what else happens.

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.630
And what else
happens is obtained

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:40.940
in higher order with this
non-perturbative treatment.

00:58:48.579 --> 00:58:49.245
Other questions?

00:58:54.540 --> 00:59:09.680
OK, 20 minutes left.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.980
So we now change gears.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.280
We move onto the
optical Bloch equation.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.360
But let me give you one summary
on this chapter of diagrams.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.020
Until maybe 10, 15
years ago here at MIT,

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.790
we were not teaching that.

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:35.520
And I felt often in
discussion with students

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.840
that a little bit more of a
complete picture behind atom

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:43.180
photon processes is needed.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:48.140
What I summarized could of
course cover a whole semester

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.780
course in QED and how
to do calculation.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:56.250
And if you're interested
in mathematical rigor,

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:59.180
the green book,
Atom-Photon Interactions,

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.520
is pretty rigorous and
still very physical.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.970
But on the other
hand, many of you

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:06.740
experimentalists,
I think you should

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.740
have sort of this picture
behind it, what really happens,

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.700
what kind of emission
processes are

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.757
responsible for which effect.

01:00:14.757 --> 01:00:16.215
And at least this
is sort of for me

01:00:16.215 --> 01:00:20.480
a take-home message which
I hope you can enjoy even

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:27.990
without mathematical rigor,
that the fact that the excited

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:32.490
state has [INAUDIBLE] really
comes from an infinite number

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:37.250
of absorption, of emission
and reabsorption processes.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.650
So you should maybe
think about when

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:43.870
you take an atom to
the excited state

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.220
that the excited state does more
than just absorb the photon,

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:50.090
the atom is excited,
and then it emits.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:53.230
The real nature of
this state is that it

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:54.800
couples to many, many modes.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.180
It emits photons
and reabsorbs them.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:01.820
And you can often neglect
that in the simple description

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.110
of your experiment.

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:09.360
But if you take certain
expressions seriously,

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.320
they would have divergences.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.170
And that's what we discussed
without this infinite number

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:17.692
of processes which happen.

01:01:17.692 --> 01:01:19.900
Of course, yes, the whole
other regime which I should

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.030
mention-- and this is
when you can completely

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.840
neglect the coupling
to many modes.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.880
If you do Rabi oscillation
with resonant interaction,

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.300
you don't need all that.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.640
Because then, you're really
looking at discrete states.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.970
So it really also depends
what you want to describe.

01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:37.040
If you do cavity
QED with an atom,

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.540
you have the
Jaynes-Cummings model.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:41.570
And you have an exact solution.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:43.630
Then you have a
similar mode problem.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:46.030
But here we have
discussed what happens

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:48.540
if you want to scatter
light in free space.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.609
And then, you have to deal with
the divergence of the excited

01:01:51.609 --> 01:01:52.109
state.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:16.420
OK, the next chapter is called
Derivation of the Optical Bloch

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:16.920
Equation.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:36.660
And yes, what we really need
for a number of phenomenon

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:41.800
in AMO physics for laser
cooling, light forces, and much

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.850
more are the optical
Bloch equations.

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:48.660
But what I try in this
chapter-- to give you

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:53.300
sort of the fundamental
story, the profound story,

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.800
the fundamental insight behind
the optical Bloch equations.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.450
Because what the optical Bloch
equations are is the following.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:04.530
We want to describe
a quantum system.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.570
But the quantum system is
coupled to the environment.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.380
And that means we
have dissipation.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.240
And this is something
which is not easily dealt

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.410
with in simple quantum physics.

01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:24.200
Because a simply quantum
system undergoes unitary time

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.930
evolution described
by a Hamiltonian.

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:31.800
And unitary time evolution does
not allow entropy to increase,

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.610
does not allow energies
to be exchanged.

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.570
So a lot of things which
happen in our experiments

01:03:37.570 --> 01:03:41.580
and in daily life come because
the system we are looking at,

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:44.760
it follows
Schrodinger's equation.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.020
But it is coupled to
a much bigger system.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.060
And so in this
section, what I want

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.860
to address at the most
fundamental limit is, what

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.400
is the step where we go
from reversible equation,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.880
unitary time evolution, to
something which is called

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.990
relaxation, which
is dissipative,

01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:07.330
where entropy is increased?

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:10.500
And the step, of course,
is we go from pure states

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.910
to statistical operators.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:13.950
We describe the big system.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:16.100
But then, we focus
on the small system.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.580
And I want to show you,
first with a simple example,

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.070
but next week in
more generality,

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:27.610
how this completely
changes the nature

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:29.650
of the description
of the small system.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:33.150
A small system which
I just described

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.410
by Schrodinger's equation,
now follows the density matrix

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:41.960
equation, has relaxation, the
entropy increases, and such.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.880
So to maybe set the stage,
one of the simplest systems

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:51.890
we can imagine is the
Jaynes-Cummings model,

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:59.480
that we have an atom
in a cavity interacting

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.930
with one mode of
the radiation field.

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:07.650
And in this cause in part
one, we've dealt with it

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:10.250
and looked at vacuum Robi
oscillation and a few really

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:12.040
neat things.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:16.210
But what happens is that the
system is an open quantum

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.950
system.

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:21.560
You can have
spontaneous emission.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:28.390
And if your mirrors are
not 100.00% reflectivity,

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.490
some light leaks out.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:35.135
So in other words, we have
coupling to the environment.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.470
Of course, we can say
we simply describe it.

01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:56.040
We have our atoms,
maybe the one mode

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:04.750
plus the one mode of the
electromagnetic field.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:15.070
And then, we have
the environment,

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:17.780
which may consist of photons
which are leaking out

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:20.900
and photons which are
spontaneously emitted.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.700
So this is our system.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:29.390
And of course, if you write
down the total Hamiltonian

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:33.630
and do the time
evolution, something

01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:36.970
will come out which,
in general, is

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:40.200
very complicated,
very entangled.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.610
The atom is entangled.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.320
The atom moving to
the left side is

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.840
entangled with a photon which
was emitted to the right side.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.890
And the recall of the
photons push the atom.

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:52.160
So you have to know, to keep
track of all the photons, which

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.140
have been scattered in
the lifetime of an atom.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.620
So you can do that.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.240
And you do that by
propagating the system

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.130
with its total Hamiltonian.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:10.120
But often, what
we do is we simply

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.370
put the photons in a trash can.

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:13.080
We trash them.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.910
We're not interested in
what the photons are doing.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:16.297
We're not keeping track of them.

01:07:16.297 --> 01:07:18.380
Actually, they hit the
wall of our vacuum chamber,

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:22.160
and we couldn't even
keep track of them.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.380
The vacuum chamber has
taken care of them.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.820
So all that we are
interested in-- how do we now

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.240
describe the atomic system?

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.660
What, after the time
evolution, is now

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.630
the density matrix
of the system?

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:39.615
Of course, if we use
the full description,

01:07:39.615 --> 01:07:41.490
we know the initial
state of the environment.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.470
We know the initial
state or our system.

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:47.230
We propagate it exactly with
the correct time evolution,

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.260
we get everything.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.220
And then, we could reduce
by doing a partial trace.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:55.020
We could reduce the description.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.710
What is now the
probabilistic description

01:07:57.710 --> 01:08:00.270
for density matrix of the atom?

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.620
But this is rather complicated.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:08.080
What we want to do is we want
to do it as a derivation.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.290
But in the end, we want to
have a formulation which simply

01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:16.160
tells us, what is
the atomic density

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:25.439
matrix as a function of the
initial atomic density matrix?

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:29.109
So in other words, all that
happens with the environment--

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:31.939
that there's initial state,
that it gets entangled,

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:36.189
and then we neglect maybe not
keeping track of the photons--

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:39.300
we're not interested
in all of that.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.920
We really want to focus on
what happens to the atom.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.779
How does an initial
state of the atom

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:49.670
propagate into a final state?

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.630
And this is done by
optical Bloch equations.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.120
This is done by the
master equation.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.800
So the master
equation, you can see,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.620
focuses on the relevant part
of the system, maybe just

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:01.859
a single atom.

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:04.529
And we can neglect
the million photons

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:05.870
which have been emitted.

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.029
But those million
photons which have

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:09.850
been emitted into
the environment,

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:12.500
they change, of course.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.380
They change this density
matrix of the atom.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.569
And if you find a description,
the master equation

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:24.970
is including with extra terms
what those photons have done.

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:26.710
Maybe this sounds very abstract.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.729
But in the end, you will
find that maybe photons which

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.080
emitted produce some damping.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.500
Or if you put atoms in
molasses, the atomic motion

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.420
comes to a standstill.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.090
So in other words,
we want to develop

01:09:39.090 --> 01:09:42.859
a systematic approximation
scheme for the master equation

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:46.240
whether effect of all these
many, many degrees of freedom

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.379
can maybe be simply expressed
by a few damping terms.

01:09:51.379 --> 01:09:52.170
So that's the idea.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:36.180
So yes, you know already one
example of a master equation.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:46.320
And these are Einstein's
rate equations,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.440
which we have discussed in
the first part of the course.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.830
If you have a two
level system which

01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:59.150
is coupled to the
radiation field,

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.930
then we obtained
equations that the rate

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:05.920
of change of the
ground state population

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.730
is related to the
excited state population

01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:12.990
through spontaneous emission
described by the Einstein e

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.020
coefficient.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.130
And if you have a
spectral density

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:28.290
of the electromagnetic field,
it causes stimulated emission.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:39.556
And it causes absorption
described by the Einstein b

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:40.055
coefficient.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.830
And you have a similar
equation for the excited state.

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:57.890
So this is clearly the
semi-classical limit

01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.400
of what we want to accomplish.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.500
But we want to know more.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.360
We really want to
know not just, what

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.460
is the rate equation
for the atom?

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:11.560
We want to know, you can
see, the wave function.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.160
Well, wave function slash
statistical operator--

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.700
the statistical
operator contains

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.790
all information of
the wave function.

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.397
And if the wave function
is a pure state,

01:12:20.397 --> 01:12:21.980
it has a certain
statistical operator.

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:24.670
And we can find the pure state.

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:26.050
So that's what we want to do.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.650
But sort of just
genetically, we really

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:33.410
want to find the full
quantum time evolution.

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:36.810
And now I just want
to express that.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.510
We have to be careful.

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:42.650
The time evolution
as a Hamiltonian,

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.350
if you now bring
in the environment,

01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:52.920
cannot be simply included
by adding an imaginary term.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:59.355
This here violates the
unitary time evolution.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:12.400
In other words, when we find
an equation for the quantum

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.930
system, how it evolves,
it's not that everything

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.460
you think which
phenomenologically works will

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.160
work.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.030
It has to be consistent with
the loss of quantum physics.

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:28.690
In other words, when we find an
equation for the statistical--

01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:33.690
if you find an equation which
describes the atomic system,

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:36.610
it will be a requirement
that a density matrix

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:38.500
turns into a density matrix.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.510
So certain structure
has to be obeyed.

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:44.250
And that is actually
extremely restrictive.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.530
And our derivation of
the master equation

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:52.190
will actually show what
kind of operators applied

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:56.335
to the atomic density
matrix are consistent, are

01:13:56.335 --> 01:13:58.620
quantum mechanically consistent.

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.020
This is actually
something-- well,

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.370
we're not doing a lot of
equations or work today,

01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:08.070
so let me rather be
a little bit chatty.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:12.470
This is actually something which
is the frontier of our field,

01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:15.910
both in theory in ion traps
and with neutral atoms,

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.870
that we have some evolution
of an atomic system

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.880
by coupling it to
the environment.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.380
Well, the usual environment
you can think of

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:28.350
is just taking photons away.

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:31.750
It gives us a damping
term of the excited state.

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.650
But now you can
ask the question,

01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:36.330
can you construct
an environment which

01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:38.840
has some degrees of freedom
with laser fields, RF

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.760
fields, and such?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.660
You call it the environment,
and this environment

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:46.710
does something really fancy.

01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:48.310
And the system
comes in equilibrium

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.300
with the environment.

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.970
But could you engineer
the environment

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:55.620
that the system comes
into equilibrium

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.870
with the environment, and
it is in a fancy super fluid

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.960
or fancy entangled state?

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.230
So can you engineer the
environment in such a way

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:09.480
that it does something
really fancy to your system?

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.770
Well, you can dream of it.

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:15.865
But you dreams are restricted
by the mathematical structure

01:15:15.865 --> 01:15:19.000
of all possible master
equations in the world.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.710
Because the environment
cannot do everything for you.

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:31.370
The environment
can only do for you

01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:35.690
what can come out of all
possible Hamiltonians.

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:38.440
And the fact that
the total system

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:42.060
evolves in a unitary way
with the total Hamiltonian

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:45.320
of the system, this
is really restricting.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.660
This operator sort of stands for
all possible master equations.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:50.710
It's restricting
the master equation

01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:53.830
for your atomic density matrix.

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:55.693
There was just-- I
think was it this year

01:15:55.693 --> 01:15:59.940
or last year-- a nice
science and nature paper

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:03.300
by [INAUDIBLE] where
they engineered

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.040
the environment around
ions in an ion trap.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.670
And that stabilized
the ion in the state,

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:13.760
which was an unusual state,
not what the normal environment

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.400
would have done.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.590
So anyway, what
I will be telling

01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:21.200
you is also sort of
relevant to understand

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.020
this sort of frontier
in our field which

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.510
is called environment
engineering.

01:16:37.890 --> 01:16:46.020
OK, density matrix--
good, five more minutes.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:17:08.500
So what we have is
we have a system.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.420
And we have this environment.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.350
And what we are exchanging
with the environment

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:20.760
is both energy,
but also entropy.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:32.500
And so when we transfer
energy or heat,

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.660
there is a corresponding
change in energy.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:41.450
And it's a general property
of all quantum systems.

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:44.610
It's a consequence of the
fluctuation dissipation

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:47.250
principle, the fluctuation
dissipation theorem,

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:51.140
that you cannot have any form
of relaxation without noise.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:17.830
So for instance, when we
discuss optical molasses--

01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:21.170
we do that in a few weeks, where
the atomic motion is damped--

01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:23.290
well, you have a damping term.

01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:26.050
It seems it brings some
motion through friction

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:27.540
to a standstill.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.600
But we know by
general principles

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.220
that damping is not
possible without noise.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.400
So when somebody sells you a
wonderful damping scheme which

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.460
damps the motion, you
should always ask,

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:38.510
but there must be noise.

01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:40.150
What is the ultimate noise?

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:42.650
And it's fundamental
that it is there.

01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:46.400
So therefore, our derivation
of the master equation

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.750
will also display
that, that we do not

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:53.870
get any form of damping without
at least the fundamental

01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:56.250
quantum noise.

01:18:56.250 --> 01:19:08.930
So what we need is we need
a description of the quantum

01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:13.360
noise, which comes from
coupling to the environment.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:28.830
The tool which we use for
that is the density matrix.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.700
I assume everybody here is
familiar with the density

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:38.560
matrix.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.750
The atomic lecture
notes on the wiki

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:46.170
have a small tutorial
on the density matrix

01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:51.380
if you want to freshen up your
knowledge about density matrix,

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.620
maybe read about it.

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:55.070
I don't want to
cover it in class.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.740
The one thing we need, and
I just want to remind you,

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:16.470
is for all density matrices,
you can always unravel it.

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:22.360
The density matrix
can be written

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:30.005
as a probabilistic
sum over states.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:39.040
This will actually
play a major role.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.165
We will make certain
models for damping.

01:20:43.165 --> 01:20:45.210
And it's really beautiful.

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:49.150
On Monday, I will give you
the beam splitter model

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:50.505
for the optical Bloch equation.

01:20:50.505 --> 01:20:51.500
I really like it.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.080
Because it's a
microscopic model.

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:58.440
And it shows you a lot of
fundamental principles.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.320
But the important
part is whenever

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.215
we have a way to construct
a density matrix by saying,

01:21:05.215 --> 01:21:07.420
we have certain
quantum states k,

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:10.600
and we just add them
up probabilistically,

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.730
this kind of microscopic
interpretation of the density

01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:15.740
matrix is called unravelling.

01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:19.770
It's sort of writing it
as a specific diagonal sum

01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:20.800
over states.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:26.860
But those unravellings
are not unique.

01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:28.745
They describe one possibility.

01:21:28.745 --> 01:21:31.660
But there are other
possibilities.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:42.240
And the one example
which I can give you

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:45.540
is that if you have a
density matrix like this,

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:52.820
you can write the density
matrix as this form suggests,

01:21:52.820 --> 01:22:02.240
as a probabilistic sum of
being in the state 0, 0,

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:09.350
or in the state 1, 1 with
probability 1/4 and 3/4.

01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:17.070
But you can also write it as
being with equal probability

01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:30.130
in two states a and b
where the states a and b

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:37.420
are superpositions
of state 0 and 1.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:49.390
And you can see by inspection
that this will do the trick.

01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:52.020
So we'll talk a lot about
unravelling of the density

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:52.520
matrix.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.936
That's why I want
to say up front,

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:57.385
that the same density
matrix can be thought

01:22:57.385 --> 01:23:02.710
of as being created by
different processes.

01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:06.150
But this actually makes
it even more powerful.

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:08.810
Because we have a unified
description, or even

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:11.505
an identical description,
for different microscopic

01:23:11.505 --> 01:23:12.005
processes.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.835
OK, any last questions?

01:23:19.605 --> 01:23:23.200
Well then, let's enjoy the open
house with incoming graduate

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.940
students, and I'll
see you on Monday.
