00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.650
PROFESSOR: Before I
continue with the material,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.830
I want to show you at least
the title of a recent paper

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.260
in Nature, because it's
related to material

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.450
we have covered in this course.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.630
It's about the Kerr
effect, the effect

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.520
that one photon can create a
phase shift for another photon.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.540
And one goal, of course,
for quantum computation

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.310
where things are
about single photons

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.760
is to have a
single-photon Kerr effect

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.800
that one photon can change
the phase of the other photon

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.390
in a strong, noticeable way.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.750
So maybe one photon should
create a phase shift

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.620
on the order of pi.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.760
And this was reported
here in this paper.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.960
Of course, the non-linearity
created by nonlinear crystals

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.850
is much too weak for that.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.176
But what those authors did is
they used microwave photos,

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:30.330
had microwave photons
into cavities.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.320
And they were coupled
through a sapphire substrate

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.330
with a Josephson junction.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.840
So the non-linearity
here is the non-linearity

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.390
of a Josephson junction,
which is actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.260
realized with a
superconducting qubit.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.394
I can't explain you
many more details,

00:01:47.394 --> 00:01:48.810
but I just thought
it sort of cool

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.122
to see how the Kerr
effect, which we discussed

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:54.830
and which we discussed
for single-photon,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.770
is realized, at least
in the microwave domain.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.290
And also, just sort
of to illustrate

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.220
that I hope this course enables
you to read recent research

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.630
papers, what those
people measured

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.680
is a [? key ?] representation.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.750
This is a coherent state.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.800
And then they showed, and this
is the subject of the paper,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.980
that the coherent state which
has a well-defined phase,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.470
lost its phase through
the Kerr medium.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.450
And you clearly see there
is a big phase uncertainty.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.460
But then after certain
time-- this is experiment

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.380
and this is simulation--
there is a re-phasing,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.030
and the phase is back.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.280
There is a revival of
the coherent state.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.030
All right.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.370
Now I want to address
one question which

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.410
Cody asked about the g2
function and fluctuations

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.140
of single-mode light.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.630
Let me just summarize.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.880
I told you that if you
do the thermodynamics

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.010
of a single mode, we find
Bose-Einstein distribution

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.860
of photons.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.870
And we have a
thermal distribution.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.270
And a thermal distribution means
sometimes we have more photons,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.480
sometimes we have less
photons, depending

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.150
on the thermal distribution.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.810
And when we calculated what the
intensity fluctuations were,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.290
we found they're characterized
by a g2 function of 2.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.750
OK.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.810
Then a little bit later
in this course-- actually,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.180
just this week-- I told you
that single-mode light always

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.470
has a g2 function of one.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.630
And what I meant here is the
following, rather trivial.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.420
If you have a single mode,
that means that you [? align ?]

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.620
[? it ?] is simply
e to the i omega t,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.130
the intensity is constant.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.170
There are no intensity
fluctuations.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.950
And also, because everything
is sort of predictable,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.589
it's just one wave.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.790
The Gn function
factorizes into-- can

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.870
be re-expressed by
the g1 function.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.290
So therefore, this is
the most trivial case.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.120
But the question
now is, how do we

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.700
reconcile those two statements,
that a single mode, e to the i

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.960
omega t, does not have
intensity fluctuations?

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.950
Therefore, is a g2
function of one.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.990
And our earlier treatment
about single-mode black-body

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.810
radiation.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.450
And of course, the
answer is, what

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.190
is the single mode
in one context

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.310
is different from the single
mode in the other context.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.910
Maybe let me explain that.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.490
Let's just create an
ensemble of cavities.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.010
We put them in thermal
contact with a reservoir.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.270
And then we break the thermal
contact with a reservoir.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.230
Each cavity has now a
perfect single mode, e

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.020
to the i omega t.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.470
But each cavity is filled
with a different photon number

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.730
according to the
thermal statistics.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.965
So therefore, if you
just look at one cavity,

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:21.815
we find no intensity
fluctuations.

00:05:21.815 --> 00:05:23.850
The g2 function is one.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.360
But if you extend
the ensemble average

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.350
over all the
different cavities, we

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.700
find that there are
fluctuations in intensity.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.900
Well, we can now
keep that in mind.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.970
But now we can say,
well, let's just

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.960
take one cavity which is weakly
coupled to a thermal reservoir.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.040
And instead of looking
at the ensemble average

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.000
of many cavities, we look
at the long-time average

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.350
of this one cavity.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.770
And what will happen is thermal
photons will be created,

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.250
will disappear, and such.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.040
So now this one
cavity fluctuates.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.070
But technically,
what that means now

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.140
is it means that the
sharp mode of the cavity

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.500
is interacting with
the environment,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.680
and it becomes broadened.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.750
It has a broadening delta omega.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.110
And this can be
regarded as that we

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.680
mix in modes of the environment.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.070
So in that case,
strictly speaking,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.720
it's no longer a
single-mode cavity.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.050
So you have to
consider those things.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.090
And depending what point
of view you want to take,

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.470
you get the different result.

00:06:40.564 --> 00:06:41.230
Other questions?

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.060
Then let me ask you a question.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.590
Last class, I explained
to you-- well, at least,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.150
tried to explain to you
that g2 function for bosons

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.110
and fermions with the
counting statistics,

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.020
with permutations and such.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.510
I wasn't sure, at
least from one question

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.991
I got, whether this
was completely clear.

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.490
Do you have any
question about that?

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:13.294
[? Teroy. ?]

00:07:13.294 --> 00:07:14.710
AUDIENCE: This
seems very obvious.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.480
But during class, I
was trying to something

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.040
with thermal state.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.980
What is the definition
of our thermal state

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.695
in terms of any basis,
just generally speaking?

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:25.820
We write it as-- I thought
it'd be something like e

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.365
to the minus beta
light Hamiltonian.

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:29.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.450
So our definition of
the thermal state--

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.670
when we had thermal
light, we say

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:43.370
that the statistical
operator is given by that.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.560
And H is the Hamiltonian
for a single-mode light,

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.920
which is n plus 1/2 nn.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.920
Well, with suitable
parentheses and summations.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:09.545
Other questions?

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:13.940
OK.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.900
Then let's get to the main
subject we want to discuss now.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.900
And these are actually
Feynman diagrams.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:35.799
I wanted to give you
an exact definition

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.299
and a deep
understanding, what does

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.390
it mean when we talk about
processes of absorption

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.500
and emission, but also about
absorption, emission processes

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.820
which violate energy.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.440
And some people refer to
them as virtual photons.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.480
The reason is that virtual
photons cannot really exist

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.490
for a long time.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.040
When you emit a virtual
photon, another photon

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.950
has to be absorbed immediately
to reconcile energy

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.560
conservation, as we
want to see in a moment.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.980
So the goal of this
presentation is

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.320
I want you that you realize
that each of those doodles

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.610
has an exact
mathematical meaning.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.465
Each of those diagrams
represents one term,

00:09:28.465 --> 00:09:32.660
or a class of terms,
in an exact solution

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.780
for the time evolution
of the system.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:49.870
So in other words,
if you would ask me,

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.360
we have a ground
and excited state.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.210
Is it possible that the
ground state emits a photon,

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.860
goes to a virtual state,
emits another photon

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.400
of another frequency, and then
somehow absorbs the photon,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.300
goes to here, and eventually
takes another photon,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.700
and is back to the ground state.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.200
Is that a possibility?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.900
Can that happen?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.330
And I think what
the message here

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.130
is yes, everything happens.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.790
The system is trying out
all of its possibility.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.820
And the two time
evolution is the sum

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.500
of all those possibilities,
of all the amplitudes related

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.270
to those diagrams.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.750
But what I want to show you
is how sort of the weirder

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.480
the diagrams get, the more you
go in energy below the ground

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.150
state, the more you go away
from real atomic states,

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.390
the bigger is your
energy denominator.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.930
And that means
those diagrams have

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.840
a smaller and smaller weight.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:57.120
And in all practical
calculations, we neglect those.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.030
But I want you sort of to be
able to see that and realize,

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.920
I exactly know what it means.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.800
It means this and this
term in a summation

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.802
over all the amplitudes
which the quantum

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:08.635
system is exploring.

00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:13.690
And I think with that, we really
learn something about physics.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.830
We learn about what is
actually inside the Schrodinger

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.120
equation.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.990
A lot of people actually,
before they take this class,

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.460
think that this
is just nonsense,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.060
that this has no
physical reality.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.000
But I hope after
this class, you see

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.770
that pretty much everything
you draw has physical reality.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.580
It's just-- it may
not contribute a lot.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.600
So what we have done--
and let me just start here

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.660
and invite your questions.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.340
We have figured out how
an initial state evolves

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.810
with a time evolution operator
to another basis state,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.640
toward the final state.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:06.090
And formally, this is the formal
solution and exact solution

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.220
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.491
We have to sum over all orders,
orders in the interaction.

00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:16.130
Well, I will
immediately tell you

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.000
what is the first
and second order.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.310
We are not going much higher.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.170
But if you want, here, you can.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.980
And then what you have to
do is in the time evolution,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.540
you have to sum over
intermediate times.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.910
You have to allow the system to
propagate, to change its state,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.260
propagate again,
change its state again.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:40.080
And the times where the
change of state happens,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.570
that can happen at any
time between your initial

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.900
and your final time.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.470
And we integrate over
all possible times.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.060
And I showed you--
and I think this

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.520
was the very last thing
we did on Wednesday.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.390
I showed you how
this diagram can

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.754
be translated into
mathematical equation.

00:13:02.754 --> 00:13:04.670
And I think I picked the
second order diagram.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.000
But I think from the way how I
presented should be clear now

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.580
how any such diagram can be
translated into an equation.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.010
And eventually, you have
to perform an integral

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.647
over all intermediate times.

00:13:17.647 --> 00:13:19.855
And this is part of the time
evolution of the system.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.530
Questions about that?

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:28.920
AUDIENCE: We allowed these
to be [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.860
Because we haven't done
anything with that?

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.110
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.800
I assume that it's
time-independent.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.620
Actually, right now, I assume,
just to assume something,

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.430
that it's a dipole interaction.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:52.080
My understanding is if it has
an explicit time dependence,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:58.530
it would just appear there,
and it would not change the--

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.600
would it?

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.440
Wait, would it?

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.030
Actually, when be derived
the differential equation

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.930
for the time evolution
operator, did

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:13.250
we assume that v was
time-independent or not?

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.150
I don't think we did.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.440
We integrate over time.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.100
I think the formal solution.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.100
Remember, I wrote down
the differential equation

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.974
for the time evolution
operator and then say,

00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:28.140
this is a formal solution.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.910
My gut feeling is
nothing changes

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.990
when v is time-independent,
but this one step

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.284
should be confirmed.

00:14:35.284 --> 00:14:35.950
Other questions?

00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:41.250
OK.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.790
Then let me just spend a few
minutes on connecting what we

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.000
have done with standard
first and second

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.700
[? auto-perturbation ?] theory.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.720
I want to sort of throw
a few definitions at you.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.810
S-matrix, T-matrix.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.130
But I'm not really
going into any details.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.520
I just want to sort of wrap
up the perturbative treatment

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.100
by connecting it with the
standard first and second

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.040
[? auto-perturbation ?] theory.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.195
But after that in
a few minutes, I

00:15:12.195 --> 00:15:15.650
want to have a discussion
about the nature

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.680
of intermediate and
so-called virtual state,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.600
and then talk about the
interaction v, whether it's

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.725
d, dot, e; or the p
minus e interaction.

00:15:28.725 --> 00:15:29.225
OK.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.050
So far, I've presented
the formalism

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.050
that we started in initial
time and ended at final time.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.250
But usually, these
are microscopic times.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.910
And in the
experiment, we observe

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.460
a system for macroscopic time.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.610
So for that purpose, we
usually go to the limit

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.685
that initial and final
times are infinitely apart.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.210
And that actually means we
have energy conservation.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.550
The initial and final
energy has to be the same.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.450
And that can be, for instance,
even if you restrict ourselves

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.110
to second order, remember we
had all those propagators,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.270
e to the i energy
over H bar times t.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.060
And when we integrated
over long times,

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.200
it will just average
out to zero unless

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.672
the initial and final
energy are the same.

00:16:23.672 --> 00:16:25.130
And technically,
you have seen that

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.535
in undergraduate derivation
second order perturbation

00:16:27.535 --> 00:16:28.610
theory.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.650
You integrate the
exponential function.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.700
And eventually, for
sufficiently long time,

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.320
capital T is the
difference between

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.700
initial and final times.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.630
It approaches the
delta function.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.840
So that's how energy
conservation comes in.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.480
So the fact that we
have energy conservation

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.990
is then used to
define s and T-matrix.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.970
The transition amplitude from
the initial to the final state,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.500
what we have just
calculated and discussed,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.170
is called the S-matrix.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.890
It's just how it is called.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:15.140
In first order, of
course, the time evolution

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.970
is the unitary matrix.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.960
So therefore, we get
[? conical ?] delta.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.619
And then we discussed that
in the limit of large times,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.550
we have a delta function.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.670
So therefore, if we
take the S-matrix, which

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.350
is the transition amplitudes
we have calculated,

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:39.430
and sort of take out of the
S-matrix, the unity matrix,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.690
and factor out the delta
function, then what is left

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.500
is the so-called T-matrix.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.200
When we talk about transition
amplitude, transition

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.420
probabilities, we
are asking, what

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.600
is the probability
that the system

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.340
has gone from an initial
state, maybe the ground--

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.660
the excited state
to the ground state

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.620
through spontaneous emission?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.400
Well, probability is
an amplitude squared.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.640
So we take the matrix element
of the S-matrix and square it.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.130
And from the line
above, this is now

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.310
involving the matrix element
of the T-matrix squared.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.370
There's a delta
function which becomes

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.620
a delta function squared.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.540
But if you integrate over all
final states, that's-- I mean,

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.940
a delta function is always
requiring that you do some

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.870
integration later.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.360
Otherwise, the delta
function doesn't make sense.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.490
The delta function squared.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.480
You can actually explicitly see
from the sine function above.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.370
The delta function squared
just turns into the time t.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:54.530
So therefore, if you divide
the probability by the time,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.290
we have our transition
probability.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.690
We have our transition rate.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.761
And what we obtain is the
second order expression

00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:05.260
for the transition rate, which
is essentially Fermi's Golden

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:05.760
Rule.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.110
So anyway, this
is just finishing

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:27.430
the formal derivation.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.930
But now I want to
discuss the nature

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.420
of those intermediate states.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.690
And maybe what you
should have in mind--

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:42.300
the intermediate state, which
comes about when we have

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.670
the system in the ground
state, it emits a photon

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.660
and goes down to this
intermediate state,

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.530
or this weird state which
seems to be lower in energy

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.280
than the ground state.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.850
Well, what happens is those
intermediate states, when they

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:08.900
appear after the vertex, they
propagate with the energy.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:18.564
But if their energy is less
than the initial energy,

00:20:18.564 --> 00:20:22.400
here, the energy-- the
intermediate state k

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.190
has a phase factor
in its propagation

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.380
which is determined by the
difference of its energy

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.070
with the initial energy.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.550
So when we violate
energy conservation

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:40.660
in intermediate state,
delta Ek is non-zero,

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.680
and it is the larger, the more
we violate energy conservation.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:50.160
And then in the solution
of the time evolution,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.140
we have to integrate over
all intermediate times.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.140
So what we have here is we have
an oscillating phase vector.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.460
And when we integrate it,
when we integrate something

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.530
oscillating over longer
than an oscillation period,

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.240
it averages out to zero.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.070
So therefore, those
intermediate states

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.590
which are off the energy shell,
which seem to violate energy,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.280
can only noticeably
contribute over

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.620
a duration which is 1 over
the energy defect, delta Ek.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:28.650
So it is correct to say
that the system in its time

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.370
evolution for short
times can, so to speak,

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.420
violate energy protected
by Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.570
relation.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.120
Or you can say, the system
can do whatever it wants.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.200
It can spontaneously
create 10 photons.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.230
But this is pretty much like
taking money, taking a deposit

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.750
out of Heisenberg's bank.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.346
And after very,
very short time, you

00:21:52.346 --> 00:21:55.620
have to pay it back by
having another process which

00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:00.840
brings you back to
the correct energy.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.870
I should put it under
quotation marks when

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:06.990
I said we violate energy,
because energy is not

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:11.240
sort of defined or measurable
in this intermediate times.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.630
We start a process
with a quantum system,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.310
we look what happens afterwards.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.960
And whenever we
assess energy, it

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.230
is assessed when
the final time is

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.210
much, much larger
than the initial time.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.380
And I just showed you that
eventually, the system

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.220
has to be back to
a final energy, Ef,

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.491
which is identical to
the initial time, Ei.

00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:38.740
So in other words, I just
want you to keep it in mind.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.200
I've proven to you
energy conservation

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.400
in the limit that t final
minus t initial is large.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.900
And when I'm now talking about
non-conservation of energy,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.330
I do that in quotation
marks, because we

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.650
know energy is
conserved in the end.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.220
It's just that for very,
very short times in the time

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:04.110
evolution of the system, there
appear virtual states which

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.146
seem to violate energy.

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:07.770
But you can think
about it in that way.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.030
Questions about that?

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:27.410
Finally, let me now
address the question,

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:31.140
is everything I'm explaining
to you really happening?

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.200
Is it really happening
in a physical system?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.550
Well, the first answer
is, I wouldn't tell you

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.750
about it if it had no reality.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.290
So yes.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.080
You can imagine that this
is what your atom is doing.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.770
You can imagine that
the hydrogen atom that's

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:52.880
[INAUDIBLE] [? shift ?]
is permanently

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.400
emitting and absorbing
photons and all sorts

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.380
of weird photons from
the ground state,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.080
lower, up, and back
again, and such.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.760
Yes.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.210
This is the way
how we derive some

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:11.930
of the most precise predictions
in physics, namely QED.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:17.830
However, we can represent
systems in different gauges,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.040
in different representations.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.870
And we had discussed
earlier that we often

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:29.360
take the dipole representation
for the light atom interaction.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.250
But there's also the p
minus a representation.

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:39.800
And if you look at the two, both
the e, dot, d and the a, dot, p

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.320
interaction are the
product of something

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.830
which creates and annihilates
single photons-- a plus a

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.130
[? dega. ?] And then the p
operator or the d operator

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.300
connect the ground
with the excited state.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.800
So those matrix
element would tell you,

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.370
you can only emit
and absorb a photon

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.870
when you go from the ground
to the excited state.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:09.750
However, in the p
minus a representation,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:12.070
we also have the a squared term.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.030
And the a squared
term allows you--

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.750
because there is no atomic
operator in front of it--

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.970
allows you to
scatter two photons

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.910
without changing the
quantum state of the atom.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:28.860
But this does not
contradict anything.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.946
You can take either approach.

00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:32.570
And in your homework,
you will actually

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.350
do that when you calculate
Rayleigh scattering and Thomson

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.070
scattering.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.420
And you will find out
that the two approaches

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.150
give identical results.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.980
So if you know ask the
philosophical question,

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.720
can an atom scatter a photon
without changing its quantum

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.210
state, well, the
answer to this question

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.520
is actually gauge-dependent.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.910
But maybe to lift away
some of the confusion,

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.610
one can, of course,
also say, the a

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.610
squared term is
really important.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:07.710
And it's a simple description
of Thomson scattering.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:14.120
Thomson scattering
is about photons

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.300
which have much, much more
energy than the energy

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.770
difference between the
ground and excited state.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.750
So therefore, if you want
to completely describe

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.430
the system-- and you can,
it's just more complicated--

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.230
with a dipole approximation,
we have to scatter a photon.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.430
But because the photon
has so much more energy,

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.790
it's so far away from resonance,
this intermediate state

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.640
has a huge energy defect.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.900
And that means what I
just explained to you--

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.820
the system wants to
immediately pay back

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.620
the money to Heisenberg's bank.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:50.440
So it will remain in this state
only for very, very short time.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.220
And now the other
gauge tells you,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.800
this very, very short
time can also be zero.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.290
So see, it's not as dramatically
different as you might assume.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.530
But this is just
something which is common

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.870
that, if you have
different representations,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.250
the physics tastes
different, but you always

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.860
have to remind you that when you
calculate an observable result,

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.345
the two different gauges
must exactly agree.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:22.650
Questions?

00:27:29.236 --> 00:27:29.735
All right.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:42.530
So this is all I wanted to say
about the diagrammatic solution

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:48.030
for the time evolution
of a quantum system.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.150
But I want to use it now.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:50.710
I think this is
interesting stuff.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.110
It's a powerful method.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.040
And I want to illustrate
to you how this method can

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.430
be used in the
next two sections.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.645
Our next section is van
der Waal's interactions.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:40.520
So the chapter on van
der Waals interaction

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.500
is quite interesting for
the following reason.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.460
It really tells us
something about the vacuum.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.160
I think modern physics
has come to the conclusion

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.490
that the vacuum is one of
the most interesting subjects

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.470
to study, because
the vacuum is alive.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:03.860
It's filled by virtual
photons, virtual particles.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.640
And as we know now, by a
condensate of Higgs boson.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.470
So there is a lot of
stuff, a lot of structure,

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:14.560
a lot of phenomena
associated in the vacuum.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.630
And the subject of van
der Waals interactions

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.180
is it's a nice way to
talk about the vacuum,

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.180
but it's nice also for
the following reason.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.220
There is a completely, I
would say, semi-classical way.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.110
Just use the
Schrodinger equation

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.180
and calculate what
is the Van der Waals

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.770
interaction between two atoms.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.470
So you can just calculate
in perturbation theory.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.690
And in your whole
calculation, you never

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.840
use the quantized
electromagnetic field.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.790
Photons never appear.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:51.026
You just use
perturbation theory.

00:29:51.026 --> 00:29:52.400
And you do that
in your homework.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.660
It's rather straightforward.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.870
And you could have Van
der Waals interaction.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:05.010
On the other hand, I started
to derive for you the theory

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.610
of the quantized
electromagnetic field by saying,

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.880
we really look at everything.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.940
We have charges, and we have
the electric and magnetic field.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.810
And we described everything.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.500
And the way how we
separate it is we

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.560
had this Hamiltonian H naught,
which gives us the atom.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.140
And the longitudinal Coulomb
field became part of it.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.260
So this is the degree
of freedom of the atom.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.180
And we have H naught
for the other atom.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:37.790
And then we had radiation
field and the coupling

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:42.330
to the atom described
by our operator V, which

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.630
can be the dipole operator
or can be written down

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.910
in other gauge.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.690
But what I'm telling you is the
way how we have fundamentally

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:54.600
divided the world into atoms,
atom's neutral objects,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.690
and the rest is interactions
with the radiation field.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.290
That should tell you
that the Van der Waals

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:08.600
interaction between two atoms
must have a description in QED

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.200
where the Van der Waals
indirection between atoms

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.060
comes from the
exchange or photons.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.590
So there are two very simple
pictures at the same physics.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.590
One is you don't even
know that they're photons,

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.500
you just do perturbation theory.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.860
But in a more
comprehensive description

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.920
where we include
the photons, you

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.000
should be able to
understand the Van der Waals

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.040
action between two atoms
due to the exchange

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.920
of virtual photons.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.910
In other words, one atom
is in the ground state,

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:47.380
emits a photon that's going
down from the ground state.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:51.540
But until now, if you
have only one atom,

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.817
it has to reabsorb the
photon again and be back

00:31:53.817 --> 00:31:54.650
in the ground state.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.570
Otherwise, energy
would be violated.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.810
But if you have two atoms,
one atom can emit a photon,

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.850
and the other atom
can absorb it.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.980
And then the other atom
can send a photon back.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.340
And if we consider
that process, we

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.880
will actually find the
Van der Waals interaction.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.320
So I hope this is showing
interesting physics from two

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.330
angles-- that something
which looked maybe

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.860
trivial a long
time ago now looks

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:28.370
much richer, because
those forces are really

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.000
mediated by virtual
photon pairs.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.910
So that's sort of the
discussion I want to go through.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.580
There is another aspect to it.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.640
And this is when we go from
the Van der Waals force

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.720
to the Casimir force.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.670
The Casimir force has
one exact derivation,

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.520
which I want to share with
you, which relates the Casimir

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.980
force to the vacuum fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.870
So eventually, for those
forces between two metal

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.370
plates-- a neutral
atom in the plate,

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:08.160
two neutral atoms-- we will
have three different pictures.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.420
One is we use the
semi-classical dipole field

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.809
as a perturbation operator.

00:33:11.809 --> 00:33:12.850
You don't think about it.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.130
It's trivial, and you check
it off in your homework.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.530
The second one is you
look at the exchange

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.180
of virtual photons.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.980
And the third one
is you only look

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.950
at the zero-point fluctuations
of the electromagnetic field.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:26.230
What is real here?

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.220
What causes it?

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.170
We'll see.
