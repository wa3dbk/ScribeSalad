00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:22.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.980
Now, before we start with
the prepared questions,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.610
I have another question for you.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.940
It's sort of taking a straw
poll before and after discussing

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.730
something.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.920
And the question for
you, I want to ask

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.060
you is, what is the
nature of shot noise?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.100
The whole set of
questions will build up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.180
to teach you something
about what is shot noise.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.740
In other words, when
you measure in photons,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.010
you start with coherent
beams, you always

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.970
have sort of square root n.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.800
And the question
I want you to ask

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.060
is, when we measure square
root n fluctuations,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.920
when we detect n
photons, is this

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.270
caused by the nature of
the measurement process--

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.320
sort of how we detect
photons-- or is it

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.865
an intrinsic quantity
of the quantum fields?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.630
So I just want to get your
intuition, your gut feeling,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.880
with the shot noise-- it's
maybe not black and white,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.950
but if you think it's more
related to the measurement--

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.472
Well, let me write it down.

00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:35.470
Shot noise.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:52.290
OK, so the question
is, shot noise,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.440
is it caused by the quantum
measurement process, projection

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.880
of whatever you know about it?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.180
Second part, is it a property
of the quantum fields?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.710
For instance, if you
don't make a measurement,

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.920
if you run the quantum fields
through a beam splitter,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.980
we can split it.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.750
We can split the shot noise
even before we measure it.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.700
That would mean quantum fields.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.640
And maybe then, third is both.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.240
And the fourth is
none of the above.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.130
So let's just take an opinion.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.870
And I'm not discussing
the answer at this point.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.370
I will come back to that at the
end of those 10 or 15 minutes

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.270
and ask you the question again.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:47.250
So I just want to see what your
intuitive understanding is when

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.760
you measure the number
of photons in a laser

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.490
beam in an optical field
and you see fluctuations.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.650
Quantum measurement versus
properties of a quantum field.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.680
Quantum measurement
means mainly it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.890
caused the moment you detected.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.950
And quantum fields means
it's there already before,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.820
and it can be,
whatever, modified.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.840
Quantum fields or both.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.460
All right.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.250
Good.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.750
Fine.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.166
Let's now go through
the question.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:26.920
We first have to make sure
that we use the same definition

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.170
and measure things
in the same unit.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.860
We want to talk about
coherent states.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.950
So the first is just
little, quick checks.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.030
Coherent states are
eigenstates of the Hamiltonians

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.310
of a or a dagger?

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:44.625
For the easy question, I will
just give you 10 seconds.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.980
All right.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.710
Stop.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.720
Display.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.170
Yes.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.810
OK.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.330
That's good.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.650
Next question.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.980
Which states realize the
minimum quantum uncertainty

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.350
with delta p delta q
equals h-bar over 2?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.970
I give you five
different states.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.150
And in order to use
the clicker, you

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.576
should just answer how many of
them are minimum uncertainty

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:17.075
states.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.285
Ready, set, go.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.980
So three or two.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.670
Let's just go through them.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.590
The vacuum, definitely.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.590
The coherent state, definitely.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.650
The thermal state,
definitely not.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.710
Now, number states,
they are eigenstates.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.575
But let's just take
a big number state.

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:07.960
It's a big lean in
the quasi-probability.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.480
It has a huge delta
x and a huge delta p.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.100
It's definitely-- it's a
very quantum like state,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.350
very nonclassical.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.250
But it doesn't have
minimum uncertainty.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.870
Final question.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.450
x and p, are those minimum
uncertainty states?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.790
x and p are a
little bit cryptic,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.770
because one is infinite,
the other one is 0.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.200
And infinite times 0
is h-bar over 2, yes.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.320
So it's a minimum uncertainty
state, because we discussed it.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.780
It is the limit of squeezing,
when we perform the limit

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.700
that the squeezing
parameter goes to infinity.

00:05:46.004 --> 00:05:47.420
You can send me
your lawyer, and I

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.670
may have to step back from it.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.270
But the way I present it,
this is one correct answer.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.540
It's a limit of an
infinitely squeezed state.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.120
So if the squeezed vacuum--
which I forgot actually

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.890
to ask-- if the squeezed vacuum
is a minimum uncertainty state,

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.370
then the x and p state
are the limiting case.

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:13.260
By the way, your clicks
are getting recorded,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.390
and the clicks are responsible
for half of your semester

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.070
grade.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.050
This was a joke.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.970
You can actually use
clickers and record them,

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.719
but then each student
would have a clicker

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:26.850
with an already set number.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.530
But as you see, you just take
a random clicker out of the box

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.590
and put it back in.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.050
So I have no idea what
your clicker number is.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.075
And to use the clicker is solely
for our joint entertainment

00:06:37.075 --> 00:06:38.480
here.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.720
OK, next question.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.850
What features are unique
to nonclassical light?

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.479
And nonclassical
light means-- well,

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.020
we have discussed
nonclassical lights

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.510
but their different aspects.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.080
One is that the roots
of the two quadrature

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.890
components-- the uncertainty of
the two quadrature components--

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.810
the cosine and sine quadrature
components are unequal;

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.100
negative cosine probabilities;
a correlation function, which

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.370
is smaller than 1; and
sub-Poissonian statistics.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.970
So I've given you four criteria.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:20.100
How many of those four are
features which we will not

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.040
associate with classical light,
only with nonclassical light?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.510
OK.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.815
Stop.

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:33.315
Display.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.940
So there's a wide distribution.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.810
Let's quickly
discuss the answer.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.470
Negative cosine
probabilities, well,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.300
if you use w distribution
and p distribution,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.920
negative probabilities
are always

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.820
associated with
nonclassical light.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.320
You can also say
it's the definition

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.760
of nonclassical light.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.100
g 2 function of-- maybe, I
should not say smaller or equal

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.160
-- smaller than 1 is only
possible for nonclassical

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.870
light.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.400
Sub-Poissonian
statistics is also

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.830
only possible for
nonclassical light.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.560
Now, the fact that the two
quadrature components are

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.072
different, you
can just use some,

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:21.530
and you can choose
classical states

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.662
and prepare them, that
you have more certainty

00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:26.870
in the sine quadrature than
in the cosine quadrature,

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.050
so definitely not.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.250
OK, now, we really
need prominently

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.710
to discuss quantum noise and
shot noise, the coherent state.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.080
So just to make sure
that we relate--

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.370
I will relate later
everything to photon number.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.890
Because photon
number is intuitive.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.365
You can count, you can feel
the photons fluctuation

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:51.760
of square root n and
immediately tell you Poissonian,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.890
if it's less,
sub-Poisson, all that.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.920
So I want to make sure we are
correctly associating photon

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.716
number with coherent states.

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:00.090
So, therefore,
the first question

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.570
is if you have a
coherent state, alpha,

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.170
and we detect all the
photons with a photodiode

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.400
of 100% efficiency,
is the number

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.300
of detected photons
alpha or alpha squared?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.720
Yes.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.030
Alpha is, so to
speak, the field.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.910
And alpha squared
is the intensity.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:38.630
So, therefore, form
now one, I will always

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.840
use units for the
photocurrent in such a way

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.960
that the photocurrent, or
the integrated photocurrent,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.100
is the number of photons.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.900
So when I say, what is
the current associated

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.970
with a coherent state,
it's just alpha squared.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.090
Just one side remark.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.600
If you use a laser
beam, you sort of

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.630
have a stream of
photons, but you

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.720
have a time constant
in your detector,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.140
and every millisecond
you do a measurement.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.220
And then, what I mean by
alpha or alpha squared

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.740
is the number of photons
which arrive during the time

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.160
constant.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.710
So that's sort of the mapping.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.770
We all usually talk
about coherent state

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.080
in an isolated system.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.080
But if you have a beam, you
just chop the beam into pieces

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.770
and associate that with
your coherent state.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.270
OK.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.830
So now, we are talking about the
measurement of coherent beams.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.780
We will have now lots
of coherent beams,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.760
running through beam splitters,
being mixed at beam splitters

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.660
and such.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.440
And we will always
characterize the strength

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.710
of the coherent beam
by alpha squared.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.470
And that means in photons.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.680
So now, the next
question is-- again,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.540
just to make sure we
are all on the same--

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.180
we have the same basis,
what is now the variance?

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.950
If I measure the fluctuating
current, I measure the current,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:04.550
I have a coherent state, and I
repeatedly measure the current,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.360
it will show fluctuations.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.530
And the question is, what is
not the standard deviation

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.804
of the current, what
is the variance, which

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:14.220
is the standard
deviation squared?

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.480
Yes, the standard
deviation is square root n.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.600
The variance is n.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.370
OK.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.475
Stop.

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:32.975
Hide.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:41.720
OK, now finally, now we can
have fun with beam splitters.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.856
So, so far, we have
really just repeated

00:11:43.856 --> 00:11:46.230
a little bit of definitions
of classical and nonclassical

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.980
light at coherent states.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.210
We measured current.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.670
We know now in what units we
need to measure the current.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.890
And we characterized the
fluctuations in variance

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.880
not in standard deviation
for the rest of this unit.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:10.140
But now, we run the coherent
state through a beam splitter.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.500
And we have two photodiodes,
one i1 and one i2.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.130
And we measure the current, i1.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.020
What is the variance now
in the current you measure?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:39.570
OK.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.050
It is A. It's n/2.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.770
The way how you
think about what it

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.710
is, when you split a laser
beam with a beam splitter,

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.390
you get two laser beams.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.500
Each is half the intensity.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.200
So therefore, each creates a
photocurrent, which is n/2.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.780
And since one laser beam,
which is a coherent state,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.470
gives two laser beams, which
are two coherent states,

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.160
each of them has
a variance which

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.550
is equal to the photon number.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.520
And this means, we have
Poissonian statistics.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.830
So we have n/2
photons in each beam.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.480
The standard deviation is
the square root of n/2.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.555
And the variance is n/2.

00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.520
Ask me, if there
are any questions.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.370
I mean, this is still
the preliminaries.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.480
We are not yet bringing
in squeezed light.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.950
Then, it gets
really interesting.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.490
OK, we will always
refer to that situation.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.430
We have a laser beam.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.540
We split it.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.315
We create-- and that's actually
your homework assignment.

00:13:48.315 --> 00:13:51.360
We'll actually show
wonderful operator algebra.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.430
If you split a coherent beam,
you get two coherent beams.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.080
And they are simply
characterized

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.210
that the alpha value is
now down by square root 2.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.010
The number is down by 2.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.840
And if the number is down by 2
and you have a coherent beam,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.684
the variance is down by 2.

00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:06.600
Poissonian statistics.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:18.780
OK, next question is we
have a beam splitter.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.880
We have two photodiodes,
i1 and i2, and now

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.020
we measure-- it's important
for balanced homodyne

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:30.130
detection-- we can now
take the two currents,

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.340
and we can add them or
we can subtract them.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:40.280
So the question is, if we add
the two currents, what is now

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.030
the variance in
the two currents?

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.650
Remember, each current
had a variance of n/2.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.670
So now, you are asked, when
you sum the currents of the two

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.170
photodetectors, what happens
to the two variances?

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.109
Do they sum up?

00:14:58.109 --> 00:14:58.608
Do they--?

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:14.250
I don't know.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.350
Do people want
to-- does somebody

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.744
want to defend
his or her choice?

00:15:20.744 --> 00:15:22.160
What do you think
is the variance?

00:15:26.328 --> 00:15:28.758
AUDIENCE: It should be
the answer, you just

00:15:28.758 --> 00:15:31.284
measure before
the beam splitter.

00:15:31.284 --> 00:15:33.950
PROFESSOR: You said it should be
as if I measure before the beam

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.500
splitter, and then it would be
n, because we have n photons.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.400
Well, you can also see if
you put in a mirror here,

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.690
and you shine the two beams
on the same photodiode.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:50.200
And then you would say
you have n photons.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.250
And if there are Poissonian
fluctuations, you would get n.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.540
But there is one thing
you should keep in mind.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.880
Since we have the
beam splitter here--

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.260
this is the correct answer.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.790
But I want to point out
one subtlety for you, which

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.900
will become important later.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.530
The beam splitter has an
open part with the vacuum.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.800
And so when you said we can
measure before or by sort

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.950
of just combining the two
beams with a big photodiode,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:25.730
we can measure after, that's
now a question for you-- which,

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.740
maybe hold the thought
and ask me later,

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:30.360
if it doesn't become clear
with the following question.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.650
Hasn't the vacuum entered here,
and hasn't the vacuum, which

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.206
has entered here
added fluctuations?

00:16:36.206 --> 00:16:37.580
So if you put in
a beam splitter,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.610
and we mix in the vacuum
with our coherent states,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.697
shouldn't that possibly
mean that if you

00:16:43.697 --> 00:16:47.060
use a big photodiode and
measure everything together,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.750
that we measure the
variance we had before.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.150
But isn't that
possibly a contribution

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.470
of the vacuum, because we were
opening the door to the vacuum?

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.530
Please hold the thought.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.720
OK.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.770
The next thing is now, you can't
have the solution that we take

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.390
sort of a big photodiode
and combine the two beams,

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.500
because I'm asking
you now is, what

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.069
is the variance in i1 minus i2?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.960
So you subtract
the two currents.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.950
So the question is, if
you have technical noise,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.920
the two beams would
be fluctuating,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.170
and you would form i1 minus i2.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.890
All the technical noise
would cancel away.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.520
But what is shot noise?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.770
Is shot noise technical noise?

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.710
Is shot noise that every
time you prepare an ensemble,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.190
there is a hiccup, and you
can split it and subtract it?

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.230
So now, it's getting
really interesting.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.420
To what extent does a
beam splitter-- does

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.990
a split coherent state,
which has shot noise,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.520
and you now perform the
difference of the measurement,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.730
can you get rid of some
of the shot noise or not?

00:18:02.037 --> 00:18:02.745
You vote, please.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.180
Yes.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.310
So it doesn't matter
whether we measure

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.000
the sum or the difference.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.820
So it seems, we have two beams.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:38.860
And it seems that the
noise in i1 and i2

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.859
is completely uncorrelated.

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:42.900
And whether we perform
the sum or the difference,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.650
it doesn't matter.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.690
As long as you think
about classical states

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.850
and coherent states, you can
get away with this notion.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.530
But now I'm going to
add some squeezed light.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.131
And now, it's
getting more subtle.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.540
So we have exactly
the same situation.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.150
We have our beam splitter.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:11.640
We split our coherent beam into
two beams, exactly as before.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.110
But now, I'm playing
with a vacuum.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.700
I'm playing with the open
part of the beam splitter,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.650
and I put in squeezed vacuum.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.010
And just to be specific,
I've squeezed the vacuum

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.340
in such a way that
what is narrow now

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.930
is the quadrature component
of the coherent state.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:39.680
In other words, the coherent
state is cosine omega t.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.050
In sine omega t, we haven't
been put in any photons.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.685
Our coherent state has really
a classical oscillation

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:46.880
in cosine omega t.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.480
And what I have squeezed
here with the vacuum

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.880
is the noise in the cosine
omega t quadrature component.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.000
So in other words, the coherent
state and the short axis

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.210
of the ellipse are the
same quadrature component,

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.020
which means, they
can now interfere.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.380
So the question is
now the following.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.710
We split the beam.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.060
We have n/2 photons here.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.797
We have n/2 photons there.

00:20:17.797 --> 00:20:19.630
And what is now the
result for the variance?

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:25.300
I formulated a
condition up there,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.240
which is the strong local
oscillator condition.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.280
You should assume,
if you get confused,

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.410
that the local oscillator
is very, very strong.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.370
And if you have any doubts
about some smaller terms,

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.880
just crank up the
power and make sure

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.980
that it's really the local
oscillator which dominates,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.881
which is the biggest
number in all equations.

00:20:47.881 --> 00:20:48.380
OK.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.840
So the reference is
without squeezing,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.530
the noise, or the
variance, in i1 was n/2.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.510
With n/2 photons, Poissonian
statistics was n/2.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:08.230
The question is now, when
we use squeezed light,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.770
does the variance stay the same?

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.010
Does it go up?

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.850
Does it go down?

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.210
Or does it go to 0?

00:21:28.176 --> 00:21:30.780
By the way, at the end
of the clicker question,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.260
if you come to me after
class and honestly declare

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.990
you got 100% on all
questions, I buy you a lunch.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.590
OK, you're done?

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.730
What have you learned?

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.780
It's almost random.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.250
I will give you a little bit
formalism later, but I mean,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.660
let me say one thing.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.990
I had a few discussion
with students after class,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.350
and I came to the
conclusion after last class

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:15.050
that I could teach today about
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms'

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.060
wonderful applications
of all that,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.870
but I came to the conclusion,
you can go to the Wikipedia

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.370
and read about yourself.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.200
Because this is simply
using beam splitters,

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.160
homodyne detection.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.600
It's just using kind
of all the tools.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.460
But what I said instead is,
I'd rather spend half the class

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:35.120
today in trying to give you,
with very simple examples,

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.355
an intuitive understanding.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.730
I mean, everything
I'm saying you

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.100
can do with operator algebra.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.480
But to some extent, I feel
when we learn physics,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.230
we use operators, we use
equations, but in the end,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.220
we want to shape our intuition.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.650
And what I try to sort of
challenge you today is,

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.500
what happens to noise?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.060
So what I have to tell you
now is-- OK, got to hide this.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.580
The way you should look
at it very soon, I hope,

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.680
is the following, that when
you split the coherent beam,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.630
you also split the noise.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.440
In other words, your
little uncertainty circle

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.960
goes down in the amplitude
by square root of 2.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.080
It is split-- the reflection
coefficient of the beam spit

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.940
and transmission coefficient
is 1 over square root 2.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.270
But what happens is, you
let in the vacuum here.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.710
And so, the vacuum comes into
the transmission coefficient

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.750
of 1 over square root 2.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.990
So what I want to teach you
is that when we think back

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:42.860
to this example and we had
this situation with a vacuum,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.290
yes, it looked to
us that we had n/2--

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:54.050
so this was i1 plus
i2-- we had n/2 photons

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.900
and the variance was n/2, it
looked completely Poissonian

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.990
as if nothing has happened.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.860
But what you should understand
is, that the beam splitter

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.400
has taken out-- in amplitude,
1 over square root 2,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.300
when I square it--
half of the noise out

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.820
of the coherent state.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.360
But half of the vacuum
state was added.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.330
And half of the vacuum state
and half of the intrinsic noise

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:23.130
of the coherent state give
you back this circle of unity.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.760
And you can pretty much
neglect all subtleties

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.050
of the quantum field.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:32.150
But now, by messing
up with a vacuum,

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.980
by squeezing the vacuum,
half of the shot noise

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.300
comes from the beam splitter.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.510
It's a 50-50 beam splitter.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.740
But the other half comes
from the open part.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.890
But if you squeeze it strongly,
it's on the order epsilon.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:51.240
That means, it
doesn't contribute.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:25:02.350
And the correct answer is
now, we have-- just a second.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.110
It is linear or quadratic?

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.170
Variance is quadratic.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.000
The correct answer is here,
because this is epsilon;

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.170
this is small.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.800
We only get half of the
noise we had before.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.420
We had n/2, and
now, we have n/4.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:21.530
OK.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.955
Now, we take exactly
the same situation.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.890
So the thought is that you
measure the fluctuation here

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.410
and you have only half of them,
because this squeezed vacuum,

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.860
you've squeezed out the
noise from the vacuum part.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.010
And since you have a
strong coherent state,

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.000
everything which is sine
omega t doesn't matter.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.725
Cosine omega t is homodyned,
everything fluctuation

00:25:55.725 --> 00:25:57.590
and cosine omega t.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.600
When we measure, the intensity
is the square of phi,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.140
or it's a dagger a.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.490
And so if you measure
a quadratic quantity

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.100
and we have a very
strong local oscillator,

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.470
everything is projected
on cosine omega t.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.400
This is why only the
cosine omega t fluctuations

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.830
of discrete statement are here.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.553
It's a strong local
oscillator limit.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.620
OK.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.390
Now, I hope you've
learned something.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:30.250
Next question is now, we
do exactly the same thing,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.350
but now we have
the two currents,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:38.390
and the question is, what
is the variance in i-plus?

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.050
I add the two currents.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.000
What do I get?

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:47.780
And I give you the
same choices as before.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.220
Just as a reminder,
when we did not squeeze,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.150
the variance was n.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:00.420
So the question is now, has
this squeezing done nothing,

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.301
or has it reduced the variance?

00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:03.050
What is happening?

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.390
The correct answer is C. It's n.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.690
And I will show you-- I owe
you a little bit of math now.

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.050
But the way how you should
feel is the following.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:47.080
The noise of the coherent
oscillator is equally split.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.690
But the amplitude-- I mean,
you can say 50% go through, 50%

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.610
go through here.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.410
And if you add the
two currents, you

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:58.230
get back the full noise of
the original coherent state.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.410
You would say what
about the squeezing?

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.550
Well, the issue
is the following.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.340
The squeezed light,
the squeezed vacuum,

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.124
is reflected with a reflection
coefficient, which is minus 1

00:28:09.124 --> 00:28:10.040
over square root of 2.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.660
You know when you have two
beams reflected, by unitarity,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.030
it's necessary that
one has a negative,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.660
the other one has a positive
reflection coefficient.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.640
So therefore, you have
this squeezed vacuum

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.030
appears in this arm
with a minus sign

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.310
and this arm with a plus sign.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.640
And if you sum up
the two currents,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.870
you lose everything which is
related to the vacuum part.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.950
So when you measure
i1 plus i2, what

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.190
came from the vacuum part
entered here with a minus sign,

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.280
here with a plus sign.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.030
And therefore, you
[INAUDIBLE] what you've

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.310
done at the vacuum part.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.820
This is when I told you
earlier, you measure i1 plus i2,

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.840
and we all agreed,
the variance was n.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.760
And I said, well, this
is exactly the same

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.120
if you put a photodiode-- big
photodiode-- behind the beam

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.880
splitter or before
the beam splitter.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.020
The vacuum has not contributed.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.030
That's what it seems.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.920
But even if you squeeze
the vacuum, it cancels out.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.400
OK.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.420
Now, the obvious
next question-- but I

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.270
think I've given
you the answer--

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:17.270
is what happens when we
now measure the difference,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.700
i1 minus i2?

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.800
Again, without squeezing,
the variance was n.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.350
So now, we measure i1
minus i2, and what happens?

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.760
OK.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.190
The correct answer is this.

00:29:58.025 --> 00:30:01.200
Well, when I say 0, it's
always epsilon squared terms

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.910
which I neglect.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:03.780
I just assume strong squeezing.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.390
I mean, I just want to give you
the most conceptional problem.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:08.840
What happens is the following.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.264
And I will show
you the equation.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.520
The noise of the coherent
state is split equally.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.510
So we have a delta a--
a is the field operator,

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.970
or the quadrature operator
here-- and a delta a here.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.470
And therefore, the
original shot noise

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.850
is common mode, because the
reflection and transmission

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:36.310
coefficients are the same.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.000
And if you subtract the
current, you completely

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.730
get rid of all noise,
which was originally

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.230
associated with
your coherent state.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:51.446
Now, what happens is
the small noise we get,

00:30:51.446 --> 00:30:53.320
but now, we have to
consider the vacuum part.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.820
But what comes in on the
same quadrature component

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:00.510
point on the vacuum
tube is strongly split.

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:06.800
And because the beam
splitter has different signs

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.260
for reflection and transmission,
the noise is anti-correlated.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.230
And if you take
the difference, you

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:19.160
will actually measure the noise
of the input of the open part

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:27.110
of the beam splitter, which
would mean, in terms of order

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.400
epsilon-- I didn't work it out.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.290
I think it's epsilon squared.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.760
But it's a power of epsilon.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.750
So anyway, it seems your
intuition fails here.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.570
So let me try to give you a few
equations which explain that.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:51.870
In your homework and
in most of the course,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.740
we really want to
work with operators.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.370
We do transformation
of operators and such.

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:59.570
But I've found-- for
shaping my intuition--

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.130
I found a simplified
approach very helpful.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.050
And I've posted two
references for you.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.180
One is the article
by Schumacher,

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.560
and one are some
older lecture notes,

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.360
where I summarize some
results of this article.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.520
And this goes as follows.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.110
When you have a
coherent input, you

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:23.480
can say you have a
deterministic classical field.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:28.180
And then, you have some noise
in one quadrature component,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.730
which is cosine omega t.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.710
And the i is a reminder
that there's also

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.450
noise in sine omega t.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.750
So you can really say
the electric field has

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.520
a sharp value,
but then, there is

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.529
some fluctuation in the
coefficient of cosine omega t

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:45.070
and a little bit fluctuation in
the coefficient of sine omega

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.720
t.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.140
And what is important now is, if
you shine that on a photodiode,

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.330
this is sort of the field.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.962
The current is proportional
to the square of it.

00:32:58.962 --> 00:33:00.670
You have to be a little
bit careful where

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.920
you put complex conjugation,
but it is the square of it.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:11.190
And now, if we use the strong
local oscillator assumption,

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.260
we only take alpha
squared, which

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:14.940
gives us a number of photons.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.160
But then, those
fluctuations are homodyned.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.845
We only take-- we
don't consider that

00:33:19.845 --> 00:33:21.330
the square of the fluctuation.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.590
We only homodyne it.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:28.350
We use, at the cross term,
where we multiply with alpha.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:36.380
So if I now put in
photon numbers for alpha,

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.540
we get n photons.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.690
Yes, OK.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.500
And now, we get some noise.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:47.190
Well, the noise is
the current squared.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:53.710
The noise is-- we take the
average of the current squared

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.600
and subtract the average
of the current squared.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.920
So if you do that--
this is the current

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.625
squared-- the current
squared average,

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:08.690
and the average current
squared takes that away.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.400
So we get this here
as the variance.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.810
And now, I have to tell you that
in the units I'm using here,

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:18.540
this delta a1 squared
for coherent state--

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.580
so if I show the
standard circle--

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.570
the standard
Heisenberg uncertainty

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.045
circle-- this quantity is 1/4.

00:34:26.045 --> 00:34:28.250
I've just kept track
of my constant.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:35.290
So therefore, we obtain in this
picture that the variance is n.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.199
And this is Poissonian
light with a coherent state.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.679
And the fluctuation
squared of the current, n,

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.900
this is Poissonian
statistics, square root

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.530
in fluctuations of the current.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.340
The variance is n.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.989
But what you should
realize is one thing.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:53.409
The moment I have a
strong coherent state,

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:57.190
the sign quadrature component
doesn't matter at all.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.740
Because if you multiply
cosine with sine and average,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.470
you get 0.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.740
So we only consider the
quadrature component,

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.130
which is given by
the coherent state.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.600
This is a principle of homodyne.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.556
You set your
quadrature component

00:35:09.556 --> 00:35:10.680
with your local oscillator.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.010
OK.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:24.320
But now, I have a beam splitter.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.810
And the way you
can think about it

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.270
is, you can get everything
in operator algebra,

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:35.210
but just take my word or
follow the procedure now

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.200
that we are saying,
we can always

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.780
think about a
quantum field that it

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.770
has an average value
and some fluctuations.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.300
And if you pass it through
an optical element or a beam

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.860
splitter, we have a
transmission coefficient,

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.930
but it multiplies the
mean value of the field.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.580
But it also multiplies the
fluctuations of the field.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.860
So that's why I'm saying the
beam splitter is actually

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.030
splitting the
fluctuations of the field.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:06.205
And therefore, you get reduced
fluctuations in either beam.

00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:09.680
But we have to consider
that there may be vacuum,

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.260
and the vacuum has
also some fluctuations

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.025
and will reflect in or transmit
through parts of the vacuum.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:31.150
So now, we want to
understand photocurrents.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:45.070
For photocurrents, we take those
quantities and square them.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.280
So which one should I take?

00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:57.610
Well, let me take
the first line.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.950
So this is i1.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:07.530
So if I calculate now i1, I
obtain t squared alpha squared,

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.450
plus the cross product
between the first two terms

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:19.510
is 2 times t alpha
times t delta a1.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.340
And then, I get a second
term from the vacuum,

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:30.580
which is 2tr alpha delta b2.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:38.270
And let me assume that we have
a balanced beam splitter, 50-50.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.280
So t squared is simply 1/2.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.970
Alpha squared is the
number of photons.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.190
So this term becomes n/2.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.500
t squared is 1/2.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.610
It cancels with the 2.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.110
We are left with alpha.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.660
And this is shot noise.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.510
Here, appears our square root n.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.510
So you can say the
shot noise comes

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.150
because we have homodyned
the quantum noise.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.950
The quantum noise, which is the
same for all coherent states,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.082
has now been multiplied
with square root n

00:38:20.082 --> 00:38:21.290
through the homodyne process.

00:38:29.935 --> 00:38:30.435
OK.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.860
So I lost my line.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.620
That's delta a2.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.630
And then-- and
this is important--

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.820
because of the mixing
at the beam splitter,

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.160
the quantum noise off the
vacuum gets also homodyned

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.560
by a factor of square root n.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:59.980
So now, I think you see
what I told you before.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.310
The transmitted beam has
half of its noise coming

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.060
from the coherent state,
and half of the noise

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.570
comes from the vacuum.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.750
So if I would now
take the current,

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:18.140
square it, calculate
the variance,

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.650
I would find that I have n/2
photons with a variance of n/2.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:26.360
But an identical
contribution of the noise

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.950
will come from the
original coherent state

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.840
and from the vacuum.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.900
So therefore, when
I replace the vacuum

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.760
by a strongly squeezed vacuum,
the beam, the current i1,

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.800
lost half of its shot noise.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.930
We had n/2 photons
with a noise--

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.530
with a variance, which was n/4.

00:39:48.087 --> 00:39:48.670
Any questions?

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.170
Yes.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.376
AUDIENCE: Why are the subscripts
on the delta operator of

00:39:53.376 --> 00:39:56.340
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.100
PROFESSOR: Because I should
have dropped them all together,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.590
saying we are only using
the quadrature component

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.510
of the local oscillator now.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.360
Everything else is orthogonal
to it and cancels out.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.800
But if you want me to put them
back, they should all be equal.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.317
I compiled this writeup from
different lecture notes, which

00:40:17.317 --> 00:40:19.275
one had the cosine, one
had the sine component.

00:40:19.275 --> 00:40:21.930
I just made a
[? stitching error. ?]

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.000
OK.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.240
So this was i1.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:36.450
If I would now look at--
let me change the color--

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:42.340
at the current, i2, the only
anything which changes is

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:47.260
that because the quantum
noise is transmitted

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.070
with a positive
coefficient, that I

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.460
have to put a plus sign here.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.390
And now, you realize the magic.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:01.510
When you form i1
plus i2, whatever

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.430
came through the vacuum part,
or through the open part,

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.430
cancels out.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.990
Therefore, when we calculated--
or when I asked you

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.060
for the variance
in i1 plus i2, it

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.990
was independent, whether
there was squeezing,

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.530
whether whatever was
at the vacuum part.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.680
And therefore, it doesn't matter
whether I put my power meter,

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.220
measuring both currents--
both beams-- before the beam

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.720
splitter or after
the beam splitter.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.630
But-- yes, a question?

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.020
AUDIENCE: This
last really depends

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.323
on the convention
of where we put

00:41:38.323 --> 00:41:39.656
the negative sign in reflection?

00:41:39.656 --> 00:41:41.641
Because if I had put
the negative sign here

00:41:41.641 --> 00:41:43.890
and a positive there, then
I would have been canceling

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.194
my delta a's instead of b's?

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.320
[INAUDIBLE] the process?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.110
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:58.085 --> 00:42:00.760
Well, so you should
[INAUDIBLE] conventions here.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.950
It's clear that you
have to be careful.

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.490
We're talking about
[? face-sensitive ?] detection.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.300
So what happens
is-- number one is--

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.990
there is really
physics associated.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:13.940
When you have a
beam splitter, one,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.320
let's assume you have
a piece of glass,

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.040
which has some coating on it.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.850
One beam is reflected when
it goes from the vacuum

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:26.410
to material interface.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.445
The other one is reflected
from the material

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:29.610
to vacuum interface.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.953
AUDIENCE: So then, it depends
on which face of the beam

00:42:31.953 --> 00:42:33.030
that will be put which--?

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.390
PROFESSOR: But one thing
is absolutely clear.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.190
The two reflected beams, one
of them has a minus sign.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:47.228
So therefore, when I do i1 minus
i2, the contribution of the--

00:42:47.228 --> 00:42:49.036
AUDIENCE: --If a's will cancel.

00:42:49.036 --> 00:42:50.510
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.680
It is clear that
in i1-- OK, yes.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.052
But the question
is whether we have

00:42:56.052 --> 00:43:00.120
to perform i1 minus
i2 or i1 plus i2.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.780
Well, I don't know
if it helps you,

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.170
but what happens is we have
a propagating laser beam.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.270
If you would simply move your
mirror by half a wavelength,

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:11.840
you get a minus sign.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.960
So eventually, all of the
phases-- the beam splitter

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.880
phase, the propagating
phase-- all the phases

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.140
have to be controlled.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.200
And in essence, what you do is
you put an experiment together,

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.705
you measure some noise, and
then you move your mirror

00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:27.070
or you change your phase.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.524
And then, you really figure out
which noise is now subtracting

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:32.440
and which noise is
constructively interfering.

00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:36.685
Other questions?

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.630
OK.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.060
But the other thing
is now obvious.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:49.620
When we measure i1
minus i2, everything

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:54.740
related to the coherent
input, to the original noise

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.380
of the beam, cancels out.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.360
And what we are
measuring is only

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.420
the noise which came in
through the other part.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.080
So this is the reason why, if
you have interesting light you

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.790
want to measure it, you
use a local oscillator.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.140
But then, you do i1 minus i2.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.570
And this is what I presented to
you at the end of last class,

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.970
is the way how
people have measured

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:19.095
the signature of squeezing.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.600
Any questions?

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:40.850
And finally, I think this is
one of the coolest things.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:46.432
Now, we want to talk about
the displaced squeezed vacuum.

00:44:46.432 --> 00:44:48.510
Now, we put everything together.

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.970
Remember, we have
learned by applying

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.520
the squeezing operator, how
we can squeeze the vacuum.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.740
And then, with the
displacement operator,

00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:01.370
I can move the displaced vacuum,
that there is an expectation

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:04.450
value, alpha, for the field.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:09.070
So it now looks like a
squeezed coherent state.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.720
So this is now the
state we have generated.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.170
And I explained to
you that such a state

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:23.330
can be generated by using a
beam splitter in the limit where

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.970
the transmission
coefficient goes to 1.

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:31.500
So the squeezed vacuum is pretty
much transmitted without loss.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.200
But now, we have a very
strong local oscillator.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:40.000
Also, the reflection
coefficient goes to 0.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.830
We can just crank up the
power in alpha in such a way

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:47.380
that r alpha squared-- the
number of photons which get

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.890
reflected-- is n.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.130
So the limit we are looking at
it is small n and large alpha.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:55.960
But what we keep constant--
throughout actually

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:59.390
all those questions-- is that
we have n photons in that beam.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.690
And I explained
to you in class--

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:08.690
and I showed it to
you with operators--

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.850
that this setup
is really creating

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:16.430
the displeased squeezed vacuum.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:17.100
OK.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.790
Now, we have one
laser beam, which

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:25.670
has an average value
of the field, alpha.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.770
It has certain properties.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.440
And now, I want to ask you, what
is the variance of this beam?

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.820
We measure the
photocurrent of this beam.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.790
We measure-- of course, the
photocurrent is n photons.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.045
But what is this variance?

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:59.440
So the choices are
we have n photons.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.440
Is the variance n?

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.510
We learned before, with
the 50-50 beam splitter,

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.990
that we were able, by
squeezing the vacuum,

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:11.540
to eliminate half
of the shot noise.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.375
Maybe what I've done
is wrong, and we get 2

00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:15.500
and we increase the noise?

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.540
Or does the noise
really go to 0,

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.850
which means it's on the order
of epsilon, whatever I define

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:29.150
for the squeezing for the short
axis of this squeezed vacuum.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.980
So now, we are not
subtracting currents.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.200
No i1 minus i2.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.680
We have one beam hitting
straight the photodiode.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.100
There are n photons
per unit time.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.465
And the question is, what are
the fluctuations of this beam?

00:47:42.465 --> 00:47:43.340
What is the variance?

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:03.520
Well, the correct
answer is this one.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.190
What happens is the following.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.180
In terms of fields--
you should go

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.680
through that again
a little bit more

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.050
slowly-- but what happens
is the coherent state is

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:18.350
sort of this disk.

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.930
But when we make alpha
larger and larger,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.930
the disk of the coherent
state is the same.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.360
But now, we have of a
reflection coefficient,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.260
which goes to 0, such that
the product of r alpha

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.550
stays the same.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.280
But that means the
reflected beam,

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.787
we have divided the disk by
the reflection coefficient--

00:48:37.787 --> 00:48:39.620
multiplied with the
reflection coefficient--

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:43.430
so therefore, the original
noise of the coherent beam

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:47.810
has been completely eliminated
because of the small reflection

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:48.900
coefficient.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.620
So the only noise which is
there, is from the other part.

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.635
But we have strongly
squeezed the noise

00:48:56.635 --> 00:48:58.210
in this quadrature component.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.580
And therefore, the
noise goes really down

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.830
to 0 or to I think it's
epsilon squared when epsilon

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:09.560
is the normalized widths of
the narrow part of the ellipse.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:31.360
I've written down the
math for you here,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.510
which is the following.

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:36.270
We have a reflection coefficient
for the coherent beam

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:39.860
and the reflection coefficient
for the fluctuating fields.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.920
Whereas, the squeezed
fluctuations,

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.990
they are fully transmitted.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:46.710
And what I'm
completely neglecting

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.300
is-- and you'll realize it
already-- the other quadrature

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.110
component.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:53.610
Because the moment I square
it to obtain the current,

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:57.420
I'm only considering
parts, which

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.117
are in the right
quadrature component,

00:49:59.117 --> 00:50:00.450
that they get enhanced by alpha.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:09.110
So if I square that and
neglect all terms which do not

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:14.080
get multiplied with
alpha, I get this line.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.580
And now, you see that
this term here-- the one

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.980
which had the fluctuations
of the coherent beam--

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:22.460
is what I just said.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:25.600
r times alpha is n.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.140
So this is n.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.060
It would be the normal variance.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.110
But now, we have
another power of r.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:33.907
So therefore, delta a1
really got diminished.

00:50:33.907 --> 00:50:35.740
I mean, you see that
actually already better

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.950
in the previous line.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.270
So therefore, in the limit of
r, in the limit considered,

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.480
there is no contribution
from the fluctuations

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.830
of the coherent beam.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.930
The only fluctuations
come from the squeezing.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:51.370
And therefore, the variance
is, well, 0 or epsilon squared.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.070
So you can create a beam, which
has no fluctuations-- or almost

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:02.760
no fluctuation-- in
the photon number

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:07.810
by mixing a strong local
oscillator with a squeeze

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:08.310
vacuum.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.110
And that would mean now,
if you take this beam

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:18.360
and send it through
a cesium cell

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:23.640
and do spectroscopy of cesium,
you have reduced noise,

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.105
and you are more sensitive
to obtain, to observe,

00:51:27.105 --> 00:51:30.360
a small quantity of cesium.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:32.800
I've posted it actually--
this is exactly what

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.740
I described here, how
the first spectroscopy

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.250
with squeezed light was done.

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:40.560
And I've posted the paper
of Jeff Kimble's group

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.370
on our website.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:52:01.860
So I'm wondering, by going
through these examples,

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.923
if I would ask you that the
shot noise, which is square root

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:11.430
n in the fields and
n in the variance,

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.200
after looking at the beam
splitter and the modes which

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.700
are involved, how would you
now answer this question?

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:23.380
Is the shot noise related
to quantum measurement,

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.840
is it related to quantum
fields, both, or none?

00:52:45.176 --> 00:52:46.550
That's interpretation
of physics;

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.820
I think there is
no right and wrong.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.800
I would actually very
strongly-- my opinion is,

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.830
it's B. It's really
the quantum fields.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:55.850
The quantum fields
which are split.

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.010
If the noise were done
in the measurement,

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.615
you cannot have constructive
and destructive interference due

00:53:01.615 --> 00:53:04.310
to the positive and negative
reflection coefficient.

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:07.320
So for me, the noise, which
is responsible for shot noise,

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.710
is a field which
can be split where

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.490
you have constructive and
destructive interference

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.590
even before the measurement
process takes place.

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.337
But this is sort of
my interpretation.

00:53:21.337 --> 00:53:26.960
And let me maybe point out why
I think that for those cases,

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.920
the quantum measurement
process is not relevant.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:34.170
Here, we've always talked
about square root n

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:36.820
fluctuations, where n is big.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.880
So the fluctuations of
the coherent field--

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.070
all of the fluctuations
we were discussing here--

00:53:43.070 --> 00:53:44.980
had many, many photons.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.010
So to some extent that we have
maybe just a single photon,

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:51.300
and we can only get one
click and not two clicks,

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.130
doesn't measure it.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.180
That doesn't matter here.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.160
All the fluctuations
we considered

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.020
here were fluctuations
in the field, where

00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.370
many, many photons
were involved.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.380
So, therefore, I think
the quantum character

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:06.630
of the measurement process
does not really show up.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.740
If I would construct
something-- other examples--

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:14.860
where we wouldn't always have
this strong local oscillator,

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:16.860
this strong homodyning.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.520
Then I think we
would find quantum

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.460
noise of a single photon,
and then I would say,

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.530
we're getting closer, that's
really quantum measurement.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.620
But here, I would say
the short noise related

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:31.210
to a strong local
oscillator-- at least,

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:33.540
I find it easier for go
through those questions

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.080
if I think about it as a quantum
field, which can be split,

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.850
added up.

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.600
Constructive and
destructive interference.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.910
Good.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:43.650
Questions?

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:45.284
Yes?

00:54:45.284 --> 00:54:47.700
AUDIENCE: So, when we're talking
about [INAUDIBLE], can we

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.780
actually talk about it
without referring to i,

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.613
because that makes me
think of measurements.

00:54:58.144 --> 00:54:59.830
PROFESSOR: You mean
i, as the current?

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:00.455
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.380
PROFESSOR: But we
have to do something.

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.860
OK, what happens is
i was nothing else

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:14.260
than the expectation
value of a dagger a.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:29.660
In other words, whenever we
had a photodiode-- I mean,

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.770
we learn how to
transform modes, and i

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.920
was synonymous to
performing a measurement,

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.200
and the measurement
is a dagger a.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.880
And when we talked
about i squared,

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.010
in order to get the noise,
the operator involved

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.590
was a a dagger, a a dagger.

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.110
I think I will ask you
something about the displaced.

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:02.760
Yeah, it's too nice a problem.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.960
I should ask about the
displaced squeezed vacuum

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.030
in the next problem set.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.050
I really want you to calculate,
maybe with a higher order

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:14.060
term-- it's a three-liner-- in
operators, what is the noise?

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:18.440
And in your calculation,
photodiode will not appear.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.840
What will appear is
"Calculate the expectation

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.440
value of a dagger a.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.472
If you call it a
measurement process,

00:56:26.472 --> 00:56:28.680
it's [? inobservable ?] and
it's an expectation value

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680
of an emission operator.

00:56:44.209 --> 00:56:44.875
Other questions?

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:53.208
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
understand the [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:53.208 --> 00:57:01.176
for a stream of particles,
which [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:01.176 --> 00:57:04.662
with a constant
probability per unit time?

00:57:04.662 --> 00:57:08.646
[INAUDIBLE] The detector
is also [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:16.614 --> 00:57:18.606
I think you also
get the square root.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.970
PROFESSOR: Well, a lot of
classical counting statistics

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:29.380
needs to short noise.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.800
If you have
independent particles

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.290
with a certain probability,
then you get short noise.

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:38.620
But I would sort of
press you hard to make

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.930
a classical explanation for
the last example I gave you,

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.220
where we had a strong
local oscillator.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:50.990
We reflected it and superimposed
it with squeezed vacuum.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:54.710
At that point, all the
short noise has disappeared.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.050
So therefore, I would be
hard-pressed to connect it

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:05.950
with the classical probability
of detecting a photon.

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:09.093
Of course, classically
speaking, the empty part

00:58:09.093 --> 00:58:12.040
of a beam splitter is
empty, and squeezed

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.120
vacuum doesn't
exist classically.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.850
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:18.760
AUDIENCE: So it might be
kind of a silly question,

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.426
but we say we have a
minimum uncertainty

00:58:20.426 --> 00:58:22.962
state when delta x delta p is 0.

00:58:22.962 --> 00:58:24.336
But a lot of times,
we talk about

00:58:24.336 --> 00:58:27.051
the number-phase uncertainty.

00:58:27.051 --> 00:58:29.050
So, I'm just curious,
because the coherent state

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:32.790
has the same circle
of-- the area

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.692
of the circle is
the same, right?

00:58:34.692 --> 00:58:36.150
I know this is
wrong, but can't you

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:39.880
always make the delta
m delta phi uncertainty

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.666
very small by having
a very large n?

00:58:42.666 --> 00:58:46.080
Delta n stays the same, but
the angular spread always

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:51.980
goes down as you make the circle
farther away from the origin?

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.030
PROFESSOR: So you're talking
about an uncertainty relation

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:07.910
we have not discussed.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.840
In the last homework,
you looked at it.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.570
So what happens is if you
have a coherent state,

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:21.680
you would say the phase angle
phi has this uncertainty.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:28.465
And then there's an
uncertainty relation.

00:59:32.027 --> 00:59:34.402
AUDIENCE: Maybe you should
have talked about this problem

00:59:34.402 --> 00:59:35.848
yesterday.

00:59:35.848 --> 00:59:39.704
I think the uncertainty
and the size of the disc

00:59:39.704 --> 00:59:44.668
is constant,
[INAUDIBLE] in alpha.

00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:49.608
But alpha is proportional not
to n, but the square root of n.

00:59:49.608 --> 00:59:55.042
[INAUDIBLE] an arrow propagation
[INAUDIBLE] square root of n.

00:59:58.006 --> 01:00:00.970
If we move the
circle further away,

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:05.416
the uncertainty alpha stays the
same, but the uncertainty of n

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:06.404
goes actually up.

01:00:06.404 --> 01:00:08.380
But we don't see
this [INAUDIBLE],

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.356
because we only have
alpha, not [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.915
PROFESSOR: Yes, you
have to be careful.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:23.500
That's another comment
I wanted to make,

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.990
but thanks for
reminding of that.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:29.212
When we have coherent states,
it looks that the uncertainty

01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:32.360
is always the same,
because it's a disk.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:37.880
But we learned today,
and in the last class

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:41.520
that the uncertainty of the
coherent state when you measure

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.840
the photocurrent
is square root n.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:50.500
What happens is the following:
the uncertainty-- and this is

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:53.510
what I was referring
to-- the uncertainty,

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.920
let's say delta a in one
[? quadrature ?] component, is

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.260
constant for the coherent
state, independent of n.

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.440
But that would mean
what you really

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.120
calculate, when you
calculate the photocurrent,

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.330
is alpha plus delta
a which is constant.

01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:11.080
But then you square it.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.180
In the limit of a
strong coherent state,

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.150
you get alpha squared, which
is the number of photons,

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.940
plus 2 alpha times delta a.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.290
So the delta a,
which is constant,

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:26.800
gets multiplied with
square root n here.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.925
So therefore when you go
to launch a coherent state,

01:01:29.925 --> 01:01:32.480
you increase the
number uncertainty,

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.070
but by the same factor, you
reduce the phase uncertainty.

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:52.950
Well, I thought this
would take half an hour.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:58.110
It took an hour, but I hope
it was time well spent.

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:02.280
So let's get started
on the next unit, which

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.430
is fully dedicated
to single photons.

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:11.630
So after learning
about different aspects

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:14.020
of the electromagnetic
field, we now

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.270
want to focus on
the purest quantum

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:20.810
states, which are
single photons.

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:24.030
And this unit it is
definitely motivated

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.060
by quantum information
processing.

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.110
We want to use control
over single photos

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:33.120
to realize interesting devices.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.200
We talk about beam splitters
and phase shifters,

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.250
but then we put beam splitters
and phase shifters together

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.050
to make Mach-Zehnder
interferometers.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.210
And then eventually
I can show you

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:49.200
how Mach-Zehnder interferometers
with a non-linearity

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.760
can be used to
realize quantum gates.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.280
But let me make maybe
one general comment here.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:05.530
This unit here on single photons
has actually two purposes.

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.530
It tries to give you some
fundamentals, which are really

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.720
necessary to follow recently
literature in quantum

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.660
information science, so
we introduce some concepts

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.820
of gates and truth
tables and such.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.890
But for those of
you who are maybe

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.110
less interested in quantum
information science,

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:29.687
I have to say that as a more
traditional atomic physicist,

01:03:29.687 --> 01:03:32.020
I've never worked in quantum
information science myself.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.325
I started with atomic
molecular spectroscopy,

01:03:34.325 --> 01:03:37.680
and advanced from laser
cooling to quantum gases.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:43.430
I feel that using the
quantum logic formalism

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:47.250
is a very elegant way of
organizing your thoughts.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:50.315
So I do feel even for the
rest of the world, who is not

01:03:50.315 --> 01:03:52.190
doing kind quantum
information process, which

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:54.630
is a pretty big
fraction of AMO science

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:59.740
these days, even
for the rest of us,

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.250
to use concepts of quantum
logic and quantum information

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.900
is very, very powerful.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.030
So in other words, I
would say right now

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:13.970
every atomic physicist should
have some knowledge in what

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.440
happens to beam splitters, what
happens to singular photons

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.570
when they're manipulating,
and the way, the approach,

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.690
how we formulate it using
concepts of quantum information

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:26.430
processing is
extremely powerful.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.610
Like in quantum
mechanics, you need

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:30.530
to know the Schrodinger
representation

01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:32.340
and the Heisenberg
interpretation.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.850
You can't get away with one.

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:38.090
Similarly, for some aspects
of the propagation of quantum

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:41.040
states, you should just use the
language of quantum information

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.870
processing.

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.300
Just sort of to give you
already an outlook where

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.820
I think everything
comes together,

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.790
I've taught for 15
years, 20 years,

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:53.720
about decoherence
and master equation.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.540
And I know how to derive it
from general quantum physics,

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.960
and I will show you that
later in this course.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.910
But then I learned from
Professor Ike Chuang,

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:02.980
when I co-taught
the course with him,

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.630
that he could actually make
a model for decoherence

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:10.540
by just passing light through
many, many beams splitters.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.120
So there is a beam
splitter model

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.500
for decoherence, which
is just beautiful.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.010
You can give derive a master
equation by just sending light

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.120
through many, many
beams splitters.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.410
So that taught me something,
that actually those

01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:27.520
was elementary devices for
quantum information science can

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:31.160
really act as conceptual
models for more complicated,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.940
more general things.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.370
So I've decided now,
over the last few years,

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.530
to make quantum
information language

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:42.370
an essential ingredient
of this course.

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.770
But I should say over
the last couple of years,

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:49.220
I've de-emphasized some of the
more formal algorithmic things,

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.240
but I'm focusing
on the concepts.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.740
And I think some
concepts are really

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.230
highlighted by using
quantum information aspects.

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:59.170
So with that
introduction, we want

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:02.360
to talk about single photons.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:10.060
And I want to introduce for
you the single photon qubit.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:15.610
Now, [INAUDIBLE] would think, if
you talk about single photons,

01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:18.850
you automatically
have one qubit.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:20.910
0 is no photon.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.740
One is the single photon state.

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.120
We make in addition
later on, this

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.740
is not the most
robust qubit, because

01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:43.110
if, due to unavoidable losses
or limited quantum efficiency,

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:45.380
you have one photon,
and you lose it,

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.970
you think the bit
has been flipped.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.900
So you don't want
to really use that,

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:55.376
but we will use, in a
moment, a single photon

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:57.190
in two different quantum states.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:00.010
And then, if you detect zero,
you know you've lost it.

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:03.520
We will talk about one photon,
which is either here or there.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.260
And this is zero of
our qubit, and this

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.750
would be one of our qubit.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.110
But we will come to that later.

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.720
I first need the Hilbert
space of zero one

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.120
to introduce a few
things, and then we'll

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:23.930
use what we've learned to define
the dual-rail single photon

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:26.050
state.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.985
But for now we don't have
to make this distinction.

01:07:31.775 --> 01:07:33.150
The question we
want to answer is

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:42.940
what happens when
those states pass

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.090
through optical components.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.800
I want to show you how
beam splitters and phase

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.940
shifters can be used-- very
simple optical components--

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:05.690
they can be used to realize
an arbitrary single qubit

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:08.040
operation.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.370
And then we introduce
non-linear interferometers,

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:13.890
and we get two qubit operations.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:23.869
So let's start out very simple
and talk about phase shifters

01:08:23.869 --> 01:08:24.660
and beam splitters.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:34.779
And this is pretty
much how far we

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:38.950
will get today in this chapter.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:52.399
Well, if you have a single
photon and time passes on,

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:55.479
the single photon
gets phase shifted.

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:19.706
If you pass it through
a dispersive medium,

01:09:19.706 --> 01:09:21.080
it will have
another phase shift.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:31.649
So this is how phase
shifts can be realized.

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:35.950
But there is one caveat, and
that immediately tells us

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:39.640
we can't get away with just
a single photon in one fiber

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:42.140
and phase shifting it,
because everything phase

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.040
shifts a photon.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.120
Time and everything which
is in the beam path.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.109
So whenever we talk about the
phase, we need a reference.

01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.220
So therefore, we're
immediately drawn

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:06.720
that one mode and one
photon is not enough,

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.216
even if you're interested
in one-photon gates,

01:10:09.216 --> 01:10:09.965
we need two modes.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.995
Just think about two wave
guides or two optical fibers.

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:31.310
We call them mode A and B.
If you put one photon in--

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:35.530
and this is now the symbol for
a phase shifter, a little box

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:45.670
with the letter
phi-- then we get

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:48.900
a phase shift of the state one.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.380
And the second mode A
acts as a reference mode

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:55.050
to detect the shift
of phase, let's say

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:58.590
by interfering the two photons.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:05.650
So in general, we
have an input state,

01:11:05.650 --> 01:11:08.580
and we obtain an output state,
which has a phase shift.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.315
We'll come back to
phase shifters later.

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.110
So we'll have two modes.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:36.220
The next thing we can do
is we can combine modes,

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.850
and this is done
with a beam splitter.

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:40.810
So we've talked
about beam splitters

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.280
in the context of
homodyne detection.

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:45.300
We've talked about
beams splitters most

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.650
of the first hour with
a clicker question,

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:51.590
and I was mainly referring
to the beam splitter

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.000
before in a rather
non-formal way.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.720
If you've a 50:50 beam splitter,
and you have two inputs,

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.230
you get a symmetric and
antisymmetric combination

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:03.200
of the two, if it's a
50:50 beam splitter.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.790
What else can you get?

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:10.410
Or, I used the concept of just
reflection and transmission

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:11.240
coefficients.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.270
I think that's all important
to get an intuitive

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:14.820
feel for the beam splitter.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.550
But now I use a more
rigorous approach.

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:21.960
I have a beam splitter,
which is characterized

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.955
by an angle theta.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.630
We will later find
out what theta is.

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:35.060
And we have an input mode A
and a second input mode B,

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:37.540
and those modes get mixed now.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:43.260
We have output modes B prime
and output modes A prime.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:47.360
And we can use the
Schrodinger picture

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.270
and talk about the photon
states in those modes,

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.790
but I prefer to use
the Heisenberg picture,

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:55.770
so when I put A, A
prime, B and B prime in,

01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:59.760
just think about
annihilation operators which

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.730
annihilate photons
in those modes.

01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:08.301
So what I postulate
is that this system

01:13:08.301 --> 01:13:10.050
is described by the
following Hamiltonian.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.450
And I'm sort of telling
you, this Hamiltonian

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.500
describes this beam splitter.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.910
You will say, why and how?

01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:32.020
Well, I will tell you what this
Hamiltonian does to the modes,

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.090
and then we have the
quantum description

01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:37.840
of the beams splitter, and you
will then see in your homework

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.870
that this quantum description
of the beam splitter

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:45.230
does exactly what it is expected
to do to coherent states.

01:13:45.230 --> 01:13:47.230
It just splits a
laser beam into two,

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.800
with a reflection and
transmission coefficient

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.510
which are cosine squared
theta and sine squared theta.

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:57.120
And I will also show you that
this beam splitter is doing

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.640
the same, splitting
with cosine squared

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.210
and sine squared theta
probabilities, a single photon.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.760
So in essence, I give
you the Hamiltonian,

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.470
I discuss that the
transfer matrix, which

01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:12.670
is built upon this Hamiltonian,
does everything you ever

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:15.460
wanted a beam splitter to do,
and therefore you can say,

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.470
this defines the beam splitter.

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.610
OK, if you have a
Hamiltonian, that

01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:30.990
means after propagating
through the Hamiltonian,

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.810
we have the following transfer.

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:38.170
You may be familiar with
putting the unitary time

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:40.790
evolution here, and the
time which has elapsed,

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:43.760
but we are always
using a fixed time

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.300
after the light has
transformed the beam splitter.

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.600
So you can see the
time t is absorbed

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.830
in the definition of
h, the Hamiltonian,

01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:59.930
and b is really the unitary
time evolution from [? being ?]

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:01.980
before and [? being ?]
after the beam splitter.

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:09.740
So the transformation,
which transforms the modes

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:15.070
at this beam splitter, has now
the following unitary operator.

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:26.250
And we have modes a,
b, mode one and two,

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.700
before the beam splitter.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.370
After the beam
splitter, they have

01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.680
been transformed to
a prime and b prime.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:37.840
And we obtain that by
taking the input modes

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.910
and doing unitary
time evolution.

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:44.930
You do simply the
operator transformation

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:47.560
for unitary transformation.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.130
So we can now transform
the operators a and b.

01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:59.056
I'm not going with you
through the exercise

01:15:59.056 --> 01:16:00.305
how you transform an operator.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:06.740
I think in undergraduate
quantum mechanics classes,

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:09.300
you do the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:14.680
formula, how to use with
operators in the exponent.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.560
And if you do with that,
you find-- not surprisingly,

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.420
a beam splitter is a linear
element-- that what you get

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.640
is a linear
combination of a and b.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.770
So if you don't like me
postulating an operator

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.400
and saying, "Believe me,
this is a beam splitter,"

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.240
you can reverse engineer.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.020
You can say, this really looks
like the modes, the operators

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:01.720
a b get linearly superposed
with cosine and sine.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.100
This is what a beam splitter
does, is it mixes two modes.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.320
And then you can reverse
engineer and figure out

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.440
that it's exactly the
Hamiltonian above which

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:09.940
does it.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.110
So your homework will show
that this happens exactly

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:18.580
for coherent states.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:21.350
So if you've a coherent
state with alpha,

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.545
you get a coherent state with
alpha cosine theta in one arm,

01:17:24.545 --> 01:17:27.020
and alpha sine theta
in the other arm,

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:31.090
and you will see that
everything works beautifully.

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:40.380
I have to use one convention
now for a 50:50 beam splitter.

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.980
And I use a convention
that I chose theta

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:48.670
to be pi over 2
b and 90 degrees.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:52.980
And we want to use
symbolic language,

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:56.600
because we want to draw
diagrams of multiple beam

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.630
splitters and such.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:10.130
So this tilted square is the
symbol for beam splitter.

01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:15.040
We have input ports a
and b on the left side.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:22.440
We have output ports, which
are now b prime and a prime.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:27.450
And for the 50:50 beam
splitter, the modes

01:18:27.450 --> 01:18:38.310
are symmetric and
antisymmetric superpositions.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:43.930
So this is the symbol for
the unitary transformation b.

01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:47.640
And since one output port has a
minus sign, it's antisymmetric,

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.410
and one is positive.

01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:52.824
We usually put a dot there
which distinguishes the two

01:18:52.824 --> 01:18:53.490
different ports.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:05.020
So this is the operator B.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:10.840
We have already used, for
the unitary transformation,

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.860
the operator b dagger.

01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:34.360
So for the operator b dagger,
using the equations above,

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.140
we have input modes a
b, but what happens now

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.290
is for the operator b
dagger, the output modes

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:44.350
are interchanged.

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:47.200
So we have a plus b over
square root a, a minus b

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.680
over square root 2, and
therefore the symbol

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.435
for b dagger has the dot here.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:10.150
I just want to warn you
that there are other phase

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:13.670
conventions in the literature
which are equivalent.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:16.440
But sometimes if you read a
paper and all of the minus

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.170
signs appear somewhere
else, well, people

01:20:19.170 --> 01:20:20.950
have a different
phase convention.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:27.190
You can postulate that
you have a beam splitter

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:32.020
without having the i here.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.530
And everything works similarly.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:38.590
It's just that, for
instance, in this equation,

01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:40.640
you get an i here.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.900
So imaginary units
and plus-minus signs

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:46.640
and that busyness are
phase conversations.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.850
If you'd say, hey, but if
you another definition,

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:51.080
don't you have
another beam splitter?

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.030
Yes, it is another
beam splitter,

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:56.740
but I can always get it out
of my beam splitter-- which

01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:59.370
now is our beam splitter--
by putting a phase

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.670
shifter afterwards.

01:21:00.670 --> 01:21:04.390
So it doesn't limit the
generality of the discussion

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:08.200
by defining our beam
splitter in this way.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.520
OK, time is over.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.120
Reminder, we have another
class this week on Friday,

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.576
and finally, your
graded homework is here.

01:21:15.576 --> 01:21:17.980
Have a good afternoon.
