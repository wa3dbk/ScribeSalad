00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.410
PROFESSOR: --equal
forces of light.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.060
But before we get
started with it,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.860
do you have any question
about the last lecture, which

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.360
was on open quantum system--
Quantum Monte Carlo methods--

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.530
and in particular, the
conceptual things we discussed

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.760
is what happens when
you do a measurement,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.330
or when you don't
detect a photon,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.010
how does it change
the wave function?

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.055
And this was
actually at the heart

00:00:48.055 --> 00:00:51.020
of realizing similar
quantum systems,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.870
and simulating them using
quantum Monte Carlo methods.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.600
Any question?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.441
Any points for discussion?

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:01.940
OK.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.630
Today is, actually
conceptually, a simple lecture,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.790
because I'm not
really introducing

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.870
some subtleties of
quantum physics.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.500
We know our Hamiltonian--
the dipole Hamiltonian--

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.900
this is the fully
quantized Hamiltonian,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.940
how atoms interact with
the electromagnetic field.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.500
And, of course,
it's fully quantized

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.360
because E perpendicular
is the operator

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.610
of the quantized
electromagnetic field,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.790
and it's the sum of
a plus a [? dega. ?]

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.040
But when it comes to forces,
it's actually fairly simple.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.560
We don't introduce
anything else.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.080
This is our Hamiltonian.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.410
This is the energy.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.790
And the force is nothing
else than the gradient

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.320
of this energy.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
So I decided it today--
it's rather unusual--

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.170
but I will have everything
pre-written, because I think

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.185
the concentration of new
ideas is not so high today,

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:06.160
so I want to go a
little bit faster.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.545
But I invite everybody
if you slow me down

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:10.295
if you think I'm going
too fast and if you

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:12.710
think I'm skipping something.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.950
Also another
justification is at least

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.150
the first 30%, 40%
of this lecture,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.970
you've already done as a
homework assignment, when

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.290
you looked at the classical
limit of mechanical forces.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.580
You actually had
already, as a preparation

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.960
for this class, a
homework assignment

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.440
on the spontaneous scattering
force and the stimulated dipole

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.450
force.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.940
PROFESSOR: Well, the
only subtlety today

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.130
is how do we deal
with a fully quantized

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.040
electromagnetic field?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.660
But what I want to show you
in the next few minutes is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.810
in the end, we actually
do approximations

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.430
that the quantized
electromagnetic field pretty

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.560
much disappears
from the equation.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.900
We have a classical field.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.260
And then, almost everything
you have done in your homework

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.240
directly applies.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.860
The only other thing we do
today is the dipole moment.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.500
Well, we use, for the
dipole moment of the atom,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.770
the solution of the
Optical Bloch Equation.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.530
So I think now you
know already everything

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.655
we do in the first
30, 40 minutes.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.650
PROFESSOR: So we get rid of
all of the quantum character

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.870
of the electromagnetic
field in two stages.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.900
One is the following,
well, we want

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.760
to describe the interactions
of atoms with laser fields.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.080
And that means the
electromagnetic field

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.110
is in a coherent state.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.850
And you know from
several weeks ago,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.840
the coherent state
is a superposition

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.050
of a [INAUDIBLE] states,
coherent superposition

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.520
and such, so they're
really photons inside.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.710
It's a fully quantized
description of the laser beam.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.450
But now-- and this is something
if you're not familiar,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.170
you should really
look up-- there

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.360
is an exact canonical
transformation

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.060
where you transform
your Hamiltonian--

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.670
you do, so to speak, a
basis transformation--

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.430
to another Hamiltonian.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.100
And the result is, after
this unitary transformation,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.510
the coherent state is
transformed to the vacuum

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.000
state.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.510
So in other words, the
quantized electromagnetic field

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.140
is no longer in
the coherent state,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.330
it's in the vacuum state.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.000
But what appears
instead is a purely

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.670
classical electromagnetic field.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.270
A c number.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.250
So you can sort of say--
I'm waving my hands now--

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.970
the coherent state
is the vacuum,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.760
with a displacement operator.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.420
All the quantumness of
the electromagnetic field

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.130
is in the vacuum
state, and that's

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.940
something we have
to keep because this

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.300
is responsible for
spontaneous emission quantum

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.100
fluctuations and such.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.080
But the displacement
operator, which

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.130
gives us an arbitrary
coherent state, that

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.807
can be absorbed by
completely treating

00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:13.390
the electromagnetic
field classically.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.520
So therefore, we take the fully
quantized electromagnetic field

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.000
and we replace it now by a
classical field, and simply

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120
the vacuum fluctuation.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.690
So there are no
photons around anymore.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.770
There is the vacuum ready
to absorb the photons,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.470
and then there's a classical
electromagnetic field,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.980
which drives the atoms.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.980
And, of course, the classical
electromagnetic field

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.740
is not changing because
of absorption emission,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.860
because it's a c number
in our Hamiltonian.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.400
So this is an important
conceptual step,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.030
and it's the first
step in how we

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.965
get rid of the quantum nature
of the electromagnetic field

00:05:58.965 --> 00:06:01.060
when it interacts with
atoms mechanically.

00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:05.560
OK.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.365
So, by the way, everything
I'm telling you today--

00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:15.270
actually, in the
first half of today--

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.840
can be found in
Atom-Photon Interaction.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.770
Now, so this takes
care actually,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.300
of most of the
electromagnetic field.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.210
We come back to
that in a moment.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.440
The next thing is we want
to use the full quantum

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.060
solution for the
atomic dipole operator,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.660
and that means we want
to remind ourselves

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.780
of the solution of the
Optical Bloch Equations.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:45.741
PROFESSOR: Now, talking about
the Optical Bloch Equations,

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:49.020
I just have to remind you
of what we did in class,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.520
but I have to apologize
it's a little bit

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.320
exercise in notation.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.690
Because in Atom-Photon
Interaction

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.350
they use a slightly
different notation then

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.250
you find in other sources.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.990
On the other hand, I think
I've nicely prepared for you,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.080
and I give you the
translation table.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.180
In Atom-Photon Interaction,
they regard the Bloch vector,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.070
and we have introduced
the components, u, v,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.830
and w, as a
fictitious spin, 1/2.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.130
Therefore, you find with this
kind of old-fashioned letters,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.880
Sx, Sy, Sc, in
Atom-Photon Interaction.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.710
The other thing, if
you open the book,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.100
Atom-Photon Interaction
is that their operators,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.620
density matrix-- the atomic
density matrix-- sigma,

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.990
and sigma head.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.830
One is in the rotating frame,
and one is in the lab frame.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.500
So we have to go back
and forth to do that,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.790
but the result is
fairly trivial.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.100
So this is simply
the definition.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.700
First of all, the density
matrix is the full description

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.660
of the atomic
system, but instead

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.020
of dealing with matrix
elements of the density matrix,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.240
it's more convenient
for two level system

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.160
to use a fictitious spin
or the Bloch vector.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.160
So the important equation--
the are the Optical Block

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.990
Equations-- is the
equation A20 in API.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.020
And it's simply the first
order differential equation

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.370
for the components
of the Optical Bloch

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.070
vector, u v, and w.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.549
Notation is as usual,
the laser detuning,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.600
delta L. Omega 1 is the
[INAUDIBLE] frequency.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.669
And this is the
parametrization of

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:44.520
the classical electromagnetic
field which drives the system.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.360
Now, this equation is
identical to the equation

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.790
we discussed in the unit on
solutions of Optical Bloch

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.720
Equations.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.790
We just called the
[INAUDIBLE] frequency, g,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.240
delta L was called delta.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.620
And then, vectors
of 2r was confusing.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.290
The components, [? r,x,y,z, ?]
are two times u, v, w.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.540
And the reason for
that is some people

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.490
prefer that it
represents spin 1/2,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.240
so they want to
normalize things to 1/2.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.330
Or if you want to
have unit vectors,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.770
your throw in a vector of two.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.450
But that is all, so if you're
confused about a vector of two,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.390
it's exactly this substitution
which has been made.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.950
So these are the Optical Bloch
Equations, and what we need now

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.195
is the solution.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.380
What we need now is the
solution for the dipole moment,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.390
because it is the
dipole moment which

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.420
is responsible for
the mechanical forces.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.460
The dipole operator is, of
course, the non-diagonal matrix

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.560
elements, the coherencies
of the density matrix.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.640
So all we want to take now
from the previous unit,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.750
the expectation value of
the dipole moment, which

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.071
is nothing else than the trace
of the statistical operator

00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:18.695
with the operator of
the dipole moment.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.250
At this point, just
to guide you through,

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:31.540
we go from the lab frame-- from
the density matrix in the lab

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.510
frame-- to the density
matrix in the rotating frame,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.960
and this is when the
laser frequency appears,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.530
is into the i omega l t.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.240
And therefore, we want
to describe things

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.500
in the lab frame.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:50.380
If you use the u and v
part of the Optical Bloch

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.140
vector obtained in the rotating
frame, in the lab frame

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.580
everything rotates at
the laser frequency.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.330
If you drive an atom, if you
drive a harmonic oscillator

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.390
with a laser frequency,
the harmonic oscillator

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.720
responds at the laser frequency,
not at the atomic frequency.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.940
We discussed that a while ago.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.640
So therefore, the
dipole moment oscillates

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.690
at the laser frequency.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.510
And their two components, u
and v-- since our laser field

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:30.330
was parametrized by definition--
epsilon 0 times cosine omega t.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.595
We have now nicely separated,
through the Optical Bloch

00:11:33.595 --> 00:11:37.750
vector the in phase part
of the dipole moment,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.470
and the in quadrature
phase of dipole moment.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.840
If you didn't pay attention
what I said the last five

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.430
minutes, that's OK, you
can just start here,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.230
saying the expectation value
of the dipole moment oscillates

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.010
with a laser frequency.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.930
And as for any harmonic
oscillator, or harmonic

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.770
oscillator type system,
there is one component

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:01.432
which is in phase,
and one component

00:12:01.432 --> 00:12:02.390
which is in quadrature.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.760
Fast forward.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.910
OK.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.020
And you know from any
harmonic oscillator,

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:20.970
when it comes to
the absorbed power,

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.990
that it's only the
quadrature component which

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.420
absorbs the power.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.410
And you can immediately
see that when

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.140
we say-- just use what
is written in black

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.500
now-- the energy is nothing
else than the charge

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.960
times the displacement.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.930
When we divide by
delta t, you'll

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:49.070
find that the absorbed
power is the electric field

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.410
times the derivative
of the dipole moment.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.220
Well, if you ever
reach over one cycle,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.710
we are only interested
in d dot, which

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.630
oscillates with cosine omega t.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:08.360
But that means since it's d dot,
d oscillates with sine omega t.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.200
And this was the in
quadrature component, v.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.500
So it is only the part, v, of
the Optical Bloch vector which

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.990
is responsible for
exchanging energy

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.694
with the electromagnetic field.

00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:31.070
And we can also, by dividing
by the energy of a photon,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.490
find out what is the
number of absorbed photons.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.810
But we did that already when
we discussed Optical Bloch

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.309
Equations.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:43.160
OK, so that was our look back
on the Optical Bloch Equation,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.940
the solution for the
oscillating dipole moment,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.080
and now we are ready to
put everything together.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.800
So we want to know the force.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.140
The force, using Heisenberg's
Equation of Motion

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.340
for the momentum derivative
is the expectation value

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:08.180
of the operator, which is the
gradient of the Hamiltonian.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.820
OK.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.460
So now we have to take the
gradient of the Hamiltonian.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.250
This is the only
expression, actually,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.405
today, I would've liked to just
write it down, and build it

00:14:19.405 --> 00:14:20.470
up piece by piece.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.520
But let me step you through.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.085
We want to take the gradient.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.920
The dipole operator of the atom
does not have an r dependence,

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.830
it's just x on the
atom, wherever it is.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:40.130
But the gradient with respect
to the center of mass position

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.870
from the atoms comes
from the operator

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.450
of the electromagnetic field.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.520
So in other words,
what this involves

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.430
is the gradient of the
operator of the fully quantized

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.300
electromagnetic field.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.770
But we have already written
at the electromagnetic field

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:05.080
as an external
electromagnetic field--

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.640
classical electromagnetic
field-- plus a vacuum

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.050
fluctuations.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.980
But the vacuum
fluctuations are symmetric.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.980
There is nothing which
tells vacuum fluctuations

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.600
what is left and what is right.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.580
So therefore, the
derivative only

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.840
acts on the classical
electromagnetic field.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.880
So this is how we
have now, you know,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.260
we first throw out
the coherent state,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.980
and now we throw out
the vacuum state.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.465
And therefore, it is
only the classical part

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.790
of the electromagnetic
field which

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.790
is responsible for the forces.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:51.380
Now we make one way assumption
which greatly simplifies it.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.570
R is the center of mass
position of the atom,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.790
and we have to take the
electromagnetic field

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.500
as the center of mass position.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.200
And if the atom is
localized-- wave packet

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.480
with a long [? dipole ?]
wave-- we sort of

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.350
have to involve the
atomic wave function

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.800
when we evaluate this operator
of the electromagnetic field.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.970
However, if the
atom is very well

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:20.262
localized-- you would
actually want the atom

00:16:20.262 --> 00:16:26.170
to be localized to within
an optical wave length--

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.455
then, under those
circumstances, you

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:33.610
can replace the
parameter, r, which

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.990
is a position of the atom, by
the center of the atomic wave

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.430
packet.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.900
So therefore, the
kind of wave nature

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.690
of the atoms--
which means the atom

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:47.500
is smeared out-- as long as
this wave packet is small,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.520
compared to the
wave lengths, you

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.030
can just evaluate the
electromagnetic field

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.380
at the center of
the wave packet.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:04.290
This assumption
requires-- since the scale

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.040
of the electromagnetic field
is set by the wave lengths--

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.760
this requires that the
atom is localized better

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.680
than an optical wave length.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.310
And that would mean
that the energy

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.130
of the atom, or the
temperature, has

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.230
to be larger than
the recoil in it.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.980
And if you're localized the,
to within a wave length,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.760
your momentum spread is larger,
by Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.970
Relation than h bar
k, and that means

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.270
your energy is larger
than the recoil energy.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:39.690
So if you want to have
a description or light

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:46.660
forces in that limit, you may
have to revise this point.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.210
But for most of laser cooling,
when you start with a hot cloud

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.850
and cool it down to
micro-Kelvin temperatures,

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.360
this is very [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.870
Colin?

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.578
AUDIENCE: Vacuum field
doesn't contribute

00:17:57.578 --> 00:18:01.434
in sort of in the sense that
the expectation value is zero.

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:05.772
But wouldn't the rms
value be non-zero?

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:08.510
So what's the--?

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.550
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.840
I mean, in the end, you
will see that in a moment,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.230
when we talk about
cooling limits,

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.680
fluctuations, spontaneous
emission, provides heating.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.980
It doesn't contribute
if you want

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.210
to find the expectation
value for the force.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.220
The vacuum and the
fluctuations-- I mean,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.380
that's also logical-- the
vacuum has only fluctuations,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.910
it has no net force.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.940
But the fluctuation's heat.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.200
And for heating, it
will be very important.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.156
But we'll come to that
in a little bit later.

00:18:42.156 --> 00:18:43.530
AUDIENCE: So what
is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:52.229 --> 00:18:55.130
PROFESSOR: If the
light is squeezed, yes.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.490
That's a whole different thing.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.920
We really assumed here that the
light is in a coherent state.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.976
Now--

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:08.420
AUDIENCE: The transformation
that we had [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:24.820
PROFESSOR: Well, you know,
you can squeeze the vacuum.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.020
And then it's squeezed.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.375
But there's so few
photons, you can't really

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.860
laser cool with that.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.530
So the only way how you
could possibly laser cool

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.720
is if you take the squeezed
vacuum, and displace it.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.230
So now you have, instead
of a little circle,

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.190
which is a coherent
state, you have

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.540
an ellipse, which is displaced.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.500
I haven't done the
math-- maybe that would

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.820
be an excellent homework
assignment for the next time I

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.570
teach the course--
you could probably

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.340
show that the displacement
operator, which is now

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.350
displacing the squeezed vacuum,
again can be transformed

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.940
into a c number,
and the ellipse this

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.610
squeezed vacuum
fluctuation-- the ellipse has

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.540
an even symmetry, has an 180
degree rotation symmetry.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:20.400
And I could imagine that it will
not contribute to the force.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.020
So in other words, if you have
a displaced, squeezed vacuum,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.510
my gut feeling is nothing
would change here.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.570
But what would change,
aren't the fluctuations,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.730
but which would possibly
change is the heating.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:45.250
OK, so we within
those approximations,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.050
Heisenberg's Equation
of Motion for the force

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.290
becomes an equation
for the acceleration

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.140
for the atomic wave packet.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.080
And it involves now, two terms.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.910
One is the atomic
dipole moment as

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.890
obtained from the
Optical Bloch Equations,

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.750
and the other one
is nothing else

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:10.310
than the gradient of
the classical part

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.880
of the electromagnetic field.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.270
And with that we are pretty
much at the equations which

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.270
you looked at in your
homework assignment, which

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.220
was a classical model
for the light force.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.980
Because this part is
completely classical,

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.340
and the only quantum
aspect which we still have

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.830
is that we evaluate
the dipole moment,

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.070
not necessarily, it's just a
driven harmonic oscillator.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.520
When we take the
Optical Bloch Equations,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:45.530
we will also find saturation
a two-level system can

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.290
be saturated, whereas a
harmonic oscillator can never

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:50.880
be saturated.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.730
So let me just repeat,
so this is completely

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.730
classical except
for the expectation

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:57.970
value for the dipole moment.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.910
But for no excitation,
of course-- and we've

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.310
discussed it many, many
times-- a two-level system

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.065
is nothing else for
weak excitation,

00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:08.870
than a weakly excited
harmonic oscillator.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.240
So then we are
completely classical.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.175
But we want to discuss
also saturation and that's

00:22:14.175 --> 00:22:16.880
been the Optical Bloch
Equations, of course, come

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.580
in very handy.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.220
OK.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.130
Next approximation,
we want to know--

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.630
approximate-- the dipole
moment-- the expectation

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:38.680
value of the dipole moment--
with the steady state solution.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.882
The steady state solution--
analytic expression--

00:22:40.882 --> 00:22:43.340
we just plug it in, and you
can have a wonderful discussion

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.900
about light forces.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.940
The question is, are
we allowed to do that?

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.520
Now I hope you'll remember
that's actually one reason why

00:22:51.520 --> 00:23:01.300
I did that when we discussed
the master equation.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.960
And we discussed an [? atomic ?]
[? cavity. ?] I introduced

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.600
to you the adiabatic
elimination of variables.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.240
We adiabatically
eliminated [? of dipole ?]

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.700
matrix elements.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.410
Whenever you have something
which relaxes sufficiently

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:21.370
fast, and you're not interested
in this short time scale,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.750
you can always say, I
replace this quantity

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.430
by its steady state value.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:33.040
Steady state with regard to
the slowly changing parameter.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.820
And we want to do
exactly the same here.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.170
So let me just translate.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.090
It's the same idea,
exactly the same idea,

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:40.460
but let me translate.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:47.000
If an atom moves, we have two
aspects, two times [? case. ?]

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.330
One is the motion of the atom.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.690
The atom may change
its velocity.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:57.160
The atom may move from an
area of strong electric field

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.700
to an area of weak
electric field.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.280
But this is really all that
is related to the motion,

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.840
to the change of momentum
of a heavy object.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.620
But now inside the atoms,
you play with the, you know,

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.340
Bloch vector, excited state.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:15.930
If the electric
field is higher, you

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.050
have a larger population
in the excited

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.760
state than in the ground state.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.520
But this usually adjusts with
the damping time of gamma,

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.070
with a spontaneous
emission rate.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.030
And that's usually very fast.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.840
So you can make
the assumption when

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.650
an atom moves to a changing
electric field, at every point

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.910
in the electric field,
it very, very quickly--

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.910
the dipole moment--
assumes the steady state

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:45.780
solution for the
local electric field.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.870
And this would now be called
an adiabatic elimination

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:52.320
of the dynamics of the atom.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.630
And we simply replace
the expectation value

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:02.219
for the dipole moment by
the steady state solution

00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:03.510
of the Optical Bloch Equations.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.350
Well, this is, of
course, an approximation.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.175
And I want to take
this approximation

00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:18.190
and who you what
simple conclusions we

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.150
can draw from that.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.690
But I also want
you to know, I mean

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.560
this is what I focus
off in this course,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.380
to sort of think about
them and get a feel where

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.520
those approximations break down.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.650
So this approximation requires
that the internal motion, that

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.780
this, you know,
two-level physics,

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.120
that the internal
density matrix,

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.940
it has a relaxation
rate of gamma.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.520
Whereas the external
motion, we will actually

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.820
see that very soon when we talk
about molasses and damping,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:54.640
has a characteristic
damping time which

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.740
is one over the recoil energy.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.890
The recoiled energy
involves the mass.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.480
The heavier the object, the
slower is the damping time.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.860
It has all the right scaling.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.360
And you will actually
see in the data

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.680
today, that we will naturally
obtain this as the time scale

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.140
over which atomic
motions is changing.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:22.690
So, is that approximation,
this hierarchy of time scales,

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.470
is that usually fulfilled?

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.380
It is fulfilled in almost all
of the atoms you are working on.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.410
For instance, in sodium, the
ratio of those two time scales

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.110
is 400.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.670
But if you push it,
you will find examples

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.390
like, helium in the
triplets statement--

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.140
metastable helium in the triplet
state-- where the two time

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.590
scales are comparable.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:56.110
Helium is a very light,
so therefore, it's

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.450
faster for a light atom to
change its motion by exchanging

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.670
momentum with
electromagnetic field.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.290
And at the same time,
the transition in helium

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:09.750
is narrower, and
therefore slower.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.980
So for metastable helium, the
two time scales are comparable.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.260
| if you really want to do
quantitative experiments

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:24.110
with metastable helium, you may
need a more complicated theory.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.990
But, of course, if something
is sort of simple in one case,

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.760
the richer situation
provides another opportunity

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.810
for research.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.580
And I know, for instance,
Hal Metcalf, a good colleague

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.540
and friend of mine,
he focused for a while

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.690
on studying laser cooling
of metastable helium,

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.800
because he was
interested what happens

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.030
if those simple approximations
don't work anymore?

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.059
Then the internal motion
and the external motion

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:54.350
becomes sort of more entangled.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.710
You have to treat them together,
you cannot separate them

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.840
by a hierarchy of time scales.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.130
Any questions about that?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.760
OK, now we have done, you know,
everything which is complicated

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.870
has been approximated away now.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.718
And now we have a
very simple result.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.780
So I'm pretty much
repeating what

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:34.510
you have done your homework,
but now with expressions which

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:40.480
have still the quantum character
of the Optical Bloch Equations.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.580
So let's assume that we have
an external electric field.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:29:03.250
it's parametrized like that, and
at this point, by providing it

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.310
like this, I leave it open
whether we have a standing

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.630
wave-- if you have a
traveling wave, of course,

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.860
we have a phase
factor, kr, here--

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.900
if you have a standing wave, we
don't have this phase factor.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.970
So I have parametrized
the electromagnetic field

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:24.780
in such a way that we can
derive a general expression.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.490
And then we will discuss what
happens in a traveling wave,

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:29.990
and what happens
in a standing wave.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:38.090
I make one more assumption here,
namely that the polarization

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.032
is independent of position.

00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:43.480
I'm just lazy if
I take derivatives

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.760
of the electric field.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.920
I want to take a derivative
with the amplitude

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.450
of the electric
field, and I want

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.040
to take a derivative
of the phase

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.740
of the electromagnetic field.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.070
I do not want to take a
derivative of the polarization.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.800
Of course, what I'm
throwing out here,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.190
is all of the interesting
cooling mechanisms

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.460
of polarization
gradient cooling, when

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.790
the polarization
of the light field

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.330
spirals around in
three dimensions.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.550
We'll talk a little bit
about that later on,

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:11.614
I just want to keep
things simple here.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.320
OK, so now if you
take the gradient

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.100
of the electromagnetic
field, finally, we

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.200
have approximated
everything which

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.870
complicates our life away.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.320
And we have two terms.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.920
One is the gradient
x on the amplitude

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.080
of the electromagnetic field,
or the gradient x on the phase.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.960
And since we have taken
a derivative, when

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.890
we take the derivative
of the phase,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:47.150
because of the chain rule,
the cosine changes into sine.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.230
So therefore, the gradient
of the electromagnetic field

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.920
has a cosine in phase and
an in quadrature component.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.150
And now, for the force,
we have to multiply

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.510
this with the dipole moment.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.240
And, of course, we
will average over

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.120
one cycle of the
electromagnetic wave.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.260
And, of course, that's
what we discussed.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.970
There's is a u and v component
of the Bloch vector, which

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.980
gives rise to an in phase
and in quadrature component

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:18.720
of the dipole moment.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.060
And now, if you combine--
if you multiply--

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:29.860
the gradient of the electric
field with the dipole moment,

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.940
and average.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.250
The cosine part goes
with the cosine part,

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.220
the sine part goes
with the sine part,

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.910
and the cos terms average out.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.130
So therefore, we have
the simple result

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.710
that we have two
contributions to the [? old ?]

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.530
mechanical force of light.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:55.280
And the u component--
the in phase component--

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.110
of the dipole moment goes with
the amplitude of the gradient.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.910
And the in quadrature
component goes

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:05.900
with the gradient of the phase.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.100
So in other words, when
it comes to light forces,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.640
the cosine component
and the sine component

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.160
of the dipole moment
talk, actually,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.590
to two different
quantities associated

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.280
with the electromagnetic field.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.860
It's just in phase
and in quadrature.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.430
OK.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:36.920
Now I just have to tell you
a few definitions and names.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.640
This component, which goes
with the in phase component,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.160
is called the reactive force.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:49.060
Whereas the other one is
called the dissipative force.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.010
The name, of course, comes
that if you have a harmonic

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.860
oscillator, the component
which oscillates in quadrature

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.050
absorbs directly energy,
whereas the in phase component

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.480
does not absorb energy.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.500
I'll leave it for
a little bit later

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.770
in our discussion how you
can have a force and not

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.370
exchange energy.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.140
That's a little
bit a mystery when

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.130
we talk about cooling
with a reactive force.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.520
We will have to scrutinize
what happens with energy,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.350
because at least
in the most basic,

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.580
the in phase component
of the oscillating system

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.750
does not extract energy from
the electromagnetic field.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.060
So maybe just
believe that for now,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:40.190
and we will scrutinize it later.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.980
Any questions?

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.850
Am I going too fast?

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:48.960
Am I going too slow?

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.230
Does it mean about right?

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.730
OK.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:05.180
So we have now obtained the
reactive force, which is also

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.550
called the dipole force
or stimulated force,

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.000
and the dissipated
force, which is also

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.840
called the spontaneous force.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.190
The next thing is
purely nomenclature.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.510
We want to introduce
appropriate vectors

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.559
which point along the
gradient of the phase,

00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:31.909
and which point along the
gradient of the amplitude.

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.570
And this is done here.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.659
So we want to say
that the reactive

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:39.800
and the dissipative
force are written

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.852
in a very sort of similar
way, but the one off them

00:34:44.852 --> 00:34:47.409
points in the direction
of a vector, alpha,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:51.110
the other one in the
direction of a vector, beta.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.730
The beta vector is the
gradient of the phase.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.660
If the phase is kr, the
gradient of the phase

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.200
is simply k, the k vector
of the electromagnetic wave.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.130
So that will come in handy
in just a few seconds.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:10.510
Whereas the reactive
force points

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:15.160
into the direction of the
gradient of the amplitude,

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.220
but we never want to talk
about electromagnetic field

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:18.720
amplitude.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:23.760
For us, we always use the
electric field in terms of you

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.590
parametrize the Rabi frequency.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.190
The Rabi frequency is
really the atomic unit

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.710
of the electric field.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.470
So therefore, this
vector which involves now

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:36.810
the gradient of the amplitude,
becomes a normalized gradient

00:35:36.810 --> 00:35:40.100
of the Rabi frequency.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.557
So these are the two fundamental
light forces, the reactive

00:35:44.557 --> 00:35:45.640
and the dissipative force.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.320
OK.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.710
Now we are going to have a
quick look at those two forces.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:03.370
So therefore, I'm now
discussing the two

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.740
simple, but already
very characteristic

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.650
cases for those forces.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:14.090
One is we want to look at
a plane travelling wave,

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:18.190
and then we want to look
at a pure standing wave.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:22.090
And the beauty of it is in
a plane travelling wave,

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.690
you've a plain wave, the
amplitude of the electric field

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.120
is constant everywhere,
it just oscillates.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.380
And therefore, this
alpha vector is zero.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.710
And in a few minutes, we
look at this standing wave,

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.830
and in the standing wave,
the beta vector is zero.

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:44.660
So the travelling wave and the
standing wave allows us now

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.080
to look at the two forces
separately in two physical

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.110
situations which are--
as you will see later--

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:56.276
highly relevant for experiments.

00:36:56.276 --> 00:37:00.376
Well, I don't think I have to
tell anybody in this room--

00:37:00.376 --> 00:37:01.750
maybe except some
people who take

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.640
the course for
[? Brett's ?] requirement--

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.620
that standing waves
or optical lattices

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.260
are common in all labs.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.960
And similar,
traveling wave beams

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.100
are used, for instance, for
decelerating atomic beams.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.270
So we illustrate
the two forces now,

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:21.615
but we already discussing two
experimentally very important

00:37:21.615 --> 00:37:22.115
geometries.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.850
OK, plain travelling waves.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.860
I mean, I just really plug
now the electromagnetic field

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.930
for plain travelling wave,
I plug it into the equations

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.700
above.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.090
The important thing is--
and which simplifies things

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.390
a lot-- is that the
alpha vector is zero.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.420
The amplitude of
the plain wave is--

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.810
that's what a plain
wave is-- constant.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:54.040
And the beta vector is the
gradient of the Rabi frequency

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.630
is just the k
vector of the light.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:04.030
So therefore, the dissipative
or spontaneous light force

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:10.680
was the Rabi frequency times
the v component of the Optical

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.340
Bloch vector times h bar k.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:21.800
And this has a very
simple interpretation

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.590
because the steady state
solution of the Optical Bloch

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.100
Equation is nothing else than
gamma times the excited state

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.770
population.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:35.420
And since the excited state
scatters, or emits photons

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.880
at a rate, gamma,
this is nothing else

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:43.020
than the number of
absorbed emitted

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.680
scattered photons times h bar k.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:50.470
We are in steady state
here, so the number

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.840
of photons which are emitted
into all space, into the vacuum

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.450
has to be the number
of photons which

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.870
has been absorbed
into the laser beam.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:04.010
So therefore, the interpretation
here is very simple,

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.410
you have a laser beam.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.150
Every time the atom
absorbs a photon, it

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:13.360
receives a recoil
transfer, h bar k.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.910
Now, afterwards, the
photon is scattered,

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.710
but the scattering is
symmetric, and does not

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.350
impart the force onto the atom.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.320
And this is what we
discussed earlier.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.820
The quantum part of the
electromagnetic field

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.090
is symmetric.

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.450
And here, we see sort of
what it means visually.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.140
Spontaneous emission
goes equally

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.770
probable in opposite direction,
and there is no net force,

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:41.720
but there is heating
as we discussed later.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:54.120
So we can plug in the solution--
the steady state solution--

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.200
from the Optical Bloch Equation.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.540
That's our Lorentzian.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.710
We have discussed power
broadening already

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.710
when we discussed the
Optical Bloch Equation.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.260
And, of course,
I just remind you

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:11.830
if you saturate the system with
a strong laser power, what you

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.630
can obtain is that
half of the population

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.115
is in the excited state,
and half of the population

00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:18.880
is in the ground state.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:24.290
Under those circumstances,
do you get the maximum force.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:26.440
And the maximum
spontaneous force

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:31.080
is the momentum per photon
times the maximum rate at which

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.070
a two-level atom
can scatter photons.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.100
So that's, in a
nutshell, I think

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.960
all you have to know about
the spontaneous light force

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.600
as far as the
force is concerned.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.640
But we still have to discuss
the heating associated

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.225
with a spontaneous force, which
are the force fluctuations.

00:40:55.617 --> 00:40:56.116
Questions?

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:07.280
Well, then let's do
a similar discussion

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.015
with reactive forces.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:20.260
Which is a little bit richer
because, well, you will see.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.380
So a standing wave
is parametrized here.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.880
We only have an alpha
vector, not a beta vector

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.220
now, because
everything is in phase,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.990
there is no phase phi of r.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:45.630
So therefore, there is
no dissipative force,

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.730
the only force is
a reactive force.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.160
Since the reactive
force depends only on u,

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.200
there is no exchange of energy.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:04.870
So that raises the question,
what is really going on it is

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:08.970
only the reactive part with
u, how can the atom really--

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:13.480
How can the motion change if
it cannot exchange energy?

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.070
Well, we'll come to that
in different pieces.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.080
The one part I want to
sort of discuss here

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:25.772
is that you should--
I want to show you

00:42:25.772 --> 00:42:27.455
that at the level
of our discussion

00:42:27.455 --> 00:42:31.000
we can already understand
that the atom is actually

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.700
doing a redistribution
of energy and momentum.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.030
Well, if I only hold
onto my standing wave,

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.520
there is no energy exchange
because the atom is always

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.580
in phase with the
standing wave--

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.880
the atomic dipole-- which is
this one [INAUDIBLE] force.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.580
But I can now do what
everybody does in the lab.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:58.022
We generate the standing wave
as a superposition of two

00:42:58.022 --> 00:42:58.730
travelling waves.

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:08.600
And if I have a superposition
of two traveling waves,

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.560
there is a point in space where
the phases of the traveling

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.150
waves are the same.

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.450
Then one phase is
advanced in phase,

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:20.390
and the other side one of the
waves is lagging in phase.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:25.300
And for pedagogical reasons,
I pick the point where the two

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.110
travelling waves are 90
degree phase shifted.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.480
OK.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:45.550
Now the situation is that
we have our electric field

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.330
and what is responsible for the
reactive light force is the u

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.780
part of the dipole moment of
the Optical Bloch vector, which

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.370
oscillates in phase.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:00.900
But nobody prevents me from
analyzing it with respect

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.310
to E1 and E2.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.780
And so if I ask now, I
say, I have one laser beam.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.000
I have another laser beam.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.140
And if you want, after the
laser beams have crossed,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.260
you can put in two photo-diodes,
and you can not only

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.855
ask, what happens
to the standing

00:44:15.855 --> 00:44:20.165
wave, you can also ask, what
happens to each traveling wave?

00:44:20.165 --> 00:44:21.040
Are photons absorbed?

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.110
Or what happens?

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:28.040
And now, what is obvious
is if you have an harmonic

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.360
oscillator, and you have an
oscillating dipole moment,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.180
if the dipole moment
is withing 0 and 180

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.650
degrees with a dry
field, you absorb power.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:44.840
If it is in the two
other quadrants,

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.390
it emits, or delivers power.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:50.610
And now you see, that
we are in a situation--

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:56.100
which I've peak here-- where one
travelling wave loses energy,

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.900
and the other traveling
wave gains energy.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:01.590
And there is a
classic experiment,

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.880
which was done by Bill Phillips
a while ago-- he had atoms

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:09.190
in an optical lattice,
and they were sloshing.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:13.410
And she could really measure
that when the atoms were

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:18.500
accelerated this way, one of
the laser beams gained power,

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.260
and the other one lost power.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.310
So while the atoms
where sloshing

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:26.850
in momentum space, the power
between the two laser beams

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.660
was distributed back and forth.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.650
So this is the character
of the dissipative force,

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:38.080
that it redistributes momentum
and energy between the two

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.890
traveling waves.

00:45:48.422 --> 00:45:49.005
Any questions?

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.090
Boris?

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:56.631
AUDIENCE: But if
there's a net change

00:45:56.631 --> 00:45:58.823
in the patterns of
motion, the energy still

00:45:58.823 --> 00:46:00.066
has to come from somewhere.

00:46:00.066 --> 00:46:01.557
Right?

00:46:01.557 --> 00:46:03.048
Can you make that [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:16.979 --> 00:46:18.520
PROFESSOR: This
question has bothered

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.010
in many different iterations.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:25.310
And at some point, I found a
very, very easy answer to it.

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.830
And this is one of your
homework assignments

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.410
for homework number 10.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.360
There's a very
simple example where

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.380
you will realize where
the energy comes.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.270
What happens is,
in steady state,

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.270
if everything is
stationary, of course,

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.070
there can't be an exchange.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.125
But, if you're for
instance, saying--

00:46:46.125 --> 00:46:50.300
and I give you no part of the
solution-- if you have atoms,

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.240
and they are attracted
by the dipole force,

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.260
there's a strong laser beam and
the atoms are accelerated in,

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.450
and you're now asking, where
does the energy come from?

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:06.110
Because all of what the
atoms do, at least according

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.010
to what I'm telling
you, they redistribute

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.810
photons of energy, h
bar omega, into photons

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:14.260
of energy, h bar omega.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.080
So where does the
energy come from?

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.590
You have to go higher in
the approximation here

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:22.471
to understand where
the energy comes from.

00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:23.970
Let me just tell
you one thing, this

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.690
is actually something which
I've encountered several times.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:31.850
And it can be really
confusing, I've

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.130
really proven to mathematically
the this is false.

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.000
So in this level of treatment,
with these very simple

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.960
concepts, we correctly
obtained the optical force.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:47.880
But if you're now asking,
where does the energy go?

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:49.920
You have to go deeper.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.900
And, for instance,
what happens is

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.760
if you take a cloud of
atoms, and the cloud of atoms

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.310
moves in an out
of a laser beam--

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:01.100
just think of it as
center of mass dipole

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.150
oscillations of a Boson-Einstein
condensate in an optical dipole

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.540
trap-- what happens is when
the atoms move in and out,

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.830
they actually act as a phase
modulator for the laser beam.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.270
The index of the refraction of
your laser beam is changing.

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.530
So therefore-- and we
don't deal with that

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:24.170
when he replace the
electromagnetic field by a c

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:29.940
number-- your laser beam, when
the atoms move in will actually

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.380
show a frequency modulation.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:36.440
And you will find-- and it's a
wonderful homework assignment,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.270
I'm pretty proud
that we created it,

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:40.020
and that it works
out so easily-- you

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:42.760
will find that the kinetic
energy of the atoms

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.740
is exactly compensated
by the energy shift

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:49.550
the photons which have
passed through the atoms.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:51.940
But I'm giving you a
very advanced answer.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:55.130
It's often very difficult
if you have a simple picture

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:58.260
for the force to figure out
what happens to the energy.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:05.030
Actually, let me give
you the other example.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.190
When we have the
previous example,

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.990
where we have atoms and
we have a laser beam

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:13.550
which cools with a
radiation pressure.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:26.790
This was our previous example.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.640
Where does the energy go?

00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:32.150
I have a wonderful correct--
within the assumptions--

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.610
an exact expression
for the force.

00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:35.700
Where does the energy go?

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:44.530
The atoms have a
counter-propagating laser beam.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:49.080
They scatter photons
with this rate.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.590
Every time they scatter
a photon, they slow down

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.750
by h bar k.

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:56.430
They lose energy.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.310
We have a complete
description what

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:03.189
happens in the momentum
picture and in forces.

00:50:03.189 --> 00:50:04.480
But where does the energy come?

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.646
Or where does the energy go?

00:50:05.646 --> 00:50:07.964
The energy where
the atoms have lost?

00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:10.374
AUDIENCE: They absorb a
slightly high frequency

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:12.302
with a Doppler shift.

00:50:12.302 --> 00:50:16.158
And then slow down
and then re-release

00:50:16.158 --> 00:50:18.429
a photon with
slightly lower energy.

00:50:18.429 --> 00:50:19.220
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.850
So in that case, it
actually depends which way.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.160
When the atom loses
energy, the energy

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.760
goes into blue-shifted photons.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.730
I'm just saying, in order to
address the question, what

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.290
happens to the energy, we have
to bring in our physics, which

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:37.830
we didn't even consider
to address here.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:42.120
It is now the physics of the
spontaneously emitted photons.

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:45.380
We said for the force,
spontaneous emission vacuum

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.710
fluctuations can be eliminated.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:52.530
But if you try to understand
where does the energy go,

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:55.690
we have to go to those
terms, and we even

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:59.990
find the physics of Doppler
shifts, which we didn't put in,

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.510
which we didn't
even assume here.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:05.630
But, of course, it has
to be self consistent.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:10.210
So therefore, you sometimes have
to go to very different physics

00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:12.350
which isn't even
covered by your equation

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.890
to see the flip
side of the coin.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:17.710
One side is forces,
which are very simple,

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.740
but the other side of the
coin can be more difficult.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:26.790
We'll actually come back to
that when we talk about cooling

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:28.120
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.540
Cooling with a stimulated force.

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:36.890
How can a stimulated force
cool, because it's all u.

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:38.360
Well, we'll get there.

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:43.060
And it will again
be-- the energy--

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.720
will be extracted through
spontaneous emission

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.860
from all those side
[INAUDIBLE] and all that.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.845
So we have to trace
down the energy,

00:51:50.845 --> 00:51:52.220
and we successfully
will do that.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.180
But energy can be subtle.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:55.930
Forces are simple.

00:52:02.804 --> 00:52:03.470
Other questions?

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.200
Actually, since
I'm in chatty mood,

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.150
when I explained to you
where the energy goes

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:28.740
in a dipole trap-- that it's a
phase modulation for the laser

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:31.220
beam-- I have been using
optical dipole traps

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.940
in my laboratory for
many, many years,

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.770
before I really figured
out where the energy goes.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.680
And I'm almost
99% certain if you

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:42.740
go to DAMOP, and ask
some of the experts

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.420
on cooling and trapping,
and ask them to figure out

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:48.030
this problem, most of
the people will not

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:49.900
be able to give you this answer.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.740
I've actually not found the
answer in any standard textbook

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.940
of laser cooling, until I
eventually found it myself

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:01.620
and posted and prepared it
as a homework assignment.

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:04.290
So many, many people may
not be able to give you

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:07.340
the correct answer,
where does the energy go

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.040
when atoms slosh around
in a dipole trap.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.510
Try it out at DAMOP,
it may be fun.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:16.010
OK.

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:22.690
So back to the simple
physics of forces.

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.520
We don't need to
understand the energy,

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.220
because we know the forces,
but we'll come back to that.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.200
So we have the reactive force.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.840
The reactive force
is written here.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.330
What have we done?

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:38.240
Well, you remember
the alpha vector

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.210
was the gradient of
the Rabi frequency,

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:45.520
and we have to multiply with the
u component of the steady state

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.840
solution of the
Optical Bloch Equation.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.540
Here it is, just put together.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.486
It's a nice expression.

00:53:54.486 --> 00:53:58.340
There are two things you
should know about it.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.850
The first one is
that you can actually

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:05.955
write this force exactly as
the gradient of a potential.

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:13.620
So there is a dipole
potential, and is

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:15.860
exactly this dipole
potential which

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.920
is used as a trapping potential
when you have dipole traps.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:27.700
Probably 99% of you use
dipole traps in the limit

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:30.050
where the detuning is large.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:33.780
And then the logarithm of
1 plus x simply becomes x,

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.050
and you have the simple
expression you are using.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.410
But in a way, this
is remarkable.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:45.220
The dipole force can be
derived from a potential,

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:48.560
even if the detuning
is small, and you

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.090
have a hell of a lot of
spontaneous scattering, which

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:57.010
is usually not regarded as being
due to conservative potential.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:59.010
So this expression,
that the reactive force

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:02.760
is a gradient of a potential,
even applies to a situation

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:07.490
where gamma spontaneous
scattering [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.610
And you're not
simply in-- and this

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:12.300
is what this last term is--
in the perturbative limit

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.270
of the AC Stark Effect.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.770
OK.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.140
That's number one you should
know about this expression.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:25.020
The second thing is if you
look at this expression,

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.640
the question is, what is
the maximum reactive force?

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:33.770
We talked about the maximum
spontaneous, or dissipative

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:37.110
force, which is h
bar k, the momentum

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.190
of a photon times gamms over 2.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:43.090
What is the maximum
force you can get out

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:45.750
of the reactive force?

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.600
Well, of course, if you
want a lot of force,

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.660
you want to use a
lot of laser power.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.750
Therefore, you want to
use a high Rabi frequency.

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:58.010
And now, if you want to use
your laser power wisely,

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.500
the question is, how should
you pick the detuning?

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.425
And you realize if you
pick the detuning small,

00:56:04.425 --> 00:56:07.370
there is a prefector
which goes to zero,

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:09.815
but if you pick your
detuning extremely large,

00:56:09.815 --> 00:56:12.410
the denominator kills you.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:17.200
And well, if you analyze it
and or stare at this expression

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.390
for more than a
second, you realize

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:23.710
that the optimum detuning
is when the detuning is

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.810
on the order of
the Rabi frequency.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:30.980
And if you plug
that in, you find

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:33.420
that under those
optimum conditions,

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:37.720
the reactive force
can be written again

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.150
as the momentum of
a photon-- it must

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:45.480
be, the momentum of the
photon is the unit of force,

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.650
the quantum of force,
which has to appear--

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:50.500
but not the frequency
is not gamma,

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:55.940
but it is the Rabi frequency.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.300
So the picture you
should sort of have

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.880
is that under those
situations, just

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.530
assume the standing wave
consists of two traveling

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.160
waves, and the atom
is Rabi flopping.

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.690
But it is Rabi flopping
in a way that it goes up

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:12.680
by taking a photon
from one laser beam,

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.520
and then it goes down
by emitting the photon

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.080
into the other laser beam.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:21.210
So during each
Rabi flux cycle, it

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:24.650
exchanges a momentum
of 2 h bar k

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:28.030
with the electromagnetic field.

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:32.270
So therefore, the reactive
force-- the stimulated force--

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:38.690
never saturates if you increase
the Rabi frequency-- depending,

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.220
of course, on your detuning,
but if you choose the detuning

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.630
correctly-- you can
get a force which

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.530
is just going
further and further.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:02.770
Questions?

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:03.617
Yes, Jen?

00:58:03.617 --> 00:58:06.102
AUDIENCE: Is this the same
concept as the Raman constants,

00:58:06.102 --> 00:58:08.587
except that the frequencies
are just the same?

00:58:08.587 --> 00:58:09.581
Or is it just a--

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.590
PROFESSOR: It is
a Raman process.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:19.330
Actually, everything is
a Raman process here.

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.160
Because in laser
cooling, in everything

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.125
which involves the mechanical--
the motion, the external degree

00:58:26.125 --> 00:58:30.560
freedom of the atoms-- we have
an atom in one momentum state.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.760
We go-- light scattering always
has to involve the excited

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.940
state-- and then we go down
to a different momentum state.

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.760
So therefore, laser
cooling is nothing else

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:47.329
than Raman processes in the
external degree of freedom

00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:48.960
of the atom.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.780
You may be used to
[INAUDIBLE] Raman process

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.105
more when you start in
one hyperfine state,

00:58:54.105 --> 00:58:57.140
or for molecules in one
vibration rotation state,

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.950
and you go to another
one, but, well,

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:03.180
for vibration, and
rotational states,

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:06.640
and hyperfine states of it,
Raman is used all the time.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.970
I usually used it also
for the external motion,

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:13.630
because I think it
clearly brings out

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.790
common features between
all those different Raman

00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:17.850
processes.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:25.280
So you can actually say that the
reactive force is a stimulated

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.990
Raman process between two
momentum states, where

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:31.350
both legs are stimulated
by laser beams.

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:34.100
In a standing wave, it
would be-- the two legs--

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.990
would be stimulated by the
two travelling wave components

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:38.950
of the standing wave.

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:44.300
Whereas the dissipative force
is spontaneous Raman process,

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.327
where one leg is driven by
the laser, and the other one

00:59:47.327 --> 00:59:48.660
comes with spontaneous emission.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.370
Nicky?

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:55.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
when the atoms

00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.410
slow down, the [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:07.078 --> 01:00:09.036
PROFESSOR: So the
spontaneously emitted photon?

01:00:09.036 --> 01:00:11.516
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm just thinking

01:00:11.516 --> 01:00:15.484
of actually the
stimulated force.

01:00:15.484 --> 01:00:17.468
Because the atom
must be stimulated.

01:00:17.468 --> 01:00:20.940
[INAUDIBLE] I'm
confused how when

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:24.908
the energy of the emitted photon
must be slightly different

01:00:24.908 --> 01:00:27.884
due to the phase modulation?

01:00:27.884 --> 01:00:36.075
[INAUDIBLE] stimulated emission
can be added to the frequency?

01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:37.060
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:40.820
PROFESSOR: I mean we had the
discussion after [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:47.780
question, if you go up and
down, and you are stimulated,

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:50.250
you go up in a stimulated
way, you go down

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:57.560
in a stimulated way,
and both laser fields

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.010
which stimulate the transition
have the same frequency, omega,

01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:09.460
you would actually see that
there is no energy exchange.

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.090
So at our current
level of description

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.530
we have described where
the force comes from,

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:19.440
but we don't understand
yet where the energy goes,

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.800
or where the energy comes from.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.550
And this is really
more sophisticated,

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:28.820
and I don't want to sort
of continue the discussion.

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.460
We will encounter one
situation, and this

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:36.050
is in the [INAUDIBLE]
atom picture, where

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:40.160
we will discuss in a week
or so, sisyphus cooling.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.220
And we will find
out that there is

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.290
symmetries in the mono-triplet.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:46.610
So again, we will find
the missing energy

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:49.000
in spontaneous emission.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.890
But if you don't have
spontaneous emission,

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:55.550
if you just have atoms
moving in an optical lattice

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:58.840
without spontaneous emission,
it is really what I said,

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.290
the phase modulation.

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.050
And I would probably
ask you at this point

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:04.514
to do the homework
assignment, and maybe

01:02:04.514 --> 01:02:06.430
have a discussion
afterwards, because then you

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:08.040
know exactly what
I'm talking about.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:15.000
Does it at least-- You can take
that as a preliminary answer.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.570
So these are the
two limiting cases.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.630
One is spontaneous
emission, and the other one

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.100
is phase modulation at
a certain frequency.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.980
One can be sustained
in steady state,

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.920
you can spontaneously
emit in sort of an atom

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.750
goes to a standing wave,
and this is sustainable.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.190
Whereas the phase modulation
thing is actually a transient.

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:43.580
It's an oscillation
which is added in.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:52.509
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You're adding the force

01:02:52.509 --> 01:02:55.216
to the other one [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:55.216 --> 01:02:56.341
PROFESSOR: Yeah, actually--

01:02:56.341 --> 01:02:57.299
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:57.299 --> 01:03:00.640
PROFESSOR: If that helps
you, but it's the following.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:04.850
I would sometimes
say you know, I

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:07.860
like sort of intuitive
explanations of quantum

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.600
physics.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.970
Let's assume I'm an atom.

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:12.090
I'm in [INAUDIBLE]
standing wave.

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:15.060
And you don't know it yet,
but I do sisyphus cooling.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.780
By just exchanging photons,
a stimulated force,

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.407
I'm actually cooling.

01:03:21.407 --> 01:03:22.990
And you would say,
how is it possible?

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:27.600
Because all the photon exchanges
involve the same photon,

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.460
the same energy.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.050
How can I get rid of energy?

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.560
And I think what really
happens is the following,

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:38.280
the atoms can lose
momentum without energy,

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.600
but due to Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Relationship

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.660
this is possible.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:44.830
So the atom is first taking
care of its momentum--

01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:47.680
is losing momentum--
by stimulated force,

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.250
and eventually,
before it's too late,

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.590
it has to do some
spontaneous emission where

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:57.250
it is paying back it debts
in energy to Heisenberg.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:02.210
So and of course, after a
certain time, everything is OK.

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:04.900
The force was provided
by exchanging photons

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:06.400
of identical frequency.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.410
And the energy is provided by an
occasional spontaneous emission

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.870
event, using one
of the [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.010
So everything is there.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.970
Everything is a perfect
picture, but you

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:21.610
have to sort of, in
this description,

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:24.770
allow a certain uncertainty
that the force is

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:27.420
the exchange of
identical photons,

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.330
and the energy
balance is reconciled

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:32.550
in spontaneous emission.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:39.110
And on any longer time scale
there are enough events

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:42.040
that the balance is
perfectly matched.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.950
But if you would
take the position,

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:45.440
no, this is not possible.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.830
You know, the atom can only-- I
mean, it's sort of in diagrams.

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:54.290
It's not that one diagram
which scatters a photon

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:55.910
has to conserve energy.

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:57.160
You have a little bit of time.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.630
You have Heisenberg's
uncertainty time

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.510
to make sure that
another diagram jumps

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:06.560
in, and reconciles
energy conservation.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.740
That's at least my way
of looking into it,

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.750
but it's a very maybe, my
personal interpretation

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:15.120
of how all these diagrams
and photon scattering

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.670
events work together.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:21.600
OK.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.300
Let's do something simpler now.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:29.220
So I've explained to you
the dissipative force,

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:36.290
the reactive force,
and in the next unit

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:40.100
I want to show you
simply applications

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:41.890
of the spontaneous force.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:44.500
In every experiment
on cold atoms,

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.530
the spontaneous force
is center stage.

01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:50.990
It is necessary to
slow down atomic beams.

01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:55.610
It provides molasses, which
is the colling of atoms

01:05:55.610 --> 01:06:00.230
to micro-Kelvin temperature,
and the spontaneous force

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:03.460
is also responsible for
the Magneto-optical trap.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.830
So what I want to
do here is, again,

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:13.210
by showing you the
relevant equations, how

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:16.040
the spontaneous force, which
we have just discussed,

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.830
how these spontaneous
force leads to those three

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.340
applications.

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.200
So this is one of the
most experimental sections

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.740
of this course, because this
equation has it all in it.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.700
And I just want to show you how
this equation can be applied

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.180
to three different important
experimental geometries.

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:47.770
OK.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.500
So this is our equation.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.210
It has the momentum
transfer per photon.

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.430
It has the maximum scatter
rate, gamma over two.

01:06:58.430 --> 01:07:05.930
And then, here, it has
the Lorentzian line shape.

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:11.050
And the important thing is
when we talk about molasses

01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:14.910
and beam slowing is that
the detuning is the laser

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.270
detuning and the
Doppler detuning.

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:20.850
So the velocity
dependence enters now

01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:24.780
the spontaneous force through
the detuning in the Lorentzian

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.910
denominator, and it enters
through the Doppler effect.

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.750
So you can pretty
much say it like this,

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.360
if you have a bunch
of laser beam,

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.760
and slow and cool your atoms,
how can the lasers do the job?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.640
Well, they measure the
velocity of the atoms

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.100
through the Doppler shift.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.240
And if is the Doppler
shift which tells

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:45.181
the laser beams what
to do, so to speak.

01:07:45.181 --> 01:07:46.680
And this is how
laser cooling works.

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.590
So just as an
experimentalist, you

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.790
should actually know
what the scale is.

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.740
If somebody asked
you, how strong

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:05.620
is the spontaneous
scattering force?

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.170
Well, a way to connect
it with real time

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:10.880
units-- with real
life units-- is,

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.400
what is the maximum
deceleration?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.740
Well, this is 10 to
the 5 G. You can ask,

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.470
is 10 to the 5 G a lot?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.660
Or not?

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.520
Well, for an astronaut,
it would be a lot.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.620
It would.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:28.870
No living organism can
sustain 10 to the 5 G.

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:33.109
But I'm really surprised
when I did this calculation.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.510
When you compare it
to the electric force

01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:40.540
on an ionized atom,
the same force,

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.540
which is provided by the
spontaneous light force,

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.040
would be provided
by an electric field

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.050
of one millivolt per centimeter.

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:51.235
So it's not easy if you
have a stainless steel

01:08:51.235 --> 01:08:53.359
chamber to avoid
petch effects, which

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.359
create those electric fields.

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:57.109
And if you've a
battery with 9 volt,

01:08:57.109 --> 01:09:00.120
a centimeter apart--
just a 9 volt battery--

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.950
would accelerate an ion
four orders of magnitude

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:10.819
faster than your beloved
strong spontaneous light force.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:13.720
So in that sense,
10 to the 5 G is

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.210
a lot in the macroscopic
world, but if you

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:18.950
would look at microscopic
forces-- which are often

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:21.750
electric forces--
it's absolutely tiny.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.140
And sometimes I say,
the fact that you

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:31.580
can do 100 kilovolt
per centimeter,

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.840
that you can make
electric forces which

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.439
are seven, eight, or
nine, orders of magnitude

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:41.050
stronger, that's actually
the reason why ion traps were

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:44.950
invented before trapping
of neutral particles.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:47.809
So some developments
in the field

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.970
of trapping particles--
and eventually

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:53.569
laser cooling them-- it
first started with ion traps,

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.290
and then it proceeded
to neutral atoms.

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:58.255
And the reason is
the ion trappers

01:09:58.255 --> 01:10:00.892
have forces at
their disposal which

01:10:00.892 --> 01:10:02.850
are eight or nine orders
of magnitude stronger.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.070
OK.

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.835
Optical molasses.

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:17.340
I know some of you will
hate it, because I've just

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:23.080
explained to you that
in a standing wave,

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.250
we don't have any
spontaneous light force,

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:29.120
all we have is the reactive
force, the stimulated force,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.250
because it is the
u, the in phase

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:35.120
oscillation of the atomic
dipole operator which

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.170
is responsible for everything.

01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.940
But now I'm just, you
know, wearing another hat,

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:47.420
and I tell you that there is a
limit where the total force can

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.810
be regarded with some
of the two forces.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.940
So therefore, I'm
pretending now that if you

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.040
have near resonant light
in a standing wave,

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.670
that the force in the
standing wave-- which you know

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.080
is a purely reactive
force-- can now

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.400
be written as the sum of
the two propagating waves.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.580
And, of course, each
propagating wave

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:17.330
does a purely dissipative force.

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:19.900
That is, what I'm telling you
can be mathematically proven.

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:28.410
That the stimulated force
in a standing wave is equal

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.420
to the sum of the two
dissipative forces or each

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.870
travelling wave.

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:37.470
I just keep that
in mind whenever

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:40.690
you think you can
rigorously distinguish

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:44.340
between the dissipative force
and the stimulated force.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.090
Keep in mind that
a standing wave--

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:49.490
which has only a
stimulated force,

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:55.740
as I rigorously proved to you--
can alternatively be described

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.730
as the sum of two
spontaneous light forces,

01:11:58.730 --> 01:12:00.980
each of which provided by
one of the travelling waves.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.550
Well, it sort of makes sense
in a perturbative limit.

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.069
You can just take one beam,
you can take the other beam,

01:12:10.069 --> 01:12:11.985
and the combined effect
of the two laser beams

01:12:11.985 --> 01:12:12.990
is higher order.

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:16.817
So the fact that in
some low intensity limit

01:12:16.817 --> 01:12:18.400
this has to be valid,
is pretty clear.

01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:29.220
Anyway, but just a
warning, if you really

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.100
want to use a stimulated force
here, you're in big trouble.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.470
It's much, much harder
to get this result out

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:35.860
of the stimulated force.

01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:39.720
Because to get a stimulated
force with velocity dependence

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.270
requires you to take
solutions of the Optical Bloch

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:46.980
Equations, which are not steady
state, but non-adiabatic.

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:47.990
So just a warning.

01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:50.900
You can do it, if you want
with a stimulated force,

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.900
but I would strongly
advise you to first use

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.760
the simpler formalism.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.750
You have to go to very different
approximation schemes and much

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.700
more technical
complexity if you want

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.630
to get it out of the
stimulated force.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:05.250
OK.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:09.310
So with that assumption,
you'll remember

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:13.310
we had the dissipative
force of each laser beam.

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:15.270
Now we have two laser beams.

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.460
We summed them up.

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:19.400
Because the two laser beams
come from different directions,

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.940
we have a minus sign here.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.040
And for the same reason,
we have plus and minus sign

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.350
in the Doppler effect.

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:29.240
So what we have
is the following,

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:34.205
each force of each laser beam
has this Lorentzian envelope,

01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:39.010
shown in black, but the other
force of the other laser beam

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:40.400
has the opposite sign.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.980
And the two have
opposite Doppler shifts.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:49.410
So if I add up the two black
forces, I get the red force.

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:53.180
And the red force is
anti-symmetric with respect

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.540
to velocity.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.350
So therefore, in the
limit of small velocities

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:02.100
I get a force which is
minus alpha times v.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.120
And this is the
force of friction.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.580
And in a whimsical way,
people called this arrangement

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.690
of two traveling
waves Optical Molasses

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:18.820
because the atom
literally gets stuck

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:21.550
in this configuration
like a tiny ball

01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:24.060
bearing you throw into honey.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.340
So this is optical molasses.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:29.980
Actually, I think
some of the Europeans

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.790
had to learn the
word molasses for it.

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:35.110
In the US, everybody
knows what molasses is.

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:37.200
Well, in Europe, we
know what honey is,

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.490
but molasses is not
a standard staple.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:43.210
But anyway, it's
optical molasses.

01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:44.840
OK.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:46.220
Very simple result.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.390
And, again, it's not easy to get
it out of the stimulated force.

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:52.990
But it's possible.

01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:55.390
I will actually tell you
how we get cooling out

01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:57.659
of the stimulated force
later in some limit.

01:14:57.659 --> 01:15:00.154
AUDIENCE: Is there
[INAUDIBLE] why

01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:05.643
this assumption of dissipative
forces is easier [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:05.643 --> 01:15:08.637
and the stimulated force will
be made difficult [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:22.250
PROFESSOR: I'm not
sure if there is

01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:25.010
a simple answer why it's easier.

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:26.880
Well, it can't be
easier than that.

01:15:32.875 --> 01:15:35.125
AUDIENCE: I mean, there has
to be something wrong with

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:38.990
our assumptions of stimulated
forces so that we cannot get

01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.490
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:40.156
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:40.156 --> 01:15:42.880
I think what happens
is what I briefly said.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.700
To the best of my knowledge,
but I'm not 100% certain.

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.060
We have the simply
expression because we

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:52.000
have used the steady state
solution of the Optical Bloch

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:52.640
Equation.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.460
In other words, we
have a laser beam,

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.650
and it's just the power of
the laser which tells us

01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:59.080
how much light
scattering happens.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.020
And we use the steady
state solution.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.200
And we sort of have folded that
into the force for one laser

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:04.720
beam.

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:06.094
And then we have
the same package

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.500
for the other laser beam.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.100
And we have never considered
that the two laser

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.870
beam may have some cross talk.

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:15.810
And this is indeed valid
for all low laser power.

01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:18.080
However, if you want
to get cooling out

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.270
off the stimulated force, I
will show some of you later,

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:26.100
you can no longer use
the steady state solution

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:29.790
because it would
miss the effect here.

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:32.360
You wouldn't get any
cooling out of it.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.990
In order to get something
which is dissipative,

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.670
out of a reactive
force-- reactive

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:38.830
force is by definition
not dissipative--

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:40.820
you need a
dissipation mechanism.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.950
And the dissipation
mechanism is that you're not

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:48.150
quite steady state, there is
a relaxation time, a time lag.

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.870
The atom is not instantaneously
in its steady state solution.

01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:54.200
It needs a little bit
of time to adjust.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:00.440
And it is these time lag of
the atom which eventually gives

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.920
rise to an alpha coefficient
in the stimulated force.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.808
AUDIENCE: So then
physically, you are,

01:17:04.808 --> 01:17:07.168
during cooling experiments,
you can take care

01:17:07.168 --> 01:17:09.370
that you are actually not
in the steady state limit?

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:18.500
PROFESSOR: What I'm telling you
is, for the spontaneous force,

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.180
we get in leading order
the effect by assuming

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.210
the steady state limit, but
if you want to get it out

01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:27.735
of the stimulated
force, as far as I know,

01:17:27.735 --> 01:17:29.875
you don't get it with
the steady state limit.

01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:30.416
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.830
PROFESSOR: If you use
different approaches--

01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:39.500
I mean this is why you
want to pick your approach.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.570
Sometimes you get something
already in lower order.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.760
Sometimes you get
it in higher order.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.060
And I think one
favorite example is

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.300
you solve this problem
about [INAUDIBLE] scattering

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.380
and Thompson scattering, pick
your Hamiltonian, d dot e,

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.650
or p minus a.

01:17:55.650 --> 01:17:58.221
In one case, you have to work
harder than in the other case.

01:17:58.221 --> 01:17:59.470
And I think here it's similar.

01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:09.680
Anyway, let's just put
in-- I think that's, yeah,

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.130
we can do in the
next few minutes.

01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:18.190
So we now want to
put in the effect

01:18:18.190 --> 01:18:20.070
that the force fluctuates.

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:23.170
And that means we have heating.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:27.840
Before I do that, let me just
tell you what the solution is

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.320
for force equals minus
alpha times v. Well,

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.890
it means we extract
energy out of the system

01:18:35.890 --> 01:18:39.150
at a rate-- Well,
energy per unit time

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:42.490
is force times velocity.

01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:46.355
Force times velocity is now
minus alpha times v square.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:49.760
But v square is the
energy, the kinetic energy.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.110
In other words, this
equation tells us

01:18:53.110 --> 01:18:59.030
that the atomic motion,
the kinetic energy,

01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:04.310
is exponentially [? damned. ?]
And if there were nothing else,

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:07.510
you just need two laser
beams-- optical molasses--

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:10.980
and you would go not just to
micro-Kelvin, but to nano-

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.750
and pico- Kelvin temperatures.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:16.910
It's an exponential
decay to absolute zero.

01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:19.440
However, we don't
each reach nano-

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.389
and pico- Kelvin
temperatures in laser cooling

01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:23.805
because there are
other processes.

01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:30.900
And what is important here
is spontaneous emission.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.520
OK.

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.460
So the way you treat
spontaneous emission is

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:44.770
the following, every time an
atom emits spontaneously, there

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:49.740
is a random momentum
kick of h bar k.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:54.900
If you have n photons scattered
because the momentum kicks

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.140
going random direction, they
only add up in a random box.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.280
You get square root
N. Or if you ask,

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.700
what is the average of p square
due to spontaneously emission?

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.500
It is the momentum
of the photon squared

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.310
times the number of
scattering events.

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.340
So therefore, in the form
of a differential equation,

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.200
the heating rate, or the
derivative of-- the TEMPO

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.770
derivative-- of
p square goes now

01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:22.530
with the number of
photons per unit

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:23.990
time, which is the
scattering rate.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.286
OK.

01:20:29.286 --> 01:20:34.870
If you would stop
here, and that's

01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:43.190
what many people do who explain
heating in this situation,

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:45.510
you would miss half
of the heating,

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:48.850
because what you
have treated here

01:20:48.850 --> 01:20:52.950
is only the photon transfer
and spontaneous emission.

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:57.150
However, there is also
fluctuation and absorption.

01:20:57.150 --> 01:21:00.860
I mean just look at two
atoms in the [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.070
Kind of me and another atom.

01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:05.200
And we both scatter photons.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.620
On average, in the same laser
beam, we absorb in photons

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.670
and get in momentum kicks.

01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:13.732
But there is
Poissonian statistics

01:21:13.732 --> 01:21:16.620
how many photons I
absorb, and how many

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.100
photons my twin brother absorbs.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:22.500
So therefore, due to the
randomness in absorption,

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.010
or the fluctuations
in absorption.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:28.550
There is another
square root n variance

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:34.120
in the recoil kicks which comes
from the absorption process.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.600
And it so happens, for
exactly that reason,

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.630
that the heating-- the
derivative of kinetic energy,

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:45.010
or the difference of momentum
squared due to absorption

01:21:45.010 --> 01:21:46.515
is exactly the same
as in emission.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.100
Well, if you now make
different assumptions,

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:54.830
spontaneous emission
has a dipole pattern.

01:21:54.830 --> 01:22:01.790
And you can sort of factor on
the order of unity, depending

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.870
what the pattern of the
spontaneous emission

01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:08.540
is, whether you make a 1D or 2D
model of spontaneous emission

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.180
that the photons can only
go in one dimension, in two

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.480
dimension, or three dimensions.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:15.170
So you have to get
other prefectors,

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:19.680
but the picture is that without
going into numerical factors

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:24.820
on the order of unity, you have
fluctuations in the absorption,

01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.090
you have a randomness
in spontaneous emission,

01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:30.760
and they both
equally contribute.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:42.300
So that means now the following,
that we have heating rate.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:46.730
The heating rate we
just talked about.

01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:48.580
The increase in p square.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:51.060
Well, if you divide
by 2 times the mass,

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:53.790
it's increasing kinetic energy.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:56.060
So the increase
in kinetic energy

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.325
is given by this expression.

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:04.130
And it is common if you
have a heating process

01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:06.290
to introduce a
momentum diffusion

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:07.680
coefficient in that way.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.310
It's just the definition.

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:14.150
It shows you how p square
increases per unit time.

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:18.320
And now we can get the cooling
limit for spontaneous emission,

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:21.890
namely by saying,
in steady state when

01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:24.470
we have-- due to
photon scattering--

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:27.400
the same amount of heating and
the same amount of cooling,

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:29.530
the temperature will have
asymptotically reached

01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:30.890
a steady state value.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.890
The heating rate
was parametrized

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:40.970
by momentum diffusion
coefficient, d over m.

01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:45.090
So this is sort of independent
of the velocity of the atom.

01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:47.670
Whereas you'll remember
the cooling rate

01:23:47.670 --> 01:23:51.000
was proportional to
the energy because it

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.810
was an exponential
approach to zero energy.

01:23:56.810 --> 01:24:00.770
So therefore, when we have the
heating equals the cooling,

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:03.340
we have the energy
of the atoms there,

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.280
and therefore, we
find that the energy

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.110
of the atoms in steady
state is given by, actually,

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:15.260
the ratio of heating
versus cooling.

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.120
It's a simple expression.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.045
The energy or the limiting
temperature for molasses

01:24:22.045 --> 01:24:24.850
is the ratio of
heating versus cooling.

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:28.800
Heating is described by momentum
diffusion coefficient and alpha

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.330
is described by
the damping force.

01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:35.080
I want you, actually, to
keep this expression in mind.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.520
A limit in temperature
in laser cooling

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.690
is always-- actually, in other
processes in laser cooling--

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.720
is the ratio of
heating over cooling.

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.550
And momentum diffusion
coefficient due to heating,

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:50.430
over a friction
force due to cooling.

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:55.010
Because we will later find
polarization gradient cooling,

01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:56.460
cooling in blue
molasses, we will

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.490
find other cooling
schemes, where

01:24:58.490 --> 01:25:02.440
we will calculate-- with
the appropriate model--

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:04.390
the heating and the cooling.

01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:06.340
And I don't have to
repeat this part.

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.510
The moment I calculate
the heating, the momentum

01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:10.980
diffusion, and I
calculate the friction,

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.540
I know what the limiting
temperatures is.

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:20.775
Again, when I said, the
energy is kt over 2, you know,

01:25:20.775 --> 01:25:24.640
of course, kinetic energy is
kt over 2 times the number

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.820
of degrees of freedom.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.740
I assumed 1D, here.

01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.755
So in everything I've
said on this page,

01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:31.990
there are numerical
factors which

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:35.245
may change whether you assume
one or two or three dimension.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:39.460
OK.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:43.930
I think that's the last
thing I want to tell you.

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:47.100
And then on Wednesday
we do Zeeman's slowing

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.410
and Magneto-optical trapping.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:59.565
We had an expression for alpha.

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:07.490
Remember we had this Lorentz
profile, for the other Lorentz

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:09.434
profile, and alpha
was just the slope.

01:26:09.434 --> 01:26:10.600
I mean, everything is known.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.370
I just didn't bother
to calculate it.

01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:15.460
But it just involves
derivative of Lorentzian.

01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:19.070
And now we can ask, what
is the lowest temperature

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:20.720
we can reach?

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.140
Well, you can now analyze
your expression for alpha

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:30.360
for a two-level system solved
by the Optical Bloch Equation.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.630
And you find that you will have
the most favorable conditions

01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:37.920
for low temperature-- you
get the minimum possible

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:41.980
temperature-- in the
limit of low laser power.

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.370
And your detuning--
your optimum detuning--

01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:46.990
is half a line width away.

01:26:46.990 --> 01:26:50.850
And then you'll find
this famous result,

01:26:50.850 --> 01:26:54.900
that if you cool
a two-level atom,

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.850
the limiting
temperature is simply

01:26:57.850 --> 01:27:01.030
given by the spontaneous
emission rate,

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:05.030
or the line width of
your transition, gamma.

01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:09.120
And this is the famous
result for the Doppler limit.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.600
For sodium atoms,
it's 250 micro-Kelvin,

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.920
for rubidium and cesium,
because of the heavier mass,

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.265
it's lower, is 10's
of micro-Kelvin, 50

01:27:21.265 --> 01:27:23.190
or 100 micro-Kelvin.

01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:25.440
So this is a famous limit.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.710
And the physics of
it is the following,

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:32.070
the narrower the line width is.

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:38.400
Then you can say the better
you can cool particle down

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.960
to zero temperature--
and I think,

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.490
Jenny, your idea of
the Raman process

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:46.820
comes now in very handy--
I can have an atom,

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:50.360
and I can have a Raman process
where I scatter photons

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.780
and go to higher energy
or I scatter photons

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.300
and got to lower energy.

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.750
And the difference
between the two processes

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.890
is actually, the one
that whether I cool

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:03.080
or whether I heat comes
from the Doppler effect.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.810
So the more I can discriminate
between through the Doppler

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:10.260
effect, the better I can cool.

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.640
But the Doppler effect--
the Doppler shift,

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.320
kv-- how well I can
resolve it, depends

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.520
on the width of the
atomic transition.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.840
The narrower the
atomic transition,

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.910
the more the Doppler effect
can steer the laser cooling--

01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:28.190
the Raman process--
towards lower velocity,

01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:30.470
not towards higher velocity.

01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:33.510
So that's the natural result
that the-- or an expected

01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:37.711
result-- that the natural
line width appears here.

01:28:37.711 --> 01:28:38.210
OK.

01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.543
I've talked a few extra minutes.

01:28:39.543 --> 01:28:43.470
Is there any question?

01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:46.190
Then I see you on Wednesday.
