00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:26.020
PROFESSOR: Ready to roll?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.350
OK, good afternoon.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.510
Count down four lectures
and you know everything

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.670
you have to know about
atomic and optical physics,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.910
at least for those of you
who take part two-- for those

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.760
of you who've taken part one and
part two-- for the other ones,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.850
well, there is one more semester
which is the following spring.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.340
So we have discussed
light forces, first

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.040
with the optical
Bloch equations,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.120
and then we discussed the
stimulated light force

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.410
using the dressed atom picture.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.850
So this is sort of finishing
the presentation and derivation

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.420
of they light forces.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.700
Today, I want to continue
to discuss for the aspects.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.440
We've discussed dipole
traps, different ways how

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.210
we can understand why
there is a dipole potential

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.840
from the harmonic oscillator
to the dressed atom

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.500
to the refraction of
light by small spheres.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.830
So in all cases, we realize
red detuned light traps.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.930
Today I want to discuss
what is at work here,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.380
electrical magnetic
forces, and then I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.870
want to address
what several of you

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.320
have asked, where is
energy conservation?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.170
Where does the energy go when
we cool with a stimulated force?

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.130
But this will only
take 10 minutes.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.800
The main part of
today's lecture will

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.750
be techniques to go to
very low temperature

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.190
to ultra-low temperature.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.880
This is sub-Doppler
cooling, sub-recoil cooling,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.130
evaporative cooling,
and magnetic trapping

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.039
as a technique.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.890
So this is the menu today.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.870
Again, a feature-picked menu.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.300
Now talking about electric
and magnetic forces,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.110
you may think it's
a trick question,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.920
but it's rather subtle.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.520
All optical forces were derived
from the electric dipole

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.650
Hamiltonian D dot
E. This is what

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.790
we used as a starting
point for light forces.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.890
So my question is, what
about the Lorentz force?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.840
The Lorentz force comes
from the magnetic part

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.100
of the electromagnetic field.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.690
Now, is there Lorentz
force on the atoms?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.380
And, if yes, does it contribute
to the light forces or is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.610
it negligibly small?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.030
Actually, the question
I'm asking you,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.630
I don't think it's
addressed in any textbook

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.390
and I think you can
go to conferences

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.450
and ask some of your colleagues.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.920
You may get a wide
range of answers.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.790
So but anyway, has anybody
of you thought about it?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.240
What about, is there Lorentz
force on neutral atoms?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.670
If no, you're done.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.100
If yes, does it contribute,
is it negligible,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.270
or is it even dominant?

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:32.651
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
temperature

00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.609
or is equivalent to
the T minus A picture,

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.553
and the T minus A picture
has the Lorentz force, so

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.525
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:42.540
So.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.320
PROFESSOR: So it
should be included

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.520
because we are talking about
two different representations.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.585
Collin?

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:51.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.070
PROFESSOR: OK, so yes.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.080
The Lorentz force is included.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.400
Also, when you ride
on D dot E, you

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.880
think it's the electric
force of an electric dipole.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.300
We come to that in a moment.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.900
The next question is,
do you have any idea

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.195
if the Lorentz
force is important

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:14.320
or whether it's negligible?

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:19.089
AUDIENCE: For neutral, or?

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.362
PROFESSOR: For neutral atoms.

00:04:25.322 --> 00:04:27.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:32.930
PROFESSOR: OK, who of you is
working on optical lattices

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.160
or wants to work on
optical lattices?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.390
OK, just to catch
your attention,

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.390
when the atom goes up and down
the optical lattice, if feels

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.080
the lattice potential.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.350
The force is 100%
the Lorentz force.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.400
There is no contribution
from the electric force.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.200
So that's what I
want to show you now.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:02.850
So we have two fundamental
forces, the electric force

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.700
and-- if you have two charges
separated in the field,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.960
two different electric fields--
we derive from the Coulomb

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.780
force, the dipole force.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.580
And the force on
the electric dipole

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.255
is-- that potential is-- D
dot E. The gradient of it

00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:25.080
is D times gradient E-- with
correct Victorian notation--

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.170
whereas the Lorentz
force is V cross B.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.458
So these are the two
forces we have to consider.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.350
Let me show two configurations
where we use dipole forces,

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.230
the stimulated light force.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.820
One is here where we
focus a laser beam,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.690
and let's just assume for
the sake of the discussion

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.030
that the laser beam--
it's propagating here

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.390
and the linear polarization
goes up and down.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.320
So now we have a dipole
moment of the atom, which

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.210
oscillates up and down, which is
parallel to the electric field.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.330
So now we have D dot E, and
indeed if you take the atom

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.640
and move it into
the laser beam, it

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.020
will experience an
attractive force

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.680
and this attractive
force is purely electric.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.790
But let's now come to the
situation which many of you

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.820
work on in the laboratory, would
that we have two plane waves--

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.070
so the laser beams are
infinity extended--

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.940
we have two plane waves and
they form an optical lattice.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:48.450
Now, the dipole, the oscillating
dipole, the electric dipole,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.090
is again driven by
linearly polarized light.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.940
It points up, but the
gradient of the electric field

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.680
is in the direction of the
interference of the lattice,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.010
so the gradient of
the electric field

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.650
is perpendicular to
the dipole moment.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.520
So therefore, D
dot E is exactly 0,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.310
and therefore, the electric part
of the potential-- the Coulomb

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.470
force which is
microscopically behind it--

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.220
will not contribute anything.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.720
So I could stop here
and say, well, OK,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.200
since we have only the Coulomb
force and the Lorentz force,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.240
I've proven to you it's
not the Coulomb force,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.820
so therefore it's
a Lorentz force.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.220
But let me just tell you why.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.060
So what I'm really telling you
is it is actually remarkable

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.980
that if you go along
the Z direction

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.560
and we take the Z derivative of
the AC Stock's shift potential,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.370
and the AC Stock's shift
potential is one half,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.290
alpha is now the
polarizability--

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.370
we use alpha in many
places-- times E square.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.590
So this is the AC
Stock's shift potential,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.490
and the spatial derivative of
the AC Stock's shift potential

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.510
is a force, but it's
the Lorentz force.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.550
Actually, I was amazed.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.425
I had to work it out
myself because I haven't

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.900
seen it discussed anywhere,
but you can simply

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.520
take the electric field
of a standing wave,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.820
perform this derivative,
and what you find

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.010
is you get the Lorentz force.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.390
If you wonder how you get
it without going through all

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.370
the Victorian notation,
the Lorentz force

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.110
is V cross B. The
velocity of the charge

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.520
is related to the derivative
of the dipole moment.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.720
The dipole moment is
charge times position,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.380
and the derivative
of the dipole moment

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.570
is charge times velocity.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.750
So don't let yourself
fool yourself.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.640
When you have an
oscillating field,

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.650
there are charges which move
their currents inside the atom.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.290
So our V cross B, the
V is pretty much D dot.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.520
The D dot is
polarizability times E dot,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.220
this is alpha
polarizability-- frequency

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.590
times the electric field.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:11.170
But, as Cody said, we can
go form P dot A to D dot E--

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.670
or, to be precise-- the magnetic
field is the curl of the vector

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:20.590
potential, and the curl
gives us the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.520
I'm suppressing Victorian
notation, here--

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.570
and you know that E,
the electric field,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.710
is the temporal derivative of
A, so therefore we get that.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:39.260
So if you now multiply D
dot with the curl of A,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.850
you get something which
is K alpha E square.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:47.220
K is for a standing wave,
the spatial derivative.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.720
So I've shown you--
at least you can

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.160
see by dimensional analysis,
or by just pointing

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.820
to the different terms, that if
you take the AC Stock's shift

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.420
potential through
the derivative,

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.711
you get everything which you
have in the Lorentz force.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.142
It would be a 10 minute,
easy homework assignment,

00:10:05.142 --> 00:10:07.350
but we're running out of
homework assignments-- we're

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.730
at the end of the semester--
to show that, explicitly.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.600
So it is really
the Lorentz force

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.424
which provides the
trapping potential

00:10:15.424 --> 00:10:16.340
in an optical lattice.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.210
Questions?

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.710
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.336
AUDIENCE: So in
the simple picture

00:10:23.336 --> 00:10:26.108
you have [INAUDIBLE]
the lattice,

00:10:26.108 --> 00:10:29.826
you're saying that the
transverse confinement is

00:10:29.826 --> 00:10:32.526
provided by the
electric force, but what

00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:34.245
about the perpendicular
direction?

00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:37.620
[INAUDIBLE] electric field like
this, but the other direction?

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.120
PROFESSOR: OK, I can discuss
with you two simple geometries.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.310
In one case, in
one direction it's

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.500
the pure Coulomb force at work.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.010
In the other direction,
it's the pure Lorentz force.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.670
But in general, when you go
through an AC Stock's shift

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.880
potential, you have both.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.720
So you may wonder that
the Coulomb force, when

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.240
you integrate it, would
not be integrable.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.620
It does not give
rise to potential.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.740
Also, the Lorentz force does
not give rise to potential.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.800
But if you add the Coulomb
force and the Lorentz force,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.750
you can integrate it up to
the optical dipole potential.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.060
I find it remarkable,
but it is what it is.

00:11:23.105 --> 00:11:23.605
Questions?

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.490
So energy conservation, yes.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:32.490
That's a good thing
to discuss now.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.450
Let me first discuss I want
to have-- energy conservation

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.270
has to be discussed with
two different perspectives.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.797
One is a transient
phenomenon-- which

00:11:49.797 --> 00:11:52.380
I'll do in a few minutes-- but
let me first discuss something,

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.270
which is CW, and this
is the following.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.690
You have atoms which move
over a standing wave,

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.220
and I use the dressed
atom picture to show you

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.880
that-- for a strong, blue
detuned standing wave--

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.830
we have a friction force.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.790
So the atom-- this was
the Sisyphus cooling--

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.360
that the atom is climbing up
hills, there's some transition,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.650
climbs up the next hill,
but on average the atom

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.390
climbs up more hills
than it scoots down,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.485
and therefore
there is work done.

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:30.150
There is a net force, and this
net force provides friction.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.090
It slows down the
velocity of the atom.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.280
My question to you is,
where has this energy gone?

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.200
The kinetic energy lost by atom,
where does this energy appear?

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.471
Which fields?

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:52.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the laser beam?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.580
PROFESSOR: Well, we have two
fields, the laser fields,

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.440
and we have maybe a
spontaneous emission?

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.940
But the force is only a
stimulated force due to-- yeah?

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.618
Which fields?

00:13:11.618 --> 00:13:13.100
AUDIENCE: The laser field?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.064
Because when you stimulate
into a laser field,

00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:20.030
your [INAUDIBLE]
modulator [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.470
PROFESSOR: Well, I have a
little bit problem with that

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.530
because when the
atoms-- the force

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.190
comes from distributing
photons from one standing

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.900
wave to the other one, and these
are photons of equal frequency.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:44.230
So in that sense, the net effect
is that those two laser beams--

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.880
actually, the atom moves, here.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.840
So what should happen
to the laser beams?

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.930
Photons are not disappearing.

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:02.330
I will later tell you, in the
transient picture-- and this,

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.913
maybe you've already done your
homework assignment number 10--

00:14:04.913 --> 00:14:06.970
there is something
happening to the laser beam.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.905
But this would only
happen when atoms fly in

00:14:09.905 --> 00:14:12.030
and fly out of a laser beam.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.060
Then we have a
different situation.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.120
But here, if the atoms stay in
the laser beam the laser beam--

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.050
so to speak-- sees a constant
index of refraction medium.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.500
It just goes through
and nothing has

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.630
happened to the photons except
that-- occasionally-- photons

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.040
are spontaneously emitted.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.470
Well, OK.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:40.320
If it's not the laser
beams, what remains now?

00:14:43.754 --> 00:14:45.170
AUDIENCE: Spontaneous
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.100
PROFESSOR: Spontaneous emission.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:55.170
Now how can spontaneous
emission carry the energy?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.940
What is the spectrum of
spontaneous emission?

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.676
AUDIENCE: Triplets?

00:15:05.676 --> 00:15:07.050
PROFESSOR: Yes,
the mono-triplet.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.000
We have the central
carrier, the central carrier

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.750
is not carrying away
any energy because it

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.320
is at the laser frequency.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.420
Now we have two side bands.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.810
Can the side bands
carry away energy?

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.190
AUDIENCE: Interlacing them.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.110
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.410
AUDIENCE: Interlacing
with the [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.178
PROFESSOR: Asymmetry
in what sense?

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:32.440
AUDIENCE: If the side bands
are [INAUDIBLE] escape.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.020
PROFESSOR: Well, but
didn't we discuss,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.580
with a radiative cascade,
that the blue detuned side

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.060
bend comes when you go from
the upper dressed level

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.870
to the dressed level?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.710
And in the lower
dressed level, you

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.554
can only emit a red detuned side
band, not a blue detuned side

00:15:48.554 --> 00:15:49.090
bands.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.960
What we said in the
radiative cascade

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.800
after one blue detuned photon,
there is a red detuned photon.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.290
So the number of photons
emitted on the red side band

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.530
and on the blue side
band are exactly equal.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.970
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.630
AUDIENCE: But then you have the
[INAUDIBLE] cooling picture,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.796
where the red detuned side then
was emitted in the lower field

00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:12.490
region?

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.470
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.530
So the situation
is the following.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.900
The atom emits an
equal number red, blue.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.110
Red detuned and blue detuned,
red detuned and blue detuned.

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.125
But when it emits
the blue detuned,

00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:26.210
the side bend spacing
is larger because it

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.490
emits the blue detuned photon
when it's on top of the hill.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.260
And the red detuned
photon is emitted

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.860
when the atom is
more in the dark,

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.670
and therefore, the side
bend spacing is lower.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.400
So it alternates
blue, red, blue, red.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.280
But the blue detuned photon is
emitted when the generalized RB

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.810
frequency is larger, when
the atoms is at an anti-node

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.300
And the red detuned is
more preferably emitted

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:58.050
when the photon is at a
node of the standing wave.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.170
So it is the difference
of these modulations,

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.420
the side bands are modulated,
and there is a preference

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.920
to emit the blue detuned
side band when the side band

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.829
spacing is larger than
in the red detuned case.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:13.670
And this is where
the energy goes.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.690
AUDIENCE: You could make
the argument and that

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.396
would give a simple picture
for the maximum cooling rate?

00:17:19.396 --> 00:17:20.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.810
AUDIENCE: Where you have omega
times your [? scattering ?]

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:23.750
rate?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.520
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:29.180
That's exactly how, last class,
I calculated the cooling rate.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.180
The cooling rate, the energy
removed from the system,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:46.960
is, well, yeah, I said it is
the height of the lattice,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.650
but the height of
the lattice is also

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.710
the amount by which
the-- the lattice is

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.230
nothing else than the
generalized RB frequency.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.860
This is the energy level
of one crest level,

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.760
and therefore the
lattice is the increment

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.090
by which we modulate
blue and red side bands.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.620
Exactly.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.870
This can be
quantitatively worked out.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:11.620
If I had another half hour,
I could do it for you.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.480
It's in the
references, but this is

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.990
the physical
picture for cooling.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:26.870
OK, but so you realize, this
is one of the subtleties.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.450
We can understand
the force simply

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.090
from a simple picture, energy
levels, Sisyphus cooling

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.120
and such, but in
order to understand

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.330
where the energy comes from,
we need the mono-triplet.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.580
We need spontaneous emission.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.690
So the force comes from the
redistribution of photons.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.135
It's the stimulated
redistribution

00:18:46.135 --> 00:18:48.600
of photons which is
responsible for the force,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.940
but the energy
balance comes from,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.330
what can be neglected for
the momentum balance, namely

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.270
the few spontaneous emission
events, and especially

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.870
those which involve the
blue and red side bands.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.880
And it beautifully
works together

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.840
and all the equation
of physics are obeyed.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.610
OK, but that tells you now
that the cooling effect

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.440
hinges on spontaneous emission.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.541
And yes, spontaneous
emission is dissipation.

00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:23.540
And whenever you want the
friction coefficient--

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.300
you want dissipation--
you need an open system

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.550
and the open system is
spontaneous emission

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.870
into those nodes.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.840
So let's now talk about
an opposite situation

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.290
where we do not have any
spontaneous emission.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.010
And I think almost
all the people

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.330
who work with optical lattices
use infrared lasers for them,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.300
or [INAUDIBLE] detuned laser
where spontaneous emission

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.395
happens only once
every 20, 30 seconds

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:51.410
or 100 seconds per atom, so
we can really neglect it.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.350
So now the question
is the following.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.830
Assume you have a
focused laser beam

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.290
and you load a
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.830
at the edge of the cloud,
and now the condensate

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.150
is accelerated, sucked
into the laser beam.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.550
So now the atom
has kinetic energy.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.510
The question is, where does
this kinetic energy come from?

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.210
And this time, we do not
have spontaneous emission

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.630
as we have when we do
frictional cooling.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.140
So the question is now, where
does the energy of the atom

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:23.640
come from?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.936
AUDIENCE: But if we were talking
about a dielectric medium,

00:20:31.936 --> 00:20:37.304
it's coming from those light
waves that are reflected or not

00:20:37.304 --> 00:20:39.760
reflected.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.220
PROFESSOR: If comes
from those light rays,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.590
but-- the atom is a dielectric
medium, that's good--

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:52.560
but the reflection and
deflection of light rays--

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.670
at least in leading order-- you
would say photons of the same

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.702
energy are deflected--

00:20:57.702 --> 00:21:01.638
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
[INAUDIBLE] of the atom

00:21:01.638 --> 00:21:07.060
just get absorbed [INAUDIBLE]
and the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.540
PROFESSOR: I would hate to
use the picture of absorption

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.090
and emission.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.610
What really happens is
it's just scattering.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.740
It's scattering.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.670
you scatter a photon
which has one frequency

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.017
into a different direction.

00:21:19.017 --> 00:21:20.225
It's really light scattering.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:30.056
Well, you have a homework
assignment on that,

00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:32.430
and I don't need to go into
details because it can easily

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:36.790
be worked out, but what
happens is the following.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.290
The atom is a dielectric medium.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.210
It has an index of refraction.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.050
And if you put an
index-- if you suddenly

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.990
put an index of refraction
into a laser beam--

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.770
then you change the
phase of the laser beam.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.760
The atoms act as an
electro-optical modulator,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.600
and they change the frequency
of the transmitted photons.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.780
You have a homework
assignment on that.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.580
So if you increase the number
of atoms in your laser beam,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.540
because they move in,
this is-- the phase

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.960
of the transmitted
photons is shifted.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.740
If the phase of the photons is
shifted during a certain time,

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.390
phase over time is frequency.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.630
So therefore you will see,
when the atoms move in and gain

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:28.880
kinetic energy, the transmitted
photons of the laser beam

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.250
have lost some energy.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.100
They are slightly
shifted to the red.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.800
So in other words, it's funny
but if you have a dipole trap

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.020
and the laser beam
is focused and atoms

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.750
slosh through the trap,
if you would carefully

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.590
analyze the frequency
of the transmitted beam,

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.890
you will find that it's a
little bit blue, a little bit

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.390
red, a little bit
blue, a little bit

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:52.130
red, and this compensates
for the kinetic energy.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.800
Again, I don't think you'll
find it in any textbook.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.900
It confused me for a while
until I could work it out.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.280
But the homework assignment
gives you an exact dissoluble

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.060
model where you can exactly
show what I told you.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.680
So these are the two
situations, here.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.230
It's either
spontaneous emission,

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.160
which is responsible
for cooling,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.320
but here we have a
conservative potential.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.510
And in this
conservative potential,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.660
the only player is the laser
beam which is transmitted.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.640
And, indeed, it is the photons
which have been transmitted,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.850
and usually you wouldn't
put that into your picture.

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:32.640
Remember, the dipole
force can be explained

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.710
by eliminating the
coherent field of the laser

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.280
field-- for canonical
transformation--

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.000
and then we have a C number.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.910
We have a classical
electric field.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.090
This is your Hamiltonian,
and from this Hamiltonian,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.610
you derive that you have
a conservative potential.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.750
But if you now ask
where the energy goes,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.840
the energy-- really,
in this situation--

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.250
goes into a frequency
shift of the photons.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.470
Also, in your
Hamiltonian, you have

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:04.440
assumed that the electric field
is an external classical field,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:10.110
E naught times cosine omega T.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.070
Well, if you want
my advice, whenever

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.130
you use the AC Stock's
shift for trapping,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.420
just use the AC Stock's
shift and regard it

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.370
as a classic potential,
and just completely forget

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.470
that there are photons behind
because if you want to account

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.310
what really happens to the
photons-- what really happens

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.522
to the energy in this
system-- it really gets ugly

00:24:31.522 --> 00:24:32.855
and it can get really confusing.

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:38.086
Questions?

00:24:44.528 --> 00:24:48.625
OK, we are done with
the stimulated force.

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:51.660
We are now in
preparation for next week

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.340
when I want to tell you
about degenerate Fermi gases

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.440
and degenerate Bose gases.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.920
Those gases require
nanokelvin temperatures,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.840
so today, in the
next hour, I want

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.830
to tell you what
are the techniques

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:10.000
to create such
ultra-low temperatures,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.860
and the techniques
I want to discuss

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.770
is one addition
to laser cooling.

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.950
We have so far discussed laser
cooling to the Doppler limit,

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.250
but now I have to tell
you that that's not

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.900
where laser cooling stops.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.310
You can go sub-Doppler
and sub-recoil.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.990
And, at least when
the Nobel Prize

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.610
was given to Bill Phillips,
Steve Chu, and Claude

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.750
Cohen-Tannoudji, well, if
you go to the Nobel website

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.964
and read the report of the
Nobel Committee-- well,

00:25:40.964 --> 00:25:42.630
they should have given
it to those three

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.560
people for the many,
many wonderful things

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.130
they have done, and I've
made frequent references

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.910
to their work.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.020
Bill Phillips invented
Zeeman slower,

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.760
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji invented
the dressed atom picture,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.790
they have many,
many contributions,

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.265
but the Nobel Committee
tried to justify their choice

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:01.240
with a coherent story,
and the coherent story

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.750
was Steve Chu cooled to the
Doppler limit in molasses,

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.700
Bill Phillips discovered
sub-Doppler cooling,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.600
and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji
realized sub-recoil cooling.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.005
So the storyline was
cold, colder, the coldest.

00:26:15.005 --> 00:26:16.660
And that's what we
want to talk today.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:24.620
So sub-Doppler cooling.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.770
Well, I could have spent--
or, 10 years ago, I

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.710
spent a whole lecture
on sub-Doppler cooling,

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.210
polarization gradient cooling.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.150
Wonderful!

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:38.200
The kind of epiphany of
elegance in [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.250
a mechanical
description of an atom.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.130
But I have to say--
and then I explained,

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:45.380
in another lecture,
sub-recoil cooling,

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.080
how you can even cool
below the recoil limit.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.200
Well, this year, 2013,
I spent 15 minute on it.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.920
The reason is the following.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.420
When I joined atomic
physics and was a post-doc

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.460
in the '90s and
assistant professor,

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.180
the conference's
[INAUDIBLE] of [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.690
[INAUDIBLE] was full on intents
to find new ways to laser cool.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.770
Ideas of how to get to lower
and lower temperatures.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.120
There were many, many
different-- sub-Doppler,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.200
sub-recoil techniques
were discussed.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.990
This was the main topic.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:23.160
But then suddenly,
in 1995, evaporative

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.770
cooling-- an intellectually
boring cooling technique,

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.160
just have atoms
collide and evaporate--

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.770
this led to the lowest
temperature ever,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.110
and it was almost a
sudden transition.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.930
Within a few months there was
no research, no papers anymore,

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.940
on advanced methods
of laser cooling.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.860
Evaporative cooling it
just completely wiped out

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.200
this area over atomic physics.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.940
The reason being because
all cooling schemes which

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.590
have been discussed had,
in the end, some problems.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.990
At some point, photons heat.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:58.770
Heat because they excite an atom
and if an excited atom collides

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.980
with another atom, there is
a heating mechanism and such.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:07.100
So even all the optimistic
proposals for laser cooling

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.930
reached very low temperature,
but never at high density.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.270
And evaporative cooling
just did everything for you.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:18.700
But anyway, I think it-- not
just because a Nobel Prize was

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.760
given for sub-Doppler
and sub-recoil cooling,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.900
this is really an accomplishment
to understand how can you

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.710
go through conventional
cooling limits,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.800
and at least every
graduate student

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.280
who happens to graduate
in AMO physics at MIT

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.090
should know what
are the concepts

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.030
behind sub-Doppler and
sub-recoil cooling.

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.110
So what I need in order to
introduce those cooling methods

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.450
for you is I have to remind
you that optical pumping is

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.170
a cooling scheme, and one could
actually say, to some extent,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.010
every cooling you do with lasers
is based on optical pumping.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.790
And so let me explain that.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.200
Optical pumping
happens that-- let's

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.130
say you have a level
structure with a circularly

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.340
polarized light where you can
go maybe from M equals 1 to M

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.540
equals zero.

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:13.550
And then there can be
spontaneous emission back to M

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.020
equals 1 and back to M equals
minus 1, but the laser--

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.820
because it has
angular momentum--

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:24.000
cannot excite this state
to any excited state.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.220
So what happens is, of
course, pretty clear.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.530
You have whatever distribution
you have in state one and two.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.930
You switch on your laser,
and after a few cycles

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.680
everything has fallen
into the dark state.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.210
You have 100%
population in stage two.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.910
So this is the simplest
example of optical

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:45.650
pumping using the
three-level scheme.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.890
Well, you may ask now, what
has that to do with cooling?

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:54.400
Well, temperature is
a Boltzmann factor,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.880
and if you-- we can define
a temperature by saying

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:04.770
the population
between two levels

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.160
is given by a Boltzmann factor.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.100
Let's just introduce an
energy-splitting delta

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.340
E-- which is somewhat arbitrary
here-- but in any event,

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.000
you see if you completely
pump out a level,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.810
if you have all the
population in one state,

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.010
this corresponds to
zero temperature.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.540
So if you optically pump
the atoms, preferentially,

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.710
into certain states,
you have lowered

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.320
the entropy of the system, the
atoms are no longer distributed

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.400
over as many states
as before, and this

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.960
corresponds to
lower temperature.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.700
And the message I
want to give you

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:46.360
is that you can understand
laser cooling as optical pumping

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.760
in translation space
in velocity space.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.920
When you laser cool, you excite
the atoms at high velocity

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.590
and then because of the
mechanisms we discussed,

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.860
spontaneous emission
leads to lower velocities,

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.750
and this is one form
of optical pumping.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.340
I also like the word-- optical
pumping is, in some sense,

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.060
a spontaneous Raman process.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.360
You go up with one
photon, you go down

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.260
with-- you go up with
the laser photon,

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.390
you go down with the
spontaneously emitted photon.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.660
So this is a spontaneous
Raman process,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.790
and laser cooling-- even if
you have just a single ground

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.150
state-- can be regarded
as a Raman process

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.340
where the initial and
final state differ

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.120
in velocity or momentum.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.900
You have the same
internal state,

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.820
but you have a different
external state.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.274
So you can see laser cooling
is spontaneous Raman scattering

00:31:38.274 --> 00:31:39.690
between different
momentum states.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:54.300
OK, now how can we achieve
sub-Doppler cooling?

00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:02.270
Sub-Doppler cooling
was discovered in 1988,

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.320
and I remember I was at the
[? IKA ?] Conference in Paris

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.800
when Bill Phillips'
group said, we've

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.620
carefully measured
the temperature

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.780
and in sodium we measure
a temperature which

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.930
is lower than the Doppler limit,
which was rigorously derived.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:18.510
I derived for you the
Doppler limit of molasses.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.710
So what went wrong here?

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.160
Well, it became clear
the only loophole--

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.440
if you have a theory
which predicts something

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.770
and then you find a
violation, you carefully

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.510
have to check the assumption.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.420
And the assumption
which was made--

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.200
and which we have
made in this course--

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.390
is that you had a
two-level system.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.520
Now, atoms have
hyperfine structure--

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.550
and for pedagogical
reasons, because I

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.070
want to explain to you why
in sub-Doppler cooling scheme

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.590
I assume this hyperfine
structure with F

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.260
equals one half, F
equals three half--

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.340
but let me first tell you
what the novel feature is

00:32:54.340 --> 00:33:02.370
about a multi-level atom
which has hyperfine structure.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.430
Now, the one thing
which happens is

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.820
that-- instead of just going
between our single ground state

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.950
and our single excited state--
we now have transitions.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.225
You may want to call
them Raman transitions,

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:21.070
or optical pumping, between
the hyperfine atoms.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.900
So there are now transitions
not only up to an excited

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.860
state which rapidly
decays, there

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.270
are now transitions--
Raman transitions--

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:39.310
between ground states which
have a very low widths.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.290
The width of the
excited state is gamma.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:46.890
Well, what is the width
of the ground state?

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.580
Well, if you don't
have a laser beam,

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.770
the width is zero,
but if you have

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:56.670
laser beams the atom
doesn't stay there forever.

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.550
There will be a time, which
is estimated here-- depending

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.700
on the RB frequency and the
detuning-- this is the time,

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.150
this is simply nothing
else than the scattering

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.510
rate which we derived before.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.170
So that's the rate at
which you scatter photons.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:17.820
And then, depending what
the bunching ratio is,

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.090
this is also the time in
which you may optically

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.909
pump to another ground state.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.719
So therefore, what we
have to take into account

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:32.590
now is that we have narrower
widths in our system,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:38.250
and those widths correspond to
another two-level system which

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.710
is driven by two photons in
which connects the two ground

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.280
states.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.590
I will not give you any
derivation how this exactly

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.540
leads to a lower
temperature, but I

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.739
want to give you two
pictures which I have already

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.400
introduced to you.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.860
One is, remember, when we
discussed Doppler cooling,

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.350
the final temperature was
proportionate to gamma,

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.770
the width of the transition.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.620
So now I wave my hands and
say, if you have transitions

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.990
between ground states which have
a much, much smaller width--

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.970
which is the rate
of optical pumping--

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.820
and for low laser
power this width

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.200
can become very, very narrow.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.342
But you have at
least one ingredient

00:35:24.342 --> 00:35:25.925
which can lead to a
lower temperature.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:34.370
OK, in all truth in
advertising, for the Sisyphus--

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.780
for the polarization
gradient cooling scheme--

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.530
the final temperature
is not given

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.090
by gamma prime, the
rate of optical pumping.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.470
It is a proportionality factor,
but there is another factor.

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.975
If you want to
learn about it, you

00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:51.410
have to read some of
the classic papers.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.240
But there is another
picture which I can also

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.830
use to tell you--
and that's actually

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:01.940
related-- why optical
pumping at least gives

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.270
the possibility for
lower temperature.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:07.365
I explained to you with the
stimulated force in [? blue ?]

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:11.370
molasses-- that the only
reason why we have cooling--

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:15.010
is that the atom has a lag time.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:19.060
It cannot instantaneously adjust
itself to the light field.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:21.220
It lags behind.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.410
And you can say,
in Doppler cooling,

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:27.260
the lag time is the
spontaneous emission time,

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.870
and the inverse of it is gamma.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.110
Here, in this case,
the lag time can

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.140
be the very long time
to optically pump.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.920
So therefore, if the atom is
in one hyperfine state and now

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.640
moves into an area where the
polarization of the laser beams

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.940
is different, it may take
a long time to adjust.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:54.700
And it is this lag time to
which the friction coefficient

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.360
was proportional.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.350
So this is a new feature, long
delay times, narrow widths,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.780
and resonances between
ground state levels.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.940
OK, a little bit
show and tell now.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.915
Nobody thought
about polarization

00:37:15.915 --> 00:37:18.610
creating cooling, nobody
thought about Doppler cooling,

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.780
but it was discovered
when people simply

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.610
did Doppler molasses
and it's one

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:27.100
of those big violations
of Murphy's law

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.810
where cooling worked much better
than everybody had thought,

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:32.920
and the result is the following.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.450
That-- when I drew for
you the blue curve, which

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.220
is force versus velocity--
it's pretty much

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.780
the subtraction of
two [? Lorentzian ?].

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.780
What happened is-- for sodium
atoms, or for any alkali atom--

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.350
it's the red curve.

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.430
For large velocity you have
the Doppler cooling mechanism,

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:57.020
but for smaller velocities you
have a steepening of the slope,

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.970
and the steeper the slope,
the larger is your friction

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.570
coefficient, alpha.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:09.550
And this is the mechanism of
polarization gradient cooling.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.220
Let me just take
this famous paper

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:17.150
and show you one way how
polarization gradient cooling

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:20.860
works, which is the most famous
form of sub-Doppler cooling,

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.780
and this goes as follows.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.690
If you have molasses
with two laser beams

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.760
and the two laser
beams are lin-perp-lin,

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.900
linear polarization
perpendicular

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.670
to the other linear
polarization.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.722
So you have two laser beams
with these polarization.

00:38:35.722 --> 00:38:38.870
When these two polarizations
overlap and they

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.450
have the same phase, you
get light at 45 degree,

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.930
but if these two polarization
have 90 degree out of phase,

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.320
you get circularly
polarized light.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:53.040
So as these two laser
beams counter-propagate,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.710
you periodically go from
linear polarized sigma minus,

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.740
linear polarized sigma plus.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.280
So you have spatial--
at any given point

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.910
you have a polarization, but
the polarization changes.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.880
You have a-- you
would say, naively,

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.080
lin-perp-lin don't interfere,
don't form a standing wave.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.540
Well, they do not form a
standing wave in intensity.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.850
They form a standing
wave in polarization.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.850
So now what happens
is the following.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:27.940
If you have a multi-level atom
and I use this simple scheme

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.450
here, the different
polarizations,

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.370
linear polarization
drives, the pi transition,

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.170
sigma plus and sigma
minus [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.270
different transitions,
and those transitions

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.310
have different strengths.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.570
So an atom here--
when it experience

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.800
this polarization--
reaches cycle,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:50.446
but when it experiences the
other circular polarization,

00:39:50.446 --> 00:39:54.500
it will be optically pumped
over here and then it cycles.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.250
So therefore, an atom which from
sigma plus polarization and was

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.160
here, it flies over to
an area where you've

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.450
sigma minus polarization, it
will actually be pumped over.

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:09.810
So the atom will constantly
be pumped back and forth

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.440
between those hyperfine states.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.770
And this actually gives rise
to a beautiful form of Sisyphus

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.190
cooling that the atom
experiences sigma plus

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.750
light in one ground state.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:29.340
It climbs up the hill, it
sees the AC Stock's shift

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.740
potential-- and the AC
Stock's shift potential,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:36.440
because of the, for instance,
for one hyperfine state, sigma

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.550
plus drives the
strongest transition--

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:42.550
and therefore we have
sigma plus light,

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.840
one ground state has
the deepest potential.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.200
Where we have sigma
minus light, it

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.370
is the other ground state which
has the deepest potential.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:54.260
And so what happens is that the
atom is in one hyperfine state.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.550
It climbs up the
hill, and then it's

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.880
optically pumped to the
other hyperfine state,

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:05.850
and we have exactly the same
kind of Sisyphus cooling.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.980
I just show you pictures
and you sort of match it

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.290
with what you know.

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.520
This is more
complicated because this

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.130
involves optical pumping
between hyperfine states.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:17.660
The different hyperfine states
have different [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.200
coefficients and such.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.900
It's not really complicated
but more complex.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.370
What I explained to you
is how Sisyphus cooling

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.950
works in the
dressed atom picture

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.030
just for a two-level system.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:34.350
And here you find a more subtle
form of Sisyphus cooling,

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.290
but this form is more
important because whenever

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.500
you operate a
magneto-optic trap,

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.610
you get this cooling
mechanism for free.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:58.030
OK, so that's all I want to tell
you about sub-Doppler cooling.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.210
OK, sub-recoil cooling, we
can quickly deal with it

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.300
because I want to prove to you
here that sub-recoil cooling is

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.100
impossible.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.730
And unless you tell me what
this wrong in my derivation,

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:12.480
I don't need to discuss
sub-recoil cooling

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.760
because I've convinced
you that it's impossible .

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.010
OK, so let's assume our atom
has an initial kinetic energy

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.910
and then we absorb one photon.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:25.560
That would mean the momentum has
now changed by the laser photon

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.710
by the recoil-- and
then it emits a photon,

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.420
so the momentum gets reduced
by the immediate photon--

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.740
and all I do is I ask,
what is the difference

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.560
between the initial
kinetic energy

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:44.530
and the final kinetic energy
after two photons-- a laser

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:49.100
photon and the spontaneously
photon-- have been exchanged?

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.590
And what you find is--
and this is just exact--

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:55.625
that the change in energy is
two times the recoil energy.

00:42:55.625 --> 00:43:01.860
The recoil energy is h-bar
square K square over 2m, plus--

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:07.300
and this is now the
cross-term-- plus KL--

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:11.510
the K vector of the laser--
minus K spontaneous emission

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.590
times the velocity.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.690
And now, of course, we
assume-- which is correct--

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.220
that spontaneous emission goes
randomly in all directions.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.670
Therefore, if we average
over many cycles,

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.040
this does not contribute.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.660
So therefore we find now that
the average energy exchanged

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.750
by an absorption and
emission event is two times

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:41.840
the recoil energy plus h-bar
K laser times [? width ?],

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.770
and we want to make it negative
because we want to cool.

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.300
Well, we make it negative by
arranging the laser beam--

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.700
surprise, surprise--
counter-propagating

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.800
to the velocity.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.640
This is how we can
get the best cooling.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.290
Well, surprise, that's
what we expected.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:08.080
But you find, of course, that
when this velocity is a very

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:15.480
small then K V is
smaller than K squared.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:20.200
So therefore, once the velocity
is smaller than the recoil

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:26.410
velocity of a single
photon, you cannot choose--

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:32.830
you cannot make this equation
or this expression go negative.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:34.600
In other words, what
I've shown to you

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.920
is if there is an atom which
has a velocity which is smaller

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.315
than the recoil velocity
of a photon, whenever

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:48.550
this atom scatters
a single photon,

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.300
it will be hotter
than it was before.

00:44:55.902 --> 00:44:57.860
So is it clear, what I've
shown you, in energy?

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.080
When an atom has
a velocity which

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.040
is smaller than the
recoil velocity,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:07.340
any further photon
scattering will not cool.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.460
It will lead to an
energy transfer delta

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.440
E, which is large,
which is possible.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:21.907
So that shows you that
sub-recoil cooling

00:45:21.907 --> 00:45:22.490
is impossible.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.160
Any idea how we can
sub-recoil cool?

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:40.530
Any idea why Claude
Cohen-Tannoudji

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.610
got the Nobel Prize?

00:45:44.436 --> 00:45:46.030
AUDIENCE: Further
down in the lattice,

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.777
you can have an
effective mass that

00:45:47.777 --> 00:45:51.910
is much heavier than
[? bare ?] mass?

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:54.190
PROFESSOR: OK, great idea.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.230
We put the atom in a lattice,
a lattice has band structure,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.610
in a band structure we
have an effective mass,

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:04.200
and heavier atoms can be cooled
to lower and lower temperature.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.520
Actually, it's well known
that, in Doppler cooling

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.295
and sub-Doppler
cooling-- especially

00:46:10.295 --> 00:46:13.470
in sub-Doppler cooling--
cesium an rubidium reach

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:17.510
a microkelvin, sodium
reaches only 25 microkelvin.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:20.530
So making the atom
heavier is OK,

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.540
but I have to say you're only
rescaling your recoil limit,

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.370
you're not breaking through
the recoil limit which is now

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:31.140
defined with a heavier
effective mass.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
emission direction--

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.505
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:46:35.505 --> 00:46:37.445
AUDIENCE: --means
that the atom must

00:46:37.445 --> 00:46:40.585
have [INAUDIBLE]
responding is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:40.585 --> 00:46:41.210
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.160
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.510
PROFESSOR: That
was the assumption.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.982
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] at
least for this cooling,

00:46:49.982 --> 00:46:56.430
it needs the time much larger
than the Doppler cooling

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:00.164
[INAUDIBLE] spontaneous
emission time?

00:47:00.164 --> 00:47:02.080
PROFESSOR: Well, that
was the assumption here.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.520
We scatter several times, a
spontaneously emitted photon

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:13.170
do not contribute the recoil
of the spontaneously emitted

00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:17.970
photons cancels out because
spontaneous emission-- and this

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.020
is correct, this is not wrong--
spontaneous emission goes

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:26.080
equally probable in the plus
X and the minus X direction.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:30.630
Well, I thought I want to
show you a demonstration how--

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.810
mechanical demonstration--
how you can sub-recoil cool.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.250
It's not a demonstration
in velocity space,

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.430
it's a demonstration
in position space.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.710
What I have here
is a Plexiglas tray

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.380
and it has a little
hole in the middle.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.700
And I have a bunch
of ball bearings

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.332
and I put those
ball bearings in.

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:49.040
Let me translate.

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:58.570
I can blindfold myself and
all I do is I shake the tray.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.860
So whenever I shake
it, I kick the atoms

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.570
randomly in position
space from here to here.

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.420
So the amount of position
control I have over the atoms

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.230
is on the order of this size.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:16.110
But the question is,
can I-- without having

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:21.410
any control of the transfer
of position I give to them--

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.130
can I steer all the
atoms into an area

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.110
here into the hole in the
middle, which is very, very

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:31.100
narrow in position space?

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.350
So the translation is, if
I randomly scatter photons

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.720
and they kick the atoms
around with h-bar K,

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.710
I don't have any
control about momentum

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:40.820
transfer smaller
than h-bar K, is it

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.530
possible to localize the
atoms in momentum space

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.810
to a momentum around
zero, which is

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.186
much, much smaller than h-bar K?

00:48:49.186 --> 00:48:51.810
Well, let's do the experiment.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:56.080
I just close my eyes and I
shake it, and I shake it,

00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:01.020
and I just shake it for a while
and I continue shaking it.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.740
And, well, zero temperature!

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.410
So without controlling
the motion on the scale

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:15.950
I'm interested in, I manage to
cool into a target region which

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.470
is much, much narrower.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:22.210
So in other words, what
you need is-- all you

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:28.460
need is-- you need
some dark state which

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.770
is velocity selective.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:35.240
If you scatter light but
you create a situation where

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.020
once the atoms are close to zero
velocity, they're not excited.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.460
You're not steering the
atoms in a deterministic way,

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.490
you just wait until-- by random
chance-- one photon is emitted,

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.910
and by the random chance
the atom hits the hole.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:57.120
And then, it will never
be re-excited again.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.330
This was the idea of
this demonstration.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.010
And I could, yes,
in the old days

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.650
I may have spent two
hours on teaching it,

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:10.250
but by using Raman resonances
between ground states--

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:14.740
which are terribly narrow--
or by using VSCPT-- velocity

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.600
selective coherent population
trapping-- you can create

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.100
such narrow dark
resonances which

00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.290
have the effect that the atoms
scatter, scatter, scatter,

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.450
but the moment they reach a
very narrow region around zero

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.840
velocity, they stop scattering.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.750
So what was wrong in my
proof is that here we

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:38.430
have a situation where we
stop the laser cooling exactly

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:41.220
at the time when the
atom, by random chance,

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:45.250
happens to be at low velocity,
at very low velocity.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.250
And then you don't
need any control,

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.630
you just accumulate
in the same way

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.670
as I accumulated
the ball bearings.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:07.110
OK, this was sub-recoil cooling
in five minutes. [? Timo ?]?

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.400
AUDIENCE: So I wasn't
here last class.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.367
But just to summarize,
the Doppler cooling rate

00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:12.908
gets us to a
temperature on the order

00:51:12.908 --> 00:51:14.330
of gamma, which is
natural alignment.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:14.955
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:18.936
AUDIENCE: And the recoil
limit is the recoil energy

00:51:18.936 --> 00:51:21.870
which is usually
tens of kilograms.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:23.920
But if you have a really,
really narrow line,

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.624
would you use the
Doppler cooling limit?

00:51:26.624 --> 00:51:29.970
You could, in principle,
beat the recoil limit

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.404
with Doppler cooling, no?

00:51:31.404 --> 00:51:32.850
If you have a--

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.230
PROFESSOR: No, you can't,
because if you do Doppler

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:37.430
cooling-- [? Timo's ?]
question is,

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:42.390
if you simply do molasses
with a very, very narrow line,

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:53.410
we derived that the limit of
Doppler cooling is Kt equals

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.390
gamma, and what
you are saying now,

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:57.740
if you use narrower
and narrower lines,

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.990
can we reach [? arbitrary ?]
low temperature?

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.140
This is not the case.

00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:09.340
In our derivation
of Doppler cooling,

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.740
we made a continuum
assumptions when

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:14.290
we plotted the force
versus velocity

00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:16.230
and we had the
friction force, we

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:19.580
assumed that an atom,
when it scatters a photon,

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.230
stays, let's say,
within the linear part

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:24.500
of the force versus velocity.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:28.580
So we had a hidden
assumption which

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:36.240
required that the recoil energy
is smaller than h-bar gamma.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.110
But there is a lot of literature
where people looked into it,

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:43.040
and it turns out that when
you have a very narrow line,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.860
you can go to the recoil
limit, but you can't go beyond.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:49.610
If you want to go-- and I
think this is what I showed you

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.570
in the last five
minutes-- if you want

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.990
to go below the
recoil limit, you

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:56.410
need some velocity-selective
dark state,

00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:00.620
and you would not have
that in this situation.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.490
On the other hand, if you
have a very narrow resonance,

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.993
you can probably
engineer a dark state

00:53:05.993 --> 00:53:09.830
that there is destructive
interference in some excitation

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.140
in a very, very
narrow velocity class,

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.050
and this narrow
velocity class is simply

00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:17.160
selected by the Doppler effect.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:25.420
So you can use the narrow line
to engineer sub-recoil cooling,

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.690
but the simple arrangement
of just having molasses

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.290
with narrower and narrower
line will not work.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.180
[? Collin ?]?

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.763
AUDIENCE: I think
the group that laser

00:53:32.763 --> 00:53:36.806
cooled to BEC just had-- their
dark state was just a Stock's

00:53:36.806 --> 00:53:40.587
shift, [INAUDIBLE] and that
was their-- and it shook.

00:53:40.587 --> 00:53:43.450
There were resonances in
kilohertz or something.

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:46.860
PROFESSOR: Thy used
a very-- did they

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:48.800
go below the recoil
limit in laser cooling?

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.630
I'm not sure.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.630
They may have had
a situation where

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:55.290
it was enough to go
to the recoil limit.

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.090
I have to check out
the paper, but--

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.922
AUDIENCE: I remember they did
have some sort of dark state.

00:53:59.922 --> 00:54:03.698
Maybe it was to increase
density or-- they had the high--

00:54:03.698 --> 00:54:07.180
PROFESSOR: Anyway,
let me just be clear.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.710
Sub-recoil cooling
requires that you

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:12.340
have a dark region
in velocity space.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.080
For that, you need some
narrow line widths.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.480
That's necessary.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.400
But I think you
just don't get it

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.390
by having counter-propagating
laser beams,

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.640
you have to do something more.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:24.605
Other question?

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:36.320
OK, so I've told you
about sub-Doppler cooling,

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.525
sub-recoil cooling, but what
really got atomic physicists

00:54:40.525 --> 00:54:43.900
to nanokelvin temperature
were two other techniques.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:47.620
Laser cooling was
used as pre-cooling,

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:50.070
but then the final
trapping and cooling

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.880
was done by magnetic trapping
and evaporative cooling.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.840
So I want to give you
now, in the last half

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.860
hour, a quick overview
of magnetic trapping

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.590
and evaporative cooling.

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:10.240
So I think any discussions
of magnetic trapping starts

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.400
with a theorem, a
theorem which tells you

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.980
that not everything is
possible you would like to do.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:22.420
And this is the following, then
if you have a region without

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:26.260
charges and currents without--
through an empty space,

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:30.930
and what this theorem
says-- in empty space,

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:35.780
you cannot have
a local minimum--

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.530
you cannot have a local maximum
of your electric and magnetic

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:39.330
fields.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.010
So if you take the strengths
of the electric field

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.950
or the strengths of
the magnetic field,

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:45.404
you cannot have a maximum.

00:55:45.404 --> 00:55:46.570
You can only have a minimum.

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.520
Well, and this is important
when it comes to magnetic traps.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:55.830
Depending on the magnetic
moment-- spin up,

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.620
spin down-- we could
create a trapping potential

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.480
around a maximum of
the magnetic field

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.560
or the trapping potential
around the minimum

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.890
of the magnetic field.

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.865
You want to be at the
minimum of the potential,

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.240
but if you have
a minus sign, you

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.020
may want to be at the
maximum of a magnetic field.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.790
But [? Bing's ?] theorem
says that only one of them

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:18.000
is possible.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.180
The proof really
goes in two lines.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.610
You really show, if you assume
that there is a maximum, that

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:31.590
would mean that if you add a
field to it, you add a field--

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.620
and no matter in which
direction you add a field--

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.425
the total field
strengths become smaller.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.515
But that requires a violation
of the Laplace equation.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.310
It's easier for you-- you can
probably read it at home--

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.370
but you simply assume
you have this situation,

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:56.280
so you add-- and you show you
have an incremental field,

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.360
delta E. This
field, delta E, you

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.710
are at the maximum
of an electric field,

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:04.440
and then delta E over R
is the small difference

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.930
of the electric field.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:12.140
And you can show that this
expression is only negative.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:18.750
That means you have a maximum
of the electric field when

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:24.060
the electric field would not
fulfill the Laplace equation.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.920
So the gist of the
argument is the following.

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.290
Each component of the
electric and magnetic field

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:31.140
fulfills the Laplace equation.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.060
And the Laplace equation-- I
don't know if you've probably

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.020
heard about it-- if something
fulfills the Laplace equation,

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.630
it says at any given
point the function which

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:44.190
fulfills the Laplace equation
is equal to the average

00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:49.190
of function, averaged over
a small sphere around it.

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:54.860
And that means-- if something
fulfills the Laplace equation--

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.440
you cannot have a local
maximum or a local minimum

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.810
because if the value
here equals the average,

00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:06.080
that would mean in one
direction the value gets higher,

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.800
in the other direction
the value gets lower.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.870
So if something fulfills
the Laplace equation,

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:15.150
you cannot have a local
maximum or local minimum.

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:19.060
But now, we're not asking
for maximum or minimum

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.380
in one component of the
electric or magnetic field.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.860
We ask for a maximum or
minimum in the total value,

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.540
or the square of
the electric field.

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.900
But then you show, when you
assume that you have a maximum,

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.290
the field points
along the Z direction,

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:39.640
that then the Z component
of the field cannot fulfill

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.480
the Laplace equation.

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.090
So maxima are not possible.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:48.640
Minima are possible.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:49.350
Good!

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:51.320
So the magnetic
trapping potential

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.530
comes because we have a
magnetic dipole moment which

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:57.620
interacts with a magnetic field.

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.220
Magnetic traps are
actually classical.

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.200
You can have a classical
model for a magnetic trap,

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.220
and in that case, you
say this potentially

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.760
is mu times B
times cosine theta.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.840
[? Crendo ?] mechanically, of
course, the angle cosine theta

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.580
is quantized and we have
the different M F levels,

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:17.950
the different
orientations of the spin,

00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:18.910
relative to the Z-axis.

00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:26.790
OK, the fact that the
magnetic field can only

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:32.070
have minima and not
maxima means that we

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:36.120
want to make sure that the
magnetic moment times the G

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.750
factor times M F is
negative, or cosine theta

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.960
is negative in the
classical picture.

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.930
And if we absorb whatever
we choose for cosine theta--

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:51.320
or what we call mu Bohr G
M F, the magnetic moment--

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.360
we want that the magnetic
moment of the particle

00:59:54.360 --> 01:00:00.490
is anti-parallel to
the magnetic field.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.750
Then we have a magnetic
trapping potential,

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:06.750
which is-- I've taken care
of the sin now-- mu times B,

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:10.250
and if B has a minimum this
potential has a minimum,

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.190
and that is a magnetic trap.

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.990
But so the consequence
of [? Bing's ?] theorem

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:20.430
is that we can
only trap particles

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:24.960
which are anti-parallel
with a magnetic field.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.840
And they can always
lower their energy

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.030
by flipping to the other state.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:34.150
So therefore, a
magnetic trap does not

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.966
allow us to trap particles
in the absolute ground state.

01:00:37.966 --> 01:00:41.810
There is always the possibility
of spin-flip collisions

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.730
which lead to an
anti-trap state which

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.470
is expelled from
the trapping region.

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.990
Now, spin-flip
collisions can happen

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.610
when you have particles at
sufficiently high density

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.560
and they collide.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.860
For the experts, there
can be spin relaxation,

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.620
there can be dipolar
relaxation, they

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.050
are two different kinds
of spin-flip collisions.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:11.180
Fortunately, in magnetic
traps, they only

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.980
become relevant when you
pick the wrong spin state.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.650
But for suitable
choices, magnetic traps

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:21.160
are very long-lived.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.120
Dipolar relaxation is often--
can be a limiting process

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.130
for Bose-Einstein
condensates, for instance,

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.200
for high [? dose ?]
Bose-Einstein condensation,

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.530
dipolar relaxation was-- limited
the number and density of atoms

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:37.410
in the Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.080
But I don't want to talk
about cold collisions, here.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.660
You should just know, based
on the fundamental theorem,

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.440
you cannot trap in
the ground state.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.410
You have to trap
into a state which

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:51.590
has more energy than other
states, and, in principle,

01:01:51.590 --> 01:02:00.860
it's possible to flip the
spin and go to a lower state.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.400
Now, what we have
assumed here is--

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.600
when I wrote the trapping
potential like this--

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.320
I assumed that the atom stays
in a given hyperfine state.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.050
So we put the atom in one state
and it experiences potential.

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:18.590
Classically it means that
the angle of the dipole,

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:22.160
with respect to the magnetic
field, stays constant.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:25.070
And this is the case
due to rapid precession.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:27.870
Classically, the
magnetic dipole precesses

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:29.870
around the magnetic
field, and when

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:32.530
the direction of the
magnetic field changes,

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.390
the rapid precession
keeps the dipole aligned.

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:40.320
Or, in other words, for slow
changes of the magnetic field

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:46.300
direction, cosine theta
is an adiabatic invariant.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.660
So the word adiabatic is
important, either classically

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.780
or you stay in a quantum state
as long as you're adiabatic.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:03:00.150
Well if an atom would
rapidly go through a region

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.870
of very weak magnetic
field, then the precession--

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.190
the [INAUDIBLE] precession--
of the atom is very slow,

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:10.210
and this adiabatic
condition can be violated.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:13.610
And this violation of an
adiabaticity condition

01:03:13.610 --> 01:03:16.840
is called Majorana flops.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.100
So if you operate
a magnetic trap

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:23.145
at very low magnetic field,
you may destabilized the trap

01:03:23.145 --> 01:03:24.520
because you violate
adiabaticity.

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.850
OK, so these are the
consequences of the fact that

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:34.260
we cannot create maxima,
we can only create minima

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.410
of the magnetic
field in free space,

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:40.690
and therefore we have to deal
with those two possible loss

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:46.380
processes, but we have learned
what kind of magnetic trap,

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.870
what kind of atom to pick, and
in general these are not big

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:52.370
problems.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:56.810
OK, so we have to--
so this shows here

01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:59.520
the typical hyperfine
structure of an alkali atom.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.450
It could be rubidium
87 or sodium 23.

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:07.740
The fact that we have
only a local minimum

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:15.090
of the magnetic field means
we can only trap hyperfine

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:19.010
states-- which I've marked here
in green-- where the slope is

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.760
positive, and these
are the atoms where

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.630
the magnetic moment
is inter-parallel

01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:26.800
with the magnetic field.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.920
And, well, for
stability reasons we

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.440
usually pick the highest
state of the lower manifold,

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.900
or the highest state
of the upper manifold.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.370
In principle, it would
be also possible to trap

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:41.670
here-- you have
the correct slope--

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.960
but often those
states suffer form

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.320
spin relaxation
and collision loss.

01:04:49.629 --> 01:04:50.170
[? Mickey ?]?

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:53.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
picture you showed before,

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.790
is it actually possible to
make a magnetic trap with state

01:04:57.790 --> 01:05:03.225
number four from the top so
that they expel from the center?

01:05:03.225 --> 01:05:05.660
From [INAUDIBLE] a--

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:08.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there
is a peculiarity here,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.220
you have the transition from the
weak field to the strong field

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:13.430
region.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:16.630
Whenever the magnetic
moment is constant,

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.960
you need a local minimum
of the magnetic field.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.750
But if the magnetic
moment would change

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.680
and you have a gradient
of the magnetic field,

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.630
you could actually trap here.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:35.060
So in this case, you have
a magnetic field gradient

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:39.240
but you have a spatial variation
of the magnetic moment.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.730
This has been discussed
in one special paper

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:43.690
in the literature,
but it has not really

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.862
found any [? lucent ?]
realization.

01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:48.222
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
help to put the Majorana

01:05:48.222 --> 01:05:49.638
flops in the center?

01:05:49.638 --> 01:05:51.580
Because they're repelled
from the center.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.290
PROFESSOR: Well,
yeah, but these atoms

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:55.910
would undergo
spin-flip collisions

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:59.090
so it's not a good choice.

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.920
It would help against
Majorana flops,

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.550
but we have many solutions
against Majorana flops.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:07.360
And here, you would solve
the Majorana flops problem

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.930
but you would solve it
with another problem.

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.660
OK, so we need minima
of the magnetic field.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:19.230
This provides magnetic
trapping potential,

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:24.680
and there are two kinds of
possible trap configuration.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:29.470
One is where the minima
is at zero magnetic field,

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:33.480
and one is where the minima
is at finite magnetic field.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.400
Now, the zero magnetic
field minimum one

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.850
can be simply created
with anti-Helmholtz coil.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:44.590
What happens is
the magnetic field,

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:49.210
as a function of position, would
actually cross through zero.

01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.620
It's just a field gradient
which crosses through zero,

01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.227
but, of course, since
we are interested

01:06:55.227 --> 01:06:57.060
in the absolute value
of the magnetic field,

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.420
we get the V-shape potential.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.020
This V-shape
potential was what was

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.620
used for the first demonstration
for Bose-Einstein condensation

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:10.650
because a V-shape potential
is much, much more

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:15.050
confining in this cusp than in
harmonic oscillator potential.

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:18.240
And this had advantages
for tight confinement

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.520
and rapid evaporative cooling.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.875
So those quadrupoled traps
with the V-shape potential

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:27.380
are the best
confinement you can get,

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.190
the best confinement
for the buck,

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:33.720
and the buck here is your
power supply and your coils.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.020
However, they have
a problem when

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.990
the magnetic field is zero.

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:42.050
We violate adiabaticity
because the different spin

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:44.210
configurations
become degenerate,

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:47.610
and in degenerates you
can't have adiabaticity.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.800
So therefore, the two
first demonstrations

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:53.620
of Bose-Einstein condensation
avoided this cusp

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.510
in two different ways.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:00.560
One way was to use a
rotating magnetic field,

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.410
and to use a perpendicular field
but which was time-dependent,

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:08.330
and the MIT solution was to
use a blue detuned laser beam,

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:11.870
use the optical dipole trap--
optical dipole potential--

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:16.050
to push the atoms away from
the dangerous [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.100
field region.

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:25.540
I should say rotating-- none
of those-- most traps which

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.080
are now used are the other
kind of trap, the trap which

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:34.649
has an harmonic oscillator
potential, which doesn't have

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:40.569
the cusp and where the minimum
is at a finite magnetic field.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:42.569
Let me just make one comment.

01:08:42.569 --> 01:08:44.500
The rotating trap
was very popular

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.859
because it led to the first BEC
and a lot of people built that,

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:49.770
but to the best of
my knowledge, it's

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:53.060
only used in different places.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.880
And the only real
application it has

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.340
is-- since you have some
rotating magnetic field--

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.790
by some modification
you can actually

01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:06.970
make of rotating potential.

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.859
And this is nice if
you want to study

01:09:08.859 --> 01:09:11.410
Bose-Einstein condensation
on a rotating frame,

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.800
create vortices and
things like that.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.790
But for simply creating a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:21.740
this trap is used, by
far, most frequently.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.540
But there is actually a
renaissance of this trap.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.149
One reason why
people use this trap

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.859
and why my own research
group immediately

01:09:29.859 --> 01:09:31.330
switched to this
trap-- and we had

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:34.260
the idea how to built it--
is, well, harmonic potential

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:34.760
is nice.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.029
Every physicist loves
an harmonic potential.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:39.490
You can solve,
immediately, thermodynamics

01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:40.880
in a harmonic potential.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.630
Who wants to deal
with that potential?

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:46.420
Also, if the laser beam
just drifts by a micrometer,

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.750
this symmetric potential
becomes asymmetric.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.970
So you characterize
your potential today

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:54.450
and a few hours later you
have a different potential.

01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:57.140
Whereas a magnetic potential,
harmonic potential,

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.880
once it's characterized--
as long as you don't change

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.480
the current in your
power supplies--

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.550
it's the same week after
week, months after months.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:08.430
Well, there is a renaissance
now because a lot of groups

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:10.520
now doing experiments
in optical lattices,

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.430
they don't care what shape the
potential is because they don't

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:16.210
do physics in this potential.

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:19.010
They just take the Bose-Einstein
condensate or the cooled Fermi

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.220
gases and transfer them
to an optical lattice.

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.960
So in that case, it
doesn't play any role,

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.940
and then the advantage
of this potential

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.147
is you get more
bang for the buck.

01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:35.636
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you were
saying before [INAUDIBLE] more

01:10:35.636 --> 01:10:38.640
rapid evaporation in V-shape
versus the [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.840
Where is the differences
in evap time?

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.390
PROFESSOR: It depends.

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:47.930
I may run out of time today.

01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:50.700
I needed-- I can
probably-- I wanted

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.300
to go through
evaporative cooling,

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.230
and I will talk to you that,
for evaporative cooling,

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.520
there could be a
threshold in confinement

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.680
where you go into
a runaway regime

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.250
that evaporative
cooling is speeding up.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:08.650
So a little bit of confinement
can make the difference

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.240
without never getting
into a runaway regime

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.940
or being in that runaway regime.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:14.900
So confinement,
extra confinement,

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.340
can make the difference
between getting BEC and not

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.230
getting a BEC.

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.220
So it really depends.

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.630
It's highly nonlinear,
but I will show you

01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:28.200
later on that when you
put a system together,

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.700
the kind of threshold density
at which the cloud can evaporate

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.745
to BEC is much lower
here than it is there.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.780
But-- and this is
the next thing I

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.540
want to explain--
it's not really

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.960
that this is a linear potential
and this is a [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:49.380
potential because those
finite magnetic field--

01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.540
these traps which have a minimum
at a finite magnetic field--

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.510
are usually done in
the following way.

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:59.940
Those traps are called
Ioffe-Pritchard trap.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.330
Ioffe actually suggested such
a magnetic field configuration

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:07.530
for confinement of
plasma, and Dave Pritchard

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:10.670
was the first to point out
that such a configuration would

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:13.460
be a good choice
for neutral atoms.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.730
So I sometimes joke and I
say, well, plasma physics

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:18.800
is the study of very hot matter.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.540
Cold atoms is the study
of very cold matter.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.520
But when matter is either too
hot or too cold that you cannot

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.440
put it in ordinary container,
you want it confined with

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.750
magnetic fields.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:32.030
And it happens that,
for plasma, you

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:35.690
need a minimum of the magnetic
field, and for neutral atoms

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.710
you need a minimum of
the magnetic field.

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:40.960
So therefore here is something
which ultra-cold atoms have

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.432
in common with plasma physics.

01:12:43.432 --> 01:12:45.890
I don't think there is a lot
the two fields have in common,

01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:49.450
but when it comes to magnetic
field configurations, yes.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:53.760
A similar magnetic
field configuration

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:59.230
can confine a plasma and
can confine neutral atoms.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:05.480
OK, so the generic way of
how these magnetic fields are

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:14.720
generated is you want to have
two coils, called pinch coils.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.230
You can say each of them creates
a magnetic field which decays,

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.570
a magnetic field which
decays, and now in the middle

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:23.370
you have the parabolic minimum.

01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:27.800
But then you have to add the
so-called four Ioffe bars which

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.520
create a linear potential,
and this is shown here.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.640
So the pinch coil is simply
creating a local minimum

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.270
along the Z-axis,
and if you only

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.780
want to trap in one
dimension, you would be done,

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.060
But you want to trap
in 3 dimensions.

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:43.532
And so what happens
is you add now

01:13:43.532 --> 01:13:47.940
an anti-Helmholtz-- or
quadrupold-- field in X and Y,

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:52.260
and this blue field is
done via the green bars,

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.650
by the Ioffe bars.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:58.150
So you add together a harmonic
quadratic field in the Z

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:03.000
direction with the linear
quadrupoled field in X and Y.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.530
And what matters
for the atoms is--

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.580
and what matters for
the Zeeman energy

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:11.060
is-- the absolute value
of the magnetic field.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:13.380
So you add those
things in quadrature,

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.430
and because you add
it in quadrature,

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:18.380
you have now an harmonic
oscillator potential

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:21.100
in X, Y, and Z, so
you have an harmonic

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:24.830
trap in three directions.

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:30.510
However, if this field
is not larger than this--

01:14:30.510 --> 01:14:33.350
if these field becomes
larger than this field,

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:35.250
so then when you add
it in quadrature,

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:38.150
you actually get a
linear potential.

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:40.950
So in other words, the
Ioffe-Pritchard trap

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.580
is quadratic for smaller
values of X and Y,

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.170
but if you go out
to large X and Y,

01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:49.330
you get the linear potential.

01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:51.980
So in the end-- and this
is maybe in response

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:56.080
to Matt's question--
for a high temperature,

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:58.160
the Ioffe-Pritchard
trap is actually not

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.880
harmonic in three dimensions.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.640
It's linear in
two dimensions and

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.960
harmonic in the third dimension.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.480
So, therefore the hit you
take in evaporative cooling

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:11.430
is not as large as
we'd initially assumed.

01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:14.500
And the moment we
realized that, we

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.750
were building a
Ioffe-Pritchard trap.

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.620
And this has been
the traps we' have

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.340
been using at MIT ever since.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.300
Well, just as a warning, this
is sort of the simplified

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.110
description, but if
you have curvature,

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:33.100
the curvature has to
fulfill Maxwell's equation.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.290
And you cannot have a
curvature only along Z.

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:38.710
Maxwell's equations
are three-dimensional,

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:41.500
so you get sort of all
sorts of curvature terms.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.640
If you really build
a magnetic trap,

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.160
you should understand those.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.895
If you just want to understand
why magnetic traps work,

01:15:47.895 --> 01:15:49.270
the previous slide
is sufficient.

01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:54.860
The different ways
to build those traps,

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:57.370
this is the design
we invented at MIT.

01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:59.410
It's called a clover-leaf trap.

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:05.800
So you have one
coil package here,

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.110
to another coil
package here, and what

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:11.360
you see is the pinch coils,
and when you have two of them

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.350
you create this
parabolic minimum.

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:19.170
We don't like Ioffe bars because
if you have a vacuum chamber

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:21.670
you either have to put the Ioffe
bars into the vector vacuum

01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:24.030
chamber or you drill holes
through your vacuum chamber

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:26.127
to put the Ioffe
bars back and forth.

01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:27.710
Don't laugh, some
people have done it.

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:29.459
Of course, they put
little tubes around it

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:31.520
so it was a very
highly-engineered vacuum

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:34.740
chamber where they could string
Ioffe bars through the chamber.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.880
But we realized that the
same field as Ioffe bars

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.600
can be generated by
taking the Ioffe bars

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.500
and flipping them out, and
after flipping them out,

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.590
they had the shape
of clover leaves.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:53.010
It's just a variant of creating
the same field geometry.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:57.670
Yes, that's all I want to tell
you about magnetic trapping.

01:16:57.670 --> 01:17:00.180
I think I should not start
with evaporative cooling.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.100
This will just take
10 or 15 minutes,

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:06.060
but I'll do that on Monday.

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.720
So since we're on
time, do you have

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:12.150
any questions about
magnetic trapping?

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.020
Different forms of
magnetic trapping?

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:22.200
OK.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.390
Final announcement, next
week is the due date

01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:26.195
for the term paper.

01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.320
Yes, and the term paper
is due on the date

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.160
of the last class,
which is Friday.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.820
Any questions about that?

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:42.310
OK.

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:43.860
Good.
