at ocw.mit.edu.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.640
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
start to discuss ion traps.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.190
Now, in many situations, ions
are just charged neutral atoms.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.300
And if the charge
doesn't matter,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.440
you can do very similar physics
with ions and neutral atoms.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.220
However, the charge
makes major differences

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.460
when it comes to confining
and manipulating particles.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.410
So when I compare
neutrals to ions,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.660
the forces which we
exert on neutral atoms

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:10.225
are magnetic forces,
optical forces.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.930
And typically, the
traps we can create

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.680
have a depth of about 1 kelvin.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.140
Actually, you just need
superconducting magnets.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.000
The magnetic traps we build here
at MIT have millikelvin depths.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.390
So the trap depth is
often on the order

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.610
of microkelvin, millikelvin,
and kelvin at the high scale.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.580
Well, this is very
different in ions.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.835
In ions, you have
the Coulomb force.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.080
If you take electric fields
of 100 volts per millimeter,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.595
you can create confinement
forces for 10,000 kelvin.

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:06.785
So you have no problem in
confining room temperature

00:02:06.785 --> 00:02:07.285
ions.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.880
When it comes to-- so this
is trapping and confinement.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.565
If you talk about cooling,
well, our workhorses

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.500
are Doppler cooling and
evaporative cooling.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.865
You can actually cool
ions by evaporation.

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:41.400
You can also cool ions
by evaporative cooling.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.930
But what has been very
common and special to ions

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.870
is the ability to resolve
sidebands, sidebands

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.090
of the vibration and motion in
the harmonic oscillator trap.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.030
And in problem
set number 10, you

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.090
have looked through the
physics of sideband cooling.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.790
However, sideband cooling
is now also coming back

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.050
to neutral atoms.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.350
For instance, if you have
neutral atoms in a very tightly

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.850
confining dipole trap,
you can resolve sidebands

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.520
and use those for cooling.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.695
OK, what is the science?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:33.520
Well, a driving force for
both ions and neutral atoms

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.020
has been clocks.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.490
If atoms are cold,
you can use them

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.630
to have very accurate
ways of keeping time.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.610
And I think currently,
there is a race

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.990
between the based neutral
atom atomic clocks,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.270
neutral [INAUDIBLE]
optical lattices,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.130
and ion traps in particular,
the aluminum ion at Boulder.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.930
So we have clocks.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.190
In ions-- and this is what I
want to talk a little bit more

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.620
about today-- a major driving
force was quantum information.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.140
You have two ions and get
quantum gates between them,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.579
or you have eight
ions and can have now

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.019
eight qubits in a
prototypical quantum computer.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.340
So quantum information
science and quantum algorithms

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.890
was quite important.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.210
But I would say
some of the physics

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.399
is at least discussed
and partially pursued

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.690
with atoms in optical lattices.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.610
We have talked a lot
about, for neutral atoms,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.320
quantum simulations,
studying super fluidity,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.500
studying phase transitions,
magnetic properties

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.110
of many body systems.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.920
But there are more efforts
to do that with ions.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.810
Chris Monroe's
group in Maryland is

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.700
studying antiferromagnetic
ordering of a spin chain.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.060
And the spin chain consists of
a string of ions in an ion trap.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.340
So see actually on
the science side

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.250
that all three-- clocks,
precision measurements, quantum

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.780
information, qubits, quantum
algorithms, and quantum

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.670
simulation of many
body systems--

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.810
are done with both
neutral atoms and ions.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.340
So these are now two
very different platforms.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.340
So I could spend a
long time teaching

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.650
about special aspects of ions.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.970
How do you do a trap?

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.845
How do you cool ions?

00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:41.090
How do you do quantum
state control?

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.480
Because this is
our last lecture,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.620
I decided to focus
on two aspects.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:56.510
One is, I want to talk about a
special way of trapping ions.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.620
Because there is one
difference for ions.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.960
Ions, until recently,
have not been

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.260
trapped in stationary traps.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.550
They've only been
trapped in dynamic traps.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.020
So you cannot trap ions by
simply putting an electric

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.660
potential around it.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.650
Because the divergence of
the electric field is 0.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.050
And that means there's
always one direction in space

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.830
where the ions are dragged out.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.530
You cannot have an inward
force from all directions.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.210
So therefore, when you want
to use electric fields,

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.760
you can only use dynamic traps.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.000
Well, for the
experts I should say,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.530
this does not apply for
the optical dipole trap.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.170
We know how we can create
trapping potentials

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.370
for neutral atoms using
the optical dipole trap.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.480
And very recently, a group
was able to trap ions

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.800
not with electric and magnetic
fields provided by electrodes

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.129
or radio frequency, but by
inner focused laser beams.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:13.420
So it's a very new development.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.860
But it uses exactly
the mechanism

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.870
which has been used
for neutral atoms.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.310
So when it comes
to dynamic traps,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.190
the standard two
traps which have

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.030
been used for ion trapping--
one is the Penning trap,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.870
which I do not want
to describe in detail.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.520
The Penning trap uses a
quadrupole configuration

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.910
of two positive charges.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.000
And then you have a ring
with negative charge.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.400
That means that an
ion is confined here

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:02.160
but would see anti-confinement
in the outward direction.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.090
Now, what you do with
the anti-confinement?

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:13.170
Well, the solution is that
you add a magnetic field.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.620
And what happens
now is the particle

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.230
is well-confined axially.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.480
But radially, when
it wants to move out,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.820
it's turned into
a cyclotron orbit,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.640
and therefore stays trapped.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.930
So this is the principal
of Penning traps

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.030
where the confinement
in the axial direction

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:43.840
is electrostatic, and
the confinement in x, y

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.390
is through cyclotron motion.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.830
OK, it's wonderful
physics to describe

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.210
the motion of ions in this trap.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.770
It's the combination
of an axial motion,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.630
cyclotron motion,
magnetron motion.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.390
It's very interesting physics.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.292
And for many years, Dave
Pritchard here at MIT

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:17.880
used such Penning traps to
measure the masses, determine

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.800
the masses, of ions with
the highest precision ever

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.100
possible.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.900
MIT still has the world
record of the most precise

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.940
mass measurements at the
10 to the minus 11 level.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.920
And this was done
in Penning traps.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:39.320
But I want to talk more today
about RF traps, or Paul traps,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.980
because the are used in the
majority of experiments.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:46.150
And they're used in pretty
much all experiments

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.700
on quantum information
processing with ions.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.870
So the neat thing--
and I try to teach you

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.120
concepts in physics-- the
interesting thing about Paul

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.880
traps or RF traps is that
you alternate at a radio

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.650
frequency between confinement
and anti-confinement.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.430
You can say you have a
settle point potential, which

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.320
is confining in x and
anti-confining in y.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.820
But then, you switch x and y.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.790
So therefore, the situation
is just imagine you're an ion,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.590
and you feel half of the time
a confining harmonic oscillator

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.070
and half of the time an
anti-confining harmonic

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.080
oscillator.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.530
The question I have for you,
and this is a general physics

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:41.610
question, well, is
the sum of a confining

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:47.005
and an anti-confining potential
of the same strength give 0,

00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:49.850
or does it give something
which in the end is confining?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.470
So if you were in a potential,
and the potential switches

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.860
permanently form parabolic
upward to parabolic

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:09.780
downward, at any given position,
the average force is 0.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.662
Because in one phase, you
have a force to the left.

00:11:12.662 --> 00:11:14.370
In the other case,
you have the opposite.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.155
You have the same
force but to the right

00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:19.270
with the opposite sign.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.570
But what's going on here?

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.302
Yes.

00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:26.176
AUDIENCE: So I can't answer
this mathematically or even

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:26.676
physically.

00:11:26.676 --> 00:11:29.568
But I just remember
this very cool example

00:11:29.568 --> 00:11:33.135
that someone showed me once
where they took a saddle shape

00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.570
in space, put a
ball in the middle,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.383
and then you spin the saddle.

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:39.466
And as soon as the ball
tries to fall to one side,

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:41.414
the saddle will spin
over and pick it up.

00:11:41.414 --> 00:11:43.414
So I know the answer has
to be, it is confining.

00:11:43.414 --> 00:11:44.970
But I can't explain why.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.420
PROFESSOR: OK, Colin?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.440
AUDIENCE: Could it possibly
be like a threshold?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.830
Because if you consider
spinning it sort of slowly,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.962
then the particle can
just sort of roll off.

00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:55.045
Maybe there's a threshold.

00:11:55.045 --> 00:11:56.628
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
there is a threshold.

00:11:56.628 --> 00:11:58.620
I mean, if there's a
confining potential

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.585
for a long, long
time, and then there's

00:12:00.585 --> 00:12:03.095
an anti-confining potential,
and I just fall down

00:12:03.095 --> 00:12:06.840
the anti-confining potential,
and I disappear to infinity,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.750
the confining part
doesn't help me.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.890
So there will definitely
be a threshold in time.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.420
We have to switch between
confining and anti-confining

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.480
sufficiently rapidly.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:16.980
Yes.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.646
AUDIENCE: Does it
have something to do

00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:21.980
with fictitious
force [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.890
PROFESSOR: No, but this would
have been a possibility.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.110
Maybe there is a formalism.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.890
But the standard formalism does
not use the rotating frame.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.390
Let me--

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.431
AUDIENCE: You could think
of the classical analog

00:12:32.431 --> 00:12:35.440
where you have a bead on a wire,
and you have a stable position

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.960
at sort of a finite angle
only at certain frequencies.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.720
PROFESSOR: Yes, I'm not sure.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.280
Anyway, you all-- I think
everybody here works

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.650
with optics or knows
what optics is.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.070
So why don't I
discuss the following.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.540
If you take a positive
lens and a negative lens

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:03.700
with equal strength, what
happens now to your laser beam?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.980
You send a laser
beam through, it

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:11.790
gets an inward bend by the
convex lens, an outward bend

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.260
by the concave lens.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.450
Is the net effect nothing,
or is it focusing?

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.950
Well, it depends.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.650
What happens is the following.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:38.110
If the lenses are put
in close proximity,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:44.680
the two bending actions on the
rays just completely cancel.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.470
But now we can do the following.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:55.040
We can put the two
lenses further apart.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.110
And now the following happens.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.890
We have a laser beam
which is bent inward.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.990
And you probably all know
the lens maker's equation,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.150
that the further
out the rays are,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.670
the more they have to be bent
inward to come to a focus.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.950
So what happens is those
beams are now bent inward.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.960
But when they reach
the other lens,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.290
they are now bent
outward somewhat.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.460
I'm not very accurate
in my drawing.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.750
But the angle by
which they're bent

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.700
inward is proportional
to the separation here.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.805
The angle by which
they're bent outward

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.660
is proportional to
the separation there.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.470
So the inward bend is stronger
than the outward bend.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.130
So therefore what
I'm telling you

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.760
is convex and concave,
with a certain distance

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.755
between the two,
results in focusing.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.780
Now maybe you can
think about it.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.565
What happens if I reverse
convex and concave?

00:14:56.901 --> 00:14:57.776
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.550
PROFESSOR: Is it
now still focusing,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.767
or is it the opposite
of the example above?

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:17.356
Now the first lens bends
the beam outward, yes?

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:20.920
And the second lens
bends it inward.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.930
But since we reach the
second lens further out,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:29.640
the invert kick is stronger
than the outward bend initially.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:34.330
So therefore, when you have
positive and negative lenses

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.950
of equal strength, no matter
in what order you apply it,

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.525
you always get an inward force.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.150
So this should
actually explain--

00:15:48.705 --> 00:15:51.556
AUDIENCE: As long as they're
within the focal length.

00:15:51.556 --> 00:15:53.730
Could you imagine if I
had positive and negative

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.941
that was larger than
the focal length away?

00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:58.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
everything within reason

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.550
here-- there will be
a stability diagram.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.090
But I want to first make it
very plausible what happens.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.710
And just to address the
question which I raised before,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.190
if I'm in a potential,
and I get an equal amount

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.650
of inward and outward force,
shouldn't that average to 0?

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.840
The question is how you average.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.600
If I would keep the distance
from the x as constant,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.050
I would say here as a function
of-- let me call it x.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:29.170
The bending angle as a
function of x is positive.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.730
The bending angle at
the same x is negative.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.800
So if I would do the average
at constant x, I would get 0.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.430
But what I do is I do
the average following

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.380
the trajectory of the beam.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.390
So in other words,
if I'm sitting

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.565
on this potential, which
switches from attractive

00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:53.350
to repulsive, if I would
be here at my position,

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.000
the average force is 0.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.240
But when the potential is
repulsive, in 1/2 cycle

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.710
I'm pushed outwards.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.829
And further out,
the attractive force

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.020
is now stronger
than it was before.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:13.160
And therefore, if you average
the force at my position,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.460
you will always find
an inward force.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.530
But if you average the
force at a fixed location,

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.450
it averages out to 0.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:29.230
So this is exactly
how RF ion traps work.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:44.790
And well, the rest are just
equations to describe that.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.690
So I think we have
to make a choice.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.920
I could derive for
you the equations, how

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.720
you average over the rapid
oscillations of the potential,

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.680
and you get a harmonic
oscillator potential,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.440
and this is how you trap ions.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.630
But it's pretty
much showing to you

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.210
how the concept I've
just explained to you

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.840
is reflected in equations.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.495
Or the second option we have
that takes about 20 minutes

00:18:09.495 --> 00:18:12.680
is to explain to you how
quantum computation is

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.290
done with two
ions, in particular

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.859
how the famous
Zoller-Cirac gate works.

00:18:19.859 --> 00:18:21.150
Do you have a clear preference?

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.102
AUDIENCE: Second one.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:30.880
PROFESSOR: OK, fine,
but there is one piece

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.250
of mathematics you
should understand.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.150
Really, and this
is the only essence

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:36.930
of the mathematical derivation.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.680
If I'm standing here, and I
feel the alternating force,

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.780
it's a cosine omega t,
and it averages to 0.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.020
But if the force drives
me, it shakes me.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.740
This is micromotion.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.875
Like the beam here, if you
go through many lasers,

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:54.080
the beam goes up and
down, up and down.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.320
This is micromotion.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.606
The micromotion is
at cosine omega t.

00:18:58.606 --> 00:19:01.850
And the net
attractive force comes

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.760
because the force which
oscillates at cosine omega t,

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.500
and I'm oscillating
at cosine omega t,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.930
then you get cosine
squared omega t.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.240
And this gives you
the net force which

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.750
provides the net
attractive force.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:22.620
And it's the cosine square term
averaged over the micromotion,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.920
which is one half, which is
responsible for the trapping

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.490
potential in ion traps.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.530
Anyway, you know the
physics very well.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.470
You understand where the math
comes form in that it's really

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.906
just the product of the two.

00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:36.780
It's a rectification.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.730
It's an alternating force.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.470
But since the system
itself, the particle itself,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.980
is driven at the micromotion,
there's rectification going on,

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.970
which leads to the
cosine squared term.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.500
[? Timor, ?] yes?

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.760
AUDIENCE: Two quick questions.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.343
So I think ion trappers always
complain about the micromotion.

00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:57.160
But in fact, they
need it for trapping

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.940
to work-- is pretty much
what's going on here, right?

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.351
PROFESSOR: Yes, actually,
the one interesting side

00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:09.270
of the mathematics is the
micromotion is kinetic energy.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.050
The harmonic
trapping potential is

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.910
nothing else than
the micromotion.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.360
In other words, if people
show in an ion trap

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.670
that you have a
harmonic oscillator,

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.600
the harmonic oscillator
potential is high here.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.950
But mathematically, this
harmonic oscillator potential

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.520
is the kinetic energy
of the micromotion.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.070
In other words, if you
look at the micromotion,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.630
it has a kinetic energy.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.090
The kinetic energy appears
as the potential energy

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:39.100
in this slow secular motion.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.000
So in other words, the
potential energy for the trap

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.860
is the kinetic energy
of the micromotion.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.820
So you can't avoid it.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.364
This is responsible for
the restoring force.

00:20:50.364 --> 00:20:52.155
AUDIENCE: Is it a really
conservative trap,

00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:55.717
or can I have an out
of phase component

00:20:55.717 --> 00:20:57.457
to the micromotion response?

00:20:57.457 --> 00:20:59.942
Is there like a sine
part to the response?

00:21:04.415 --> 00:21:07.880
PROFESSOR: Well, the secular
motion is conservative.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.720
You're now asking--

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.220
AUDIENCE: I'm trying to think
if there would be a reason why

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.134
my response, my
dipole response, would

00:21:14.134 --> 00:21:17.536
have a different [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:17.536 --> 00:21:19.480
Is there a reason?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:30.060
PROFESSOR: Well, to the
best of my knowledge,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.050
everything is
wonderfully conservative

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.210
if you have a
separation of timescale.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.290
If you want to sort
of get something

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.380
strange and non-conservative
out of the micromotion,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.625
you have to violate the
adiabatic separation

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:44.660
of timescales.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.280
There is a possibility that
if particles move quickly

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.040
through the
potential, they're not

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.580
following the micromotion
adiabatically.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.575
And then there is a
collision where micromotion

00:21:54.575 --> 00:21:56.270
is released as
collisional energy.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:03.055
But on the similar
particle level,

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.430
it's a pretty good
approximation.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:14.200
OK, we want to talk about
quantum computation with ions.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.080
[INAUDIBLE] has a
wonderful write-up

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.770
on the wiki on the basic
concept of quantum computation

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.070
and how it applies to ions.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.250
But let me immediately
jump to qubit operations.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:32.180
You've heard many, many
times that a general quantum

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.150
algorithm can be constructed
out of single qubit

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:40.420
rotations and two qubit gates.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.150
Single qubit rotations
are just oscillations

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.390
on the Bloch sphere.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.070
If you excite a particle, move
it around on the Bloch sphere,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.510
this is how you can rotate a
single qubit from ground state

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.220
to excited state, any
possible superposition state.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.750
So the physics of single
atoms, Rabi oscillation,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.440
rotation on the Bloch
sphere, this is all you

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.950
have to know about
single qubit operations.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.640
The interesting thing is how do
we create two qubit operations?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.710
And two qubit
operation would mean

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.920
you want to do something
to one ion here depending

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.040
what the state of
the other ion is.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.150
And this is much more subtle.

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.020
So what I want to
explain to you now

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:25.440
is the famous Cirac-Zoller
gate, which was really

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.350
a pioneering paper which has
thousands of citations now.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.490
Because it showed that
quantum computation

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.240
can be experimentally realized
in a rather straightforward

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.740
way.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:49.340
So it's a fundamental theorem of
quantum information processing

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.155
that if you have single
qubit operations, and one

00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:56.400
to qubit gate, which is
a CNOT gate, that this

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.310
is a universal set
of quantum gates,

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.220
any arbitrary quantum algorithm
can be constructed out

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.410
of those gate operations.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.780
So let me just remind you
what the CNOT gate is.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.580
We have qubits ion one, ion two.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.870
They can be in 0 or 1.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.460
These can be two different
hyperfine states.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.920
Or in the case of the calcium
ion, it can be the ground state

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.670
or metastable excited state--
just two different states

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.610
of ion one, two different
states of ion two.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.580
The CNOT gate would
now say the following.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.060
The first ion is
the control bit.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.850
And whenever the
control bit is 1,

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.820
it flips the qubit,
the second qubit.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:48.580
If the control bit is 0, it
does nothing to the second ion.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:55.750
So therefore, the table
which shows how the quantum

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.530
states perform is
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:04.180
It just shows that
I'm writing down

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.520
the matrix in these spaces.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.350
It's a truth table 0,
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.290
And it shows that when you
have 1, 1 at the input,

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.460
you get 1, 0 at the output.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.070
If you have 1, 0 at the input,
you get 1, 1 at the output.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:26.780
Well, the two qubit
gate I want to discuss,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:32.690
which can be realized in
the simplest possible way

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:38.330
with the Cirac-Zoller algorithm,
is the controlled phase qubit,

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.730
which has a truth table
of 1, 1, 1, minus 1.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:50.920
And it means it simply
changes the face of the two

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.710
qubit states when
both qubits are 1.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:04.910
Now, the CNOT gate
can be constructed out

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:11.900
of the controlled phase gate
by having two single qubit

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.820
rotations done with
the Hadamard gate.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.650
The Hadamard gate is taking
the bases 1 and 2 and creates 1

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.860
plus 2, 1 minus 2, the
symmetric and anti-symmetric

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.460
superposition state.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.890
So therefore, the CPHASE gate
is S general as the CNOT gate.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.110
Because one can be used
to construct the other.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:45.690
So how do we create
the Cirac-Zoller gate?

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.750
So how do we get now
the controlled phase

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.670
gate out of trapped ions?

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.920
So the effect is the following.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:59.880
Remember, if we
have two ions, we

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.050
want to change the phase
to minus 1 of the state

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:10.200
only if the two
ions are qubit up.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.130
So in other words, we want to do
180 degree rotation of the wave

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.000
function, but only
if both ions are up.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.880
And the question is,
how do we do that?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.340
How does one ion feel what
the other ion is doing?

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.750
And let me explain that now.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.970
The critical element in
the Cirac-Zoller case

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.890
is a center of mass motion.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:39.370
We want at some point-- say
when this ion is spin up,

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.930
we swap the quantum
information from the ion

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.740
to the center of mass motion.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.200
In other words, when this ion
is up, we use laser pulses.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.660
I will explain that to you.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.270
Then all the ions
are moving together.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.630
And then, this ion,
because they're all moving,

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.970
knows that this ion
was spin up before.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:06.470
So the center of mass motion,
the common dipole oscillation

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:11.550
of all ions together in the
trap, this is the data bus.

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.900
So this is the key idea.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:22.280
But in order to explain it to
you, I have to go in two steps.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.540
So let's just take that as
a genetic level structure.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.590
We have an S state.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.690
And it has two different
hyperfine states,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.940
spin up and spin down.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.450
And these are our two qubits.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.690
There may be a P state, which
we have used for laser cooling.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.910
But everything is in the
ground state of motion

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.970
using sideband
cooling, which you've

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.030
studied in your homework.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.380
And what I want
to show you first

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.250
is how we can
create a phase gate.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.730
But I'm only
focusing on ion one.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.530
So hold the thought.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:57.710
Ion two will come in a few
moments, will come back.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.490
So what we can do
is the following.

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.240
Each qubit state has vibrational
structure-- ground state,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.240
excited state without
center of mass motion.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.180
But then, as a function of
vibrational quantum number

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.625
for the center of
mass motion, we

00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:15.810
have g1, g2, e1, e2, and such.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:20.040
And what we can now
do is, let's assume

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.660
we have another state,
a D state, which

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.760
is an auxiliary state here.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.040
Fortunately, ions and
atoms have many states.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:35.980
And we can drive a
laser transition from S

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.880
to D, which is only in resonance
with the first vibrational

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.600
excited state to the D state.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.690
So we use a [INAUDIBLE]
sideband here,

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.940
which only drives the
transition from e1

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:57.630
to the non-vibrational state
of the auxiliary state.

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:02.380
And that means automatically
that this laser does nothing

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.090
to e0, does nothing to
g0, does nothing to g1.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:11.730
So if you have this Hilbert
space of g0, g1, e0, e1,

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.580
the only transition
which is effected here,

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.034
or the only state which is
effected here, is the e1 state.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.240
OK, I'm talking
about a single ion.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.615
I'm just talking about talking
to a single ion right now.

00:30:23.615 --> 00:30:24.540
It's really simple.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.690
So if we switch on this
laser, what happens

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:33.980
is we simply induce Rabi
oscillations-- simple physics.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:40.240
The Rabi oscillation,
however, after one Rabi period

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.230
has changed the phase of the
initial state by minus 1.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.880
If you carefully look what
Rabi oscillations are,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.560
the wave function goes
up, down, up, down.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.920
But we usually discuss what
happens to the probability.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.880
And this is shown in green.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:00.070
So when we are back
in the original state,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:04.500
we have changed the phase of
the wave function by minus 1.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.410
So let's just assume that
we switch on this laser

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:14.211
to this auxiliary state,
and we have a-- well,

00:31:14.211 --> 00:31:17.390
it's a 2 pi pulse in population.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.290
But it makes a phase shift
of pi to the wave function,

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.990
which is minus 1.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.920
So what we have
accomplished now is

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.520
a phase gate not
between two ions.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.350
But we have a phase gate
which, in this Hilbert space,

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:39.850
between the qubit
up, qubit down--

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.590
I call it ground
and excited state.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.890
But the other
qubit, so to speak,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.600
is the center of mass
motion 0, 1, 0, 1.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.790
So this is the truth
table of the phase gate.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:32:02.490
And so technically, we have
now done a local phase gate

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.540
with one ion where
the two qubits are

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.740
ground and excited
state of the ion.

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.740
This is our qubit we
want to work with.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.200
But then, the second qubit
to realize the phase gate

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.065
was 0, 1 of the center
of mass vibration.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.470
But once we have
realized that, we

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:31.040
can now immediately
take this idea

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.470
and get a phase gate
between two ions.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:41.540
Because the center of mass
vibration is everywhere.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.165
So therefore, what we can
do is this was ion one.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.490
We can now-- and this
is the missing step

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:54.890
I want to show
you-- go to ion two.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:00.590
And we can swap the qubit
information-- ground, excited,

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.860
spin up, spin down.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.680
We can swap that with the
center of mass motion.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.600
So therefore, what we can do is,
when the second ion is spin up,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.940
we do a swapping
of the information

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.790
from spin up, spin down
to center of mass motion

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.930
being 0 or 1.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.340
So the idea is the following.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.890
Ion two should control
what ion one is doing.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.950
So we first focus on ion two.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:33.660
We swap the qubit of ion two
into the center of mass motion.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.210
Then, we do what I just
said, the controlled phase

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.910
gate for ion one with the
center of mass motion.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:48.230
And after this is done, we write
the center of mass motion back

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.480
into ion two.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.090
And then we have
nothing to ion two.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.070
Ion two was just
putting its information

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:54.700
into the center of mass motion.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.140
It helped ion one to do
the controlled phase gate.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.320
And then, we swapped
the information back.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.030
So this is the sequence.

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.530
After preparing the center of
mass, the first of two lasers

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:12.040
cool everything in the center
of mass motion into the 0 state.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.850
Then we swap from ion
two the information

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:19.360
to this phonon state
center of mass vibration.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.375
Then we do the controlled
phase gate on ion one.

00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:26.000
And then, we swap
the information back.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.020
So what I should show
you-- you may have seen it.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.150
But what I should
show you explicitly--

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.710
how do we swap
the information ge

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.290
from the internal
state of ion two?

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.159
How do we write this information
into the data bus, which

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.750
is the phonon,
which is the center

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.719
of mass vibration in the trap?

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.500
Well, we again use
[INAUDIBLE] side pulse.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.100
We do a pi pulse
driving this transition.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.575
And just look how beautifully
the math works out.

00:35:03.575 --> 00:35:05.910
We have an arbitrary
qubit state,

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.940
a superposition of
ground and excited.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.630
And the center of
mass motion was

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.730
laser cooled to
the ground state.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.900
So let me just
multiply that out.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:23.470
So we have coefficient a times
g0 plus coefficient b times e0.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:30.530
If we now do a pi pulse, we
transfer the population from e0

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.790
into g1.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.180
And this is what I've done here.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:38.256
But now you see I
can factor out the g.

00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:42.460
And what I have now is I have
the same qubit information

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.700
with coefficients e and b, but
no longer in the internal state

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.960
of the ion but in
the phonon state

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.130
in the qubit, which is
the center of mass motion.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.950
So the idea here is you can have
an arbitrary number of ions.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:01.250
And now you want to
have a quantum gate.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.970
What you do with a
quantum gate, you say,

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.800
I want to now take this
ion here and have a quantum

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.530
gate with 10 ions further down.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.840
So you first go
to your first ion,

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.580
transfer the information of
this qubit into the data bus,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.470
into the center of mass motion.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.630
And now with a local
operation here,

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:28.890
you can do something to this
ion conditionally on the motion,

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.320
the center of mass motion.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.890
But the center of mass
motion reflects the ion

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.770
over there, in
which state it was.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.660
And after you have
done the two qubit

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.210
operation between
those two ions,

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.220
you take the center
of mass motion,

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.120
put it back into this ion.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.230
And at the end of the
day what you have done

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.460
is you have done a
two qubit operation.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.580
You've changed the
state of this ion.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.840
But all the other ions
have remained the same.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.840
And with that, you can
now, in a chain of ion,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.295
implement arbitrary
two qubit operations.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.150
I think I said it
clearer in words here.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.190
It is in a little
bit more formal way

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.740
the steps you will do
to the wave function.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.950
You initialize.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.430
Your transfer the
information to the data bus,

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.940
you execute the
controlled phase gate,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.380
and you put the information
from the data bus

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.470
back into the control ion.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.660
And now your data bus
is free, is back again

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.870
to the initial value and
ready for the next operation.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.595
I should mention that
this was pioneering paper.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.700
Right now, this quantum gate
is not the most popular one.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.620
Because it has
severe requirements.

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:47.250
One is you really have to cool
to the absolute ground state.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.860
The center of mass
motion has to be

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.930
cooled to the
absolute ground state.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.920
There are other
quantum gates which

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.120
do not require such
extreme cooling.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.020
And secondly, the center of mass
motion, because all particles

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:05.620
move together, is one of the
slowest vibrational motions

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.870
in the system.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.880
And if you want to
scale up the system

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.090
to more and more particles,
the speed of the gate operation

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.750
has to be slower than
the vibrational period

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.850
of the center of mass motion.

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.340
So these are two disadvantages.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:27.740
But there are different
gates, like geometric gates,

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.560
like Sorensen gates.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.620
There are other possibilities
to involve the same quantum

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.820
logic with ions.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.860
But the one of
Cirac-Zoller really

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.830
stands out by it's pedagogy.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.980
It's really a
wonderful way to see

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.080
how we take the information,
put it in a data bus,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.840
do the controlled
phase operation,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.030
and then proceed to the
next two qubit gate.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:39:01.055
OK, so that's the end of
ions, the end of this class.

00:39:01.055 --> 00:39:05.740
Do you have any questions
about the last topic?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.840
If not, let me say thanks.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.780
You were a fabulous class.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.990
I really enjoyed the
classroom atmosphere.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.410
I enjoyed all the
questions, whether it

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.280
was after class or during class.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.150
And, well, I'm happy
that most of you

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:25.720
I will see around for
a number of years.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.290
All right.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.940
[APPLAUSE]
