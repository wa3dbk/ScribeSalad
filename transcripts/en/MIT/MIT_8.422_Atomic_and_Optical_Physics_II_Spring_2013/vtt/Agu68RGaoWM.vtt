00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.650
PROFESSOR: So this first lecture
is a spirited but lighthearted

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.860
introduction into the course.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.320
I usually never talk about
technicalities first.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.520
I want to talk about the
excitement of the field first.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.420
So I will talk about
technicalities a little bit

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.460
later.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.190
So when you take a
course in AMO physics,

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.450
the obvious question
is, what is AMO physics?

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.870
What defines our field?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.800
Actually, by far
the best definition

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.650
of what AMO physics is-- it
is what AMO physicists do,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.420
which is defined by a
community of AMO researchers.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.460
And this is really
characteristic for our field.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.660
I will tell you in
the next 10 minutes

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.150
or so about these enormous
dynamics of the field, how

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.500
AMO physics has changed in
a fraction of my lifetime.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.174
And what happened is, I
felt, whatever I was doing--

00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:35.090
and it turned out to be
very different of what

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.460
I did 10 and 15 and
20 years ago-- has

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.880
stayed in the center
of AMO physics.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.990
So myself and the
whole community,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.040
we're moving, and
took the field along.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.740
So therefore AMO physics is what
gets AMO researchers excited.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.460
It's not a joke.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.240
It's the way it
sort of happened.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.610
Well, a little bit
more mechanically,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060
we can define AMO physics.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.360
AMO physics is what is
made out of the building

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.700
blocks we have in AMO physics.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.930
So defined by the
building blocks.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:16.070
And in AMO physics,
we build systems

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.020
out of atoms, or molecules,
and then photons,

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.460
or light, and in general,
electromagnetic fields--

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.070
electric, magnetic fields,
microwaves and all this.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.420
So in other words, everything
which is interesting

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.990
and we can put together
with those building blocks,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.830
this is AMO physics now.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.210
And this may redefine AMO
physics in the future.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.740
Now, historically this meant
that those building blocks,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.830
atoms and molecules, were
available in the gas phase.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.550
So you had gases of
atoms, gases of molecules,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.730
and you studied them.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.720
And almost all of AMO
physics was actually

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.780
about individual particles,
individual atoms,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.500
individual molecules,
because in the gas phase

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.755
at high temperature,
pretty much,

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:25.840
you learned that in
statistical mechanics

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.040
each particle is by itself.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.750
And the partition function
of the whole system

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.940
is just factorized into
partition functions

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.860
of the individual particles.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.780
Well, maybe with some
exception-- occasionally,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.190
particles collide.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.950
And the field of
collisions-- collisions

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.520
between atoms and atoms,
atoms and ions, atoms

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.630
and molecules, molecules
and photons-- this

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.900
was widely started
in AMO physics.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.346
Well, now the field
has really moved away

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:02.714
from just individual
particles and collisions

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:03.630
between two particles.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.970
What is in the center of
attention is few body physics.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.130
And that of course takes
us to entanglement.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.000
For instance, people
study entanglement

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.430
of eight ions in ion traps.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.210
And of course this
is deeply related

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.555
to quantum information science.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.450
Or if you want to go from
few body to many body,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.230
this is now starting to overlap
with condensed matter physics.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.650
And this is now widely studied
in the field of [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.535
atoms and quantum gases.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:05.310
Now, when we talk about
many body physics,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.235
we get, of course, into overlap
with condensed matter physics.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.010
In condensed, I would
actually say now

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.750
a larger fraction of AMO physics
and condensed matter physics

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.140
overlap strongly, that we
speak the same language,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.900
we study the same Hamiltonian,
a lot of theorists

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.760
apply the same methods to
topics coming from either field.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.530
However, often in technology,
how the systems are studied,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.090
there's a different culture,
different tradition,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.040
and still two
different communities.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.410
And the overlap comes
about because there

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.350
are systems in
nature which you can

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:01.050
say-- they are natural
two or few level systems.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.260
Of course, we've helped nature
a little bit by engineering.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:15.200
Those systems are, for instance,
quantum dots or NV centers

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.810
in diamond.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.750
Or another overlap with
condensed matter physics

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.030
is that AMO physics is now--
one frontier of AMO physics

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.815
is the optical control of
mechanical oscillators.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.190
Micro cantilevers, membranes,
tiny mirrors in cavities,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.610
they have mechanical motion.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.670
And the mechanical
motion is strongly

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.271
coupled to the photon field.

00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:58.460
Of course, for fundamental
AMO physicists,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.359
a mechanical oscillator
is nothing else

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:02.525
than an harmonic oscillator.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.760
So one can say-- and this
is sort of my third attempt

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.780
in defining for you
what AMO physics is--

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:28.205
AMO physics is almost defining
itself by low energy quantum

00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:30.440
physics.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.340
So all of the quantum mechanics
which doesn't take place

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.550
at giga and tera electron
volt, which takes place

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.656
at low energy, this
is AMO physics.

00:07:39.656 --> 00:07:42.410
Of course, maybe not all of it.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.320
Usually when it is in
[INAUDIBLE] solution,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.930
it's biophysics,
and it's distinctly

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.550
different from AMO physics.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.730
Or if the solid
state is involved,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.830
then it's more condensed
matter physics.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.850
But I would say there is one
part of solid state physics

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.800
which is already becoming
interdisciplinary

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.260
with AMO physics.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:06.390
And this is when the
control of the system

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.470
is not done by wires
and carbon probes

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.470
but it is done by lasers.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.780
So if you have a
solid state system

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.500
and you use all of the
methods you apply to atoms,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.340
you use
electromagnetically-induced

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.930
transparency, coherence,
all those concepts,

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.410
then AMO physicists
feel at home and they

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.740
don't care if the two level
system or the harmonic

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.760
oscillator is an ion
oscillating in an ion trap

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.419
or whether it's a
small cantilever,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.010
the methods and
concepts are the same.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.110
So therefore, one
could say AMO physics

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.580
is sort of the playground
where we can work on extensions

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.940
of simple systems which
we understand and cherish.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.390
And of course, our
exactly solvable problems

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:59.847
are the hydrogen atom--
my colleague, Dan Kepner,

00:08:59.847 --> 00:09:01.555
would have said, maybe
the hydrogen atom,

00:09:01.555 --> 00:09:03.055
if you understand
the hydrogen atom,

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:05.540
you understand all
of atomic physics.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.950
I'm not so sure.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.240
I would actually say, in
addition to the hydrogen atom,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.990
you have to know the
two-level system.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.370
And of course, you have
to understand the harmonic

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.340
oscillator.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:19.340
So these are three
paradigmatic Hamiltonians,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:25.870
and a lot of understanding of
much more complicated systems

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:30.980
really comes from taking the
best features of those three

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.220
systems and combining them.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.440
If you have questions
or comments,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.770
this is an interactive class.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.850
Feel free to speak
out or interrupt me.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.650
OK so, now we know, or we don't
know, what AMO physics is.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:57.255
Let me now address-- how
has AMO physics developed?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.720
And I mentioned to
you that AMO physics

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:14.590
has done breathtaking
evolution in my lifetime,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.000
or even in the shorter
part of my life,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.060
which is my research career.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:27.450
Well, traditionally, almost
all fields in science

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.780
started with observing nature.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.740
The pursuit of science was
born out of human curiosity

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.350
to understand the
world around us.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.090
And atomic
physicists, well, they

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:48.330
started to observe atoms and
molecules, usually in the gas

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.390
phase, and what they were doing.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:58.520
And already there
was some evolution,

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.780
because original observations
at low resolution

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.740
were taken to a
completely new level when

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.360
high-resolution methods were
developed, when lasers came

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.480
along, when people had light
sources which had fantastic

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:20.500
resolution and eventually
finer and finer details

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.100
of the structure of atoms and
interactions between atoms

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.980
were resolved.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.780
But AMO physics is
a field which has

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.640
taken the pursuit of
science much further.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.110
So there is not just
observation of nature--

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.930
and I want to write that
with capital letters--

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.475
there is CONTROL OF NATURE.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.500
And you maybe take
it for granted,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.200
but you should
really appreciate it,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.850
that controlling nature, having
control over what you study,

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.130
modify it, advance it,
take it to the next level,

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.650
is really something wonderful.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.190
It is completely absent
in certain fields,

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.180
like astrophysics.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.880
In astrophysics, all you
can do is, you can observe.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.700
In atomic physics, we create
the objects we can observe.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:20.200
So the control of nature, the
control of our atomic physics

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.750
system, developed in stages.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.980
The first kind of control was
exerted about internal states.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.810
If you have an atom
at thermal energies,

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.380
it would only come in
hyperfine states which

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.390
are thermally
populated, or molecules

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.640
come in rotation states, and
well your limited control

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.390
was simply to raise and
lower the temperature.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.520
But with the advent of optical
pumping-- this actually

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.010
happened already with
classical light sources

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.440
before the invention
of the laser-- so

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.790
with optical pumping, you can
pump the internal population

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.690
of molecules into, let's say,
a single rotational state.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.210
So this is control over
the internal Hilbert space.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:16.360
And this was actually
rewarded with a Nobel Prize

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.630
to Alfred Kastler in 1966.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.390
Of course, the next
step after controlling

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.950
the internal degrees
of freedom is

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.600
have control over the
external degrees of freedom,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.415
and this means control motion.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.800
This was of course
pursued by understanding

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.250
the mechanical aspect of light.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:48.120
How do photons mechanically
interact with atoms?

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.740
This eventually led
to laser cooling

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.270
and Bose-Einstein condensation.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:14:02.230
And those developments were
recognized with major prizes.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.730
Well there is more to
it than controlling

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.150
internal and external
degrees of freedom.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.560
You can then also say,
well, how much can we

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.890
control the number
of building blocks?

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.490
And eventually AMO
physics advanced

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.180
to exert control
onto single quantum

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:31.740
systems-- single
photons, single atoms.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.070
A single atom in a cavity
exchanging a photon

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.980
with a cavity
thousands of times.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.510
So this control of
single quantum systems

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.280
was actually just recognized
with a Nobel Prize

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.020
a few months ago.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.590
Well, at this point I
sometimes make the joke,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:03.130
we have gone from big ensembles
in many, many quantum states

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:09.040
to single photons, single atoms,
in a single quantum state--

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.810
a single quantum state
for many particles

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.250
is Bose-Einstein condensation.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.770
So we have really gone down to
single atoms, single photons,

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.550
single quantum states.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.260
Well, what comes next?

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:27.090
To have no atoms and
no light in vacuum.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.180
Well, the vacuum has some
very interesting properties.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.520
And if you talk
to Frank Wilczek,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.210
the nature of the
vacuum and dark energy

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.180
is one of the big mysteries
in physics and in science

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.080
in general.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.550
But the study of
that is definitely

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.850
outside the scope
of AMO physics.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.370
So what happens is, when we
have gone down and have now

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.370
control over the
building blocks,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.840
now we can sort of go up
again in a controlled way,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.130
create complexity by
assembling a few photons,

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:07.080
a few atoms into new
entangled states,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.670
so we can now take our system
into very different regions

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.790
of Hilbert space.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.930
So what is defining
now the control is,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.180
we want to use this pristine
control over the building

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.500
blocks to now put in something
which hasn't existed naturally

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.520
before, or when it existed
it was completely obscured,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:39.296
completely hidden by
thermal motion or by you

00:16:39.296 --> 00:16:43.110
can say homogenous broadening
our lack of control.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.080
And the best
buzzwords are here now

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.330
entanglement and
many-body physics.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:59.176
It's hard to capture that as in
a diagram, but let me try that.

00:16:59.176 --> 00:17:00.800
I don't know actually
what I'm drawing,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.050
but I think you get
the message that this

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.579
is sort of Hilbert space.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.040
And I have 2 x's.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.569
One is sort of entropy,
high temperature,

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.869
and the other one is complexity.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:25.060
And for quite awhile,
people studied hot gases.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.569
So these are gases, there's
a lot of entropy in it.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:32.480
The complexity is actually
not particularly high.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.470
And everything is described
by a statistical operator--

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.285
the density matrix.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:46.710
The pursuit of
cooling, and actually,

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.680
control-- gaining
information about a system

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.910
is also a way of cooling.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.140
If you know in which
state the atom is,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.110
the entropy of
the system is zero

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.670
even if you haven't changed
the state of the atom.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:06.650
So control and cooling, control
measurement and cooling,

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.730
has now taken us
to the point where

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.190
we have systems which
have no entropy anymore.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.690
They are very,
very well defined.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:21.390
And our goal now is
to take these systems

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.440
to much more complexity where
wave functions become entangled

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.270
and we have strong correlations
in many-body systems.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.880
But this is now,
maybe here, this

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.650
is now described
by wave functions.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.290
But here is the wave function
of a single particle,

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:48.459
and here we have highly
correlated, highly entangled

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:49.500
many-body wave functions.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.120
So at least for me--
but all predictions

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.440
are notoriously
incorrect when you

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.560
look at them in a
few years from now--

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.360
but for me, this is where
the future of our field

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.570
is moving, to get into
interesting regions of Hilbert

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.655
space where no person
has been before.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.880
As an experimentalist, and with
a lot of experimental graduate

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.540
students in this room,
I want to emphasize

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.650
that a lot of those rapid
developments of the field

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.925
are driven by technology.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.235
So it's driven by
technology advances.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.900
In the '50s and
early '60s, people

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.380
thought AMO physics
is pretty much dead.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.040
Only a few people with gray hair
continue what they have done

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.850
and the field will
eventually die.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:10.750
But then technological
developments

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.370
made it possible to do
major conceptual advances.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.910
I've mentioned the conceptual
advances-- let me now

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:21.550
say a few words about the
technology which has driven it.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:26.200
There was one phase of
developing lasers which

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.310
I experienced when
I was a student.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.630
But those lasers were fantastic.

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.720
They were very narrow
already, very stable,

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.260
but they were very expensive
and very complicated.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.850
So if you had one laser,
this defined your laboratory

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.420
and then you studied
a lot of things

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.800
with the single laser
you could afford.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.740
Well, you're probably
not used to one big dye

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.540
laser pumped with a
big argon ion laser.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.230
It was a $250,000
investment for the lab.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.000
And of course, you couldn't
afford a second laser.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.270
It required 50 kilowatts
pf electrical power.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.620
And all this power
had to be cooled away

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.620
by gushing water
through thick pipes.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.720
So it was an
expensive undertaking

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.680
but you could really do
wonderful science with it.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.010
So what I've seen
in the last 20 years

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.670
is the proliferation
of solid state lasers,

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.930
starting with diode
lasers and continuing

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.140
until the present year.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.530
So now, in a lot of our
laboratories here at MIT,

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.350
we have 10 lasers.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.990
And we've stopped counting
them, because adding a laser

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.340
to the system is
almost like adding

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:48.130
an amplifier to a circuit
or adding another circuit

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.510
to a data acquisition system.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.360
But it's not just the
simplicity of the lasers

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.080
which we have now,
the robustness--

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.770
to have 10 lasers in
the lab, it's fine.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.990
Previously, if you had
three lasers in the lab,

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:06.240
you spent 90% of your time just
keeping the lasers running.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.190
Those lasers, not so much
continuous-wave lasers,

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.840
but pulse lasers have also
very, very different properties.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:24.520
Laser pulses got very,
very short-- femtosecond

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.280
or even attosecond.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.720
Shorter pulses means
that the energy is now

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.570
focused to a much
shorter temporal window.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.360
Therefore, laser pulses of
very, very high intensity--

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.250
if you focus a short pulse
laser on an atomic system,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.600
you can easily reach
an electric field

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.985
of the laser which is stronger
than the electric field

00:22:51.985 --> 00:22:53.240
of the atom.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.490
So in other words, if you have
protons and electrons-- well,

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.290
maybe the outer electrons, not
get down to the single protons.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.200
But maybe an ionic core,
and you've electrons.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.590
Now, you should first look at
the motion of free electrons

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.981
in the strong field of the laser
and add the atomic structure

00:23:09.981 --> 00:23:10.730
as a perturbation.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:17.520
It really takes the hierarchy
of effects upside down.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.960
So the appearance of
high intensity lasers

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.560
has given rise to a whole
new field of atomic physics.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.190
Lasers got more precise.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.660
The invention of
the frequency combs,

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.700
recognized by the
Nobel Prize in 2005,

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:48.070
meant now that we can
control laser frequencies

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:51.700
at a level of 10
to the minus 17.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:59.880
And this has completely
redefined precision metrology

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.974
and has advanced the control
over atoms and molecules

00:24:05.974 --> 00:24:06.890
I've mentioned before.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.220
Finally, another
technical development

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:19.260
which plays a major role in
research being pursued here

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.530
at MIT and elsewhere
are the development

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.440
of high finesse cavities.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.005
High finesse cavities
in the microwave range--

00:24:28.005 --> 00:24:30.240
then they're
superconducting-- or high

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.670
finesse optical cavities
by having super mirrors.

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:37.910
It is actually
those super cavities

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:43.910
which have enabled the study
of single photon physics.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:47.080
Because after all, photons move
away with the speed of light.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.110
And if you want to observe
a photon in your laboratory,

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.850
it has to bounce around
zillions of times

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.619
in order to have enough
time for the photon

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:56.785
to do something interesting.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:25.110
So sometimes a field at
the frontier of science

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:31.500
is defined by paradigms.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:39.840
If you want to explain
to somebody why

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.020
your field of interest
is cool and exciting,

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.320
you usually do it by picking a
few really exciting examples.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:57.220
And I want to show you how,
over the years, it has advanced.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.320
Definitely in the
'50s and '60s, you

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.730
would have mentioned that we
understand now atomic structure

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.750
of multi-electron atoms.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.780
Optical pumping just started.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.735
So these were flagship
developments of AMO science.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.850
The cool thing to do
in the '60s and '80s

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.380
was, use the new tool, the
laser, applied to atoms

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.740
and do laser spectroscopy.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.150
Sub-doppler spectroscopy,
sub-natural spectroscopy,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.050
resolving hyperfine
structure-- wow.

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.400
I mean, this was really
exciting in those days.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.250
And well, the older
people I have met,

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.790
my teachers, my
thesis adviser, these

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.840
were people who started
their research career

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.100
before the laser was
invented but then,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.170
as a young researcher,
embraced this new tool

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.870
and helped to
redefine the field.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:08.140
Definitely in the '80s and
'90s, the cool pictures

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.910
were those of
magneto-optical traps,

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.280
atoms standing still
and hovering around.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:21.590
So the new aspect
where mechanical forces

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:27.860
of light which led to laser
cooling and trapped atoms.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:34.490
In the late '90s, of
course, the excitement

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.280
was about Bose-Einstein
condensation.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.240
And it was really
Bose-Einstein condensation

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.360
which drove AMO physics
from single atoms, maybe

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.860
two atoms colliding,
to many-body physics.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.530
It's always easier to
analyze those things

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.440
by looking backward, so if I'm
now getting closer to the past,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.760
I have to be a little bit vague.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:12.010
But in the 2000s, I think hot
topics were ultracold fermions

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:18.925
and the study of entanglement
and correlations.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:31.340
And what is the paradigm
now or in the near future?

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.940
Well, I think you have
to help to define it.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.070
If you make an
interesting discovery,

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.520
this is what people will be
pointing to and would say,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.740
this is what now
defines AMO physics.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.510
Some candidates are,
of course, if there

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.306
is a major breakthrough
in quantum computation--

00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:56.200
let me put question marks here.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.220
In the field called
atom science,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.810
we may actually do some progress
towards topological states

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.500
which have different symmetries
and different properties.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:16.570
And another emerging frontier
is micro-mechanical oscillators.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.100
The last couple
of years, we just

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.430
had the breakthrough
for the first time.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.700
Mechanical objects were cooled
to the absolute ground state.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.850
So at least for that community
it was, but for many of us,

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.660
Bose-Einstein condensation
was 15 years ago.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.045
Any questions?

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.810
Well, eventually we have
to talk about this course.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.845
So I've told you
about, at least,

00:30:06.845 --> 00:30:10.730
a snapshot of where AMO physics
is, how it has developed,

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.510
and on what trajectory it is.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:29.830
In this course I want to present
you the concepts behind many

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.900
of the major advances
in the field.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.390
So over the years, quite often
a topic was added to the course,

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.700
because I felt, hey, that's
getting really exciting,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.741
that's what people want
to do in research, that's

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:45.500
what graduate students
want to do here.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.330
And then the subject was
added and other subjects

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.050
were dropped.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:54.010
I know in the '90s, I was
teaching aspects of laser

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.320
cooling, sub recoil
laser cooling,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.830
which was the latest excitement.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.580
This year, I may mention
it for 30 seconds.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:07.060
So the course has evolved.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.780
It wants to stay connected to
what is exciting, what is hot,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.890
and what prepares you for
research at the frontier.

00:31:18.244 --> 00:31:25.820
8.422, the second part
of the two-course cycle

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.460
in the graduate
course in AMO physics,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.740
is somewhat different,
not radically different,

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:40.790
but is somewhat different
from part one, from 8.421.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:47.190
First of all, 8.421, 8.422
can be taken out of sequence.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:51.360
We alternate between
AMO 1 and AMO 2.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.086
And whenever you
enter MIT, you're

00:31:54.086 --> 00:31:55.460
probably in your
second semester,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.380
take whatever we offer.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.966
So I expect-- let me ask you,
who of you has taken AMO 1?

00:32:01.966 --> 00:32:04.340
Yes, statistically, it should
be about half of the class.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.680
It can be taken out of
sequence because that's

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.260
the way how we've structured it.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.810
But to give you one
example is, in 8.421

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.940
you really have to learn
about hyperfine structure.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:19.903
You have to learn
about atoms, you

00:32:19.903 --> 00:32:21.736
have to learn about
Lamb shift and all that.

00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:25.070
So you have to learn what
all these atomic levels are.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.250
And here in that course,
in 8.422, I will say,

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.420
here's a two-level system
and then I run with that.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.290
And we do all sort
of entanglement,

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:34.660
manipulation of
two-level systems.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.390
So it helps you if you know
where those two levels come

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.230
from, but you don't really
need the detailed knowledge

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.950
of atomic structure, for
instance, to understand that.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.780
So this is why the different
parts of the course

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.250
are connected, but in terms of
learning the material, somewhat

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.860
decoupled.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.860
I've spoken to many
students who said

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.410
there was no problem
in starting with 8.422.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.980
The only sort of critical
comment I've heard

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:09.430
is that taking 8.422 first and
then 8.421 is anti-climactic.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.900
You see all this excitement
in the modern physics,

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.565
and then, eventually, you have
to work on the foundation.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:25.050
Prerequisites for this course--
the course announcement

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.500
said 8.05.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.120
It is actually 8.05 and 8.06.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.780
The main part of 8.06
which we really need here

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.430
is perturbation theory--
time independent, time

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.690
dependent perturbation
theory, and this is usually

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:42.570
covered in 8.06.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:46.390
However, I've had students who
took the course without 8.06.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:48.450
If you're really
determined and want

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.476
to acquire certain
things by self-study,

00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:52.600
you can follow this course.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:11.540
So the topics we will
cover include QED.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:21.639
I really want to talk about
light-atom interactions

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:25.070
from first principles.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:29.530
Sure, 95% of what
we're doing is just

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.570
done by saying we have
a matrix element, which

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.429
maybe the dipole matrix element.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:38.560
But you really have to know what
are the approximations, what

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.159
are the conditions, which lead
to the dipole approximation.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.710
And I want to do that
from first principles,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.590
and we do that
starting on Monday.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:35:04.720
So a discussion of light-atom
interaction has two parts.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.950
One is the simple part--
excitation and stimulated

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.080
emission.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.420
Because this can be simply
described by a unitary time

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:19.430
evolution, and you can do
a lot, if not everything,

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.500
by using Schroedinger's
equation.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:28.180
Things get much more
complicated and richer

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:35.000
if you include spontaneous
emission or, more generally,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.060
if you include dissipation.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.895
Then we talk about open systems.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.490
And for fundamental reasons,
we need a formulation

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.620
using the density matrix,
a statistical operator,

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.740
and a master equation.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.740
One major part of the course
is discussion and [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:05.470
derivation of the
mechanical forces of light.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.170
This will include
a discussion of

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:19.040
important experimental
techniques using

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.830
those mechanical forces.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:26.530
So various simple and
sophisticated methods

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:27.550
of trapping and cooling.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:36.820
We will spend some time in not
talking about atoms at all.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:42.490
We're just going to talk about
photons, about single photons.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:46.150
We want to understand where
the photon nature of light

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.390
makes light very,
very different from

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.360
a classical
electromagnetic wave.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.510
Also, it's not
the focus, we will

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:04.080
come across basic building
blocks of quantum information

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.450
science.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.060
Pretty much when atoms
and photons interact,

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.880
this is a fundamental
quantum gate.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.070
And we'll talk about
the many-body physics

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.295
off quantum gases.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:29.890
So maybe it becomes
clearer what we

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:35.860
are covering by saying
what we are not covering.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.820
And this tells you
that there is at least

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.400
some selection of topics.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.120
It's not that we talk
about everything.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.780
We will not talk about the
physics above 10 electron

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.280
volts.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.470
We will not talk
about collisions--

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.515
or maybe I should say,
high-energy collisions.

00:38:05.594 --> 00:38:09.560
We will, of course, talk about
nanokelvin collisions, which

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.290
is the physics of
the scattering links

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.830
and some s-wave collisions
which are really

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.950
relevant to understand
quantum gases.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:23.120
We're not talking about
any advanced topic

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.015
in atomic structure.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.630
All we do about atomic
structure is done in 8.421.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.980
And if you want to graduate
in atomic physics at MIT,

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.890
yes, you have to
understand atomic structure

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.940
at the level of
the hydrogen atom.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.740
And maybe know a little
bit about a new phenomena--

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.695
when another electron enters,
when electrons interact

00:38:45.695 --> 00:38:49.520
and that's a helium atom--
but we're not going beyond it.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.950
Let me just mention here
that there is, of course,

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.510
more interesting things
in atomic structure.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:02.000
For instance, if you go
to highly charged ions,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.330
you have QED effects.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.520
You can discuss very
interesting correlations

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.060
between two
electrons in an atom.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.520
And you can have very
relativistic effects

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.420
if you have highly
ionized atoms.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:30.970
If you have bare uranium,
then the electron

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:35.360
in the lowest orbits
becomes relativistic.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.810
You can even see, if you scale
the fine structure constant--

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:44.000
which has an e squared in it--
with the charge of uranium 92,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.110
well, 1 over 137 times
92 gives about 1,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.900
so you really get
into a new regime

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.120
of coupling for atomic physics.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.320
But we won't have
time to talk about it.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.810
And this may be an
omission, because there

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.540
is really interesting
work going on.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.122
We're not talking
about high intensity

00:40:09.122 --> 00:40:19.020
lasers and short laser pulses.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.410
This choice maybe
mainly determined

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:27.360
by that the experimental program
in the physics department

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.200
is not overlapping with that.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.015
But of course, you know we
have world class researchers

00:40:32.015 --> 00:40:34.950
and short pulse lasers in
the electrical engineering

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:35.450
department.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.640
Any question about the syllabus?

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:48.040
Questions about what to expect
in the next 12, 13 weeks?

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.716
Well, then let's talk
about some technicalities.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:14.670
I'll keep it short because
all this information is

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:15.925
available on the website.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.520
We run the website
of the CUA server.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:30.846
So it is cua.mit.edu/8.422.

00:41:30.846 --> 00:41:33.040
When I say all the
information is available,

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:36.020
I have to say-- not yet.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.260
I realized yesterday
night that [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.970
has re-modified the server.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.950
I didn't have access
to the server.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.460
I just got it an hour ago.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.790
What you will find
under this URL

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:53.800
is the website from when the
class was taught two years ago.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.130
And actually, more than 90
percent of the information

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.290
is the same.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.030
I always try to
improve the course,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.630
but I know it will be more
incremental changes and not

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.686
dramatic changes.

00:42:05.686 --> 00:42:07.560
So if you look at the
website, you'll already

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.254
get a taste what the course is,
but within the next day or two,

00:42:11.254 --> 00:42:12.545
we'll have updated information.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:26.670
I know, at least
for most of you,

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:30.310
I have contact information
for MIT registration.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:37.590
But if you are a Harvard student
or a listener just sitting

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.880
in and you haven't
registered for the class,

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:52.170
I would ask you to send an
email to our secretary, Joanna,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:59.360
j_k@mit.edu, because I would
like to have an email list

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.180
for the class for corrections to
the homework assignment or last

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.780
minute announcements.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.900
And then we'll add you
to the mailing list.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:20.050
The schedule of the
class is, well, we

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:24.400
meet at this time on
Monday, Wednesday.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:32.730
And let me know disclose, I
plan to occasionally teach

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:36.379
on Fridays at the same time.

00:43:36.379 --> 00:43:38.170
Over many years, it
has been my experience,

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.450
if you have a class on Monday,
Wednesday at one o'clock,

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:42.575
you don't have another
class Friday at one o'clock.

00:43:42.575 --> 00:43:44.100
Is that assumption correct?

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.460
So within the next few
days, I will tell you

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.605
on the website which Friday
I would like to teach.

00:43:52.605 --> 00:43:54.380
The reason is rather simple.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.690
Like every faculty member
who's active in research,

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:02.900
I have to go to funding agency
workshops and conferences.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.280
I try to keep it to a
minimum, but on average I

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.880
will miss two or three classes.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.350
And instead of
asking a [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.480
or a graduate student
to teach the class,

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.810
I would like to teach
the class myself.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.960
So I will have makeup
classes on Fridays.

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.380
OK, that's the schedule.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:40.610
Finally, talking
about requirements,

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:45.880
one requirement is homework.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.860
We have 10 wonderful
problem sets

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.920
with a lot of problems
which I actually

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.480
designed from current research.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.830
So you will actually recognize
that a lot of problems

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.010
are created based on some
research papers which came out

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.340
of my own group or other groups
at MIT in the last few years.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:18.070
The good news is, there is no
mid-term, there is no final,

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.920
but there will be a term paper.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.805
And the term paper is due
on the last day of classes.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:49.950
The teaching team are
myself, Joanna Keseberg,

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:55.820
our secretary-- that's also
where you will be dropping off

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.215
your homework-- and
then we have assembled

00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:05.160
a wonderful team of five TAs.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.800
They are all advanced
graduate students.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:12.600
And actually, I've picked TAs
from all of the active groups

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.490
here at MIT.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.490
From Martin Zwierlein's
group, I. Chuang's

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.410
group, Vladan Vuletic's
group, and my group.

00:46:20.394 --> 00:46:23.880
Are any of the TA's around?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:36.760
Nick, Alexei, Jee Woo,
Lawrence, and Molu.

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:43.040
Each TA will be responsible
for two weeks in the course,

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:46.904
and the TA will indicate
availability and office hours

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.320
on the weekly
homework assignment.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:56.700
Other details about
the term paper,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.290
how long the term
paper should be,

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:04.070
the, kind of, what I
regard as an honesty code,

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.430
that you're not
trying to get access

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:10.030
to solutions from
previous courses,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.830
all that is summarized
on the website.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:14.260
And once I've
updated the website,

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.022
I'm sure you will read it.

00:47:16.022 --> 00:47:16.605
Any questions?

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:33.710
OK, well, with that
we will actually

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.240
be ready to jump into
the middle of the course

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.280
and start with some heavy
duty equations of QED.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.850
But no-- just joking.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.050
I think this would maybe
spoil the introduction.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.100
What I actually like to do
is, to make the transition

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.470
from the introduction
to the discussion

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:59.560
of atom-photon interactions
and quantum electrodynamics,

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.660
I always like to
start the course

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.010
by giving you an
appetizer by talking

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:09.690
to you in a lighthearted
but hopefully profound way

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:17.660
about the system,
which helps to showcase

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.260
what are we doing
in this course.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.750
And until a few
years ago, I would

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:26.610
have started with the simplest
example of laser cooling,

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.630
simply beam slowing
or optical molasses,

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.560
in the simplest
possible picture,

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.750
just to give you a taste of
what we will be doing together

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:36.750
during the semester.

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.910
But as I said, AMO
physics is moving along.

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:46.880
And what I now want to use
as an example which clearly

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.470
synthesizes many
aspects of this course

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:53.000
are atoms in an optical lattice.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:49:06.470
So let me, in the last,
next 20 minutes or so,

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:12.270
make some connections to
different topics of this course

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:19.570
by using as a starting point a
concrete, very simple system,

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.680
but very, very
rich and profound,

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.910
and these are atoms
in optical lattice.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.390
So the situation
I want to use here

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:34.120
is that you have two laser
beams which interfere.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:38.820
And those laser beams form
an optical standing wave.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:55.630
So next week we will learn
how this electromagnetic wave

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.350
interacts with atoms.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.900
So we have to put a few
atoms into the system.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.460
And we will derive, from
first principles, the QED

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:14.100
Hamiltonian, which, after a lot
of manipulation and eliminating

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:22.210
complicated terms, will
be the dipole interaction.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.380
But of course, each symbol
here is an operator,

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.333
and there's a long
story behind that.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:42.280
In about two months, we will
describe light-atom interaction

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.170
with a formalism
which uses a Bloch

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:50.140
vector and the optical
Bloch equations.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.650
There is a vector with
three components which

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:59.120
describes what is the
state the atom is in.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.670
One component will
tell us if the atom

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.690
is in the upper or
the lower state,

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.970
whereas the other
components tell us

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:12.290
whether the dipole
moment of the atom

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:21.360
is in phase or out of
phase with a driving

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.610
electromagnetic field.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:40.670
Well, if there is part of
the dipole moment which

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:46.590
is in phase with a
driving electric field,

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:51.790
then the suitable
expectation value

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:55.490
defines a mechanical potential.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.630
And if the electric
field is a standing wave,

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.635
then we generate, through
light-atom interaction,

00:52:02.635 --> 00:52:05.320
a periodic potential
for the atoms.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:13.070
We will learn
everything which we

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:16.710
have to know about
this potential.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:20.500
In a simple case, it is
simply the Rabi frequency

00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:26.860
divided by the detuning of
the electromagnetic wave.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:31.430
But we will find
it very interesting

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:34.490
to look at it from very
different point of view.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.970
And maybe let me
use this example

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:40.600
to point out that I'm really
a big friend of explaining

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.910
the same physics from very,
very different perspectives.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:48.350
And when we talk about
optical standing waves,

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:51.300
we will use a picture of
a classical potential,

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.680
like a mechanical potential, and
the atom is just moving around.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.860
We will use a photon picture
that every time the atom

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.574
feels a force,
photons are involved.

00:53:00.574 --> 00:53:02.490
You don't see them in
the classical potential,

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:06.020
but photons are behind it,
and ultimately, the forces

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.315
of the classic potential come
from stimulated absorption

00:53:09.315 --> 00:53:10.290
emission of photons.

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.280
I may go down to the
microscopic level.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.910
And I may ask you, but
in the end, it's an atom,

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:21.270
but the atom consists
of electrons.

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:23.630
And the electrons are
simply oscillating

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.850
because it's driven by
the electromagnetic field.

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.560
It's actually something which
most people are not aware of,

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.320
but you can ask
the question now--

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:38.010
is the force in the optical
lattice on the atom,

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.960
it's ultimately a
force on the electron?

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.885
Well, if you have
a charged particle,

00:53:42.885 --> 00:53:45.890
you can have two kinds of
forces-- an electric force

00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:48.510
or the Lorenz force.

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.020
And I don't know if you
would know the answer,

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.320
but an atom is in
an optical lattice,

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.730
is the force just
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:00.540
the potential which
the atom experiences,

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.450
is that fundamentally due
to the Coulomb force exerted

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:06.450
by the electric
field of the light,

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:09.110
or is it due to the
Lorenz force exerted

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:10.560
by the magnetic
part of the light?

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.400
Who knows the answer?

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.870
Who doesn't know the answer?

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:18.970
OK, great.

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.720
I was actually surprised
when I derived it

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.280
a few times for the first time.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.740
And it's not in the
standard textbooks.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.270
So anyway, I hope, even for
many of you who know already

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.330
a lot about the
subject, I hope I

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:36.670
can add other
perspectives for you.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:40.340
OK, so what I've
discussed so far

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:44.470
is that the standing
wave of light

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:54.330
creates now a periodic
potential for the atom.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:57.730
And we will understand it
from many, many different

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.850
perspectives, from the
photon type, quantum optics

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:03.160
perspective, to the most
classical description.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:09.520
So what immediately
comes to my mind

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:14.120
is that we now want to look at
this periodic potential in two

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:14.995
different situations.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:22.540
We can ask, well,
whenever you have light,

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.350
spontaneous emission
is a possibility.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:31.030
And we may ask, what happens
when spontaneous emission

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.910
is not negligible?

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:37.900
And we discuss
that approximately

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.960
in week nine of the course.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:46.090
Then what happens is, an atom
has an excited and a ground

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:47.410
state.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.520
And those in the excited
and the ground state,

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:54.140
do the atoms feel the
periodic potential?

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:06.240
Well, eventually, we
have to generalize

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:10.550
the notion of ground and excited
state into [INAUDIBLE] states,

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:14.000
and I will tell you all
about it in a few weeks.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.010
But the situation can now be,
when an atom is in the ground

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:22.570
state, it has to move up
the standing wave potential.

00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:25.200
Then it's getting
excited with a laser.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.980
It has to move up again the
standing wave potential.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.380
And then there may be
spontaneous emission.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.210
So what I'm just describing
here is a situation

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.280
where the atom is mechanically
moving up the potential.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.630
It's excited at the
top of the potential.

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:44.040
And it emits when it's
on top of the potential.

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:47.230
So the atom is doing
mechanical work,

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:50.950
and this is called
Sisyphus cooling.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:57.240
This is the way, this is
one method, one mechanism,

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.760
of laser cooling which
leads to the lowest

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:03.550
temperatures in the laboratory
before evaporative cooling is

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:04.600
used.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.030
So that's some cool
aspect we will come along

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.710
by discussing motion
in a standing wave,

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:16.340
but taking into account
that photons are emitted

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:19.570
and really understanding
when and where

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.770
are the photons emitted.

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:29.290
Well, the second
situation is, of course,

00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:32.455
if spontaneous emission
is completely negligible.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:43.470
Then we have a situation
where all what matters

00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:46.830
is the potential,
and we can completely

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:51.550
forget that it's photons,
it's quantum optics

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.400
which has created
this potential.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.150
We can simply use a
classical potential

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.710
in our description
in our Hamiltonian.

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:05.930
Now, again, we have
two limiting cases.

00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:15.340
One case is when this
potential, or optical lattice,

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.630
is really deep.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:25.150
Deep means that atoms are
sitting deep in the potential

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:32.840
and they can oscillate around,
but they cannot jump over

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.810
to the next potential.

00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:42.190
So in this situation, you
would say, well, that's boring.

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:44.770
Nothing happens, the
atom just stays put.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:46.370
But what is boring
for some of you

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.740
is exciting for some
others, because these atoms

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.110
are exquisitely controlled.

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:56.040
They cannot collide, they cannot
interact with other atoms.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.360
So these are really the
most ideal situation

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.910
you can imagine for atoms.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:06.020
Of course, if you have less
than one atom per site.

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:12.150
And this is the way how
you want to prepare atoms

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:16.170
for the most accurate
interrogations.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:20.910
And you can build atomic
clocks, optical atomic clocks,

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:24.040
based on atoms insulated
in such a lattice, which

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.635
approach now 10 to
the minus 17 accuracy.

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:36.200
Well, if you drive
a clock transition,

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.550
if you take the atom from the
ground to the excited state,

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:43.420
you may face a situation
I mentioned earlier

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:46.590
that the periodic potential for
the ground and excited state

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:47.750
are different.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.460
And that would actually
interfere with your clock,

00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:53.030
because the clock
frequency depends now

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:56.470
on what the lattice is
doing to your atoms.

00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:03.360
However, and we discuss
that in week four,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:11.860
there are what people
call magic wavelengths,

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.880
where you pick a
certain wavelength

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:22.750
for your optical lattice where
the periodic potential is

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.780
absolutely the same for
ground and excited state.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:36.680
So that means you have,
then, the perfect decoupling

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.650
between the ticking
of the clock,

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.600
the internal
structure of the atom

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.870
and the mechanical motion of
the atoms in the potential.

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:55.290
And in that situation,
you create a situation

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:59.270
which has been studied
since [INAUDIBLE], namely

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:00.270
with trapped ions.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.855
If you have a single
ion in an ion trap--

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:13.830
and ion trapping is pursued here
at MIT in Ike Chuang's group--

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:17.990
you have just a single
object completely isolated.

01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:23.730
And in the form of
the aluminum ion,

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:28.280
this has just been
demonstrated to be

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.390
the most accurate atomic
clock in the world with 10

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:34.150
to the minus 17 accuracy.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:37.880
So anyway, with
optical lattices,

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.690
avoiding spontaneous emission
using magic wavelengths,

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:46.120
we can only engineer
with neutral atoms what

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.500
has been available
with trapped ions

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:51.950
but we can simultaneously
have 10,000 copies

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:55.350
and look at 10,000 atoms which
are all identical copies,

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:56.790
identical systems
with each other.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.590
So you see already
from that example

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:06.180
that there will be intellectual
overlap and synergy

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.920
between talking about neutral
atoms in optical lattices

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:15.610
and talking about trapped
ions and how they are cooled

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.510
and how they are manipulated.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.670
And we'll talk
about trapped ions

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.850
at the end of the
course, sideband cooling

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.550
of trapped ions,
which is week 12.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:35.390
OK, so this is the simple
but pristine situation

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:39.400
that we have a deep lattice.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.940
The other limit is
now that we have

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.030
a weak, or shallow lattice.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.980
And the new physics
which now comes into play

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.240
is that atoms can
move around-- they

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.260
can tunnel from side to side.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:08.910
So towards the
end of the course,

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:14.180
I think the last months,
approximately week 10,

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.060
I will give you a short
summary of what some of you

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:23.410
may have already learned in the
solid state course-- namely,

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:34.990
band structure of atoms in
optical lattices, Bloch states,

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.960
effective mass, et cetera.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.870
This has now become
language of atomic physics,

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:48.280
because there is a very clean
and straightforward realization

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.270
of this physics
using cold atoms.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.790
What we are mainly interested
in, in our research,

01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:07.890
is when we have atoms which
tunnel in this optical lattice.

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:12.680
And for bosons, if the
interactions get strong enough,

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.980
the Bose-Einstein
condensate is destroyed

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:18.450
and what forms is
a Mott insulator.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.970
This is a phase transition.

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:26.680
And for fermions,
we have a crossover

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.900
from a metal to a
fermionic Mott insulator.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:39.180
And with that, we are already
overlapping conceptually

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.750
with condensed matter physics,
because the Mott insulator

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:50.470
is a paradigm-- one of these
paradigmatic examples where

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.240
you understand
some deep physics.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.520
It's a paradigm of
condensed matter physics

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.160
where you have only a
partially-filled band.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.127
Common sense, or
undergraduate textbooks,

01:05:05.127 --> 01:05:06.710
would say,
partially-filled band, this

01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:08.730
means you've a metal,
you've a conductor.

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.550
But because of the
interactions of the atoms,

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:13.670
the system is an insulator.

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.360
So this is where, really,
the many-body physics

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.180
profoundly changes the
character of your system.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.590
Any questions?

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:35.170
Well then, let me
add one last aspect

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:42.396
to my introductory example
of optical lattices.

01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:44.770
In a sort of
flyover, I described

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.540
to you what is the
physics we encounter when

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.550
we have an optical
lattice switched on

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.950
and the atoms move around
or they don't move around,

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.150
and both cases are interesting.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:57.989
But if you think you've
explored everything, well,

01:05:57.989 --> 01:05:59.780
then you think harder
and say, hey, there's

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:01.610
another angle we
can get out of it.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:05.110
And this is, we can
take the optical lettuce

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:08.740
and simply pulse it on,
switch it on and off.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.380
Well, what happens
is, and then it

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.390
becomes a
time-dependent problem.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:22.910
It becomes something where
we can shape and control

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:26.690
the wave function of atoms
in time-dependent way.

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.240
Let me give you one example.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.980
If we start with
very cold atoms-- can

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:36.920
be a Bose-Einstein condensate--
and then, for a short time,

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:45.010
we switch on the
lattice, afterwards, we

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:51.140
observe that we have still
some atoms at zero momentum.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:57.680
But now we have atoms which
have a momentum transfer of plus

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:01.660
minus 2 h bar k.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.630
You can understand
that-- and this again

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:08.200
exemplifies that we want
to look at the physics

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.440
from different
angles-- this can be

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:18.020
described that you have
an two-photon transition

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:22.710
from the ground state with
zero momentum to the ground

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:27.520
state with two-photon recoil.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.590
So you can understand it
in the photon picture.

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:34.010
But you can also
understand it by saying

01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:39.460
you have some matter
waves which are now

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.380
exposed to a periodic potential.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.250
And you simply ask
what happens to waves

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.870
in a periodic potential?

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:52.660
Well, that's the same what
happens to optical waves

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.295
when they encounter
a grading, and that's

01:07:55.295 --> 01:07:56.420
the physics of diffraction.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.650
So in a nutshell,
this happens when

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:16.080
we use a pulse on an
optical potential.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.740
And let me now finish
by telling you that,

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:24.319
again, in this situation,
we discover the ambiguity

01:08:24.319 --> 01:08:28.350
or the two-sidedness of a lot of
things we do in atomic physics.

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:30.979
I've mentioned to you
that the same experiment,

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:34.390
the same experimental setup,
cold atoms in optical lattice--

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:37.100
you turn up the lattice and
you have the world's best

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.170
atomic clock, atoms just
isolated from each other.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:41.582
You turn down the
lattice and you

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:44.020
have an interesting condensed
matter physics system.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.990
Let me just show you that
the same two-sidedness

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.910
of atomic physics-- precision
and pristine control

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:52.920
and interesting
many-body physics--

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.810
happens when you pulse
on optical lattices.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:02.990
So one application of
those optical lettuces

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.590
is atom optics.

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:13.800
You have atoms and when they
encounter an optical lattice,

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:20.574
some atoms will just continue,
will not be diffracted.

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:28.899
They have zero momentums.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:34.310
Others are diffracted with
a transverse momentum.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:39.979
You can then expose the
atoms to a second zone

01:09:39.979 --> 01:09:44.740
where, eventually,
momentum is transferred,

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.189
and then the atoms
come back together.

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:52.069
So what we have here is an
atom interferometer where

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:56.105
atomic matter waves first
go through a beam splitter,

01:09:56.105 --> 01:09:59.894
are reflected back towards each
other, all by photon transfer,

01:09:59.894 --> 01:10:01.060
and then they're recombined.

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:15.940
So this pulsed optical lattice
acts as a beam splitter.

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:24.880
It is the way how, today,
the most precise atom

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.760
interferometers are built.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.060
And this is used for
precision measurement,

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.510
for measurement of inertial
forces, gravity, rotation,

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:45.760
acceleration, and it is used
for navigation and accurate

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.450
observation of the changes
of the gravitational field

01:10:49.450 --> 01:10:52.010
of the Earth.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.940
Since we just had a talk by
Holger Mueller from Berkeley

01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.350
day before yesterday
over at Harvard,

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.980
he talked about the combination
of atom interferometer

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:04.360
and frequency combs,
another development--

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.940
let me just mention that.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:09.700
If you derive those
laser frequencies

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.160
from an optical frequency comb,
and with an optical frequency

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.740
comb you can pretty much
count the frequencies.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.440
So this laser is mode,
I don't know-- 100,000

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.720
or whatever you are in the comb.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:26.570
By doing that, by combining
it, you can actually

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:32.000
build an atomic clock
where-- let me just say,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.070
plus combs-- can
give an atomic clock

01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:42.940
which is called the Compton
clock because the frequency is

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.930
now given by the rest
mass of the atom,

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:51.180
but divided by a
big integer number.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.190
So using completely unrelated
developments in AMO science

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:59.810
which I've mentioned, the
optical frequency comb,

01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:03.145
combining it with the physics
of a pulse standing wave,

01:12:03.145 --> 01:12:07.030
you now have an atomic clock
which is directly related

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:08.525
to the energy of the rest mass.

01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:24.950
But finally, if you pulse
on an optical standing wave

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:29.200
and your object are
not individual atoms,

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.960
non-interacting
atoms, your object

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:37.050
is the Bose-Einstein condensate
or atoms which strongly

01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:40.440
interact, then you're
not transferring

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.130
recoil to individual
atoms, you're

01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:48.750
transferring momentum to a
complicated many-body system.

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:53.940
And this means what
we are measuring

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:56.420
is the dynamic structure factor.

01:13:02.702 --> 01:13:04.660
If you have atoms, you
want to do spectroscopy,

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.970
you want to know what
energy levels are there,

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:08.470
and then you know your atom.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.530
If you have a
strongly-interacting system,

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:13.330
you also want to know what
energy levels are there.

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.390
But each energy level
in a homogeneous system

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:18.460
or in a periodic
potential is associated

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.500
with momentum and
quasi-momentum.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.700
So in other words, if you have
a more complicated system,

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.080
you want to figure out what are
the possible states in terms

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.680
of momentum and energy.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.610
And the optical standing wave,
the pulsed optical standing

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:35.810
wave is the way how we
impart momentum and energy

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:38.330
to a system.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.800
What I actually just
told you is a story

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.430
in my own research career.

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:46.190
I was a post-doc
with Dave Pritchard.

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:48.010
He had trained at
MIT in the '90s

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:50.070
by a pioneer in laser cooling.

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:52.110
And when we had
Bose-Einstein condensates

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:56.790
in the late '90s, Professor
Pritchard and myself,

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.969
we teamed up.

01:13:57.969 --> 01:13:59.885
I was the expert on
Bose-Einstein condensation

01:13:59.885 --> 01:14:03.910
and he was the expert
on atom interferometry.

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:06.460
So just by sort of
exploring things,

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.630
we took Bose-Einstein
condensates

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:10.940
and we pulsed on
a standing wave.

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.790
What was on our mind was, hey,
let's build an interferometer.

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:19.410
But I'm more of a
many-body physics person.

01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:21.775
I suddenly said,
yes, but if we now

01:14:21.775 --> 01:14:24.950
change the momentum and the
frequency of this standing

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:26.400
wave, what happens?

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.245
And I suddenly
realized that this

01:14:28.245 --> 01:14:31.720
is a way to measure properties
of a Bose-Einstein condensate

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.440
in a way which hadn't
been done before.

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.790
So I realized--
and this is maybe

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.530
the last thing I want
to tell you today--

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:41.150
I realized in my own
research and my collaboration

01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:43.750
with Dave Pritchard, that
we'd built an experiment,

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:47.460
and we just turned one
knob at our experiment,

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:50.300
and the following day
we were no longer doing

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:54.690
atomic interferometry, we
were doing many-body physics.

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.670
So this is, I think, what
makes our field exciting.

01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:03.890
We are using the tools, the
precision, and the control

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:07.590
of atomic physics,
which leads to the most

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:11.677
accurate atomic
clocks in the world--

01:15:11.677 --> 01:15:14.010
atomic clocks, which are the
most accurate in the world.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.520
And we are using those tools to
do entanglement and many-body

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.130
physics.

01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:21.800
And I think it's just a
compelling combination.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.550
Anyway, that's an
appetizer, that's

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:26.006
an outlook over the semester.

01:15:26.006 --> 01:15:31.500
Do you have any questions about
the last examples I gave you

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:32.975
or the course in itself?

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:38.790
OK.

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:41.150
No homework assignment today.

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:43.750
And we'll meet Monday
at the same time

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.890
here in this lecture hall.
