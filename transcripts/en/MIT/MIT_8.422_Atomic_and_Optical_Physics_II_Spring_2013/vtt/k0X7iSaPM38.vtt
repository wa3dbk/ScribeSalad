00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.770
PROFESSOR: So good afternoon.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.790
Our main topic today
is to understand

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.040
light forces, in particular
the stimulated force using

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.030
the dressed atom picture.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.690
And I hope once you understand
how light forces can

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.680
be described in the
dressed atom picture

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.010
you will love the
dressed atom picture,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.920
as most atomic physicists do.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.400
It is really the
language we use,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.110
the intuition we apply
to atomic systems.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.930
Whenever we have a laser
beam which drives the atom

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.790
it is, in most situations,
more appropriate

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.420
and better to use dressed
states as your basis states

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.400
and not the naked,
the bare states, which

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.010
are ground and excited state.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.620
Now I know last
week I quickly went

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.370
though the dressed atom picture.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.520
Let me sort of go
through it in a fly-over

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.890
by not doing any
of the derivation,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.440
but making a few
comments here and there.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.650
Also, because I want
that some of the results

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.320
are fresh in your
head when we apply it

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.220
to mechanical forces of light.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.460
So I told you that in
the dressed atom picture

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.730
we have two kinds of
interactions, the atom

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.460
interact with a vacuum,
with a reservoir

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.120
of empty modes with
spontaneous emission.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.810
And we also interact
with a laser field.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.260
And the new feature about
the dressed atom picture

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.495
is that we first
solve this exactly,

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:06.360
we rediagonalize the Hamiltonian
for that Hilbert space,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.710
and then we allow spontaneous
emission to happen.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.940
Now the derivation is
pretty straightforward.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.690
After a number of
assumptions, we simply

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.740
came to the two-by-two
matrix, where

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.300
we have two levels of the
atoms coupled with the Rabi

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940
frequency.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.910
I derived it here for you using
the quantized electromagnetic

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.900
field.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.380
But in your homework you derive
the same two-by-two matrix

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.880
using a classical
electromagnetic field,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.610
which drives the atoms.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.430
And we've talked about the
similarities and differences

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.070
last week.

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.540
If you have any questions,
please raise your hand

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.030
or interrupt me.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.940
Now two-by-two matrix
is fairly trivial.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.170
We can immediately
diagonalize it.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.630
And we find
Eigensolutions, which

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.750
are just sine theta,
cosine theta, amplitude,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.530
linear superpositions
of the naked states.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.225
And the naked states are ground
and excited states, state A

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:18.866
and state B, with N or N plus
1 photons in the laser field.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.100
So it's simple.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.215
It's just a two-by-two matrix.

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:28.100
But the insight we
can get out of it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.960
is pretty profound
and pretty subtle.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.120
So what we first
discussed is-- and we

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.140
will need that to
understand forces and energy

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.970
conservation-- we can now
look at spontaneous emission.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.820
Spontaneous emission coupling
to the empty modes of the vacuum

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.120
can only connect an excited
state B with a ground state A.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.940
And therefore, we
have diachromatically

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.780
those four combinations,
represented here

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.600
by those four arrows.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.510
And if you look for
the matrix element,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.430
you collect cosine theta
and sine theta factors.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.680
And that's what we did here.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.940
So we immediately get in
the dressed atom picture,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.860
an expression
which tells us what

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.850
are the matrix elements for
the carrier, for the blue

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.150
and for the red detuned
sideband of the Mollow triplet.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.870
But then there's
something else, and I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.630
edit this with the
lecture notes in green.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.190
We can also, now, if you know
what the transition rates are,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.550
we can set up rate equations
and can solve them.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.190
And once you solve a set of
differential equations for rate

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.080
equations, you know what
the populations are.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.390
But now, today, I want to
tell you one more subtlety.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.800
You know already
that you cannot,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.270
in the most general situation,
formulate an equation with just

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.660
a population.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.350
You know that we have
the master equation,

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.240
we have the Optical
Bloch Equation.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.400
This is an equation
for the density matrix.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.070
And usually we get equations
where the populations

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.020
are mixed with coherences.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.200
In other words, you cannot just
say the diagonal matrix element

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.290
of the density matrix
is a population,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.460
and the change of population
is what goes out of this state

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.260
and what arrives in this state.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.400
Coherences play a role.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.390
But, and this is what the
dressed atom picture does

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.020
for you, in the limit that we
have a strong Rabi frequency--

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.460
and this is the limit you
want to consider here--

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:41.120
the matrix equation
decouples into an equation

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.330
for populations and an
equation for coherences.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.650
And if something decouples
that should tell you we

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.920
all on the right track, we
have the right description.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.970
In this description things
decouple, things are simpler.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.740
And that means
this description is

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.510
most appropriate for the
physics we want to understand.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.060
Or, to say it more
specifically-- and all

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.645
the details of course
are in the book

00:06:04.645 --> 00:06:08.110
Atom Photon Interaction-- you
can rewrite the Optical Bloch

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.710
Equations not in the bare bases
but in the dressed atom basis.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.210
And in the dressed
atom basis you

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.116
find this wonderful
separation between populations

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:19.740
and coherences.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.820
So we have the simple
rate equations.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.740
By setting the
left hand side to 0

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.810
we find the steady
state populations.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.160
This will be very important to
understand the light forces.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.680
But you should just remember
the steady state solution such

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.620
as we know them.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.850
They're just exactly given
by this angle theta, which

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.360
tells us what kind
of superposition

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.800
of the bare states from
the dressed states.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.960
Remember in the case of
theta equals 45 degrees,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.640
the dressed states are just
symmetric and antisymmetric

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.960
superposition of
the naked states.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.320
Now what is also important
is those rate equations,

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.500
or those rate equations
have a time constant.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.280
The time constant is
here, the relaxation time

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.740
for populations.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.020
And we know exactly what it is.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.260
It's a little bit more
complicated to find

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.540
the equivalent equation
for the coherences.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.200
But just take my word,
the density matrix

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.670
in the dressed atom basis
decouples into equation

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.420
for population, which is
simple, equation for coherences,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.370
little bit harder to
derive but looks the same.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.950
And from this equation we have
now an expression for what

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.810
is the relaxation
time for coherences.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.690
And just to show you
one non-trivial example,

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.220
if you add up cosine square
plus sine square you get 1.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.130
But based on what
we derived we have

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.440
to take cosine to the power
of 4, sine to the power of 4.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.650
And this gives us effect of
1/2, which will appear somewhere

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.290
in an important place
in a few minutes.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.180
So with that we can now
address, we know now something

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.300
about the intensities
of this Mollow triplet,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.872
because the intensity is nothing
else than the population,

00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:25.270
what is the population in
the initial state times

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.070
the matrix element squared.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.190
But what is also-- what
comes out very naturally--

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.340
is that we have
different widths.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.390
The features have
different widths.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.429
The sidebands have
a different width

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.539
from the central part
of the Mollow triplet.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.732
And well, this is now
very naturally interpreted

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:47.740
at one has a width,
which is a relaxation

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.250
rate for the population.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.144
The other one, is the
sidebands have a width

00:08:51.144 --> 00:08:53.060
which is a relaxation
rate for the coherences.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.620
I showed you, and this was just
a reminder of a few weeks ago,

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.350
that when we looked at the
linear matrix equation, which

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.470
are the Optical
Bloch Equation, we

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.820
discussed complex
eigenvalues mathematically.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.040
And those complex eigenvalues,
the imaginary part

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.310
is the sideband frequency.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.730
And the real part
was the widths.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.750
What I have now, sort
of-- I can get everything

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.100
from the dressed atom picture.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.430
But what I've gotten in a
very natural and simple way

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.310
is this case, which is the
case where the dressed atom

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.460
picture is particularly simple.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.550
It's called the
secular case, where

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.700
the population and
coherences decouple.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.680
And so, what I just showed you,
that the population relaxation

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.820
time is gamma over 2.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:55.550
This explains now
why, in this case,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.300
the widths of the
central feature

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.940
is 1/2 of what it is
when we're on resonance.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.425
So everything is sort of
nicely playing out here.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:16.740
OK, any questions about
dressed level populations,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.670
rate equations,
the Mollow triplet?

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.610
Because we want to apply
it now, in a few minutes,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.040
to the stimulated light force.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.810
But before I do
that, let me show you

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:44.260
one nice piece of physics,
which can be formulated

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.750
both in the bare,
in the uncoupled,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.280
and in the dressed state basis.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.350
And this is the process
of spontaneous emission.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.410
If an atom is in
the laser field,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.970
it just emits photon,
rapid fire photons.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.080
And I want to show you now,
how we would describe it

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.370
in the bare basis,
how we describe it

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.760
in the dressed basis.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.780
And we get two very different
physical pictures out of it.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.270
Well, in the bare
basis, maybe just

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.150
think of quantum Monte
Carlo simulation,

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.100
a photon has been
emitted, and that

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.440
means we are in
the ground state.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.330
Now it takes a Rabi cycle
before the ground state

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.700
atom is in the excited state.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.030
And when it is in the excited
state, it can emit again

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.820
and goes back to
the ground state.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.220
And then things start over.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:37.300
So the picture you obtain here
is the picture of antibunching,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.560
that the atom emits
a photon, but then it

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.840
takes the inverse Rabi
frequency to load the gun again.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.910
And then it can fire again
and emit the next photon.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.610
So therefore, the probability
of getting another photon right

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:57.280
after you've observed the
first photon is reduced,

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.040
or T equals 0, it is exactly 0.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.490
And this is antibunching,
the photons are antibunched.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.450
So this is how we would describe
the radiative cascade, how

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.200
we go from N to N minus 1, to
N minus 2, how we lose photons

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.430
from the laser
field and dump them

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.200
into the empty
modes of the vacuum.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.560
That's how we describe it
in the uncoupled basis.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.143
Well in the dressed
basis we have sort of

00:12:25.143 --> 00:12:29.800
diagonalized the
atoms interacting

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.460
with the strong laser field.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.350
And now we would have
the following picture.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.630
We have this manifold here.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.700
We can emit from this manifold.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.800
And we can go to the upper
or lower dressed state.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.010
And then, the next
thing will happen again.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.770
But what we realize here, if we
are in the upper dressed state,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.420
we can either emit
on the carrier

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.970
or we can emit a
blue detune sideband.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.890
But once we have emitted
a blue detune sideband,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.550
the next sideband has to be
red detuned because we are now

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.240
in the lower dressed state,
and we need a lower sideband

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.710
to go back to the
upper dressed state.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:13.630
So what this picture gives
us, it gives us the sidebands

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.550
because we are resolving the
splitting in this picture.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.360
And secondly, it
tells us that there

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.980
is an alternation between
the blue detuned photons

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.306
and the red detuned photon.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.880
Now you would say, well
aren't those two pictures

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.940
really different?

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.940
In one case we
have antibunching,

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.920
and all of the
photons are the same.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.720
And over here I talk
about an alternation

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.640
between the blue and
the red sideband.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.060
Well again, the two
pictures are complementary.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.870
In this case, if I want to
resolve the antibunching

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.940
I need a temporal
resolution which

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.130
is better than the
inverse Rabi frequency.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.430
But if my temporal resolution
is better than the inverse Rabi

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.740
frequency then I don't have
the spectral resolution

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.180
to observe the sidebands,
and vice versa.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.070
If I want to resolve
the sidebands,

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.990
if I want to distinguish the red
from the blue detuned sideband

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.470
of the Mollow triplet I
cannot run the experiment with

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.880
the spectral resolution, which
would be required to observe

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.120
the antibunching.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.370
So these are sort of
two different pictures.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.890
One is sort of in terms
of energy eigenstates

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.670
when we have
spectral resolution.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.210
And this other picture
is more appropriate

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.810
when we're interested in
the short time domain.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.310
So in that sense, you need both.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.040
You need the bare basis.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.760
You need to dressed basis.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.530
And you have to just know for
which physical process, which

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.013
of them allows the more
direct description.

00:14:52.013 --> 00:14:52.513
Questions?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:07.730
OK, so this was partly
review, partly preparation

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.390
for the next big
chapter, namely we

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.520
want to understand the dipole
forces within the dressed atom

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.990
picture.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.670
The book Atom Photon Interaction
has a nice summary of it.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.640
But the more detailed picture,
and I heavily draw from this,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.450
is in the truly seminal article
by Jean Dalibard and Claude

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:28.890
Cohen-Tannoudji.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.280
I've linked this
article to our website.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:45.000
So I've summarized here pretty
much what I just told you.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.960
This is sort of the summary
from the previous section.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.040
What we have to know is
to understand light forces

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.650
in the dressed atom
picture is number one,

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.191
the energy speaking
between the two.

00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:03.170
The splitting between the two is
the generalized Rabi frequency.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.950
If there's anything
which is not--

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.130
well I shouldn't say 100%--
but at least 90% clear to you,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.310
ask me question.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.130
I mean these are the
results we really

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.180
need for the
following discussion.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.200
So number one is
the dressed energy

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.680
levels are split by the
generalized Rabi frequency.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.306
Number two is with
this angle theta, which

00:16:26.306 --> 00:16:27.930
came from the solution
of diagonalizing

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:31.400
the two-by-two matrix, we
have now the steady state

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.930
populations in the upper and
in the lower dressed state.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.970
And the third thing is when
we have a population when

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:46.060
we are not in steady state, then
the steady state populations

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:50.680
are obtained with the time
constant, which is given here.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.710
The time constant
is not just gamma,

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.630
it's gamma times these
trigonometric functions.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.570
So these are simple ingredients.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.910
But by using those
ingredients we

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:11.450
can get a very nice formulation
for the stimulated force.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.140
So what I've shown
here is, and this

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:30.380
is the situation we want
to focus on for a while.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.070
Assume you focus a laser beam.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.290
Then plot it as a
function of position.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.590
The atom is outside
the laser beam,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:42.495
it goes into the
laser beam where

00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:45.560
it experiences the
electromagnetic field.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.320
And if it goes further it
has crossed the laser beam

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.080
and is out of the
laser beam again.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.800
So what happens is the splitting
between the two dressed

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.380
energy levels is the
generalized Rabi frequency.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.150
And this is outside the laser
beam, simply the detuning.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.520
But then when the
laser beam is on,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.746
the generalized Rabi
frequency gets larger.

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:11.120
We have a larger lar splitting
between the dressed energy

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.160
levels, and so on.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.100
What is also important
is that if the laser is

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.510
red detuned, which is here, the
lower dressed level correlates,

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.750
corresponds to the ground state.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:38.180
Whereas for blue detuning the
ground state in this limit,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.380
the ground state correlates
with the upper dressed level.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.830
So it's important.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.920
So therefore an atom in this
situation-- because atoms

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.430
are always more in
the ground state

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.280
than in the excited
state-- an atom

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.849
will have more population
in the upper dressed level.

00:18:52.849 --> 00:18:55.140
And here it will have more
population the lower dressed

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.640
level.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.050
So what we want to
do now is we want

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:06.830
to rewrite the stimulated light
force, or the dipole force,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.770
as we want to express it
through the forces acting

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.800
on the dressed atom level.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.080
Well, I told you that we have a
splitting of the dressed energy

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.640
levels by the generalized
Rabi frequency.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.735
So therefore, if
I just cover that,

00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:28.172
the energy level
of the two dressed

00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:32.630
levels is h bar over 2 plus
minus the generalized Rabi

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.760
frequency.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.590
And the force if an atom is
in one of the dressed levels

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.720
is simply the gradient of that.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.000
So therefore we have the picture
that the two dressed energy

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.540
levels, atoms in those
two dressed levels,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.360
always experience
opposite forces.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.453
Then an expression
for the net force

00:19:54.453 --> 00:19:58.130
is that the average
dipole force is

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.830
the force in dressed
level one times

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.660
the probability that the
atom is in dressed level one.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.670
And the same for two.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.270
And if you sum it up we
get exactly the expression

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:13.910
we have derived earlier for
the stimulated light force.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.080
But let's just sort of look at
it in the following picture.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.320
If we are blue detuned,
and let's assume

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.230
we are not saturating
the transition,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.670
so therefore the atom will be
mainly in the ground state.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.790
So you have more
population in that state.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.910
But, well, if the
laser power is 0,

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.890
we have 100% population here.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.400
But when the atom moves
into the laser beam

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.130
there is a superposition of
ground and excited state.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.440
But that also means
there's a superposition

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.420
of upper and lower
dressed level.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.320
But we have always, of
course, more population

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.300
in the dressed level which
connects to the ground state

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:02.140
because an atom will-- well, it
also comes out of the solution.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.350
But it's natural, just assume
you make the laser beam weak,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.440
you start in the ground
state and everything

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.929
is sort of connected.

00:21:10.929 --> 00:21:12.345
The ground state
is simply dressed

00:21:12.345 --> 00:21:16.630
by a small excited
state contribution.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:20.850
So that explains it, why
for blue detuned light,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.380
the physics is mainly in
the upper dressed level.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.590
And we see the repulsive dipole
force of a blue detuned laser.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.850
Whereas, for red detuned
light, the dominant population

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.180
is in the lower
dressed level, and we

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.560
have an attractive force.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.080
Well that's simple.

00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:46.420
We haven't gained so
much, but you'll see,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.560
we can now rapidly gain insight
by take it to the next level.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.690
Let me first mention
a trivial example.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.390
And this is when we
are on resonance.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.410
When we are on resonance we
have equal population in the two

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:04.190
dressed states, they
are resonantly mixed.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.846
And therefore if the
population in the two

00:22:06.846 --> 00:22:10.370
dressed states is the same,
but the atoms experience

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.220
opposite forces, that means the
dipole force average out to 0.

00:22:17.342 --> 00:22:21.970
In a few minutes I want
to calculate for you

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.630
what the heating is.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.810
The dipole force is 0.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.180
But you know the atom in
this radiative cascade

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.500
is making transitions between
upper and lower dressed level.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.670
So what does it
mean for the atom?

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.100
When it is in one dressed
level it experience the force

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.160
from this side.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.300
If the atom is in the
other dressed level,

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.290
it's experience a
force from that side.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:53.350
So the atom is actually subject
to an average force which is 0.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.570
But if you take these picture
literally, and you can,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.600
the atom is really whacked
left, right, left, right, left,

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.100
right.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.950
And there is fluctuations.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.930
And we can use those fluctuating
forces to immediately calculate

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.250
what is the heating.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.410
The force average is 0, but
the fluctuations of the force

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.990
cause heating.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.430
So that's immediately the
next step of physical insight

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.120
we will get out of this picture.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.490
But before I do that I
want to do something else.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:29.730
I want to discuss
what happens now

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.010
to the force when the
atom is slowly moving.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:41.440
Remember, there is
still one phenomenon

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.630
which I owe you an
explanation for.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.480
And this is when we
discussed molasses.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.960
We always had the effect
in optical molasses

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.000
with a spontaneous
light force that we

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.330
need red detuning of the
laser beam to get cooling.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.280
The simple picture is the atom
absorbs a red detuned photon

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.870
and emits away a
resonant photon.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.460
And then that energy
difference is taken away

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.260
from the kinetic energy,
and this is cooling.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.680
But then I told
you that when you

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.690
go to higher power
of the standing wave,

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.330
the sine of alpha of the
friction coefficient reverses.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.950
And that means cooling is now
done by blue detuned light,

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.287
heating is done by
red detuned light.

00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:24.870
And that's what we
want to understand.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:35.090
So in order to get any cooling
effect, or heating effect,

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.450
we have to now
change the equation

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:41.890
we had for the
average dipole force.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.690
Remember also, the
average dipole force,

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.575
we did that earlier, can be
derived from a potential.

00:24:47.575 --> 00:24:49.620
It's a gradient over potential.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.180
So therefore, when you
fly through a laser beam

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.230
you go down and up or up
and down the potential,

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.560
but nothing has happened to you.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.310
But the assumption
we had for that

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:05.810
is that the dipole force was
calculated with a steady state

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.500
population.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.860
So now we want to say
if the atom is slowly

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.410
moving it may not
be fully adiabatic,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.120
and we want to calculate
the first correction

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.150
to the non-adiabaticity.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.310
So in other words, we have
the following picture.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.950
When an atom flies
through the laser beam

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:32.210
it needs a certain time
to adjust its population.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.230
And the question,
what is this time?

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.870
Well, it is the relaxation
time for the populations

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.990
among the dressed
states to adjust.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:44.400
And this is exactly the
inverse of the rate gamma

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.575
pop, which we have
calculated earlier.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.190
So the physical picture now
is that in the dressed level

00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:00.250
one and two, the population
at any given moment

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.970
is almost the steady state.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.990
But there is a time
lag, a time lag

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.960
by the time it takes to relax.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.160
So in other words, the
atom is always a little bit

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.140
behind in adjusting
to the laser field

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.190
because it takes a
finite amount of time.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:25.190
So let's now try to understand,
in this picture which

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.980
we have obtained
with a laser beam

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:33.450
the two dressed levels and
the atom flying through,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:41.900
let's try to understand what
this extra lag time means.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.170
So the atom is flying
into the laser beam.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.620
It starts out in
the ground state,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:53.330
which means 100% in the
upper dressed energy level.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:57.100
Now, in the laser beam the
higher the laser power is,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.980
the more there is a mixture of
the other dressed energy level.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.870
But what happens is,
when the atom is here,

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:09.530
when it just assume it flies in,
and there was not enough time

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.330
to adjust the
population, that would

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.190
mean that the atom-- and this
is indicated with the red dots--

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.450
that the atom has a
little bit of more

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.680
population in the
upper dressed level

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.450
than it would have
in equilibrium

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.290
But what does it
mean for the force

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.570
now, if there is more
population here than there?

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.120
Well, the more population
you have in the upper state,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.030
the more you're
climbing up a hill,

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.320
the more you get a
force to the left.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.560
So this red arrow shows due
to the non-adiabaticity,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.410
due to the time lag, there
is a little extra force

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.390
to the left hand side.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.710
So this is on the up hill.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.810
Let's now understand what
happens on the down hill.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.980
Well, we just have to
keep track of signs.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.630
Here, the atom, in a
fairly high laser field,

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.620
is in the upper dressed level
with a mixture in the lower

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:03.580
dressed level.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.040
But now it flies out
of the laser beam,

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.490
but it cannot immediately
adjust its population.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.160
And that means it
wants to have now

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.280
more population in the
upper dressed level

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.250
but it hasn't fully adjusted.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:23.700
So therefore, instead of
having the blue bullet, which

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.270
represents equilibrium, the
atom has the red bullet.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.440
It has a little bit
lower population in that,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.940
and higher population there.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.430
But lower population here
and hire population here

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:39.660
means-- if you have a little
bit higher population than you

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.500
should have here it means
you are climbing up the hill,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:49.040
and there is an extra force,
which is again, to the left.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.690
So we realize the
n the time lag,

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:57.860
means when an atom goes up
the hill there's a little bit

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.180
extra force to the left.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.720
And when it goes
down the hill there

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.080
is a little bit extra
force to the left.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.300
And after it has flown
through the steady state

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.410
part of the force roller
coaster up down, which

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.110
can be derived from a
potential, has integrated to 0.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.530
But what is left is this
non-adiabatic component

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.340
of the force which is
slowing down the atom.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:28.750
In other words, I have shown
you in this simple picture

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:34.370
that the time lag in adjusting
the dressed energy population

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:39.370
means that there is a small
differential force which

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.860
is slowing down the atom.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.460
And what I assumed
here was blue detuning.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.820
So we have cooling, we have
friction for blue detuned light

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.515
when it comes to the
stimulated force.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:02.710
Now this picture, this
equation that the population is

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.080
a steady state at the
given position minus a time

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.880
lag, we can solve it.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.820
And I'm not doing
it here because it

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.920
involves a few
mathematical equations.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.160
But by just using these answers,
and the rest is straight

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.030
forward, you can then
arrive at an expression

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:26.330
for the stimulated
for the dipole force.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.074
Colin?

00:30:27.074 --> 00:30:28.782
AUDIENCE: So, in the
spirit of last time,

00:30:28.782 --> 00:30:31.945
keeping track of the
energy, the energy here

00:30:31.945 --> 00:30:34.510
would be going into
the fact that now I

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.265
have-- if the atom's
a harmonic oscillator

00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:39.535
it's a little behind
the drive field?

00:30:39.535 --> 00:30:40.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.073
AUDIENCE: So you imprint some
fluctuation on the laser beam,

00:30:43.073 --> 00:30:45.073
and that's where the
energy's being carried off,

00:30:45.073 --> 00:30:46.067
in the laser beam?

00:30:50.242 --> 00:30:52.700
PROFESSOR: Well the energy's
carried off by the laser beam.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.570
I have actually
prepared something

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.070
which I want to
show you in 10 or 15

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.700
minutes, where the energy goes.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:04.820
So let's maybe do
that in a moment.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.190
So this is a physical picture.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.490
And I think what is also
important I want to later tell

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.530
you, for other laser
cooling mechanisms, which

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.970
are too complicated to describe,
but they also have a time lag.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.870
And I think, I try to
teach you basic concepts

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:25.360
by using this simplest
physical picture I can have.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.310
And what can be simpler than two
levels of an atom and one laser

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.070
beam?

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.730
But what you understand here
with this stimulated force,

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.180
which is also called
blue molasses,

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.390
is for the first
time how a time lag

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.730
in adjusting to the
local laser field,

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.516
how that leads to cooling.

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.900
I'm summarizing
here, simply taking

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.745
this picture, this
equation, and you

00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:53.610
know, turning the crank on it.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.670
The paper by Jean Dalibard
and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.650
calculates what is the
dipole force in steady state.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.840
We get almost the same
result with the Optical Bloch

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.910
Equations, but we
are discussing here

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.850
the limit that the Rabi
frequency is larger than gamma.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.810
So therefore, if you're
missing occurrences of gamma,

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.920
they don't appear here
because we've always

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.310
assumed omega is larger
than gamma in this picture.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.710
Now I want to apply
this picture now,

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.120
not just going through one
hump of the laser field,

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.070
but going through
a standing wave.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.870
So we have a standing wave of
light, which is blue detuned.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.530
Of course, in a
standing wave of light,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:51.940
if you ever reach over
one optical wavelengths,

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.350
you go up the hill,
you go down the hill,

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.550
the lambda average
dipole force is 0.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:05.300
But now you find that if
you put in this time lag,

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.240
you find a friction force, with
a friction coefficient alpha.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:17.240
And this friction coefficient is
cooling for blue detuned light.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:21.790
Now I don't want to
elaborate on this expression.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.250
But if you take the treatment
of Jean Dalibard and Claude

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.110
Cohen-Tonnoudji, which
is very transparent.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.405
It reads wonderfully easily,
as the book Atom Photon

00:33:31.405 --> 00:33:33.230
Interaction.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.850
In the limit of large
detuning, which is the simplest

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:39.390
possibly limit, you find
the friction coefficient

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.260
which looks highly nontrivial.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.580
It depends to the sixth power
of the Rabi frequency and such.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.240
The only reason why I put
it here, in 20 minutes

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.470
I want to give you a very,
very simple picture where

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:56.090
I derive that for you.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.100
So that's just a check mark.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.570
Any questions right
now about-- because I

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.910
want to go on-- about
the stimulated force

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.790
in the dressed atom picture?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.870
And if we allowed deviations
from the steady state

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.250
population we get
a cooling effect,

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.650
and this explains the
effect of blue molasses.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:18.909
And we've applied it
to a standing wave.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:19.409
Cody?

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:24.110
AUDIENCE: Just [INAUDIBLE]
the upper alpha

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.920
are a friction constant
and the lower one

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.376
is the polarizability?

00:34:28.376 --> 00:34:28.959
Or, something.

00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:31.540
PROFESSOR: No, oh,
thanks for asking.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.940
Alpha, yeah, we [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.639
Here it's the
friction coefficient.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.940
Here, remember when we
had the light force--

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:44.290
the spontaneous light force and
the stimulated light force--

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:47.760
one was directed
along a vector alpha,

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.049
and the other one
along a vector beta.

00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:53.580
Alpha was pointing
into the direction

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.130
of the gradient of
the laser intensity,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:35:00.400
and beta was the phase
gradient of the laser beam.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.080
So those two have
nothing to do--

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.630
this is friction coefficient.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:06.980
This is the direction for
the stimulated light force.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.580
And yes, a little
bit later today,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.160
I will use alpha again,
but for the polarizability.

00:35:15.426 --> 00:35:16.358
Yes.

00:35:16.358 --> 00:35:18.222
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE]
track the atoms

00:35:18.222 --> 00:35:21.138
in the [INAUDIBLE]
standing wave, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.100
PROFESSOR: You're talking
about trap in here,

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:39.530
that if you have a standing
wave of blue detuned light--

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.550
well if the standing wave
is infinitely extended then

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.400
the atom is always
in the standing wave.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.390
But if you use two Gaussian
laser beams to form a standing

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:50.200
wave, there is
always a net force

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.160
to expel the atoms away
from blue detuned light,

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.510
because blue detuned light
has an average dipole

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.260
force which is repulsive.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.230
So whenever you want
to manipulate atoms

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:05.300
with blue detuned light you need
an additional magnetic trap,

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.799
or an additional red
detuned optical trap.

00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:10.090
Because whatever you want to
do with atoms, if you want

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.230
to do it with atoms
in steady state

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.350
you have to keep
the atoms together.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.980
And what keeps
the atoms together

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.620
is red detuned optical
traps, or magnetic traps.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.560
The blue detuned
light can be used

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.900
to create a blue
detuned lattice.

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.599
Or it can be used
at least, if you

00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:31.890
want to do laser cooling with
blue detuned light it can

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.600
be used for laser
cooling, as I've

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.080
started to describe for you now.

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:47.250
But yes, I mean, in that
sense as an experimentalist,

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.865
you can run experiments where
you have only red detuned

00:36:49.865 --> 00:36:51.490
light-- red detuned
light for trapping,

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.260
red detuned light for cooling.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.870
But if you use blue detuned
light for a standing wave

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.815
or for blue
molasses, in addition

00:37:00.815 --> 00:37:03.250
you will always use
red detuned light

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.840
to keep the clouds together.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.920
So pretty much every
experiment usually

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.090
has some red detuned
light for confinement.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.100
And you have to then
match blue detuned light

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.350
with red detuned light to
get the two things you want.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.690
We can now use the
dressed atom picture

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.450
to calculate the heating.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:32.770
Remember the final
temperature you can reach

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:37.240
was always the ratio between
a heating coefficient, which

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.430
is actually the momentum
diffusion coefficient,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.930
over alpha.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:44.250
So right now we have
understood the alpha part.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:48.360
We know the physical
picture, why alpha

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.670
provides cooling, why
we have a friction

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.450
force for blue detuned light.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:56.090
But let's now take
it to the next step,

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.070
and calculate what
is the heating.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.020
And I mentioned it already in
the context of simple molasses,

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.850
which we discussed, I
think, two weeks ago,

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:12.560
that we describe heating by the
momentum diffusion coefficient.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.230
Well the momentum
diffusion coefficient

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.180
tells you that P
square is simply

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.830
growing as a function of time.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.170
If you have a cold cloud
and you heat it up,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.420
you can describe the heating
by the temporal growth

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.440
of P square.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:29.480
If you don't like
momentum, divide P

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.940
squared by 2m you have
the kinetic energy, which

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.140
increases.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.390
So it is this momentum
diffusion coefficient.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:40.075
And if you have a cloud which
moves with an average momentum,

00:38:40.075 --> 00:38:43.410
you only want to have the P
square minus P average square.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.560
But if you think about a
cloud which is being cooled,

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.750
the second term is 0.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.690
So the momentum
diffusion coefficient

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.280
is the derivative of P square.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.030
But the derivative of
P is simply the force.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.160
So therefore we can absorb the
derivative by replacing P--

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.920
at least one of the
P's-- by the force.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.900
And we can now get
rid of to second P

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.610
of the second
occurrence of momentum

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:12.510
by saying well momentum
is derivative of force.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.580
Sorry, derivative of
momentum is force,

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.890
or momentum is the
integral of force.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.550
So we can exactly rewrite that
momentum diffusion coefficient

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:31.480
by an integral over
correlation function of forces.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.430
And then we have the
nice physical picture

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.410
that with increase
of kinetic energy,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.420
the momentum
diffusion coefficient

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.871
comes because we have
fluctuations of the force.

00:39:42.871 --> 00:39:43.370
Yes?

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.328
AUDIENCE: With the last
time, the previous page

00:39:45.328 --> 00:39:48.240
the factor [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.701
PROFESSOR: The factor of 2 here?

00:39:49.701 --> 00:39:51.170
AUDIENCE: No, the next slide.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:52.089
PROFESSOR: Here is 2.

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.130
AUDIENCE: For both terms.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.295
PROFESSOR: Here is 2.

00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:56.780
And here it disappears,
because we have a factor of 2

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.980
and a factor of 2, and
the two cancel each other.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.340
AUDIENCE: No, I meant, there's a
2 multiplied the first average.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.740
And there's a 2
for the second one.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.150
Are those for the first term?

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.670
PROFESSOR: I think
this is correct.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:17.970
PROFESSOR: What happens
is P-- you use--

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:18.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.217
AUDIENCE: No, it's
supposed to be--

00:40:21.217 --> 00:40:22.550
PROFESSOR: Wait, is one missing?

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:26.840
Maybe [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.254
I think you're right.

00:40:28.254 --> 00:40:29.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:35.250
PROFESSOR: Let's assume
this is what it should be.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:45.190
So here is the reminder,
the kinetic energy.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:49.390
If you have a process which
causes momentum diffusion,

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.390
the momentum
diffusion coefficient

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.480
gives you the heating rate.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.280
And the cooling rate is given by
our friction coefficient alpha.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:01.960
And as we discussed in
the context of molasses--

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.400
of red detuned molasses, but it
applies to any cooling scheme--

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.440
the finite temperature
is when you

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.460
have detail balance
between heating and cooling

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.530
And therefore its ratio
of the momentum diffusion

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.450
coefficient over the
friction coefficient.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.979
Kensie?

00:41:17.979 --> 00:41:19.479
AUDIENCE: In the
previous step, what

00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:25.692
was the significance of
choosing f of 0 basically?

00:41:25.692 --> 00:41:31.159
Like, the time arguments were
0 and D. So we said that f of 0

00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:33.650
was DPDT?

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:39.810
PROFESSOR: Oh, we assumed that
the laser beam's Hamiltonian is

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.140
invariant against
time translation,

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.800
and we simply evaluate
that at T equals 0.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.520
I mean, that's of the argument
you have fluctuating forces.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.680
And you could have
fluctuating forces

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.720
at time T and time T prime.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.600
But then you use the augment
that in a steady state solution

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.590
the correlation
function does not

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:05.910
depend on T and T prime
separately, but only

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.180
on the difference.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.644
And then you simply
set one argument to 0,

00:42:09.644 --> 00:42:11.685
and the other argument
becomes a time difference.

00:42:15.154 --> 00:42:15.820
Other questions?

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.780
So now, by understanding
that momentum diffusion is

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.720
nothing else than the integral
over the force fluctuation,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.300
we can now use this physical
picture which I gave you

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:45.886
earlier that an
atom which cascades

00:42:45.886 --> 00:42:49.610
through upper, lower,
upper, lower dressed states

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:54.000
will experience opposite but
equal forces, form the right

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.220
and from the left.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:02.310
So I can simply evaluate that
by assuming we are on resonance.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:09.020
On resonance the force is h
bar over 2 times the derivative

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.520
of the generalized
Rabi frequency.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.980
And the force
correlation, what is it?

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.480
Well, it's the force
f of 0 times f of T.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.290
But as long as the atom
is in one dressed state

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.940
the force doesn't change.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:37.812
So I simply take here the
force, I take the force squared,

00:43:37.812 --> 00:43:44.610
and then when I integrate over
that, well the moment the atom

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.040
makes a transition
there is no longer

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.670
any correlation
between the force.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:53.630
Everything becomes random and
the integral averages out to 0.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.180
So in other words,
that's the way

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.770
how you should look
at this integral.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.590
You start with the
force f0, as long

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.520
as the force is correlated.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.670
Because the atom hasn't
done spontaneous emission,

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.920
you have sort of f of 0, f of 0.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:10.200
And you integrate it,
nominally to infinity.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.980
But you simply integrate it
until some spontaneous emission

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.000
randomizes the system.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.330
So therefore, this integral
over the correlation function

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.740
is nothing else then the force
squared times the typical time

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.850
scale for a transition.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:33.630
So if you put that
in on resonance,

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.470
we have the force here,
we square the force.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:40.860
And then we multiply with the
spontaneous emission rate,

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.620
which for resonance
system is gamma over 2.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.830
And with that we get now
the heating coefficient,

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.910
the momentum
diffusion coefficient

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.280
for an atom which is
exposed to resonant light

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.800
due to the stimulated
light force.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.430
The paper, the references
I've given you,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:09.320
is simply taking this
augment and extending that

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.890
to arbitrary detuning.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.480
For arbitrary detuning, I told
you what happens on resonance.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.400
The atom spends equal amount
in each dressed state.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.154
If you detune the atom spends
more time in one dressed state,

00:45:24.154 --> 00:45:25.820
then quickly in the
other dressed state,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.810
and then more time in the
other dressed state again.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.730
So you can, by
simply understanding

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.550
what are the rates for cascading
between the dressed levels,

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:40.320
you could pretty much write
down the expression, find it,

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.570
and here is the solution
taken out of the paper.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:45.670
So we have to correct
prefactor, but then

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.750
if the detuning is
non-vanishing we

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.660
get a contribution
from the second factor.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:51.160
Colin?

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:55.624
AUDIENCE: Are you assuming
the exponential correlation--

00:45:55.624 --> 00:45:58.104
exponential behavior
to the correlation.

00:45:58.104 --> 00:46:01.080
Because then you might
have different prefactors,

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.808
if it were something like if
you were in a [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:08.024 --> 00:46:16.450
PROFESSOR: Well what
happens is the following.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.680
I think if you're
in one dressed state

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.910
and the force pushes
you in one direction

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:28.710
and you integrate over it you
have an exponential decay.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.740
But instead of integrating
over the exponential decay

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.000
you can just take
the force squared

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.665
and multiply it with the
average time the atom stays.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.700
In other words, if I have an
exponentially decaying function

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.900
I can always approximate it
by the function of T equals

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.340
0 times the time.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.920
And what you are
asking me now is

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.100
is the time the one over E
time, or is it an average time?

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.962
What is the correct
time to use here?

00:46:59.962 --> 00:47:01.837
AUDIENCE: I guess when
the time scale depends

00:47:01.837 --> 00:47:06.228
on how the correlations decay
for [INAUDIBLE] different.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:13.610
PROFESSOR: Yes, OK, I agree.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.540
The shape of the decay of
the correlation function

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:17.460
would matter.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.240
I'm not going into that.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.590
But what I'm sort
of assuming here

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.470
is that the correlation
function indicated with time

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.130
is the correlation function of
T equals 0 times the correlation

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:30.290
time.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.940
And how the correlation
time is related

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.890
to the exponential
time, or if there's

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.090
a small prefactor and such,
that may depend on details.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.305
Yes, you're right.

00:47:40.305 --> 00:47:41.646
I've swept this under the rug.

00:47:53.502 --> 00:47:54.210
How are we doing?

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:54.710
Good.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:59.640
Let me just summarize.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.630
The dressed atom
picture has given us

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:06.200
two pieces of major insight
into the stimulated force.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:12.040
The first one is that the
atom experience is always

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.880
opposite forces in the
two dressed levels.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.940
And it is the
population imbalance

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:22.100
between the two dressed levels
which results in a net force.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.210
And this requires
either red detuning,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.890
then the force is
repulsive, or blue

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.710
detuning-- sorry,
red detuning then

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.834
the force is attractive,
or blue detuning then it's

00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:31.570
a force repulsive.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.650
Second, with this
time lag thing,

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:38.210
we understand that time
lag, non-adiabaticity,

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.380
is the way to get cooling.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.335
And the third thing we have
learned, when the atom does

00:48:43.335 --> 00:48:47.790
a radiative cascade the force--
when it goes from the upper

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:49.930
to the lower dressed
level-- the force

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.260
is suddenly reversing it's sign.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.070
And this causes fluctuations,
this shakes up atom,

00:48:56.070 --> 00:48:57.990
and this causes heating.

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:02.730
And this has nothing to do with
the other heating mechanism we

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:05.300
discussed earlier,
namely every time there

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.590
is spontaneous emission
there's a random recoil.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.740
In strong laser fields
the fluctuations

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.209
of the stimulated
force, which has

00:49:16.209 --> 00:49:17.875
nothing to do with
spontaneous emission,

00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:20.590
are much, much larger
than the photon recoil.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.630
So therefore for
strong laser fields,

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.450
it is this alternation
of the force when

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.730
atoms switch dressed
energy levels, which

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.460
is responsible for
most of the heating.

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.270
I want to come now to another
physical situation, which

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.580
is actually wonderful.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.860
You learn about
Sisyphus cooling.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.090
Everybody in cold atoms
speaks about Sisyphus

00:49:55.090 --> 00:50:00.070
cooling because it's a very,
very elegant cooling scheme.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.040
We usually apply in the
laboratory Sisyphus cooling

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.090
when we do polarization
gradient cooling.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.050
I will say you a
few things later.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.250
But this is much, much harder
to understand than the Sisyphus

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:16.250
cooling, which takes place
for a two level atom moving

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:19.790
through a blue
detuned standing wave.

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:21.850
So in other words,
I try to explain now

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.420
to you what Sisyphus cooling is.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.260
The relevant application
is multi-level polarization

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.600
gradient cooling, which
I give you an idea,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.480
but it's hard to fully describe.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:37.790
But here, in our current
discussion on the two level

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:42.590
atom interacting with one laser
beam, or one standing wave,

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.255
we find the simplest
physical realization

00:50:45.255 --> 00:50:47.320
of Sisyphus cooling.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:50.020
So just to make sure that you
are following the argument,

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:54.200
I have so far explained to you
why blue detuned light cools

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.580
in the limit of very
small velocities.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.200
Very small velocity means
we did a first order Taylor

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:04.600
expansion in this lag time.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.820
But now I want to discuss with
you a different regime, namely

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.730
that the atom moves
with a velocity such

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:18.040
that it can go up and down
several periods of the standing

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:22.060
wave before it does
spontaneous emission.

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.130
So before when we discussed
the friction coefficient,

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.950
the velocity was infinitesimal.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.620
But now I assume that
the velocity is such

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:31.980
that the atom can
surf a few waves

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.590
and then it will
spontaneously emit.

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:37.820
And let me assume that
we are blue detuned.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:43.970
So the atom, let's say here,
where the splitting is minimum,

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:45.940
well this is where
we don't have light.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.960
The generalized Rabi frequency
is just the detuning.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.560
So we are in a node
of the standing wave.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:54.220
And then the atom starts
in the ground state,

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.660
and it experiences
the periodic potential

00:51:57.660 --> 00:52:00.700
due to the standing wave.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.720
But we want to now ask, OK,
when will spontaneous emission

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.800
happen in this picture?

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.040
Well, it cannot happen here,
when the atom is in the ground

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.670
state, when there is not light.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:16.910
But where there is light, when
the atoms move to an anti-node,

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:21.560
there is a mixture, indicated
in red, of the excited state.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.950
So in other words, when an
atom does this roller coaster,

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.800
it will most likely emit a
photon-- either the carrier

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.190
or one of the
sidebands-- when it

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:37.290
is at the maximum of the
potential corresponding

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:42.740
to an anti-node where it
experiences the light.

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:46.180
OK, when the atom
emits on the carrier

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.790
it goes from the
upper dressed level

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.480
to the upper dressed level.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.920
Then sort of
nothing has happened

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.290
because the atom is in
the same dressed level.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:57.650
Let me now discuss the case
when something happens.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:02.130
And this is when the atom decays
from the upper dressed level

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.830
to the lower dressed level.

00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:08.580
And at least for weak excitation
the lower dressed level

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:11.410
corresponds to
the excited state.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.770
In other words, when
there is no light,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:17.190
the upper dressed
level was ground state,

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:21.160
the lower dressed
level is excited state.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.870
But what happens now is
actually interesting,

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.710
the atom had to
climb up the hill.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:29.720
But the spontaneous emission
to the lower dressed level

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.110
takes the atom to the bottom.

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:35.600
So you can see, on average,
it has climbed a hill here,

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.690
but now it is at the bottom.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:40.810
And now we're going to ask
how does the atom get out

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.850
of the lower dressed level?

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.490
Well, the lower
dressed level is mainly

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:50.830
excited-- is 100% excited
if there is no light.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:54.460
But if there is light, and
light means the generalized Rabi

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.920
frequency is larger, the
excited state has now in it

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.340
mixture of the ground
state because the light

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:03.580
mixes ground and excited state.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.475
So now, of course,
whenever there is red

00:54:06.475 --> 00:54:08.460
you can spontaneously emit.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.960
But there is a
probability that the atom

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.770
is more likely to emit when you
are in a purely excited state,

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:17.910
and not in a mixed state.

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:20.930
So now, talking about
the lower manifold,

00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.860
the atom does it's
roller coaster.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.960
It has a velocity
that it can cover

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.280
several periods of the
standing wave in one lifetime.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.150
But there is a higher
probability for the atom

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:36.060
now to emit when it
is on top of the hill.

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.610
So that's remarkable.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.710
We have the upper dressed level.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.450
We have the lower dressed level.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.100
The atom is doing
the roller coaster.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:48.950
But whenever it emits a
sideband, whenever it switches

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:52.300
state, it mainly
does it by emitting

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.450
at the top of the hill.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.300
And after the
spontaneous emission

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.000
it finds itself at the
bottom of the hill.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.950
So on average the atom
is climbing more up hills

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:05.510
than down hills.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:07.240
And this is called
Sisyphus cooling.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.070
I think you've all heard
about the Greek myth of King

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.670
Sisyphus, who was condemned.

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:15.770
He challenged the gods
and he got his punishment.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.920
And his punishment
was that he always

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.210
has to roll a stone up the hill.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:22.600
And when he's done
the stone falls down

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.740
and he has to roll the stone up.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.710
So in other words, we
have condemned the atoms

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:28.880
to the same verdict.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.480
They always have to
go up hill to work.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.810
Then they fall down
hill with the help

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.480
of a spontaneous photon.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.210
But then they have
to climb up hill.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:43.090
And it is the uphill climb where
the experience and net friction

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:47.720
force, which cools the
atoms down and reduces

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.650
their kinetic energy.

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:58.980
So this is Sisyphus cooling.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.640
And since I need it
in a few minutes,

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.950
I just wrote down for you, based
on this simple and wonderfully

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:10.515
elegant picture,
how much energy does

00:56:10.515 --> 00:56:12.230
the atom lose per unit time?

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.160
What is the cooling rate?

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.200
Well it's clear that
the cooling rate

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:20.120
comes when the atom switches
from one dressed energy

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.650
level to the next, because
nothing happens on the carrier.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.900
So it is the transition state
between dressed level one

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.920
and dressed level two.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.620
And then we multiply
with mu naught

00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:34.710
the depths of the optical
lattice, because it

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:39.440
is this energy difference which
is extracted from the atom.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.440
You may ask, OK what
is time limiting?

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.550
It's really the transition rate
form the first dressed level,

00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:55.510
which is mainly ground state, to
the other dressed level, which

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.550
is mainly exciting state.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.570
Because once the atom is in
this level, which is mainly

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.800
the excited state,
it will pretty much

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.900
do the next transition
at a rate which

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.500
corresponds to the
spontaneous emission rate.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:14.810
So in other words, if you're
not fully on resonance,

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.070
or if you're not
situated in laser power,

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:20.860
the rate, one, two, is slower
than the rate two, one.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:23.311
And therefore this rate
is the rate limiting step.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:32.690
Let me show you
just a few pictures.

00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:37.230
What I'm just explaining to
you was explored very early on,

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.450
just have to sort of put you
back that it was in the mid

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:44.640
'80s, '82, '83, '84, that people
developed [INAUDIBLE] slowing.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.880
It was in '85 that optical
molasses with red detuned light

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.230
was demonstrated
for the first time.

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:54.500
It was in '86 that
the dipole trap

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.290
was demonstrated by Steve Chu.

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.840
And in '87 that Steve
Chu and Dave Pritchard

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.790
introduced the
magneto optic trap.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:04.580
So the mid to late '80s
were fantastic times,

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:09.070
where one important technique
was realized and demonstrated.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:13.000
And this was actually the
first major experimental paper

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.920
of a new laser
cooling group, which

00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:18.460
was founded by Claude
Cohen-Tonnoudji at the Ecole

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.170
Normale Superieure in Paris.

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:25.440
And it was exactly about cooling
atoms with stimulated emission,

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.570
and this is blue molasses.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:31.210
And, I mean, you exactly
see here out of this paper,

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:32.685
the Sisyphus cooling mechanism.

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:40.860
And addressing the question
about red detuned light here,

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.950
this was actually
beam experiment.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.430
You head a blue
detuned standing wave,

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:48.260
and you were sending
an atomic beam through.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:51.350
And if this atomic
beam was cooled,

00:58:51.350 --> 00:58:54.550
the divergence of the
atomic beam was reduced.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:59.030
So this experiment had only
one blue detuned standing wave

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:02.630
and nothing else, because it
was not a trapping experiment.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.770
It was a beam
collimation experiment.

00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:08.670
And what is shown
here is that you

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:12.230
have the original
atomic beam profile.

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:17.920
And for blue detuned light
you make it narrower,

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.390
so this is cooling.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.210
Whereas for red detuned
light you have a defocusing,

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.500
which corresponds to heating.

00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:29.375
Any question?

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:50.150
I want to wrap up the discussion
of the stimulated light force

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:58.300
by discussing pretty
much everything again,

00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.430
but in the simplest
possibly limit.

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.160
That's actually
something I haven't

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.770
found in any text books.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:08.450
But when I derived
it for myself it

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.450
helped me to really
understand it.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.960
It's sort of the perturbative
result of the dressed atom

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:14.890
picture.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.640
So everything is simple.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.556
And by telling
you, look at this.

01:00:18.556 --> 01:00:20.601
You know this is
just EC stock shift.

01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:22.100
But in the dressed
atom picture it's

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.480
a generalized Rabi
frequency, you suddenly

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.600
understand the trivial
perturbative result

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.770
and how it translates into
the dressed atom picture.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:34.230
So what I'm presenting you
now in the next 10 minutes,

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:38.180
it provides a lot of
insight because it

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.490
connects simple pictures.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.280
So I'm discussing
things here in the limit

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.670
that the detuning is large.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:48.870
The detuning is larger
than the Rabi frequency,

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.020
and spontaneous emission
rate is the smallest

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.300
of the three rates.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.670
In that case, I can simply
do perturbation theory,

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:58.680
and I want to show you.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.940
Also, because this
is pedagogical,

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.950
I just want to show you how
the effects come together.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:07.230
I neglect all factors
on the order of unity.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:10.920
And I set h bar to 1.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.580
So let's assume we
have a standing wave.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.950
A standing wave is cosine KX.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.000
So we have an electric field.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.660
But we describe the electric
field with a Rabi frequency.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.200
So the Rabi frequency
forms a standing wave.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.430
Now what are the
two dressed states?

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.900
The dressed states 1 and
2 are the bare states,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.670
ground and excited state.

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.090
And then there a
perturbative mixture.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:43.440
And in first order
perturbation theory

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.720
we take the matrix
element over the detuning.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.520
So one dressed
state is the ground

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.980
state with a little bit
of excited stated mixed.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.300
The other dressed state is
the excited state, minus sign,

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.270
little bit of ground stated mix.

01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:00.717
These are our two dressed
states in the trivial limit

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.300
that we can apply
perturbation theory.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.840
What are now the
transition rates

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.850
between the two dressed states?

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.490
Well, we want to make
spontaneous emission

01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.480
from dressed state 1
to dressed state 2.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.880
We have to go from this small
mixture, which is the excited

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.480
stated mixture, to
the ground state here.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.600
So therefore we get the
product of the two amplitudes,

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.990
and then we multiply with gamma.

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:36.220
Of course, most of-- yeah.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.020
So this is the rate to
go from dressed state

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.210
1 to dressed state 2.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:43.720
What is the inverse rate to
go back from dressed state

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.640
2 to dressed state 1?

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.200
Well, you go from the excited
state to the ground state,

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.130
multiply with gamma,
and that's what you get.

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:58.400
Sure we have, in perturbation
theory, the coefficient is 1.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.620
It's only in higher
order perturbation theory

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:05.490
that the coefficient of the
bare state becomes less than 1.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.650
So isn't that simple?

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.200
We just discussed it with
all the cosine to the 4,

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.050
sine to the 4.

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.040
But now in perturbation
theory this

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.380
is the rate for going
from dressed state 1 to 2.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.910
And this is the rate to
go the other way around.

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:24.650
So what is our dressed
state potential?

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:26.900
Well, the dressed
state potential

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.300
is simply the EC
stock shift, which

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.770
is opposite for the ground
and for the excited state.

01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:36.920
And the EC stock shift
in perturbation theory

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:40.830
is nothing else than matrix
elements squared over detuning.

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:42.840
So this is mu naught.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.740
This is the potential of the
standing wave experienced

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.240
by the atom.

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:54.780
Now we want to do
Sisyphus cooling.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.330
What is the cooling rate
in Sisyphus cooling?

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:00.790
Well, remember,
Sisyphus cooling we

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:02.840
assume that the
atom is fast enough

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.250
to go over several
hills and valleys.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:13.610
The cooling rate is determined
by the rate at which the atoms

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.650
switch dressed levels
times mu naught.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:20.400
And I can scroll back, but mu
naught was the EC stock effect,

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.350
and gamma one, two was this
expression we had before.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:26.136
So therefore, in
the simple picture,

01:04:26.136 --> 01:04:27.510
while everything
is perturbative,

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:32.220
we have a nice expression
for the cooling rate.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.770
Well, now let's get something
non-trivial out of it.

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:40.070
What is the friction
coefficient?

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.690
Well, in many
situations I've plotted

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:46.710
for you, the force
versus velocity.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:51.200
Now I want to plot for you the
cooling rate versus velocity.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.030
That means its force
times velocity.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.670
And as we just discussed, when
the velocity is sufficiently

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:01.390
fast that the atom can go
over several hills and valleys

01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.030
in a spontaneous
lifetime, the cooling rate

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:07.590
will saturate
because it is limited

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.500
by the rate at which
the atom switches

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.530
between dressed levels.

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:17.630
But now the question
is, if we want

01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:20.180
to understand what
happens at low velocities,

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.560
how should we connect the two?

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:27.010
Well, you can say we know,
for analytical reasons,

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:30.850
that the force versus
velocity has to be linear.

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:34.030
So the cooling rate, which
is another power of velocity,

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.610
should be quadratic.

01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:39.160
And since I neglect all
factors on the order of unity,

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.330
this is now the force is
friction coefficient times V.

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:46.060
So therefore, what
I do in red here

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.080
is a parabolic
approximation, which

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.880
is alpha the cooling
rate times V squared.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.350
And now, if I want to
know what is alpha,

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:00.310
I just sort of
connect this parabola

01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:03.740
with the saturated
value, which I know.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:07.300
And I know the transition
happens at the velocity when

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.900
the atom moves further
than one wavelength in one

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.020
spontaneous emission time.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.620
So therefore, based on
this very physical picture,

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:18.970
and on the inside how low
velocities and high velocities

01:06:18.970 --> 01:06:23.820
connect together, I can actually
obtain the friction coefficient

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.210
in this blue detuned standing
wave by taking the cooling rate

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:33.680
and dividing it by the velocity
at which the atom moves

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.590
one wavelength per
spontaneous emission time.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.190
And if I do that, I
obtain this result,

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.650
which I have already
quoted earlier to you

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.950
from the paper of
Cohen-Tonnoudji and Jean

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:49.980
Dalibard.

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.040
It looks fairly non-trivial with
power to the 6, power to the 5.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.362
But this is now the simple
perturbative results

01:06:57.362 --> 01:06:58.570
for the friction coefficient.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.360
Now we have the
friction coefficient.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.580
Let's take it further.

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:09.420
I want to give you, in
this perturbative limit,

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.510
I want to give you the
momentum diffusion coefficient.

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:15.570
And then we will find in
the perturbative limit what

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:18.480
is the lowest temperature
to which we can cool.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.050
So pretty much
I'll do everything

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.550
as we've done before, but I use
the simple perturbative limit.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:34.450
So again, in order to calculate
the diffusion coefficient--

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.740
the momentum diffusion
coefficient-- and the heating

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.490
we need the fluctuations
of the force.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:43.600
And now, just remember, we
are in the perturbative limit.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.510
The atom is mainly
in the ground state,

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:51.630
which is the upper
dressed level.

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.620
It has only a little
excited stated mixture,

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:56.760
so it will mainly
stay in this state.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.350
But then with this excited
stated mixture and this,

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:03.610
power of the Rabi frequency,
it makes the transition

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:05.210
to the other dressed state.

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:09.030
But the other dressed state
is almost 100% excited state.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.040
So it will leave the
other dressed state

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.990
almost immediately.

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:16.540
So this could be a Quantum
Monte Carlo wave function result

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.290
that the atom
experiences the force

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:21.460
in the upper dressed level.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.689
Then it goes to the lower
dressed level, which is mainly

01:08:24.689 --> 01:08:28.060
the excited state, just
4 times 1 over gamma.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.939
And then it returns.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:35.340
So the picture now is that the
atom for almost all the time

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.410
experiences the steady
state force, which

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.130
is the blue dashed line.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.029
And there are only, when it
goes to the other dressed state,

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:48.090
these small spikes where
the force has changed sign.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:52.250
And if you now calculate the
fluctuations of the force--

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:58.750
the integral of f square--
once we calculate the square

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:02.170
the small deviations
from the average force

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.439
does not contribute.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:06.689
What contributes are the spikes.

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:15.399
So all I do is now I take the
4 square in one of the spikes.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.220
And the force is nothing else
than the derivat-- remember

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.580
we have a standing
wave a mu naught.

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:31.390
The derivative of the
standing wave is the force.

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:33.790
But if you have a
sinusoid lattice

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:36.810
the force is K times the
amplitude of the lattice.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:41.779
I square it, so this
is the spike squared.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:43.960
Then I have to multiply
with the time 1

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.740
over gamma, over which
the force stays the same.

01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.029
So this is, you can see, the
correlation time of the force.

01:09:53.029 --> 01:09:55.030
But then I have
to multiply, also,

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.810
when I do an average over
many, sort of, you can see,

01:09:57.810 --> 01:10:02.440
trajectories, I have to
average over the probability

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:08.760
that-- I have to multiply
with the probability

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.490
that the atom is in
the dressed state

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:13.390
1 and not in the
dressed state 2.

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:15.190
It may take you a
few minutes just

01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:17.310
to think about
the combinatorics.

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:20.790
But in the end all I do
is I take the 4 square,

01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:24.650
I multiply with correlation time
when the atom is in state 2,

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.810
and get the probability
that the atom is in state 2.

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:31.560
And when the atom is in
state 1, in my ensemble,

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.970
it doesn't contribute at
all, because in state 1

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:35.860
you're so close to
the average force

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.280
that it doesn't contribute
with the fluctuation.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.780
Anyway, it's simple but subtle.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.860
But it's a one-liner.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.170
And now based on
this perturbative

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:52.010
picture we have perturbatively
exact an expression

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.040
for the heating rate.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.000
But now it's
interesting, the rate

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:04.580
gamma one, two, the rate to
switch between dressed energy

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:11.230
levels always also appears in
the expression for the friction

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:12.660
coefficient.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:17.620
So therefore, if
you're now asking

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:22.430
what is the ultimate temperature
to which we can cool the atom?

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:26.030
It is the ratio of this
analytic result for the heating

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:28.340
coefficient divided
by the analytic result

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.760
for the friction coefficient.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:33.450
Pretty much everything
cancels out, and what remains

01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:35.940
is mu naught.

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.300
And this is a remarkable result.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.880
It's highly non-trivial, and I
really enjoyed showing to you

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.320
how simply it can be
derived by-- it's really

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.810
just perturbation theory.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:50.730
But you have to put in the right
concepts from the dressed atom

01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:52.100
picture.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.940
So what we learn
is the following.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:57.780
If you have a
standing wave, and we

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:01.770
cool with a stimulated
force, the lowest temperature

01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:05.652
is-- with a prefactor,
which I haven't calculated--

01:12:05.652 --> 01:12:08.330
the amplitude of
the standing wave.

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:13.120
And that means that it is
impossible to ever localize

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:15.820
atoms within a standing wave.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:19.900
Laser cooling cannot be used
to create atoms in an optical

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.790
lattice.

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:23.270
The temperature of
the atoms is always

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:26.330
comparable to the
depths of the lattice.

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:27.950
So therefore the
atoms will never

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.691
be localized in one
well of the lattice.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.550
And this is generally valid.

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.650
The assumption we
have made here is

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.900
that we have a two level atom.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.360
A lot of you work with
atoms to optical lattices.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.040
And you often use evaporative
cooling, take a Bose Einstein

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:49.110
condensate, which is pretty much
a [INAUDIBLE] temperature put

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.490
it in optical lattice.

01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:55.160
But before '95, people studied
laser cooling and atoms

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.700
in optical lattices.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.760
And this was only
possible because atoms

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:02.220
can be cooled to
lower temperatures

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:06.370
than we have derived here
because they are not two level

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:07.660
atoms.

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.760
So laser cooling
in a standing wave,

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:14.350
localization of atoms in a
standing wave by laser cooling,

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:18.811
is only possibly by physics
beyond what we have discussed.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.310
Colin?

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:23.675
AUDIENCE: If you use something
like Raman's sideband cooling,

01:13:23.675 --> 01:13:26.342
you could-- like, yeah,
you'd kind of need

01:13:26.342 --> 01:13:29.980
three levels for that, but
you eliminated the third.

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.890
Really, it's just that
it's two levels, right?

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:36.430
PROFESSOR: If you do
Raman's sideband cooling,

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:39.580
he posted-- I think,
in the next 10 minutes,

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.440
I cover what you want to see.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.360
Because now it involves
two ground states.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.630
And I want to show you, if
you have two ground states,

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:51.120
to Hyper fine-- Raman's
sideband cooling-- if you have

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.180
two different ground
states there is no physics.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.230
And I briefly want
to touch upon that.

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.790
We'll just kind of
fill in one thing here,

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.430
and it is, well, if
you take everything

01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:05.590
I've told you seriously,
you would say OK, too bad.

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:08.110
We cannot localize atoms
in an optical lattice

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.390
because the temperature
is always comparable

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.140
to the amplitude of the lattice.

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:17.880
But by making the lattice
smaller and smaller and smaller

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.050
I can reach lower and
lower temperatures.

01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:24.920
Well, yes, the some
extent that's possible.

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.240
But what we have done here
is we've done approximations.

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:31.160
We've only focused on
the stimulated force.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.440
We have not looked
at the recoil which

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.620
comes in spontaneous emission.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:39.780
And therefore, the moment we
would make the optical lattice

01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.720
smaller than gamma then
we have to include heating

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.560
by the spontaneous light force.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.800
And the result will be that
blue molasses cannot reach lower

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.850
temperatures than
red detuned molasses.

01:14:53.850 --> 01:14:56.530
And for red detuned
molasses we have already

01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.040
discussed the famous Doppler
limit, which is gamma over 2.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.360
So that's what I
wanted to present

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.560
to you with the
stimulated force.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.820
First, a more general
discussion using the real

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.510
dressed atom picture.

01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:22.194
But now in the end, to fly
over using sort of the baby

01:15:22.194 --> 01:15:24.610
dressed atom picture, which
is simple perturbation theory.

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:39.010
OK, so we've done the hard work.

01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:42.260
Now we want to have some
fun discussing the physics.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:45.970
And I'm realizing I've only
five, six, seven minutes left.

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:48.630
I want to discuss three points.

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:54.100
One is I want to give you all
the different pictures to find

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:56.220
the potential of a dipole
trap, because we've

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.110
encountered several.

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:00.930
The second thing is I want
to have a discussion with you

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:05.260
if the stimulated force is due
to electric or magnetic forces.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.420
And eventually, and we'll
be running out of time,

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:11.120
I have to do that on
Wednesday to discuss

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.440
the question of
energy conservation.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.630
If you cool the atoms
where does the energy go?

01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:25.620
So if you use the
stimulated force,

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.970
it gives rise to
dipole potential.

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:30.870
And using the Optical Bloch
Equations or the dressed atom

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:34.340
picture, we found
this expression

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.790
for the dipole potential.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:47.590
And there are at least four ways
how we could have derived it.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:51.050
One is the Optical Bloch
Equations, we did that.

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:53.020
The dressed atom picture,
we did that today.

01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:59.100
Another picture is very
straightforward and simple.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:02.370
It just says that
the potential is

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:05.560
the electric
potential of a dipole.

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.570
And then all you have to know
is from the EC polarizability,

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:15.740
if you drive an atom
with a laser field

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.510
below resonance--
I mean that's just

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.045
harmonic oscillator--
below resonance

01:17:21.045 --> 01:17:25.170
the harmonic oscillator is
in phase with the force.

01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:28.670
Above resonance, if you drive
a harmonic oscillator fast,

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:32.350
the response of the harmonic
oscillator is in opposite,

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:33.980
it's out of phase.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.310
So therefore, if your
potential is minus the E,

01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:41.310
you are in phase-- it is a
negative attractive potential.

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:44.160
If the harmonic oscillator
is driven above resonance

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.760
there is another
minus sign, you get

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.500
plus the E, which becomes
a repulsive potential.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.574
So it's, look and
say, just the physics

01:17:51.574 --> 01:17:52.615
of a harmonic oscillator.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.810
There's one thing I like,
which is sometimes not

01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:01.210
taught in an atomic
physics course

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:05.945
because it is the force on a
macroscopic dielectric object.

01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:12.640
So let's assume we
have an atom-- no, we

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.660
don't have an atom.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:15.750
We have something
which is bigger.

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:18.340
Let's assume a tiny
polystyrenes sphere.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.430
You can assume a
small sphere of glass.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.420
What happens if I
shine a laser beam

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:27.200
on a small sphere of glass?

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.420
Well, let me assume that
the laser beam is-- well,

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.670
if the laser beam hits
this sphere right on,

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.670
it's symmetric,
there is no force.

01:18:40.670 --> 01:18:43.540
So what we want to do is we
want to have a laser beam, shown

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.560
here by this arrow,
which has a maximum here

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.580
so the profile is like this.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:52.310
And we want to discuss
whether this sphere is sucked

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:54.870
into the laser beam, this
would be an attractive force,

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:57.170
or whether this
sphere is repelled.

01:18:57.170 --> 01:18:59.459
And all we want
to use is optics,

01:18:59.459 --> 01:19:00.500
the optics of refraction.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:06.450
When we have a laser beam
which is weak, medium, strong,

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.460
strong here, and
for red detuning

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.640
we have an index of refraction
which is larger than 1.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.470
So the sphere acts like a lens.

01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:17.980
So that leaves those
photons up and in,

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.670
and those photons up and in.

01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:25.330
And when a photon is bent in,
the momentum of the photon

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:26.300
has changed.

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.150
And the momentum, of course,
the opposite momentum transfer,

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:31.870
is imparted to the sphere.

01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:36.320
So in this case, we
have sort of-- we

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:39.470
have more photons in this
part of the laser beam, which

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:42.500
are bent up, than
photons are bent down.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.670
And this means the net
force is that the sphere is

01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:48.110
sucked into the laser beam.

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:50.790
And if you go for
blue detuned light,

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:53.250
where the index of
refraction is smaller than 1,

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:55.690
it is the opposite.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:58.030
So the picture which
we have discussed here

01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:01.010
was for atoms form
microscopic objects.

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:05.700
But you have, actually,
similar physics

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:09.810
of a stimulated force for
mesoscopic and macroscopic

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:10.740
objects.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:15.170
And then what matters whether
you trap or anti-trap,

01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:17.870
is whether the index of
refraction is larger than 1

01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:20.090
or smaller than one.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:23.350
And you know, two level
system for blue detuned light

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:26.000
has an index of refraction
which is smaller than 1.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.880
And for red detuned
light our atomic clouds

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:32.520
have an index of refraction
which is larger than 1.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:36.210
But this picture that you
can use the same set up,

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:38.650
the same focus beam
and a similar dipole

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:43.250
force to trap larger
objects is actually

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:47.940
exploited in a different
field of physics,

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.160
in biology, in the form
of optical tweezers.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:54.210
When actually in
the early '80s, when

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:57.850
Steve Chu came to Bell Labs
and had discussions with Art

01:20:57.850 --> 01:21:03.380
Ashkin, they actually discussed
optical trapping, both of atoms

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:09.590
and both of biological objects,
little microspheres, or cells.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:13.780
And it's sort of remarkable
that both approaches

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:16.230
were realized within
the same year.

01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:18.440
So atoms were trapped in '86.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.740
And macroscopic objects
were manipulated,

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.670
I think it's exactly
the same year.

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:26.630
And as you know,
the optical tweezers

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:32.030
is now an important technology
in biology and biophysics.

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.970
For instance, you can
focus a laser beam

01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:37.660
and manipulate objects
within a living cell.

01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:44.650
So I think I should stop here,
but maybe take your questions.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.030
Then let me conclude
with an outlook.

01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:57.490
We have this week and next week,
and then the semester is over.

01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:01.750
So this week we have
one class on Wednesday.

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:04.190
I want to finish this
discussion and teach

01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:07.560
about magnetic trapping
and evaporative cooling.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.840
And the last week, because
of a makeup class on Friday,

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.970
we have three more classes,
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:15.970
By the way, I just learned
that the Friday class

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:18.170
is in these room.

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:19.940
And on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday we

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.070
talk about, well,
it's really featured

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:26.070
pick about Bose gasses, lecture
one, Fermi gasses, lecture two.

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:29.350
And the third lecture is
about quantum logic with ions.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.050
OK, see you Wednesday.
