WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
So, good afternoon.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.940
Let me start by
presenting something

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.960
I learned today during lunch.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.720
I had lunch with
three colleagues

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.330
and we discussed entanglement.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.560
And, well, I'm telling you the
story a little bit differently,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.404
but the question
which came up is

00:00:46.404 --> 00:00:47.820
you have two
harmonic oscillators.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.010
One harmonic oscillator
is in the ground state,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.290
one is in the excited state.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.970
And then you have the
harmonic oscillators

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.640
where the excitation
is here and there.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.660
Is that an entangled
state or not?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.335
It's a real question.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.250
I want to think about it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.831
AUDIENCE: What's the physical
nature of these oscillators?

00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.604
AUDIENCE: Can you
distinguish these?

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:37.520
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: OK.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.130
Who's working with ion types?

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.360
There's a few people I know,
a few ion types here at MIT.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.444
If this is ion-- what is
a good ion? [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:50.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.943
WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
Strontium plus, OK.

00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:56.560
So if it's strontium plus, which
can be in the quantum state v

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.090
equals 1 or v equals 0, and you
have another strontium plus ion

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.940
in a second ion
[INAUDIBLE]-- and it can be

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.590
in the [INAUDIBLE]
first excited state--

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.110
isn't it wonderfully entangled?

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.430
Two systems far away.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.360
You can manipulate them, you
have two particles, and then

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.490
two quantum states.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.460
It fulfills with flying
colors all the qualities

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.710
you want to see of
an entangled state.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.120
But now I can say, if I call
this harmonic oscillator,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.010
I have two optical fibers.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.890
And you know, a single-mode
fiber defines a harmonic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.270
oscillator, namely the
electromagnetic field

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.000
in the single mode.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.880
And if I put one
excitation into this fiber,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.550
I have a photon here and
here I have zero photon.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.660
Or here, I have one photon
and I have zero photons.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.350
So if you look at
the fiber, you would

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.550
say the fiber has two states.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.290
It can have an
excitation or not.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.470
And if you use now that
approach, you would say,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.760
well, I have an entangled
state between two fibers.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.920
However, I can realize
exactly that state

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.070
by having a beam splitter,
by having one photon coming

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.750
on the beam splitter,
and then the photon

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.210
is coupled into
one of the fibers.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.700
So in other words,
there is an ambiguity

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.990
which I want to point out
between whether you have

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.880
a state of one particle--
one photon into two fibers--

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.000
or whether you have
two fibers which

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.220
can be in two different states.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.430
So there is often an ambiguity,
what do you call the state

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.470
and what do you
call the particle?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.840
So at our lunch
conversation it came up

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.070
in a somewhat different context,
but people would actually

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.070
say that splitting
a photon-- sending

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.480
one photon across
a beam splitter

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.240
fulfills, if you
interpret it in that way,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.350
fulfills the definition
of entanglement.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.680
I know our wiki page and
Professor Schwan would probably

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.529
not agree, but welcome to
the frontier of research

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.990
where different people
have different opinions

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:23.950
and certain definitions
are still being worked out.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.580
But there is one
thing which is real.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.420
We have here two different
harmonic oscillators,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.340
ions oscillating in a harmonic
oscillator potential or photons

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.940
in a single mode.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.470
I remember from 15
years ago, there

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.550
were papers that show if you
put the ion in a cavity or such,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.640
you can really
transfer the quantum

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.290
state from the single
photon from this harmonic

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.520
oscillator-- the
harmonic oscillator

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.710
of the electromagnetic
field-- to the harmonic

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.140
oscillator of the ion.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.960
So if we want to hold
onto the definition,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.090
which I'm not sure if you should
that this is a single photon,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.300
a single particle
cannot be entangled,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.655
well I know and people reminded
me at lunch the there is

00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:18.220
a protocol to [INAUDIBLE] map
the single photon in the two

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.910
modes after the beam splitter
onto an entangled state

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.860
of ions.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.790
So if you focus here on
the photon and say a single

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.100
particle cannot be entangled,
you're facing the problem that

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.975
there is a protocol which would
transfer something which you

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:37.214
call not entangled to
something which is entangled.

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:38.130
I hope you enjoy that.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.400
It's not clear what
is the particle

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.700
and what is the excitation.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.741
There's really ambiguity.

00:05:46.257 --> 00:05:46.840
Any questions?

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.100
OK, so that's what part
of my lunch was about.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.140
I thought since I wanted to
remind you of the schedule.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.670
In a few hours I will
actually be heading to Europe

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.750
and say there for next week, so
therefore no classes next week.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.100
We've already made up for one
class with the Friday class,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.660
and the week later we
also have three classes

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.660
and we've made up for the week.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.640
I've just put down here
for you the PSET schedule.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.300
I kept the Monday due date so
there is one PSET every week.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.385
We have wonderful
material for those PSETs.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.510
The due date is now for this
week not the day of the class,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.110
but you will find a way to
get your homework delivered

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.800
or email it to the TA.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.820
Any questions about schedule?

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.430
I think that has been
clearly announced.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.030
There was a question
in the last class

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.650
about if you have
a density matrix,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.670
if any arbitrary density
matrix can be regarded

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.800
as a partial trace
of a pure state.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.190
I was not immediately
clear-- I thought it was,

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.340
but I wasn't sure.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.610
But the proof is so simple
that it fits on three lines.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.450
You can simply take
a density matrix,

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.670
you can double up
the Hilbert space,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.760
and define our pure state
in a Hilbert space of twice

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.260
the dimension, and
you immediately

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.190
see that this density
matrix is the partial trace

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.450
of a pure state.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.990
So therefore, if you
want, you can always

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.760
say the density matrix is sort
of entangled-- you are entitled

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.210
to the opinion that the density
matrix always originated

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.040
into a pure state, but the
entanglement [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.680
to the other subsystem
have been broken.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.053
And I showed you last
class that if you

00:07:57.053 --> 00:08:00.750
are one of the Bell states,
the most entangled states

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.810
in a fully-entangled state
between two particles,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.880
but you just look
at one particle,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.170
one particle isn't just a random
states with a density matrix

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.195
which is a unity matrix.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:25.680
Now let's get back to
where we left it on Monday.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.390
I introduced to
you-- and I just want

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:32.490
to remind you of that, because
[INAUDIBLE] I introduced

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.630
to you this famous phenomenon
of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.380
which is the
following situation.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.670
If you have 50/50 beam split and
you have two identical photons,

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.080
you will never get
single photons out.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.270
The photons are bosons.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.650
They want to be together.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.090
And so you will always
get two photons,

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.620
but you don't throw on which
side of the beam splitter.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.070
Now, this is important
because we can now

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.860
use the Hong-Ou-Mandel
interferences

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.170
effect to entangle atoms.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.440
So the element we will take
from this beam splitter

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.150
is the following.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.990
We will have atoms emit photons.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:20.090
But then we create
entanglement probablistically.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.020
When these photons have passed
through beam splitters--

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.740
and I tell you
everything about it--

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.550
and both detectors make a click,
if both detectors make a click

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.360
you know for sure
that the two photons

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.600
at the input of the beam
splitter were not identical.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.140
Because if they were
identical, only one detector

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.730
receives light.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:44.200
So we will actually used
this home interference

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:50.540
to project out photon states
where the two photons are not

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.060
identical because they have
difference polarization.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.770
Any questions?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.473
Yes?

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.397
AUDIENCE: Does [INAUDIBLE]
include the phase.

00:10:01.397 --> 00:10:03.802
Like if you were in phase
lab with those photons,

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:04.764
would it be still?

00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:10.580
WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
Frequency very important.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.700
Polarization important,
timing is important.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.833
A single photon has no phase.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.860
It's a global phase.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.030
And if you have
many single photons,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.330
your many photon state
is a product state

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.970
of those single photon states.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.540
And all of the
individual phases--

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.980
if you want to hold onto
this concept for a second--

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.070
just become one big
multiplicity phase.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:38.800
Yes, Nancy?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.640
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: Oh,
everything [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.465
easy experiment.

00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:52.370
But I think the beam splitter
is probably not-- I mean,

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.860
beam splitter is a piece of
wonderfully polished optics.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.000
And in Germany and
elsewhere, people

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.250
have really learned how
to do exquisite optics.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.370
I don't think you're
limited by optics right now.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.090
What I would think
is difficult, if you

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.660
have two photons
on a beam splitter,

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.950
they have to be in
the same spatial mode.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.260
So if you have to fibers and the
fibers are not fully aligned,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.640
or you have another mode
which is [INAUDIBLE],

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.420
or if you have a lens which is
distorting your Gaussian mode,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.700
you mix other modes
in so all this

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.350
creates non-distinguishability.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.376
But I think equality
of optics is probably

00:11:24.376 --> 00:11:25.500
the least of your concerns.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.880
So actually for today, because
I'm out of town next week,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.990
I want you to have
something to think about it,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.675
I already pre-wrote
some of the slides.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.520
So I can go a little bit faster.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.290
Give me feedback.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.840
If you think I'm going too
fast, I will not do it again.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.100
But I felt I can probably
have a reasonable speed

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.510
by making annotations to
what I've already prepared.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.910
So the situation
is the following,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.940
we want to entangle two atoms.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.140
We have two atoms which
are both in the excited

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.520
state in the scatter light.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.100
And they can go to two
different ground states.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.150
Think about two different
type of ion states.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.550
I call them U and
D, Up and Down.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.790
And when because
of selection rules,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.112
one state can be reached
with one polarization.

00:12:35.112 --> 00:12:37.570
The other state can be reached
with the other polarization.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:42.520
And I call this polarization H
and V, horizontal and vertical.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.890
In reality, this will be
circular polarization,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.210
so you may want to transform
from linear to circular

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:48.870
after the fact.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.250
But for just the
discussion right now,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.270
I assume that horizontal
polarization leads

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.460
to one state,
vertical polarization

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.190
leads to the other state.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:03.620
So therefore, if you have
two atoms-- and Chris Monroe

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.120
in Michigan did the
experiment where he really

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.240
had two different
vacuum chambers with two

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.020
different ions, they
both emitted photons,

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.627
and then the photons came
together on a beam splitter.

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:15.960
So that's what you should
sort of have in mind, two ions

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.980
here and there.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.760
They both emit a photon.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:26.820
And after the have
both emitted a photon,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.450
each ion is in a
superposition before you

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.750
make any measurements.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.360
It can be in up with
a horizontal photon

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.400
or it can be in down
with a vertical photon.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.520
So that is the state of the ion.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.735
And so we have two of those.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.560
And then you want
to detect photons.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.310
And the goal now is by
using beam splitters and all

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.460
those tricks, that the
detection of photons

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.180
and the outcome of a measurement
will project this product

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.440
state of two atoms
with their photon

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.300
into a bell state for the atoms.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.280
So measurement on
photons can take

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.380
two atoms which were
completely remote,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.070
had nothing to do
with each other,

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:12.390
and suddenly they're
in a Bell state.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.000
And this is done by the
probabalistic measurement.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:37.130
And so let's-- so
lets develop it.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:55.660
Our initial state is UH plus DV.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.390
This is system one.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:07.360
And we have the direct product
with our second ion trap

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.600
apparatus which
has done the same.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.610
The ion has emitted a photon and
we don't know anything about it

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.530
at this point.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.086
And now it is important, if you
want to have entanglement you

00:15:18.086 --> 00:15:19.710
cannot go and measure
the polarization,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.045
because this would project an
individual ion into a state

00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:24.750
and would not have entangled it.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:30.280
So what we are doing is we
are allowing the two photons,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.250
one photon here,
another photon here,

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.360
they come together
at a beam splitter.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.700
Actually, before I do it let me
just perform the product here.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.380
So what we get is-- well,
it's just multiplying it out.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.900
UU for the atoms,
HH for the photons.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:07.986
UDHV plus DUVH, plus DDVV.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.790
So what you want
to do is we want

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.110
to send this beam--
the photons of course,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.400
the atoms stay put--
onto a beam splitter.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.050
Now, I can do it more rigorously
by keeping all the terms

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.080
until the end of
the calculation.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.390
But I hope it's rather obvious
that we want to have it--

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.200
if we want to send
it on a beam splitter

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.080
and then we want to detect
that both detectors make click.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.750
That requires the photons
to be distinguishable.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.760
So therefore, those
two terms will not

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.670
contribute because the photons
have the same polarization.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:04.599
So we are now using a
protective measurement.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.985
We want to find out what is
the wave function of the atoms.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:26.640
Measurement of one photon
in the modes A and B,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.040
which are the output modes
of our beam splitter.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:45.310
So it needs one more line.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.610
The output of the
beam splitter is--

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:59.920
so I'm only focusing now on the
two terms which can give rise

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.660
to two clicks at the
two different detectors.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:12.000
So I will factor out UD.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.520
And now we have the two photons
hitting the beam splitter

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.170
and each photon goes into
a 50/50 superposition.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.360
So I take know this
horizontal photon.

00:18:30.837 --> 00:18:33.045
And since we don't mess
around with the polarization,

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:37.010
it's still a horizontal
photon, but the photon

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:46.620
can be now in mode B or in
mode A in one of the output

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.080
modes of the beam splitter.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:19:02.610
And I label that
as 0,1 plus 1,0.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:11.640
Now for the second photon, it
had a vertical polarization,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.190
so it's a vertical photon.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.630
The second photon is coming
onto the beam splitter

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.156
in the other input port,
because we have taken the two

00:19:23.156 --> 00:19:24.780
photons from two
different experiments,

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.404
from two different
experimental setups,

00:19:26.404 --> 00:19:30.250
and now we combine
them so that we'll also

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.830
be now in a superposition
of 0,1 and 1,0.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.775
But you know that one mode
transforms with a plus sign

00:19:37.775 --> 00:19:40.400
and the other mode transforms at
the beam splitter with a minus

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:40.899
sign.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.450
So that's how you should
look at those terms.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.500
And of course, from of
this here, from this term

00:19:51.500 --> 00:20:05.090
we get something very
analogous, 0,1 plus 1,0.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.850
And for the other
spatial mode, the minus

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.540
sign from the beam
splitter, 1,0.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.110
OK, now we are done.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.690
Now we are detecting photons.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.620
So we want to look at this
wave function and ask,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.830
what happens if in port
A-- the output port--

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.522
we find one horizontal photon,
and in B it must be vertical

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.480
because the photons have
to be distinguishable.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.650
So where do we have
one photon in mode A?

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.370
In horizontal it is here.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.540
And here it is this
product with the minus sign

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.180
where we have-- no,
sorry, the plus sign.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.160
Here we have one
photon in the vertical,

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.270
so this is with a plus sign.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.400
But we have a
second possibility,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:11.470
one photon in mode A horizontal
happens here with a minus sign.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:17.090
And one photon in mode
B vertical happens here.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:21.710
So in other words, form
the term which gives rise

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.680
to this measurement process,
we have a plus UD here,

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.680
and because of the
minus sign, a minus DU.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.600
So therefore, if
you would detect

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.020
the photon with the polarization
at this point, which

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:45.030
we don't do, this polarization
gives rise to UD minus DU.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.870
We have a second possibility to
have a click at each detector,

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.955
and this is when we reverse
the two polarizations.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.390
But in this case, you can
just add the wave function.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:09.126
You get the atomic state,
the sign doesn't matter.

00:22:09.126 --> 00:22:11.750
So you have to measurements, two
possibilities in polarization,

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.705
but they both have
the same outcome.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:23.730
They generate this state, so
the result of all that is I've

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:31.510
shown you that the two
atoms are left now in--

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:35.520
and now I put back in the
correct normalization--

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.850
in one of the Bell states.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:48.140
So whenever you detect the two
single photons in coincidence

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.410
on both counters,
at that moment you

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.320
know what you have is
an entangled state,

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.480
a Bell state of atoms.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.660
Now, the big issue
here is efficiency.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.360
Your photon detectors
are not highly efficient.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.825
And I was sort of only
looking at combinations

00:23:08.825 --> 00:23:11.610
where we have this
double detection.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.760
Most components of
the wave function

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.430
will give the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.210
The two photons go in one way.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.890
So therefore, you have
to prepare your system,

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.760
have photons emitted,
and in most of the cases

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.280
you will not get
the state you want,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.220
so you have to keep on trying.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.590
And usually those
experiments are

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:35.430
heavily limited by the very,
very dismal success probability

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.670
of creating the state you want.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.550
And when you want to extend
it, not just to two atoms

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.520
entangled, to three atoms
and four atoms entangled,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.400
then you get a smaller
number to the power n

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.910
for your efficiency.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.990
So this probabalistic
preparation doesn't scale up,

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.410
but it is a very simple scheme,
it's a very powerful scheme,

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:07.700
and it has been used to create
teleportation of atomic states

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:13.555
and do some tests of Bells
inequality and the EPR Paradox.

00:24:16.592 --> 00:24:21.990
And here is the
abstract of a paper.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:27.280
So-- well, this was just
2008, so just a few years ago.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:37.940
And what you see here is
that here are one meter apart

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.480
two [INAUDIBLE] ions.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.820
They emit light.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.920
The light goes through
an optical fiber.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.930
And now, after
the beam splitter,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.940
when you detect one
photon you don't

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.730
know which ion has
emitted the photon.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:01.760
So this is exactly the
setup which I described.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.990
Of course, in an
optical fiber you

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:15.540
have the two good polarizations
are horizontal and vertical

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.120
in the polarization
maintaining fiber.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.710
So therefore, the
light which originally

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.840
was emitted in a circular base
is-- angular momentum selection

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.324
rules-- transformed into
linearly polarized light

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:27.240
using the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:33.280
Any questions?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.840
Yes, Nikki?

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] create
the initial state [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.011
atom [INAUDIBLE] one
state [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:44.011 --> 00:25:48.252
make sure that the ions
state is a pure state, not

00:25:48.252 --> 00:25:49.999
a mixed state, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.630
WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
Good question.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.440
So first of all, if
you think about it

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.470
you will discover more and
more experimental challenges.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.390
What people must have used there
is sort of a storm laser pulse

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.530
that you have more than
overkill to make sure

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.890
that with a very,
very short time window

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.310
both ions are excited.

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:19.690
The ions are in a pure state,
and then they emit a photon.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.310
And if you have
one system prepared

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:29.150
which can emit a photon, but it
has a branching ratio of 50/50,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.470
if it's an isolated
system, it will

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.740
have a superposition state of
photon in one polarization--

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.600
let's say a sigma plus photon
going to a magnetic quantum

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.890
number state m equals
plus 1 and a sigma

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.360
minus photon going
to m equals minus 1.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.060
And this is a pure state.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.620
The mixture only comes
if you're not careful.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.120
If you have a
magnetic field and you

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.930
don't shield your
magnetic field well,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.580
or you have some
magnetized materials

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.520
and you were not
aware of it, then that

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.360
means that you get
different phase shifts which

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.090
you can't calculate for, so
now you have a random phase.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.120
You don't know it, and
if you have ignorance

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.960
you have to trace out or you
have to average over the phase.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.210
And then your pure state
becomes a density matrix.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.365
But the quantum
mechanical process itself

00:27:19.365 --> 00:27:23.720
of a particle having
different branching ratios

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.710
is a pure system.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.280
It undergoes unitary
time evolution,

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.930
and it stays in a pure state.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:37.700
And the state which is
populated by two ions, both

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.330
emitting a photon
simultaneously,

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:46.630
is exactly the state I've
written down for you.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.030
But you're absolutely right
that decoherence is an issue.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.620
You have to be very careful
with magnetic fields.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.820
You probably want to work with
atoms which are non-magnetic.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.450
So you want to where the spin
is only a nuclear spin which

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.650
is much less sensitive with
a magnetic field, and so on.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.895
Other questions?

00:28:06.895 --> 00:28:11.780
AUDIENCE: So as soon as
both detectors click, then

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:16.340
[INAUDIBLE] so that
you can no longer

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.820
make use of that entanglement?

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.540
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: No, no wait.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.970
Look here.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.430
We have a state which has atoms
in a state and two photons.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.070
So this state has
four particles.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:36.980
We detect two particles
which are the photons.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.060
And the atoms are untouched.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.170
The atoms are then afterwards
in an entangled state.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.980
So we have a bigger
system, we do a measurement

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.880
of part of the
system, and we have

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.320
arranged things in
the skillful way

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.910
that the moment we know the
outcome of the measurement

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.980
is such and such, we
know in which quantum

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.280
state the rest of the system is.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.560
And this protocol
means that the atoms

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.900
are left after the
outcome of the measurement

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.570
is such and such, the atoms
are left in a pure Bell state.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.200
OK I've used the word
Bell, Bell states

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.710
so often, I think it's time
to talk about what Mr. Bell is

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:34.225
famous for, namely
the Bell's Inequality.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.730
So I said already
in the introduction

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.460
for the quantumness of
light and entanglement

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.910
that it is the EPR Paradox
in the Bell's inequalities

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:56.970
which a lot of people,
including myself, think

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.250
is the deeper essence
of quantum physics.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:05.000
It really shows that
quantum physics is not just

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.100
classical physics
with wave character,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.080
it goes way beyond it.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.140
So I want to demonstrate
that with Bell's inequality.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.370
And the formulation
which is very simple,

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.800
and I want to present it
here, is an inequality,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.560
which is-- I mean the name.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.420
Many Bell's inequalities now,
you have different states,

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.860
different detectors, and you
can derive Bell's inequalities

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.000
which are then violated
by quantum physics.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.120
And what I want to present
here is the CHSH inequality.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:44.860
That's Clauser,
Horn, Shimony, and--

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.150
AUDIENCE: Holt.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.340
WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
Yes, thank you.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.160
So the situation
is the following.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.800
We have something
which decays, something

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.100
which emits two photons.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.820
Maybe an atom in
an excited state,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:04.130
and it does a click clack,
a two photon cascade.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.230
One photon goes to
Bob, one goes to Alice.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.440
Or I always try to
stress similarities

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.710
between light and atoms.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:14.190
We discussed the
experiment where

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:17.650
you take a mercury
molecule, you dissociate it,

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.330
and then Bob and Alice
each get an atom.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.120
And you can say these
photons has a polarization

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.010
or the atom has a spin.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:30.290
But Bob and Alice can now use
different Stern Gerlach figures

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.290
in x and y, at obscure
angles, circular bases,

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.500
I mean you name it.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.980
But what happens is because
it's a spin up, spin

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.130
down, horizontal,
vertical polarization,

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.656
it's a two-level system
which is immediate.

00:31:43.656 --> 00:31:45.030
And after a Stern
Gerlach filter,

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.900
you have only two combinations.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.500
We call it plus and minus.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.540
So in its most general
form, what we assume

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.604
is that Bob does measurements
in a basis, if you think.

00:31:56.604 --> 00:31:58.770
Think about a spatial
orientation of a Stern Gerlach

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.160
filter called S, where the
outcome is plus minus 1,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.990
t where the outcome
is plus minus 1,

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.785
and Alice has her own choices.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.110
And we want to
assume now that this

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.020
is everything is
classical probability.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.316
That if you just write
down this expression--

00:32:21.316 --> 00:32:22.690
don't ask me where
it comes from.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.350
This is probably something
which people wrote up

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.933
after they found
something interesting

00:32:25.933 --> 00:32:27.970
and try to prove
it or simplify it.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.700
You just write down
QS, RS, RT minus QT.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:38.260
You can then rewrite it
by factoring out S and T.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.290
And now the next step
is because Q and R

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.460
are-- they're are in each
measurement 1 or minus 1,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.610
either this is 0 or that is 0.

00:32:50.628 --> 00:32:56.210
No sorry, one is 0, one is 2.

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.090
And therefore, this kind
of funny combination

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:04.140
of letters for every measurement
is either plus or minus 2.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:12.142
Now we do many measurements,
and the probability

00:33:12.142 --> 00:33:19.450
for a certain outcome
that the variable Q--

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.215
there's a certain probability
that the outcome is Q,

00:33:22.215 --> 00:33:25.840
so you sort of use this pretty
much probabilistic thing

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.670
that the system has a
certain probability to B.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.340
And this is of course
the assumption,

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.820
the probability is that
the particular comes

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:37.420
with a certain probability
in the state q, r, s, t.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.060
Of course you should
scream, q, r, s, t commute,

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.780
but this is classical now.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.220
They don't commute with each
other quantum mechanically,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.680
but [INAUDIBLE] in a moment.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.120
So then you simply put--
by multiplying each event

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.750
with its portability, you
put now brackets around it.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.880
These are expectation
values, and what

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.030
you have is an inequality
that this expression, which

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.790
is the correlation between
certain measurements

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.030
between the quantity
QS, RS, and so on

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.659
is smaller or equal than 2.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.158
I mean it's very, very basic.

00:34:11.158 --> 00:34:12.449
And that's why I wrote it down.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.199
I don't want to spend
a lot of time on it.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.000
It's just classical
probabilistic reasoning.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:28.170
So now what are we doing
quantum mechanically?

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:37.960
We want to prove that quantum
mechanics cannot be reduced

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.840
to this classical reasoning.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.360
So we want to show that
this inequality is violated.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:52.750
We have a source or
entangled photons.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.500
We've talked about how
we can entangle photons.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:08.550
And now we measure the
quantities Q, R, S, and T.

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.930
And just to give you an
example about the many possible

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:17.684
choices, Q can be a
linear polarizer and R

00:35:17.684 --> 00:35:18.850
can be a circular polarizer.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.380
S can be a linear
polarizer at 45 degree,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:36.740
and T can be a
[INAUDIBLE] plate followed

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:42.860
by a linear polarizer
at 45 degrees.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.530
Well, that sounds like
many trig functions,

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:48.079
but we're not going into it.

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.620
You have to choose
your polarization.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.100
There's a certain scheme that
linear polarization is not

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.600
orthogonal to
circular polarization,

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.860
so there's a certain
theme behind it.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:03.300
And if you would work
it out by just looking

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.680
at entangled photons,
the entangled photons

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.600
are in a state,
let's say HV plus VH.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.150
They are correlated
in polarization

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.630
or spin up, spin down with the
down spin [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.130
And you can just
work out what is

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.990
the polarization
when you detect it.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:43.120
And what happens is that a
simple but tedious calculation

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:52.850
says that all those quantities
QS, RS, and and RT are equal.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:03.430
Here we have a minus sign and
they are all 1 over square root

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.930
2.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.410
And that means that instead
of the classical inequality,

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:16.620
that this quantity
is smaller than 2.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.270
We find that this is
2 times square root 2.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:35.860
And the fact that
this is larger than 2

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:39.300
has been experimentally
confirmed

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.955
with larger and
larger precision.

00:37:44.394 --> 00:37:46.560
Actually, the person who
gave this [? CUA ?] seminar

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.040
a week ago,
[INAUDIBLE], was part

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.440
of the team with [INAUDIBLE]
who did one of the very, very

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.910
first measurements violations
of Bell's inequality

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.660
in the '80s some 30 years ago.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.275
So I mean, this happened
rather recently.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.700
So the math is trivial,
the result seems trivial.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:14.490
It just shows that the world
is quantum mechanically and not

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.270
classical.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.700
And a lot of papers
have been written

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.430
and discussions have been had
about what does it really mean?

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.400
What does it mean
about the world?

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.660
What does it tell
us about the world?

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:39.410
So so the implication from
the established violation

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:48.250
of Bell's inequality
and the CHSH inequality

00:38:48.250 --> 00:39:06.330
is that when we assumed that the
state has definite values of Q,

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:19.010
R, S, T before observation,
we have to give up that.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:31.340
Or we have to give up that a
measurement performed by Alice

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:44.480
does not influence Bob's
experiment, Bob's measurement.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:56.350
So in other words, what I
formulated here is the locality

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:04.300
principle that what happens in
one location cannot influence

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.160
what happens in
the other location.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.530
Well you can say maybe
there's some secret channel

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.260
sending [INAUDIBLE]
the speed of light.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.060
But people [INAUDIBLE]
to create links

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.590
to put the detector so far
away that even a [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.620
at the speed of
light could not have

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.680
influenced the
other measurement.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.470
So there has been
after the first

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:28.928
Bell's inequality
experiment, there

00:40:28.928 --> 00:40:32.740
have been a series
of experiments

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.180
to avoid all of those
loopholes that there

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.180
is some unknown secret
communication between the two

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.880
detectors.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:46.130
The first one is the
principal of-- sometimes

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:47.660
I think a more
philosophical word

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.480
than physical word, "reality".

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.425
That those quantities
are real and they

00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:56.310
should exist before
we measure them.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.290
So the outcome of
Bell's inequality

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:03.210
is-- the violation of Bell's
inequality is, at least one

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:09.470
of them, at least one
of these principles--

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:14.600
reality-- at least one
of these principles

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.040
does not hold in nature.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.095
So either reality or
locality are violated.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.950
Any questions?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.800
And maybe just to connect
it to what I've said before,

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.840
one reason you saw that here
in the title, Bell's inequality

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.520
with two remote
atomic [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.770
Those experiments got
a lot of attention

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:56.670
because Bell's
inequality is something

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.440
all physicists talk about.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.010
And when you do it
with photons, there

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.260
is always the
detection loophole.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:07.050
You don't have perfect
photon to detectors.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:09.670
And some people said,
well, maybe the violation

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.300
of Bell's inequality comes only
from the photons we detect.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.480
The undetected
photons would make up

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.480
for the violation of
Bell's inequality,

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:23.040
and Bell's inequality
is not violated.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.950
I mean, that almost sounds like
that nature wants to fool us.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.280
The photons team up
and say the photons

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.640
which are detected
behave very differently

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.400
from the photons which
are not detected.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.270
But these are at least
logical loopholes.

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.950
And graduate students spend
half of their Ph.D., or maybe

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.490
several graduate students
spend their whole Ph.D.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.950
In building such an
experiment which is now--

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.440
you get a famous
paper out of it.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.910
And your research has
attention, so you know.

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:56.735
I didn't sleep so much, so
maybe I'm not too serious now.

00:42:56.735 --> 00:42:58.164
But this is great research.

00:42:58.164 --> 00:42:59.830
I mean, this is really
pushing the limit

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.500
of our understanding
of quantum physics.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.760
And Chris Monroe is a
wonderful physicist.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.540
And we are in the
same [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.800
So if you have a
Bell state of atoms,

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.430
and I told you how you get it
also with a lousy efficiency

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.750
but you get a Bell state.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.320
If you now do a measurement
of those Bell state

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.920
and you measure violation
of Bell's inequality, atoms,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.770
they don't run away.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.610
You can detect the atoms
with 100% probability.

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:30.990
You can shine a laser light
on them, hundreds, thousands,

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:33.780
millions of photons until they
have scattered enough light

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.810
that you know
100%, I've detected

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.410
the atom in it's quantum state.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:43.250
So Bell states with atoms, one
real world application of them

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.200
is to test violations
of Bell's inequality

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.460
with atoms which do not fall
into the detection loophole.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:20.480
Our next unit is
partially motivated

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.050
to show you what all this
entanglement can do for us.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:28.530
So I mentioned that
entanglement is a resource.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.060
It's something useful
like energy is a resource.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.780
And so maybe ultimately there
should be a stock market,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.920
and you can buy so and so
many bits of entanglement.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.670
And you have to pay
for it because there's

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.400
something you can do.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:48.330
And let me introduce
what can be done with it.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.830
If you have one photon
at frequency omega,

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.600
and you have an
observation time-- you

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.040
do a measurement
over time T, then

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.230
the precision at which
you measure the frequency

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:07.230
is fundamentally limited by, you
can say time energy uncertainty

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.890
by the Fourier theorem, that the
uncertainty and the frequency

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:14.260
of a single measurement
is 1 over the time T

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:19.150
you had to detect or to measure
the frequency of the photon.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:22.220
But now we have n photons.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.690
And that means that the
uncertainty in the measurement,

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.490
which is now small
delta omega, is

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.180
delta omega for a single photon.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.010
But you know, when you do n
measurements, and average n

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:48.420
measurements, you gain
by the square root of n.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:57.674
And this is regarded as
the fundamental shot noise

00:45:57.674 --> 00:45:58.590
limit of measurements.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.310
But now assume we can
do something fancy.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:09.290
We can make a super photon.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.730
We take our n photons
of frequency omega

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:19.130
and make one photon
of frequency n omega.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.340
Now we have only one photon.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:34.720
The frequency uncertainty of
the measurement is delta omega,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.870
but this is now the uncertainty
off the n times more

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:39.510
energetic photon.

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.470
So therefore, if you're
interested in the quantity

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:46.080
omega, which is the frequency
of the single photon,

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.790
we have now made an improvement
over the standard shot noise

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.870
limit by square root n.

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:01.470
So everybody follows?

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.310
So that's just a
[INAUDIBLE] experiment.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.710
If you can take n
photons-- I've told you

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:12.470
how we've talked about the
[INAUDIBLE] oscillator, how

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.040
we can pump a crystal.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.282
And in your homework
assignment you

00:47:16.282 --> 00:47:17.990
do a nice calculation
with a Hamiltonian.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:21.550
One big photon in, it
breaks into two photons.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.370
The reverse process is
frequency dot doubling.

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:29.360
So if you would not measure n
photons individually, but first

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.880
ate up their frequency by
making a photon of n times

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.950
the frequency and then
look a single photon,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.850
you have now, you measure
all the photons together.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.480
And therefore, your
accuracy improves

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.034
by a factor of n and not just
by a factor of square root n.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.950
So that tells us something.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:56.430
If we do something with the
photons, if we entangle them,

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:02.290
there is a possibility
to vastly improve

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:05.215
the standard limit
of measurements.

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.090
And so people who are
really interested in it

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.970
are people who push the
limits of precision, people

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.800
who build atomic
clocks and want to get

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.210
the last little bit of
accuracy which is possible.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:19.070
So they have already exhausted
all technical possibilities,

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:24.570
and the next thing is now, well
maybe entanglement and sort

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:30.450
of subtleties of quantum
physics can come to their help.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:39.130
So this shows you
what is possible.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.750
But now I want to tell
you how it can be done.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:53.380
So what I first want to do
is, before we can improve

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.960
over the fundamental
shot noise limit,

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.850
I have to show you how
the fundamental shot noise

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.260
limit naturally emerges.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:06.850
So I want to introduce to you
beam splitter interferometers.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.900
Interferometers are there
to measure phase shifts.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.950
You split a beam,
you combine it,

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:13.860
and if there's a phase
shift you notice if.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.740
You get interference fringes.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:20.860
And I want to show you that very
naturally to standard quantum

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.020
limit, the shot noise emerges.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.360
But then we are ready to
look at our description

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.710
of the interferometer and
say, where can we now change

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:35.505
the rules to put in more
quantum-ness or entanglement

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.005
and eventually get
higher precision.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.420
Since the standard quantum
limit is well know,

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:48.230
I want to rather
quickly go over that.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:56.280
So the goal is that we want
to measure a phase shift.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.990
And my first simple
deviation of the phase shift

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:07.820
is that in this picture of
the quasi probabilities,

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.340
the coherent state is
a circle like that.

00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:20.100
The width of the
circle in natural units

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:28.100
is 1, but the radius of that
is alpha of the coherent state,

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.730
which is square root n.

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:36.210
So now if you ask how well
with this uncertainty can

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.910
I observe the phase of the
photon which circulates

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.920
in this quasi
probability plane, you

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.860
find that the phase is
1 over square root n.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.540
Or based on your homework
assignment number one,

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:54.630
you can say we have some
Heisenberg uncertainty

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:58.300
between photon
number and the phase.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.160
And in a coherent state,
the standard deviation

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.180
in the photon number
is square root n,

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.720
and you again get the
standard quantum limit.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.280
Let's now obtain the
standard quantum limit

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.690
from a real measurement
device, because this

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:27.570
is what we want to
generalize for entangles,

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:30.810
[INAUDIBLE] state, and
all the special things.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.630
So an interferometer
is the following.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.350
It consists of two
beam splitters.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.430
After the second beam splitter
we have two detectors.

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.407
And the quality we
will measure will

00:51:44.407 --> 00:51:46.240
be the difference of
the two photo currents.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:57.330
And if you don't
do any phase shift,

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.040
we know the two beams
splitters are just

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.690
the identity transformation.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:05.840
But now we put in a phase
shift, and the question

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:08.770
is, what is the smallest
phase shift we can measure?

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.665
What is the accuracy
measuring this phase?

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:16.410
We have discussed at
length all the elements.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:19.920
So we have a beam
splitter, a phase shifter,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.070
and a second beam splitter.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:27.510
You know that the phase
shifter is a rotation in z,

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:32.860
the beam splitter is a
rotation in-- was it X or Y?

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:39.000
Looks like I think Y
because of the i's.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.610
Just a warning here,
in this section

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.810
I use a beam splitter which uses
a different phase convention.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:51.540
But they are all equally
apart from some phases.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.490
So by multiplying
the three matrices,

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:59.780
we get the transformatrix for
the [INAUDIBLE] interferometer.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:05.540
So the output CD
is this matrix here

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:11.700
which is a simple rotation
times the input state.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.960
And our measurement
is the difference

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.080
in photon numbers in
the two output modes.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:28.510
So it's D dega D minus C dega C.

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:35.870
So what we can do now is we can
obtain C and D from the input

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.340
modes A and B. So
therefore we can now

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:46.380
express our signal in
terms of the input modes.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.700
When we know what we put
into the interferometer,

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:53.510
because we know all its elements
we know what we can get out.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:54.510
And this is done here.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.780
And the phase which appeared in
the rotation matrix, the phase

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.890
shift in the
interferometer appears now

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.610
as a cosine phi and
sine phi contribution.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.710
And we have sort off-
the cosine and sine phi

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.580
have two operators
as a pre-factor.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:21.640
In one case, it's A dega A minus
B dega B. In the other case

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.950
it's a cross-term, A
dega B plus B dega A,

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.830
Now we will be more specific
what is signal and noise.

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:33.200
I just want to tell you in
the standard way of operating

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.070
the interferometer you have
only one beam in the mode A.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.870
You take a beam, you split
it, you recombine it.

00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:43.830
B is nothing or the vacuum.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.670
It may introduce some noise.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:49.980
But if you have a lot of
intensity in the beam A,

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.900
it is this term which
dominates, and you find fringes

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:57.050
as a function of the
phase shift cosine phi.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:01.350
Whereas what comes here is
sort of more the vacuum mode.

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:02.960
It gives rise to noise terms.

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:16.900
So if you ask, what is
the expectation value

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:29.090
for x, this x operator,
it varies co-sinusoidally.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:32.400
And there is a special
point for a phase shift

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.695
of 90 degrees when we have the
steepest slope and the highest

00:55:35.695 --> 00:55:36.195
sensitivity.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.070
So these are sort of all
just setting the stage.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:50.140
Which we are interested in
is, if we now have an input

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.370
state of light--
and as you know,

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.634
there's all of this noise.

00:55:53.634 --> 00:55:56.259
There's the fundamental noise of
the vacuum, or coherent state,

00:55:56.259 --> 00:55:59.140
of Heisenberg's Uncertainty.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.180
And this means when we
do repeated measurements

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.390
we will have a
variance in the phase.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:07.490
And we want to know, what
is the fundamental limit

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.120
on the standard deviation in
the measurement of the phase.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:16.760
Well, the standard
deviation in the phase

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.450
is nothing else than
the standard deviation

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:24.710
of what we measure in
divided by how sensitive it

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:25.380
is to the phase.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:35.580
So by taking this
expression for M,

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:40.400
M is an operator X plus cosine
phi plus something times

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.060
sine phi.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.370
We can now evaluate
this expression.

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:53.900
This will actually appear
several times today,

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:59.070
and it's also a key question to
one of your homework problems.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:05.300
So this is sort of what
defines the accuracy

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.390
of the interferometer.

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.900
And what we have here
are expectation values

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.080
of operators.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:15.480
And now we can--
and that's what we

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.840
will do for the rest
of this lecture.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.820
We will look at this expression
for different inputs states.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.350
Coherent state, single photons,
[INAUDIBLE] light, entangled

00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:25.950
state.

00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:27.366
So that's what
you're going to do.

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.300
So if you take the
derivative of dn d phi,

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.670
the cosine becomes a sine.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:39.460
A minus sign, the
sine becomes a cosine.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:43.420
And if you specialize
to the situation, which

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.390
is where the slope
is very steep,

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:51.560
a 90 degree phase shift
around this point, our phase

00:57:51.560 --> 00:58:03.650
sensitivity is given by
the expectation value

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:08.910
of the variance of the operator
y divided by the operator x.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:18.500
So now we are ready
to plug things in.

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:23.500
The first thing is of
course the coherent state.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.160
For the coherent state, our
input to the beam splitter,

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.070
one is a coherent
state, the other one

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:37.680
is a vacuum in mode A and B.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:47.780
We had expressions-- let me
just scroll back-- for x and y,

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:51.400
expressed by the operators
a, b, a dega b dega.

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:04.690
So therefore we can
calculate that now.

00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:10.990
And x is nothing
else than the number

00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:14.030
of photons in the
coherent state.

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:16.360
And this is our signal.

00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:22.210
And y is 0.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:24.010
This was the noise term.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:27.300
And the variance
in y-- we're just

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.640
doing commutators--
is given by n.

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:45.830
So therefore, if we
calculate the square root

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:52.650
of y square over x for
the coherent state input,

00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:55.972
we take the square root of y
squared, which is square root

00:59:55.972 --> 01:00:02.050
n, we divide by n, we obtain
the standard shot noise limit.

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:03.425
Sure, what else
should we expect?

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.370
So now we know how
to use the formalism.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.020
We can now apply
it too-- we can go

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:24.150
from the most classical state
of light, the coherent state,

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:30.150
to what I regard at least for
a single mode the most quantum

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:32.810
state, namely a single photon.

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:35.490
Remember when we talked
about the G2 function,

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:39.540
G2 function can only
be smaller than 1

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.520
for non-classical states.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.600
And for the single
photon it's 0.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.140
That's the biggest violation
of the classical equation

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.580
that G2 has to be
larger or equal than 1.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:51.200
So now we're really dealing
with a quantum system.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.050
And the question is, what will
we get for the single photon?

01:00:58.435 --> 01:01:07.480
So for the single
photon we want to use

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.680
the dual-rail representation.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:15.630
We want to use the powerful
formalism we have used.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.550
After the beam
splitter, the photon

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.860
can be in one mode
or the other mode.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.306
We call this in the
dual-rail representation

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:27.600
the logical 0 or the logical 1.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:40.200
So in this
representation, when we

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:50.810
start with a photon in one input
mode, this is the logical 0,

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:57.270
the beam splitter is
directing the photons

01:01:57.270 --> 01:02:01.191
into one mode or the other
mode, but this is a single qubit

01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:01.690
rotation.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.880
The phase shifter is another
single qubit operation.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.390
The second beam splitter
is another operation.

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:19.720
So by just using
the rotation, we'll

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.810
find out what is
the output state.

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:26.870
So we start with the logical
0 with the photon in one mode.

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:30.750
The beam splitter creates
a superposition state.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.560
Remember, we have
the interferometer,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.080
and in the lower arm
we put in a phase.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:40.180
So therefore, the lower arm gets
multiplied with a phase shift.

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.080
And then it goes again through
a beam splitter, which is just

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.530
another rotation, and with that
we obtain the output state.

01:02:49.530 --> 01:03:04.110
And so the output state
is now a superposition

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:07.330
of the logical 0
and the logical 1,

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:08.830
and we've picked
up a phase shift.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:17.370
So no we ask-- we have the
beam splitter, phase shift,

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.860
recombiner, and
now we are asking,

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:23.260
what is the probability to
detect the photon in one

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.320
of the two output modes.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.400
We just put a counter there.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:35.550
And this probability is nothing
else than the probability

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:39.520
to have a logical 1,
because a logical 1

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.850
in the dual-rail
representation means

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.270
the photon is in one mode.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.980
The logical 0 would
be the other mode.

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:53.584
I felt if I would spend three or
four times as much time on it,

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:55.250
it wouldn't increase
your understanding.

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:57.340
You may have to sit down
and look through it,

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:00.720
but it's just really
putting matrices together,

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.800
[? single ?]
photons, mapping it.

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.570
Every step is
trivial and is what

01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:09.730
we have done in a
different context before.

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:12.720
So the result is
that the probability

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.300
of finding the [? single ?]
photon in our detector

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.800
has a cosine phi factor.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.160
So that's how we measure phase.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.790
Our counter, the probability
that photons arrive.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:29.390
If phi is 0, the
probability is one.

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:36.980
If phi is 180 degrees, all the
photons go to the other mode.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.450
I mean, that's what you'd
expect an interferometer to do.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.140
But now comes the
interesting question.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.820
How precise can be
measured the phase?

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:57.100
Remember, in the coherent
state, the coherent state

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.300
had fluctuations in the photon
number of square root n,

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:05.310
and this gave rise to the
standard quantum limit.

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:08.480
A single photon is
a single photon.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.390
There is no noise.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.010
We always measure
a single photon

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.020
if you would simply detect the
number of photons in the input

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.340
state.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.070
But we are not doing that.

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.957
We have sent the photon through
an interferometer in order

01:05:20.957 --> 01:05:21.920
to measure the phase.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.100
And now we have-- and
this is a result of this,

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.630
I would say, trivial
calculation that this is now

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:31.160
the probability to
observe a photon.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.190
Well, there is not a whole lot
we can learn from one photon,

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:37.040
so we run the
experiment n times.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.740
And what we get is a
binomial distribution,

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.830
just a coin toss
with probability P.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.310
What is the variance in P?

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:48.170
It's not a Poissonian
distribution.

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:55.060
It is a binomial distribution.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.800
Of course, if the probability is
1 you detect all your photons.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.050
There is no uncertainty.

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:04.390
If the probability is 0 you
detect 0 with 0 uncertainty.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.970
So therefore, the
expression for the variance

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:12.360
of the binomial distribution
is p times 1 minus p.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.700
If not, I admit I had
to refresh my memory

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:21.140
about the binomial
distribution yesterday evening.

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:24.860
So therefore, when we repeat
the experiment many times

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.210
and we have sent into
our interferometer

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:32.970
m photons and we
measure n clicks.

01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:36.350
And n over m is our measurement
for the probability.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:43.590
This measurement of the
probability has noise.

01:06:43.590 --> 01:06:47.702
And the noise is a variance
of the standard deviation

01:06:47.702 --> 01:06:48.910
of the binomial distribution.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:56.490
This expression for P
put into the variance

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.990
of the binomial distribution,
and a little bit

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.854
of triganomic
manipulation gives us

01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:03.270
the result on the
right-hand side.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:12.960
And we want to know what is
the uncertainty in the phase.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.880
I mean, this is what
we want to measure.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.120
Well, the uncertainty
in the phase

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:26.770
is the uncertainty in our
measurement, which is delta P.

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:30.167
And then we have to divide by
how sensitive the probability

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:32.870
is with respect to the phase.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:36.580
So we take this expression
of the probability

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.000
as a function of the
phase, take a derivative,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.810
and then by doing the ratio
of this over that we find 1

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:47.600
over square root n.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.270
So it doesn't make
any difference

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:53.600
if you put the n photons
into a coherent beam

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.530
and run our
interferometer or if you

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.620
go through the great
pain of preparing

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:02.910
each photon in a
non-classical flux state

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.330
and just operating
the interferometer

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:06.710
with single photons.

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:10.590
In both cases do we obtain
the standard quantum limit

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.290
1 over square root n.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:48.319
Now we are really
ready to see how can we

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:50.689
improve on the shot noise?

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:53.569
It seems that unless we
do something special,

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:56.500
we will always
get square root n.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.490
I've already shown you
at the beginning that's

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.850
the shot noise limit
is not fundamental.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:05.340
Just take this
thought experiment

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.600
that you take the n photons
through a highly nonlinear

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.100
process, you create one
photon of frequency n omega,

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.960
and then you have more
precision of this measurement.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.990
So there must be a way to have
a precision which scales 1

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.250
over n and not 1
over square root n.

01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:30.100
The mathematical augment
related to our treatment

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:39.660
of the interferometer
is the following,

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:47.140
our signal was A dega
A minus B dega B. Well,

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.340
if one of the input
mode dominates,

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.160
A dega A is the [? photon ?]
[? number. ?] So this sort

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.100
of looks like the
[? photon ?] [? number ?].

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:59.150
But if we now find a
scheme-- and I will show you

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:02.770
that this is possible-- that
this cos term A dega B plus B

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:07.680
dega A, which is some form of
quantum noise, as we will see,

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:19.170
is 0, well what do we get now?

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:22.020
So let's hope that maybe
by some squeezing--

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:25.740
I will show you several versions
which show you how quantumness

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:32.790
can give us more
than short noise.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:37.670
And one example will be
that by squeezing light.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:39.680
We've learned already
that squeezed light

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.520
can suppress the noise.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.580
If you squeeze light, something
which comes from the modes

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.020
where we apply squeezed
vacuum has been reduced.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:51.500
I mean, it's what we
discussed already.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.550
So the best we can do is
that the noise term is 0.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:00.480
So what do we have now?

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.909
If we have a signal which is
finite and the noise is 0,

01:11:04.909 --> 01:11:06.450
what is our precision
of measurement?

01:11:09.772 --> 01:11:13.850
Well, it first looks like
the signal to noise ratio

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:15.820
is infinite.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:28.930
But it's not quite that,
because if our signal is x,

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:31.410
it's a photon number.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:36.750
And the signal x was sensitive
to the phase by cosine phi.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:46.050
The sensitivity of our
measurement of the quantity

01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:56.160
m with phase is
n times sine phi.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.040
And this is smaller or equal
than n, where the equal sign is

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.540
obtained for 90 degrees.

01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.940
So therefore, we have a
[? photon ?] number n.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.540
We may absolutely know what the
initial [? photon ?] number is.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.910
But now we want to measure
whether the phase is

01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:27.200
different from pi over 2.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:34.070
And the smallest change in our
signal which we can resolve

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:38.380
is that we get one photon less.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:47.130
So that's the smallest
resolvable change

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:50.320
due to the [? photon ?]
nature of our detection.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.980
And that implies that
the smallest phase

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.330
shift we can
resolve is 1 over n.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.905
So this is more a
thought experiment,

01:13:02.905 --> 01:13:07.210
now looking at the math and
seeing what is the best signal?

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:09.970
A dega A can never be larger
than [? photon ?] numbers,

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:11.240
so that's a resource.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.860
We put in energy in
the terms of photons,

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.060
and then the best we can do is
that we don't have any noise.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:19.170
And then we are simply
limited by the fact

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:24.630
that when we deviate from
the maximum output signal

01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:27.380
because there is a phase
shift in the interferometer,

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:35.070
our sensitivity comes in grains,
is grainy by the [? photon ?]

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.570
number.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:44.980
So I'm not telling you how
we achieve to get y equals 0.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:50.420
The question is only
that at least the math

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:53.100
seems to make it possible.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:14:01.215
So now we ask how to achieve
sub-shot noise precision.

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:16.615
So here we know this is at
least mathematically possible.

01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:24.810
So we want to improve
this interferometer,

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.260
and the question is we
have to change something.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:31.650
This interferometer, [INAUDIBLE]
we've seen [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:34.070
state is not giving
us any better result,

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:35.920
so we have three options now.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.410
We can do something fancy in
the input state, use entangled

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:42.380
state.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:46.200
We can use some very
fancy beam splitters,

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.750
or we can do something
special to the way

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.010
how we read out
the interferometer.

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.050
And all those three
are possibilities.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:15:00.040
We can put in some
extra quantumness

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:01.390
into each of the three steps.

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:08.241
OK

01:15:08.241 --> 01:15:09.157
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:15.842 --> 01:15:17.300
WOLFGANG KETTERLE:
OK, the question

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:21.668
is can we do something
with the phase shift?

01:15:21.668 --> 01:15:23.075
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:25.200
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: I think
if we would do something

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.030
with the phase
shift, we would do--

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:29.510
you know, we would change
apples with oranges,

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:32.920
because we want to compare
different interferometers

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.850
by measuring the same thing.

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:36.910
And maybe as an
experimentalist say,

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:38.810
what I want to be
able to measure

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:42.110
I take a very, very thing glass
plate which just makes a very

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:44.520
small phase shift,
and I'm now comparing

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.240
different interferometers.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.480
And when I put the glass
plate in and pull it out,

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.840
I want the person who reads
out the interferometer

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.104
to see a change.

01:15:53.104 --> 01:15:55.270
So that's how I want to
compare the interferometers.

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:02.020
Actually, the question
you are raising

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.480
was in another way
also discussed today

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.820
at lunch with three of
my wonderful colleagues.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:15.610
Namely what we discussed was
some recent papers, one of them

01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:17.890
published in
Nature, which claims

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:20.570
precision better
than Heisenberg.

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:23.020
I mean, what I'm sort of
indicating to you is Heisenberg

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.140
should be the best
which can be achieved.

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:27.710
How can we do even
better than Heisenberg?

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:30.280
Well, and this was
actually related, Nancy,

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.310
to your question.

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:32.810
If you want to
measure magnetization

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:35.880
and you use some
nonlinear physics

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:44.160
where the photons, where
the magnetization involved

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.370
affects the photon field by
some higher power of what

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:54.410
you measure, you really
change what you measure.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.060
Maybe I'm not
expressing it clearly.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.270
If you measure magnetization
and you have a certain quantum

01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:59.880
limit in measuring
the magnetization,

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.040
that's one thing.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.450
But if you now bring
another material close

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:06.480
to your magnetization and this
material goes through a phase

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.790
shift, you sort of amplify
by a physical process

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.530
by a nonlinear Hamiltonian
what you want to measure.

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.100
And then of course
you can-- depending

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.940
on what kind of
nonlinear process

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.640
you're using-- you
can get a signal which

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:23.580
scales tremendously with
the number of photons you

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.190
put into your system.

01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.630
So in other words, there
are loopholes like this,

01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:31.260
and some of them led
to very fleshy papers.

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.630
And our lunch discussion
was that some of it

01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.430
is really completely trivial.

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:42.580
And some papers
who claim that they

01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.830
have seen a scaling
of the precision

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.680
with photon number which
is better than Heisenberg,

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.620
not 1 over n, maybe
1 over n square,

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:53.870
that some of those papers
were purely classical

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.750
and the only quantum
character of this paper

01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:59.640
was the name of
Heisenberg in the title.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:04.570
So it's not related to
any uncertainty relation,

01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:07.200
but that's not what
we want to discuss.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.280
Let me just spend
quickly-- let me see, yup.

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:25.800
We should the week with
something interesting and not

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.090
just shot noise.

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.820
So what I want to
use now is I want

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.580
to replace the beam
splitter by something

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.540
which involves Bell states.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.450
So as the beam splitter
we do a massive creation

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.350
of bell states.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.310
It's our entangler.

01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.205
And our second beam
splitter is a Bell analyzer.

01:18:47.205 --> 01:18:50.920
It is a disentangler.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:55.730
So what I mean is the
following, we will actually

01:18:55.730 --> 01:19:00.150
just put one photon
into this input beam,

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:02.990
and we will only
read out one channel.

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:06.760
So all these here are
only auxiliary modes.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.360
This is how I make a special
quantum beam splitter.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.710
And what we need
for this description

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:14.835
is essentially two gates.

01:19:14.835 --> 01:19:18.080
We need a single qubit.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.200
The single qubit
is the [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.730
which we have already discussed.

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:28.170
And in the dual-rail
representation

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:33.450
where its photon can be
in one of the two modes,

01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:35.860
the [INAUDIBLE] is
simply connecting

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.300
the two modes in this way.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:42.520
And we discussed
that the [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:46.430
can be described by a beam
splitter with a phase shift.

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.710
So in other words,
we need one element

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:52.490
which is a beam splitter
with a phase shift.

01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:55.960
But this is only
acting on one qubits.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.090
And now we want
to connect qubits

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:02.690
with a controlled NOT gate.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:04.460
To remind you,
controlled NOT gate

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.050
is something where the
photons stay where they are.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:14.910
But if the control bit is
1, it flips the target bit.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.610
If the control bit is 0, nothing
happens to the target bit.

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:21.350
And we discussed
already that we can

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.860
realize one qubit with
one interferometer.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.100
These are the dual-rails.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:29.070
We always have one photon in two
states, this mode or that mode.

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:33.930
And know the other
qubit, one of the rails

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:36.330
can go through the
nonlinear Kerr medium.

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:40.600
If the bit is in c
through the phase

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.295
shift in the
nonlinear Kerr medium,

01:20:43.295 --> 01:20:46.110
it flips the
[INAUDIBLE] down there,

01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:47.490
and this the controlled knot.

01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:59.800
So now we want to
use two qubits.

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.590
So I'm talking about,
in our fancy entangler

01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:08.920
I'm just talking about
the first two rails here.

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.440
So we have those two rails.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:23.630
The [INAUDIBLE] puts
us into a superposition

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:27.380
of the logical CO and 1.

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:39.690
And now after the
c-not gate, so we

01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:44.440
are in a superposition
of-- just give me

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:54.610
a second-- we start here with 1.

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:56.445
Sorry, we start here with 1.

01:21:59.065 --> 01:21:59.944
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:21:59.944 --> 01:22:01.156
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: Yeah?

01:22:01.156 --> 01:22:02.010
I'm wrapping up.

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:03.798
This is my last.

01:22:03.798 --> 01:22:06.702
AUDIENCE: One [INAUDIBLE]
minus 1 [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:13.010 --> 01:22:15.870
WOLFGANG KETTERLE: The 0
[INAUDIBLE] in 0 plus 1.

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:20.910
And let me just finish that.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.870
This is the target, year.

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.020
Sorry, it's correct.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.790
We start with 0,
we start with 0.

01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:39.920
So what we have here is
the product state of 0

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:44.020
plus 1 upstairs
and 0 downstairs.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:47.640
But if we have a 1,
we flip the 0 to 1.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:53.030
So therefore, what we have now
is the state 00 plus 1 1 over

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:55.000
square root 2.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.320
And then we apply
our phase shifter.

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:04.796
And what we get out of this
state is 00 plus e to the 2i

01:23:04.796 --> 01:23:09.780
phi times 1 1 over
square root 2.

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.740
So now by using sort of--
and now I should stop.

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.010
I know people are waiting.

01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:18.720
But by using two of
those, I suddenly

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.840
have multiplied the phase
by 2, so something is now

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.500
sensitive to 2 phi.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.920
And if I use n such, more
and more entanglement,

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.000
I will show you--
no class next week,

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.040
but in the following
week-- that we suddenly

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.370
have a term in our quantum
state which is e to the n phi.

01:23:38.370 --> 01:23:40.240
And this gives us effect
of an in precision.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.150
OK, have a good rest of
the week and we meet again

01:23:48.150 --> 01:23:51.310
in a week and a half.
