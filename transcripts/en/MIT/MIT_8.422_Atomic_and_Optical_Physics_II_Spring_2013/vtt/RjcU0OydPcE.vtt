00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.430
PROFESSOR: So the
subject here is about

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.830
if you want to
understand interactions

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.990
between neutral objects.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.870
So let's start in
a very basic way

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.380
by saying we have an atome
A, we have an atom B,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.680
they are separated
by a distance R,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.130
and we want to know what
is the force between them.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.500
In a semiclassical
picture, we would

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.530
say that everything
is-- the force which

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.670
is responsible for that
must be the Coulomb force.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.670
So the atom A and B
consists of charges,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.160
so we should find
the charge density

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.262
in our system A, the
charge density of B,

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:44.880
we take the coulomb energy and
we integrate over the volume.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.930
And this is how in e and
m, in the most general way,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.760
you would to write down
the electrostatic energy

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.720
of a system.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720
You take all
charges, each charge

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.270
has a coulomb potential with
the other charge [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.540
indicate over everything.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.080
But for objects
which are localized

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.810
and we can do
multiple expansion,

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.410
our objects are
neutral, neutral atom.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.740
So therefore there
is no coulomb term,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.090
and the next term is the dipole.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.900
So therefore, starting
with classical physics,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.130
we would find that the
interaction of those charge

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.770
density distributions one
for atom A, one for atom B,

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.990
should actually interact with
this Hamiltonian h prime.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:13.200
OK, but now, if you
look at it classically,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.100
we find that classically,
the expectation

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.220
value for the dipole operator
of each atom is zero.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.870
But you will also
find-- if you said,

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.650
well, OK, that's what I
expect, because an atom

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.280
is in isotopic space.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.000
How can it have a dipole moment?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.170
But maybe, what could
happen is, if there

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.810
is a fluctuation of
a dipole moment here

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.560
and a fluctuation there and the
fluctuations are correlated,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.450
then the two systems may
repel or attract each other.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.360
So therefore, when we are
talking about fluctuations,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.990
we are talking about expectation
values for d squared.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.090
But also in classical
physics, this is exactly zero.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.210
So what classical
physics tells us,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.990
it says, in
classical physics, it

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.450
costs more energy to create
a dipole moment, or even

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.554
a fluctuating dipole
moment, than one gets back

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.720
from the dipole interaction.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.240
So the system will
never spontaneously form

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.899
some form of dipole moment.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.600
And in classical physics,
two neutral atoms

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.598
will have no attraction at all.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.225
So it costs more energy.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.610
So now, we have to
do quantum mechanics.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.120
And every so often, I have to
go through a classical argument

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.310
to make you wonder about the
quantum mechanical result.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.840
Because the quantum mechanical
result, you're used to it.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.230
You've heard about the
van der Waals interaction.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.010
But now you know
that there is really

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.110
something quantum at work.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.350
In quantum mechanics,
the expectation value

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.080
of the square of the dipole
operator is not zero.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.990
I mean, you can see that if
you have an electron, which

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.910
is in an harmonic
oscillator, and if it

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:53.760
is at the bottom of
the oscillator-- well,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.150
the dipole moment--
what I want you to say

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.300
is the dipole moment
for a charged system

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.210
is related to-- between
electron and proton--

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.980
to the displacement operator, R.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.380
And even if you have an
equilibrium position--

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.360
like in an harmonic oscillator,
where R is equal to zero,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.480
R squared-- the expectation
value-- is not zero,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.940
because whatever your
stable equilibrium is,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.490
you will have zero point
fluctuations around it.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.300
And so therefore, now
in quantum physics,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.980
it's not that we have to provide
energy to create a d squared.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.850
We have it.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.640
We have it by necessity, because
of non-commuting operators,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.680
because of the nature
of the quantum physics.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.920
So now, the fact that we have
fluctuating dipole moments

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.750
already, that means if now
with the fluctuating dipole

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.510
moments between the two
atoms are synchronized,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.750
this will then lead to a
non-vanishing average force

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.230
between the atoms.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.100
So that's the idea.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.690
But the good thing
is, you don't even

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.780
have to know about it-- about
fluctuations and all that.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.550
You just take-- and
this is your homework--

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.060
you just take the
operator H prime.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.160
And look what happens when
you have an atom in the ground

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.800
and excited state
and what happens

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.550
when you have both atoms
in the ground state.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.450
In the first case, you
get the leading result

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.600
in first order
perturbation theory.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.190
For two ground state atoms,
you have to go to second order.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:38.880
In first order, the
potential is 1 over R cubed.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.420
And you will calculate
the C3 coefficient.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.480
In second order, you get
a van der Waals potential,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.180
which is 1 over R to the sixth.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.380
And it's fairly
straightforward to calculate

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.570
the C6 coefficient.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.110
Any questions?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:14.000
So let me reemphasize, the
beauty of this perturbation

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.950
result that it's so simple.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.640
But the downside
is, you don't really

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.850
understand what you're doing.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.891
I mean, you are solving
the Schrodinger equation.

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:22.710
You are finding an
expectation value.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.490
But the nature of
the effect-- how

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.420
it is related to fluctuation,
what is really behind it--

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.640
is sometimes obscured.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.031
So let me give you one
interpretation, which I really

00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:34.530
like.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.379
And I learned that
actually from Dan Kleppner.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.120
When he taught the atomic
physics course at MIT

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.620
20 years ago, that
was one element of it.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.830
And I told you at the
beginning that I'm actually

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.310
proud that our atomic
physics course is really

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.200
kind of-- has hopefully
kept-- the best of the decade

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.550
long tradition of teachers
like Norman Ramsey, Dan

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.190
Kleppner, and Dave Pritchard.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.860
So this is now really
due to Dan Kleppner.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.570
And I will later
today actually post

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.480
Dan Kleppner's original lecture
notes about this effect.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.190
So we want to understand
the van der Waals

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.640
force in a completely
different system.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.410
And I think that helps.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.025
We have two LC circuits.

00:09:34.634 --> 00:09:44.510
There's L, C, C, L.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:52.310
And what happens is, the
two capacitors are closed.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.937
So there is this stray field
of one capacitor reaching

00:09:54.937 --> 00:09:55.770
the other capacitor.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.590
So I won't go through
the detailed math here,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.630
because it's not necessary.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.420
But what we have
here is, we have

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.440
two coupled systems--
two coupled capacitors.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.790
And the only thing
I want to use is

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.260
that the stray
field of a capacitor

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.360
has a diopolic characteristic.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.310
And it decays with
1 over R cubed.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.150
So what we have right
now is, each LC circuit,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.870
when it's isolated, has
a resonant frequency

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.810
of omega naught.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.010
But now, when we have two
pendulums-- two oscillators--

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.970
which are coupled,
we get two modes,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.950
which are omega plus and minus.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.790
And if we simply
solve for two modes,

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.030
and they have some
coupling, well, we

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.690
get an upshift and
downshift by the coupling.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.090
But if you look more carefully
at the solution for two

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:07.670
coupled modes, it has
also a quadratic effect,

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.830
which is sometimes
neglected, but it's there.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.400
So this is, in
general, what you will

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.970
find, if you couple two modes.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:22.400
Now in quantum
mechanics, when we

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.830
ask for the oscillator
in the ground state,

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.295
we can find the
zero point energy.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.650
And so the energy
in the ground state

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:45.325
is 1/2 the zero point
energy in the mode plus,

00:11:45.325 --> 00:11:47.890
in the mode minus.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:53.730
The first order coupling term,
the 1 over R cubed cancels out.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.670
But what remains
is a contribution,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.150
which is 1 over R to the sixth.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.160
So we need quantum physics.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.050
Because in classical
physics, the ground state

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.910
of the LC circuit
is nothing happens.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.022
No charge, no
current, no nothing.

00:12:22.022 --> 00:12:23.730
I mean, this is a
classical ground state,

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.890
and you would not
get any effect.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.480
So realize that this van
der Waals potential requires

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:42.980
quantum mechanics, and it
is due to the zero point

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:51.435
energy of the
atomic oscillators.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.400
Just hold the
thought, when we talk

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.210
about atoms in the
electromagnetic field,

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.880
we have two oscillators.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.590
We have an harmonic
oscillator, which

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.000
is a fluctuating dipole moment
on each side of the atom.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.190
But we have many, many harmonic
oscillators in between,

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.750
which is the
electromagnetic field.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.870
And during the course
of this lecture,

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.520
I will refer to
both the zero point

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.340
energy of the atomic
oscillator and the zero point

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.110
energy of the oscillator, which
is the electromagnetic field.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.840
And to give you the
result at the end,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.110
I will sort of explain
different effects

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.380
by the zero point oscillation
of the atoms, other effects

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.060
by the zero point oscillation
of the electromagnetic field.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.990
But at the end of this
section, which is probably

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.350
after spring break on
Monday, I will actually

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:04.180
tell you that you
have to be careful.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.630
If you have quantum
physics, you have

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.450
to use a consistent description.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.330
And you always need that
both the field and the atoms

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.090
are quantized and give
zero point fluctuations.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.650
And when I'm telling you
now that the van der Waals

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.590
potential is due
only to zero point

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.830
fluctuations of the
atomic oscillator,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.880
there may be another way
of getting the same result

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.670
by looking at the zero
point fluctuations

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.570
of the electromagnetic field.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.100
So I just want you
to take what I'm

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.480
saying to you-- I'm not
saying to you anything wrong.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.950
But it may not be the
only way of expressing it.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.480
And I want you just to
pay attention to it.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.880
But certain effects
can be simply described

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.390
by just simply looking at
the atomic oscillators.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.190
Why do we need the quantized
electromagnetic field

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.410
when all we want to do
is have a stray field

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.830
coupling two capacitors.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.315
So we want to always
learn about the simplest

00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:04.190
way to understanding an effect.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.810
But then in the end, there
are maybe certain subtleties.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.430
OK.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.150
But let's keep it simple.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.100
So it's a zero point energy
of the two oscillators.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:29.100
And maybe let me emphasize
this by translating

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.770
this description-- what we
learned from the capacitors.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.130
Let me give you the Coulomb
description of the atom.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:44.140
So an atom really never have in
free space a spontaneous dipole

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.500
moment.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:51.940
But because of zero
point oscillation,

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.400
it will have a dipole
moment squared.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.240
So what happens now is,
let's say at some moment,

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.410
we have a fluctuation.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.090
One atom happens to
have a fluctuation

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.730
of the dipole moment.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:20.140
This creates an electric field
at the position of the atom, b.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.790
So this is a fluctuating field.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.830
The fluctuating
field, because there's

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:39.490
a finite polarizability,
induces now

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:47.460
a dipole moment of the atom, db.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.610
I will later introduced
polarizabilities.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.420
But here, it's just
proportional to Eb.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.794
So that's proportional
to da over R cubed.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.619
So now, we have no longer
randomly fluctuating

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.869
dipole moments with da db,
which are out of phase.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.329
Positive and minus cancels out.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.550
We have a dipole
moment, da, which

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.280
creates-- through
polarizability--

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.569
an aligned dipole moment, db.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:30.700
And for those, we have now
the dipole-dipole interaction,

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.370
which is db da over R cubed.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.310
And when db changes
sign, da changes signs.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.300
So the product of them
will always stay the same.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.110
And now, we find that
we have an interaction.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.360
If you look, db
was 1 over R cubed.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.190
And if you multiply
that with the R

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.500
cubed of the
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.070
we obtain, in a
very different way,

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:06.220
the van der Waals potential,
which is 1 over R to the sixth.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.810
So therefore, what
we can take away

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:20.830
from that is that the 1 over
R to the sixth potential

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:34.970
is caused by the zero
point fluctuations

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.510
of the atomic dipole moments.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:49.510
OK.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.900
So now you have already
three different ways

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.840
to look at the van
der Waals potential.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.480
One is just doing
perturbation theory

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.200
and not understanding anything.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.850
The second one is
the ground state

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.000
of two coupled oscillators,
a la two capacitors.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.310
And finally, the fact that
spontaneous fluctuations create

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.730
stimulated fluctuations,
and then there

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.590
is a quadratic term,
which doesn't vanish.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.230
OK.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:30.166
Well, let's now consider that
the electromagnetic field--

00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:31.790
that there is an
electromagnetic field.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.215
Until now, we have not
really used the fact

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:37.410
that we have an electromagnetic
field with photons.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.810
And the electromagnetic
fields, each mode,

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.300
is an harmonic oscillator.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.170
And each mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.000
has zero point
fluctuation of itself.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:00.250
So let us now discuss what
can the vacuum fluctuations

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.300
of the electromagnetic
field do for us.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:14.510
Well, if we have fluctuations--
momentary fluctuations--

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.710
of the electric
field of the vacuum,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:24.680
the fluctuation at position,
a, and position, b,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:31.104
will induce now dipole
moments of the atoms, a and b,

00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:35.280
by multiplying with the
atomic polarizability.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.350
And if you assume-- I'll say
a little bit more about it--

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.830
that we're talking about
the long wavelengths

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.850
fluctuation of the
electric field.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.520
Then the two dipole
moments, which

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.800
are induced by those
vacuum fluctuations,

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.390
are actually in phase.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.700
So the key word is now that
the vacuum fluctuations

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.255
create correlated
dipole moments.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.422
So the dipole moments are
no longer independently

00:21:04.422 --> 00:21:05.505
fluctuating by themselves.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:26.260
So if you write down now the
dipole-dipole interaction,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.414
we will find a result which
is proportional to the product

00:21:31.414 --> 00:21:32.580
of the two polarizabilities.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.520
The dipole interaction has an
intrinsic spatial dependence,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.200
which is 1 over R cubed.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.590
But now, the important
term is that we

00:21:48.590 --> 00:22:03.430
have to calculate
the correlation

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.500
function of the electric
field at position,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.722
a, and position, b.

00:22:08.722 --> 00:22:10.305
And these are the
vacuum fluctuations.

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:20.920
I'm not doing the
calculation, because it

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.640
would be somewhat messy.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.620
I really post on the web a
fairly easy-to-read paper

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.790
by Larry Spruch
in Physics Today.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.320
And he gives you a
little bit more details.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.320
But you have already the
physics in this equation.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.165
What you should use
now is, you have

00:22:41.165 --> 00:22:42.950
to use the density of modes.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:55.890
And for each mode, the zero
point energy, 1/2 h-bar omega.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:12.690
And then, what you get is,
you get an interaction,

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:18.960
which is 1 over
R to the seventh.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.103
Yes.

00:23:20.103 --> 00:23:22.075
AUDIENCE: When you're
accounting here

00:23:22.075 --> 00:23:25.033
only the dipole moment,
which are [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:25.033 --> 00:23:27.498
So they're coming
from the fluctuation

00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:30.949
of long wavelengths in your EM.

00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:33.907
And once they [INAUDIBLE]
those but they

00:23:33.907 --> 00:23:38.837
are EM field
fluctuation from vacuum.

00:23:38.837 --> 00:23:41.795
So what are the effect
of those shorter waves?

00:23:41.795 --> 00:23:44.270
Are they just higher
energies, or just--

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.730
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.800
Actually, I need
that-- in 10 minutes--

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.410
I need exactly the
answer to your question.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.740
So let me give you
the answer right now.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.810
If you look at this
expression, there

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:58.460
are two things which
come into place.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:06.030
One is we have now two atoms
separated by a distance, R,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.060
which is ra minus rb .

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.250
If you take, now, high frequency
modes, which are very short

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.730
wavelengths, and you
integrate and sum over

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:21.440
all of them, it's pretty
clear that you will get

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.780
plus and minus, which will
completely average out.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:35.430
So it seems very clear that
the modes with wavelengths,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:40.930
lambda, shorter-- definitely
much shorter-- than R average

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.430
out.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.800
So therefore, the bulk
of the contribution

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.960
will actually come from
the modes with wavelengths

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.310
smaller than R.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.080
But now, there is
something else.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.375
The density of states for
the electromagnetic field

00:24:58.375 --> 00:25:02.480
dramatically increases
with frequency, omega.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.820
So we have many more modes
at short wavelengths.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.130
So therefore, the
argument says, well,

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.480
the long wavelength
modes, up to wavelengths,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.850
R, are the dominant ones.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.540
They don't average out.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.730
But because the density
of modes increases,

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.780
the shorter the
wavelength is, by

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.865
far the dominant
contribution, will

00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:32.350
come from the modes, which
are centered around lambda

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.840
equals R.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:41.490
So the density of
modes implies now

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.130
that those modes will dominate.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.480
So that's the answer.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.580
But ultimately, you have to put
everything into an equation,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.410
have an integral,
solve the integral,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.346
do some approximation.

00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:57.720
And you will exactly see
from the density of modes

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.210
that the very long
wavelengths don't contribute.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.810
And you will also see that
because of rapid averaging of E

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.660
to the ikr phase factors,
the high frequency modes

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.616
will not contribute.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:14.770
OK.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.520
So we have now two
different power laws.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.950
One is 1 over R to the sixth.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.490
And one is 1 over
R to the seventh.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.230
So let's explain that now.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:52.790
So we obtain the 1 over R
sixth by using the uncertainty

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.950
principle for atoms.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.360
And here, we have used the
uncertainty principle, the zero

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.340
point fluctuations for
electromagnetic waves.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.350
When we derive the 1
over R sixth potential,

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:23.970
we actually used simply the
electrostatic instantaneous

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.410
Coulomb field dipole field.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:31.560
And this is only valid for
short range when-- you know,

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.830
I said we have a fluctuation
and the fluctuation

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.000
created another one,
which was in phase.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.320
But if one fluctuation
has to send out

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.660
an electromagnetic wave,
the second fluctuation

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:42.990
may not be in.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.660
When propagation
effects come into play,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.560
there's a time lag between
the two oscillators

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.370
and may actually
be out of phase.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.470
So we really assumed
in the derivation,

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.550
without ever saying
it explicitly,

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.160
that there are no
propagation effects.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.200
And this is called the
short range potential.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.690
Whereas, for the second
argument that we said,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.570
we have two distant atoms,
which get synchronized

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.800
by being driven by fluctuations
of the electromagnetic wave

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.900
at wavelengths,
lambda equals R. This

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.720
is what happens at long range.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.720
So this is a famous result,
that we have a van der Waals

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.600
force, which is the
instantaneous force.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.510
And when propagation
effects come into play,

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.560
this goes by the name
Casimir-Polder potential.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.570
The moment when propagation
effects come into play--

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:44.420
when radiation plays a role--
we get a different power law.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.140
So again, I'm just
playing with ideas.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.810
I'm taking a train
of thought, atoms

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.470
fluctuate; another train of
thought, electromagnetic fields

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.702
propagate; and just see,
what are the ramifications?

00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:06.785
What are the consequences?

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.660
So now, I want to
eventually give you

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.936
a treatment, which has
both aspects in one.

00:29:19.936 --> 00:29:21.560
And this is our
diagrammatic treatment.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:30.210
First, before I do
with that, do you

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:35.650
have any idea what
distinguishes the short range

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.530
from the long range potential?

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:38.860
So you have two atoms.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.110
You pull them apart.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.720
And what distance do we have the
1 over R to the sixth physics?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.660
At what distance do
you have the 1 over R

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.670
to the seventh physics?

00:29:53.442 --> 00:29:55.860
AUDIENCE: When
[INAUDIBLE] transitions?

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.310
PROFESSOR: When the
distance is the wavelengths

00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:59.360
of the atomic transition.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.200
That's the only
thing which matters.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.250
You don't get it
immediately from here.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.280
Because-- I mean, I used
an instantaneous potential,

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.660
which didn't have any scale.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.090
And here, I said we
have vacuum fluctuations

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.300
of all wavelengths.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.600
So here, I had a
picture, which clearly

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.830
works at long separation.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:21.020
And propagation
effects are built in,

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.170
because it's a vacuum
fluctuation, which

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.060
sort of act at
position, a and b.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.240
And the wavelengths--
their propagation--

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.430
is part of the formulation.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:35.642
But yes, Bohr's
conjecture that it

00:30:35.642 --> 00:30:39.000
is the wavelengths of the
atom-- the wavelengths

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.040
of the resonant
radiation-- is correct.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.780
But I want to show
you now how we

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.130
can obtain this
result in a, I think,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.500
really elegant and
beautiful way by looking

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.390
at the diagrams we
have just learned.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.560
OK.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.940
What did we just have?

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.130
Time to do that, yes.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.040
Any questions here?

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.330
The reason why I want to
show it diagrammatically

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:14.580
is actually two fold.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.430
One is, it's really
beautiful how it comes out.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.910
But the second thing is, when I
introduced the Feynman diagrams

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:27.620
and all of these formulation
in terms of propagators,

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.510
I gave you a wonderful picture.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.170
But in the end, I reduced
it to first and second order

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.420
perturbation theory.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.410
So I want to show you at
least one nontrivial example

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:42.280
where you would not
get the result easily

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.910
without this formalism.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.910
So enjoy one nontrivial
application of diagrams.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:16.440
So if you follow the systematic
way, how we have set up

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.230
our formulation of
quantum electrodynamic

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.370
with a photon field-- the
quantized photon field--

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:28.850
then the two neutral atoms have
no direct Coulomb interaction.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.500
I just want to point that out.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.920
Because a few
minutes ago, when I

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.130
said a classical system is just
Coulomb field-- each charge

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.050
element has a Coulomb potential
with the other charge element--

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.250
this was just the
opposite approach.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:52.140
But in our QED formulation,
we have sold our soul.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.100
We have said we only
really got the near field,

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.430
the longitudinal field,
as belonging to the atoms.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.780
Everything which
happens at longer range

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:06.740
is included in our
atom-photon Hamiltonian.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.590
So therefore, there is no
direct Coulomb interaction

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.430
for the longitudinal field.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:17.790
Everything, everything now, has
to come from the interaction--

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:23.290
the perturbation operator-- for
the quantized radiation field.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:28.100
And therefore, we
must get it out.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.030
We have one atom;
it's d1 at d prime.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:37.480
I think that's how it's-- I'm
using now the nomenclature,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:44.450
which is used in atom-photon
interaction, pages 121 to 126.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.260
And so, there is one atom
at the unprimed location,

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.200
one atom at the time
primed location.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.680
And everything has
to come out now

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.650
of the formulation of the
quantized radiation field.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.240
And we have discussed
that lengths

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.920
at the transverse electric
field become operators,

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:11.460
a plus a dagger-- the symbol
for the dipole operators

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.857
are acting on the atoms.

00:34:13.857 --> 00:34:14.690
We've done all that.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.070
So then the only thing
which happens is--

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.270
and this is described
by a and a dagger--

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.030
is the exchange of photons.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.060
So the only way how those two
neutral objects can interact

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.560
is through the radiation field.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.560
And through the
radiation field means

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.920
they have to emit photons.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.130
So I want to show you now
that the van der Waals

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.340
interaction can be thought of
as one atom emitting a photon.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.510
But this virtual
photon is absorbed

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.090
by the other atom
and vice versa.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.940
And you may have
heard quite often--

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.560
but I'm not sure if you've
seen it explicitly--

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.280
that a lot of
interactions in physics

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.120
are actually mediated by the
exchange of virtual particles.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.180
The famous example is
that the nuclear force

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.295
comes from a virtual
exchange of pions.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.490
But then, people say,
the Coulomb force

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.840
comes from a virtual
exchange of photons.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.490
But usually, we
don't really show you

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.870
how this virtual
exchange of photons work.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.590
So in that sense,
I'm proud that I

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.350
can show you, at least
the basic outline, how

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.170
virtual exchange of photons
between two neutral atoms

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.986
leads to the van
der Waals potential.

00:35:34.986 --> 00:35:35.860
So that's our agenda.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:45.030
OK.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:57.202
Now the fact that this takes
six pages in the book--

00:35:57.202 --> 00:35:59.760
and the book is not
solving all equations--

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.570
means if you really want
to do it quantitatively,

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.520
it has a certain complexity.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.110
But what I've done is, I've sort
of distilled out the grand idea

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.520
and which also shows
you what happens

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.560
when you go from short
range to long range.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.140
And this is what I
want to present you.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.200
And therefore, I take
[? Benji's ?] question

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.760
and will not discuss
all the modes

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.330
of the electromagnetic field.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:34.630
I will immediately use the fact
that the dominant contribution

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:42.700
comes from modes.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.450
And since we don't
have real photons,

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.220
we don't have energy to create
real photons when everything

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.310
is in the current state.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.281
We call them virtual photons.

00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:53.280
Virtual photons are photons
which are immediate.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.696
But a short time later, because
of Heisenberg uncertainty,

00:36:55.696 --> 00:36:56.990
have to disappear.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:04.420
So the dominant contribution
comes from virtual photons

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:09.920
at the wavelengths, which is
D, the distance between atoms.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.500
So the frequency, which
will play an important role,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.470
is simply the frequency
of those virtual photons.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.130
And I gave you already the
reason-- the density of states

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.550
which favor higher frequencies.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.700
But higher frequencies
cancel, because of the E

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.740
to the ikr terms.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.080
So we only focus on those.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:50.250
The second thing I
need is that when

00:37:50.250 --> 00:38:01.010
we do perturbation theory, the
energy shift in perturbation

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:09.900
theory-- well, if
you do second order,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:15.460
you go from the initial state
to an intermediate state.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.660
And then, you go from the
intermediate state, one,

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.700
to the final state.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.900
And what you have
to do is, you have

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.745
to divide by the
energy denominator.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:34.790
If you do higher and higher
order perturbation theory,

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.010
in our diagrammatic
presentation,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.760
that means we have propagators
at intermediate energies.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.020
And I told you that
the time an atom can

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:49.720
spend in an intermediate state
is 1 over the energy defect.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:58.400
And if you integrate the
E to the i energy defect

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.950
factor over time,
you get something

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:04.300
which is proportional
to 1 over delta E.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.430
So therefore, if you
perform the time integration

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:12.210
of the perturbation
analysis, you

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:16.710
find by integrating over the
short time particles spend

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.490
in the intermediate
state, you actually

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.030
generate those
energy denominators.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:24.860
That's actually the relationship
between the time propagation

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.100
I showed you earlier.

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.630
And when you integrate
over the time,

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.410
you get for this intermediate
state, a contribution,

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.780
which is 1 over
the energy defect

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.630
over the intermediate state.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.650
So therefore, if you go now
to higher order perturbation

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:51.700
theory, we simply have a
product of matrix elements

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.040
in the numerator.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.735
And in the denominator, we have
a product of energy defects.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.000
You are using that all the time
for second order perturbation

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.590
theory, but the structure
is that you can just

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.556
sort of daisy chain
the expression.

00:40:13.556 --> 00:40:15.430
And you get higher order
perturbation theory.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.660
So therefore, all we will have
to understand to figure out

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.530
what happens when virtual
photons are exchanged,

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.740
I will just show you
two relevant diagrams.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.560
And we just look-- we
stare at the diagrams--

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.090
and figure out what
are these denominators?

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.795
What are those energy defects?

00:40:38.795 --> 00:40:40.545
And we will find that
there's a difference

00:40:40.545 --> 00:40:42.190
at long range and short range.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.140
So that's the agenda.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.760
So we will need two energies.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.840
One energy is the energy
of the virtual photon,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.580
which is exchanged.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.080
And the second
energy, or frequency,

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:05.141
is the resonant
frequency of the atom.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:25.820
So let's look at two
relevant diagrams.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.590
So one is atom,
a; one is atom, b.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.200
We are interested
in interactions

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.740
between atoms in
the ground state.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.500
And after a
sufficiently long time,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.580
both atoms have to be
back in the ground state.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.550
Let me just get this organized,
one, two, three, four.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.750
And the result is obtained
in fourth order perturbation

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.590
theory.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.970
It has to be fourth
order, because we

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.870
need photon exchange.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.340
To emit a photon here, absorb
it here, is second order.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.520
But then, one atom is
in the excited state

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.630
and this can't be.

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.430
So a second photon is
required to undo the effect.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.850
So we need exchange
of photon pairs.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.780
Each exchange means
absorption and emission.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.200
That means two vertices.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.980
And photon pairs
means another two.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.410
So we need fourth order
perturbation theory.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:47.910
OK.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:52.590
But it's much, much
easier than you think.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.640
So we have a ground state atom.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.430
And now the action starts.

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.920
This is the first vertex.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.240
It emits a photon.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:05.380
The photon is absorbed
by the other atom, which

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.990
puts the atom into
the excited state.

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:11.490
This atom is also in the
excited state, of course.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:28.880
And then, we know the atom
cannot stay in the excited

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.210
state for a long time.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:37.920
It can now emit a second
photon, which brings it back

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.030
to the ground state.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:45.325
And the second photon
is absorbed by atom, b,

00:43:45.325 --> 00:43:47.200
and puts the atom back
into the ground state.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.520
So this is one relevant diagram.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:44:01.790
And let me analyze it
in the energy defects.

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:05.320
Here, in the first
intermediate step,

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.670
the energy defect is--
well, we have ground-ground.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.910
This is sort our reference.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:17.070
But now, we have put one
atom into the excited state.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.630
That causes energy,
omega naught.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.290
And we have created
one photon, omega.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:27.100
Here in that time step,
there are no photons,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.740
but there are two excited atoms.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.700
And in the third time step,
we have still one atom

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.280
in the excited state
and one photon.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.250
Now, this is one relevant class.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.200
I mean, you can now use
permutations at atom, b,

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.930
excites photons first and such.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.570
But the structure of
many of these diagrams

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:55.360
will be the same that we have
those three energy defects.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.540
But now, we have
another possibility.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.420
And this is, one
atom emits a photon,

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:06.570
but it feels it doesn't
want to be excited,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.930
because the excitation
energy is so precious.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.760
It wants to immediately
return to the ground state.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.170
So we could have a situation
that the atom fires

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:21.140
a second photon before the
first photon is absorbed.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.370
So the diagram-- the relevant
diagram-- is now this.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.220
So the atom started
in the ground state,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.460
is in the excited state,
but as soon as possible,

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.550
goes back to the ground state.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.080
And the other atom starts
out in ground state,

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:49.470
is in the excited state, and
is back in the ground state.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:55.360
So what we have here is, we have
again three intermediate steps.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:58.990
In the first step, of course,
we have an excited atom

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:03.800
and a photon.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.810
And we have the same here.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.450
But now the difference is,
that in the intermediate step,

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:13.890
our energy defect is not
two atomic excitations,

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.755
it is two photonic excitations.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.620
And now we want to
compare those two diagrams

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:31.565
for short and for long range.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.360
And it becomes clear
that short range

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:48.170
is where the frequency
of the photon--

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.680
its wavelength is lambda.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.410
Short range means
high frequency.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.450
The frequency of
the photon is larger

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.980
than the atomic
excitation energy.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.480
Or that means, the
distance is smaller

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.570
than the resonant
wavelength of the photon.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:09.750
Whereas, long range is
that the atomic excitation

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.835
is more precious than
the photonic excitation.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:18.780
OK.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:25.330
So I need three more minutes.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:30.390
So it just fits
into the class time.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.980
So we are here in
the limit that omega

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.360
is larger than omega naught.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.580
So that means, if we take now
the product of the three energy

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.400
denominators, omega
dominates over omega naught.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:47.400
So we'll have this structure
omega, omega naught, omega.

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.435
Omega, omega naught, omega.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.950
Whereas, at long range,
omega naught dominates.

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.030
We have omega naught,
omega naught, omega naught.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:10.950
So the structure of the
product of energy denominators

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.616
is 1 over omega naught.

00:48:13.616 --> 00:48:17.890
If you look on the
right hand side,

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.550
we have replaced-- in
the intermediate part

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.100
in the propagator-- the
energy defect by omega naught

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.100
by omega.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:34.370
So therefore, in this case,
we have 1 over omega cubed

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:39.000
and 1 over omega
naught squared, omega.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.110
So we know that when we
sum up over diagrams,

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.680
we have to sum up over
all possibly diagrams.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:51.040
And the ones which dominate
at short range are those ones

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.110
and at long range
are the other ones.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:01.600
So in other words,
at short range,

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.620
one photon is exchanged
and disappears.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.590
And then, the next photon comes.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:11.860
But at long range,
we have an exchange

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.480
that one atom sends out two
photons almost simultaneously.

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.040
And the other atom absorbs them.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.570
Because it sends them out
almost simultaneously.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:25.470
Because here, we are talking
about long wavelength photons,

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.260
and photons are cheaper.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.260
Rather send out two photons
before you spend too much time

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.920
in the excited state.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.420
OK.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.320
Let's wrap it up.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:44.160
Since omega is proportional
to 1 over the wavelengths,

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.540
which was-- and I said the
photons we are concentrating,

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:59.566
is the photons which have a
wavelength of the distance, D .

00:49:59.566 --> 00:50:03.630
So what we are realizing
now is that, if you just

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:11.840
compare those diagrams
at long range,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.750
we go from 1 over omega
squared to 1 over omega.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:34.540
So at long range-- omega is--
we have an additional factor

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:41.340
of omega, which is 1 over D.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:45.180
And so now, if you
assume-- I can't show you

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.220
that without solving
the real problem--

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.070
but if you assume
that at short range,

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:55.860
we have 1 over R to the sixth--
van der Waals potential--

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.590
then at least, I've proven
to you that at long range,

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.690
you get one more
power in the distance.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.500
And this is a transition from an
instantaneous potential, where

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:11.080
propagation effects
do not matter,

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.905
to what is called
retarded potential.

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:25.790
So that's all I
wanted to show you

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.610
about interactions
between two neutral atoms.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.460
Are there any questions?

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:32.960
Timor?

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.160
AUDIENCE: Does it matter the
direction of both the photons

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:36.810
that we drew?

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:40.080
For example, can
atom, a, emit to b, b

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:44.564
absorbs, and b emits
to a, rather than--

00:51:44.564 --> 00:51:46.260
PROFESSOR: In
practice, it matters.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:50.340
When you solve it, you have
to sum over all possibilities.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:54.307
Remember, quantum mechanics
in the system does everything.

00:51:54.307 --> 00:51:56.140
It doesn't care whether
it's allowed or not.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:59.150
It tries everything out, whether
it violates energy or not.

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.910
And you have to sum
over everything.

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:04.550
But if you then analyze
all the possible diagrams,

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:09.530
you will actually figure out
that they can-- no matter

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:13.030
what you do, what permutation
of photons and atoms you

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:16.470
have-- the fourth order
diagrams will be such

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:19.190
that they are
always distinguished

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:23.630
by in this intermediate
zone, whether you have

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.270
two atomic excitations
or photonic excitations.

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.430
And so what I do for you
were the two diagrams,

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:37.590
which are representative for a
whole class of diagrams here.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:40.311
But absolutely,
yes, you are right.

00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:40.810
OK.

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:42.330
So that's all about
neutral atoms.

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:46.129
I know you have spring break
next week-- MIT spring break.

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:48.045
Maybe that's good news
for the Harvard people,

00:52:48.045 --> 00:52:50.311
who-- when is
Harvard's spring break?

00:52:50.311 --> 00:52:52.566
AUDIENCE: We just finished.

00:52:52.566 --> 00:52:53.430
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.360
So you have-- at
least for this class,

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.270
you have a second spring break.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.240
So we are not yet finished
with van der Waals and passing

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.950
interactions, but we
finished the neutral atoms.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.210
And on Monday
after spring break,

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.950
we talk about interactions
between metal plate

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.550
and atoms in two metal plates.
