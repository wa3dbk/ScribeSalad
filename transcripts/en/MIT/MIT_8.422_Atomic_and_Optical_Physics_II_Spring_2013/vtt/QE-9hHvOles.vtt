00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:22.095
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.180
We continue our discussion
of quantum states of light.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.210
We talked at length
about coherent state,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.720
and when you talk about
quantum states of light,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.400
each mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.040
is an harmonic oscillator.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.690
We also encountered,
naturally, the number states.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.243
And we realized--
yesterday, actually,

00:00:51.243 --> 00:00:54.140
in the last class-- that
those number states have

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.190
non-classical properties.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.490
For instance, they have a g2
function, the second order

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.790
correlation function,
which is smaller

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.230
than 1, which is impossible
for classic light,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.670
as you're proving in one of
your homework assignment.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.580
So at that point, we have
encountered coherent states,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.830
which are as close as
possible to classical states.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.360
And we have found the number
states as non-classical states.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.950
Well, are there other
interesting states?

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.450
I wouldn't ask you this question
if the answer would not be yes,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.690
and this is what we
want to discuss today.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.420
We want to talk about
non-classical states of light,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.710
which we can engineer,
actually, in the laboratory,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.970
by sending laser light
through nonlinear crystals.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.030
Those go by the name,
squeezed states.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.540
Just to give you
the cartoon picture,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.350
in our two-dimensional diagram,
with the quasi-probabilities,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.990
we have coherent
states, where the area

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.640
of this disk, delta x
delta p, is h-bar over two.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.970
It's uncertainty limited.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.140
What we can do we now, is--
we cannot go beyond this.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.750
This is the fundamental
limit of quantum physics.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.390
However, we can take this
circle and we can squeeze it.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.090
We can squeeze it
horizontally, we can squeeze it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.170
into an elongated
vertical shape,

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.140
or we can squeeze
it at any angle.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.280
That's what we call,
squeezed states.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.570
And those states have
non-classical properties.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.125
They are important
for metrology they

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.110
are important for teleportation.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.580
There are lots and
lots of reasons

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.620
why you want to know about them.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.930
But again, as so often, I
feel I cannot convey to you

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.670
the excitement of doing
squeezing in the quantum

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.460
domain.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.343
And many, many
physicists now, they

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:20.510
hear about squeezing just
in the quantum domain.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.810
But I want to start with
classical squeezing.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.140
I will actually show you
video of an experiment

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.430
on classical squeezing.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.020
You can see squeezing
with your own eyes.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.760
But this is just sort
of to set the stage,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.860
to also get a feel
of what squeezing is.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.655
And then we'll do quantum
mechanical squeezing.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.280
But maybe-- tongue
in cheek-- I would

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.400
say, since classical harmonic
oscillators and quantum

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.730
harmonic oscillators
have a lot in common,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.310
the step from classical
squeezing to quantum

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.520
of mechanical squeezing
is actually rather small.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.420
It's nice to squeeze light.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.890
It's nice to have those
non-classical states.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.560
But the question is,
how can you detect it?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.890
If you can't detect it, you
can't take advantage of it.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.730
And the detection has
to be face-coherent.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.380
I will tell you what that is.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.770
And it goes by the name,
homodyne detection.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.970
And finally, we
can take everything

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.440
we have learned together, and
discuss how, in the laboratory,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.681
teleportation of a
quantum state is done.

00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.140
There is a nice
teleportation scheme,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.190
and I want to use
that as an example

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.540
that the language and the
concepts I've introduced

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.290
are useful.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.250
Concepts like,
squeezing operator,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.330
displacement operator--
those methods

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.657
allowing us to, in
a very clear way,

00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:56.490
discuss schemes which
lead to teleportation.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.340
That's the menu for today.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.645
Let's start with
classical squeezing.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.590
For squeezing, we need
an harmonic oscillator,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.010
means for parabolic potential,
we have potential v of x.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.681
And then we study
the motion of-- that

00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:47.910
should be x squared-- the
motion of a particle in there.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.800
Before I even get
started any equation,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.660
let me explain what the effect
of squeezing will be about.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.560
If you have an
harmonic oscillator,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.910
you have, actually, the
motion of a pendulum.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.240
It has two quadrature
components, the cosine motion

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.430
and the sine motion.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.470
And they are 90
degrees out of phase.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.780
What happens now is,
if you parametrically

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.590
drive the harmonic
oscillator-- you modulate

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.930
the harmonic oscillator
potential-- it's to omega.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.390
I will show you mathematically,
it's very, very easy to show,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.460
that depending on the
phase of the drive,

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.720
you will actually exponentially
amplify the sine motion,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.900
and exponentially damp
the cosine motion.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.030
Or if you change, vice versa.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.290
So by driving the system, you
can amplify one quadrature

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.490
component, and exponentially
die out the other quadrature

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.709
component.

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.375
And that is called,
classical squeezing.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.640
Let's do the math.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.680
It's very simple.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:11.830
Our equation of motion
has the two solutions

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.940
I've just mentioned.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:19.780
It has a solution
with cosine omega 0,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.950
and one with sine omega 0 t.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.300
And we have two coefficients.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.030
The cosine is called, c.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.830
The sine coefficient
is called, s.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.740
I have to call it c 0, because
I want to call that c and s.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:08:02.610
So what we have here is, we have
the two quadrature components

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.770
of the motion in an
harmonic oscillator.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.450
And graphically, we need that
for the electromagnetic field,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.560
as well.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.210
When we have our two
axes, like, you know,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.820
the complex plane for the
cosine of probabilities,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.730
I call one the s-axis.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.630
One is the c-axis.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.710
That's just something
which confuses me.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:51.720
If you have only one--
just give me one second.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.220
Cosine-- Yeah.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:03.820
If you have only cosine
motion, the s component is 0,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.560
and the harmonic oscillator
would just oscillate here.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.700
If you have only
a sine component,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.085
you stay on the x-axis.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:21.550
And now, if you have an equal
amount of cosine and sine,

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:27.120
then you can describe the
trajectory to go in a circle.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.220
OK.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.630
This is just the undriven
harmonic oscillator.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.510
I don't want to dwell
on it any longer.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.370
But what we are
doing now is, we are

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.990
adding a small parametric drive.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:01.330
Parametric drive means we
modulate the spring constant,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:08.090
or we replace the original
harmonic potential,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:14.710
which was this, by an
extra modulation term.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.930
So we have a small
parameter, epsilon.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.610
And as I pointed
out, the modulation

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.450
is at twice the
resonance frequency.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.300
Now we want to solve
the equation of motion

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.320
for the harmonic oscillator,
using this added potential.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:51.960
The way how we want to solve
it is, we assume epsilon

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.420
is very small.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.420
So if the pendulum is
swinging with cosine omega t,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.770
it will take a while
for the epsilon

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.520
term-- for the small term--
to change the motion.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.710
So therefore, we assume
that we can actually

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:12.550
go back and use our
original solution.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:16.386
And assume that
over a short term,

00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:18.010
the epsilon term is
not doing anything.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.710
So for a short time, it looks
like an harmonic oscillator

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.660
with a sine omega 0, and
cosine omega 0 t oscillation.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.830
But over any longer
period of time,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.530
the small term will
have an effect.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.560
And therefore, the
coefficients c of t, c, and s

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.680
are no longer constant, but
change as a function of time.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.560
We want to solve, now,
the equation of motion.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:07.440
That means we use this,
here, as our ansatz.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:15.300
And we calculate the
second derivative.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:23.100
We assume that the coefficients
c and s are changing slowly.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.130
Therefore, the second derivative
of c and s can be neglected.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.370
By taking the derivative
of the second derivative

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.010
of the cosine term
and the sine term,

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:48.950
of course we simply get,
minus omega 0 squared, x of t.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.510
And now we have the
second-order derivatives.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.070
Since we neglect the
second-order derivative of c

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.580
and s, the other
terms we get when

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.310
we take the second derivative
is, first derivative

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.230
of c times first
derivative of cosine.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.190
First derivative of s times
first derivative of sine.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:21.460
So we get two more terms,
which are, minus omega 0 c dot,

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.880
times sine omega 0 t.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:36.690
Plus omega 0 s dot,
times cosine omega 0 t.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.305
This is the second derivative
of our ansatz for x.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.780
This has to be equal
to the force provided

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.760
by the potential.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.440
So taking the potential--

00:14:28.424 --> 00:14:30.340
We need, now, the
derivative of the potential,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.260
for the potential of
use across this line.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.020
The first part is the
unperturbed harmonic

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.460
oscillator, which
gives us simply,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.430
omega 0 squared times x.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:49.670
And the second term, due to
the parametric drive, is 2

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.430
sine omega 0 t.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.835
And now, for x,
we use our ansatz

00:14:56.835 --> 00:15:01.640
for x, which is the
slowly-changing amplitude c

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.080
times cosine omega 0 t,
plus s times sine omega 0 t.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.130
Those two terms cancel out.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.980
So now we have products
of trig function.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.140
Sine 2 omega times cosine omega.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:38.270
Well, you know if you take the
product of two trig functions,

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.680
it becomes a trig function
of the sum or the difference

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.110
of the argument.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.620
So if you take sine 2 omega
0 times cosine omega 0,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.520
and we use trigonometric
identities,

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:58.290
we get an oscillation at 3
omega 0, which is 2 plus 1.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.380
And one at the difference,
which is omega 0.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.500
Let me write down the terms
which are of interest to us.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.220
Namely, the ones at omega 0.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:15.580
So let me factor out epsilon
omega 0 squared over 2.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:23.395
Then we have the term c times
sine omega 0 t, plus s times

00:16:23.395 --> 00:16:23.895
cosine.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:33.640
And then we have
terms at 3 omega

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.680
0, which we are
going to neglect.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.530
Now we compare the two
sides of the equations.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.380
We have sine omega 0 term.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.710
We have cosine omega 0 term.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.040
And the two sides
of the equations

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.770
are only consistent if the two
coefficients of the sine term,

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.800
and the sine term, are the same.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.634
So therefore, we
obtain two equations.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.920
One for c dot, one for s dot.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.480
And these are first-order
differential equations.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.050
The solution is
clearly an exponential.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.380
But one has a plus sign,
one has a minus sign.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.710
So the c component, the
c quadrature component,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.840
is exponentially amplified
with this time constant.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.990
Whereas the sine component is
exponentially de-amplified.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.800
This finishes the
mathematical discussion

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.210
of classical squeezing.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:08.220
We find that s of t, and c of
t, are exponential functions.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:18.290
In one case, it's
exponentially increasing.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:25.810
In the other case, it is
exponentially decreasing.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:32.940
And that means that, well,
if we go to our diagram,

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.625
here-- and let's assume
we had an arbitrary

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:40.570
superposition of cosine
and sine amplitude.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.870
This is cosine.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.210
This is sine.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:55.880
We had sort of a
cosine oscillation,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.500
and a sine oscillation.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:08.920
Which means that, as
a phasor, the system

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.590
was moving on an ellipse.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.770
If the sine component is
exponentially de-amplified,

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.190
and the cosine component
is exponentially amplified,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:25.110
that means whatever we start
with is squashed horizontally,

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.810
is squashed vertically.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:31.480
And is amplified horizontally.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.809
In the end, it will
become a narrow strip.

00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:36.100
So this is classical squeezing.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.740
You may want to ask, why did
I neglect the 3 omega 0 term.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:50.110
Well, I have to, otherwise
I don't have a solution.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.730
Because I have to be consistent
with my approximations.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.200
So what I did here
is, I had an equation

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.540
where I have the clear
vision that the solution has

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.300
a slowly varying c
and s coefficient.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.730
And then I simply use that.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.150
I take the second-order
derivative,

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.410
and I have only
Fourier components

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.930
with omega 0, the
sine, and cosine.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:22.740
Now I've made an
approximation, here.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.530
For the derivative
of the potential,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.690
the first line is exact.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.040
But in order to match
the approximation

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.450
I've done on the
other side, I can only

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.910
focus on two Fourier components
resonant with omega 0,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.450
which I have here.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.140
So in other words,
the 3 omega 0 term

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.900
would lead to additional
accelerations.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.910
Which I have not included
in the treatment.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.512
So it's consistent
with the ansatz.

00:20:51.512 --> 00:20:52.970
It's consistent
with the assumption

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.490
that we have
resonant oscillations

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.515
with a slowly
changing amplitude.

00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:00.640
There will be a small
[INAUDIBLE] for your omega 0,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.190
but it will be small.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.340
Any questions about that?

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:20.580
Let me then show you
an animation of that.

00:21:27.394 --> 00:21:28.060
Classroom files.

00:21:31.184 --> 00:21:31.850
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.775
-We have Dave Pritchard,
professor of physics at MIT,

00:21:34.775 --> 00:21:37.860
demonstrating what squeezing is.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.450
Right now, we see a wave that's
going around in a circle.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:42.250
What's next?

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.660
What's going to happen
now, Professor Pritchard?

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.890
-Well, if we drive it in
twice the basic period,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.440
then we will parametrically
amplify one quadrature

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.239
component, and we will
un-amplify the other one.

00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:58.780
So now I'm going to
start doing that.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.550
And then you notice that its
motion turns into an ellipse.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.440
We've amplified this
quadrature component,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.605
but we've un-amplifed that one.

00:22:11.605 --> 00:22:14.830
And that's squeezing.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.605
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:16.605 --> 00:22:18.230
PROFESSOR: Feel free
to try it at home.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:20.284 --> 00:22:21.700
PROFESSOR: Actually,
you may start

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.060
to think about
this demonstration.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.210
What he has shown was, when you
have a circular pendulum which

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.560
goes in a circle or
an ellipse, and you

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.290
start pulling on the rope
with a certain phase,

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.540
that one quadrature component
will be de-amplified.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.460
The other one will be amplified.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.620
And as a result, no
matter what the circular

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.140
or the elliptical motion was,
after driving it for a while,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.204
it will only swing
in one direction.

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.120
And this is the collection
you have amplified.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.350
There is one thing which
should give you pause.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:03.670
I have discussed, actually,
a single harmonic oscillator.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.510
What Dave Pritchard
demonstrated was actually

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.300
two harmonic oscillators.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.250
The harmonic oscillator has
an x motion and a y motion.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.810
However, you can
say, this was just

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.120
sort of a trick for
the demonstration,

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.370
because when you have
a circular motion,

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.970
initially, you
have the sine omega

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.744
and the cosine omega 0 component
present simultaneously.

00:23:26.744 --> 00:23:28.410
And you can see what
happens to the sine

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.970
and the cosine component
in one experiment.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.181
So in that sense, he did
two experiments at once.

00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:35.180
He showed what happens
when you have, initially,

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.500
a sine component, and what
happens when you initially

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.660
have a cosine component.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.200
OK.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.630
So we know what
classical squeezing is.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:49.300
And what we have learned, also--
and this helps me now a lot

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.610
to motivate how we squeeze
in quantum mechanics--

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.100
you have realized that what
is really essential here is,

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.610
to drive it to omega 0.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.020
What we need now to do
squeezing in the quantum domain,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:08.210
if we want to squeeze light,
we need something at 2 omega 0.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:18.910
So let's now squeeze
quantum mechanically.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.700
Go back here.

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.315
The second sub-section is
now, squeezed quantum states.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.330
What we want to
discuss is, we want

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.520
to discuss a quantum
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:07.940
We want to have some form of
parametric drive at 2 omega 0.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.240
And this will result
in squeezed states.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:28.510
Now, what does it require, if
you want to bring in 2 omega 0?

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.480
Well, let's not forget
our harmonic oscillators

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.470
are modes of the
electromagnetic field.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.440
If you now want to couple a mode
of the electromagnetic field,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:44.390
at 2 omega 0, with our
harmonic oscillator at omega 0,

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:48.070
we need a coupling between
two electromagnetic fields.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.000
So therefore, we need nonlinear
interactions between photons.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.270
So this was a tautology.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.347
We need nonlinear
physics, which leads

00:25:58.347 --> 00:25:59.680
to interactions between photons.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.520
Linear physics means,
each harmonic oscillator

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.950
is independent.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.130
So we need some
nonlinear process

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:14.214
six which will be equivalent
to have interactions

00:26:14.214 --> 00:26:14.880
between photons.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.900
The device which we
will provide that

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.550
is an optical
parametric oscillator.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.250
I could spend a long
time explaining to you

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.810
how those nonlinear
crystals work.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.360
What is the polarization,
what is the polarizability,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.110
how do you drive it,
what is the nonlinearity.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:01.120
But for the discussion
in this class,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.360
which focuses on
fundamental concepts,

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.070
I can actually bypass
it by just saying,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.910
assume you have a system--
and this is actually

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.010
what the optical
parametric oscillator does,

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:17.060
is you pump it with
photons at 2 omega 0.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:26.240
And then the crystal generates
two photons at omega 0.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.490
Which of course, is consistent
with energy conservation.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.250
And if you fulfill some
phase-matching condition,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.590
it's also consistent with
momentum conservation.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.100
But I don't want to go into
phase-matching at this point.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.800
Technically, this is
done as simple as that.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.120
You have to pick
the right crystal.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.940
Actually, a crystal which does
mixing between three photon

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.850
fields cannot have
inversion symmetry,

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.160
otherwise this
nonlinear term is 0.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.110
What you need is
a special crystal.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.780
KDP is a common choice.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.415
And this crystal will now
do for us the following.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.900
You shine in laser light.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.000
Let's say, at 532
nanometer, a green light.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:31.080
And then this photon breaks up
into two photons of omega 0.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.490
This is how it's done
in the laboratory.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.170
The piece of art is, you have
to pick the right crystal.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.030
It has to be cut
at the right angle.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.840
You may have to heat
it, and make sure

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.440
that you select the
temperature for which

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.270
some form of resonant condition
is fulfilled, to do that.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.890
But in essence,
that's what you do.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.230
One laser beam, put in a
crystal, and then the photon

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.310
is broken into two equal parts.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.300
And these are our two
photons at omega 0.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:03.800
OK.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.890
I hope you enjoy the
elegance-- we can completely

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:15.200
bypass all the material physics
by putting operators on it.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.300
We call this mode, b.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.730
And we call this mode, a.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.840
So the whole parametric process,
the down conversion process

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.230
of one photon into
two, is now described

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.310
by the following Hamiltonian.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:36.820
We destroy a photon in
mode b, a 2 omega 0.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:41.090
And now we create
two photons at omega.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.760
We destroy a photon
at 2 omega 0,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.980
create two photons at omega 0.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.330
And since the Hamiltonian
has to be Hamiltonian,

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.780
the opposite, the
time-reverse process,

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.250
has to be possible, too.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.350
And that means we destroy
two photons at omega 0,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.460
and create one
photon at 2 omega 0.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.100
So now we forget about
nonlinear crystals,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.220
about non-inversion
symmetry in materials.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.417
We just take this
Hamiltonian and play with it.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.720
By simply looking
at the Hamiltonian,

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.400
what is the time
evolution of a photon

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.090
field under this Hamiltonian.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.740
We figure out what happens
when you send light

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.170
through a crystal, and
what is the output.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.060
And I want to show you now
that the output of that

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.380
is squeezed light, which is
exactly what I promised you

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.340
with these quasi-probabilities.

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:44.270
We have a coherent state,
which is a nice circle.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:49.990
We time-evolve the coherent
state, our nice round circle,

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.620
with this Hamiltonian.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.870
And what we get is an ellipse.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.190
And if you want intuition,
look at the classical example

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.490
we did before, which
really tells you

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:05.910
in a more intuitive
way what is happening.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.190
OK.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.600
We want to make one
simplifying assumption, here.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.910
And this is that
we pump the crystal

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.320
at 2 omega 0 with a
strong laser beam.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:26.450
So we assume that the mode,
b, is a powerful laser beam.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.440
Or in other words, a
strong coherent state.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:42.030
We assume that the mode,
b, is in a coherent state.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.270
Coherent states
are always labeled

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.940
with a complex parameter,
which I call beta, now.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.150
Well, it's mode b,
therefore I call it, beta.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.580
For mode a, I've
called it, alpha.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.610
The coherent state has an
amplitude, which I call,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.690
r over 2.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:00.670
And it has a phase.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:11.490
We know, of course, that the
operator, b, acting on beta,

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:15.450
gives us beta times beta,
because a coherent state is

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.315
an eigenstate of the
annihilation operator.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:25.590
But when we look at the
action of the operator b

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:32.900
plus, the photon
creation operator,

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.080
the coherent state
is not an eigenstate

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.290
of the creation operator.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.520
It's only an eigenstate of
the annihilation operator.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.100
But what sort of happens
is, the coherent state

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.370
is the sum over many,
many number states with n.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:49.740
And the creation operator
goes from n, to n plus 1,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:56.680
and has matrix elements which
are square root n plus 1.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.850
So in other words,
if n is large,

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:03.740
and if we don't care about the
subtle difference between n,

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.200
and n plus 1, in this
limit the coherent state

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.880
is also an eigenstate of
the creation operator,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.220
with an eigenvalue,
which is beta star.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:28.940
This means that we have a
coherent state which is strong.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.020
Strong means, it has
a large amplitude

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.370
of the electric field.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.820
The photon states which
are involved, n, are large.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.039
And we don't have whether
it be n, or n plus 1.

00:33:40.039 --> 00:33:42.080
This is actually, also,
I should mention it here,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.580
explicitly-- this is
sort of the step when

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.030
we have a quantum
description of light.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:52.630
And we replace the operators,
p and p dega, by a c number,

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.150
then we really go back
to classical physics.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:59.210
Then we pretend that we have a
classical electric field, which

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:05.260
is described by the
imaginary part of beta.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.969
So when you have an Hamiltonian,
where you write down

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.330
an electric field, and
the electric field is not

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.100
changing-- you have an
external electric field.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.830
This is really the limit
of a quantum field,

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.409
where you've eliminated
the operator by a c number.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.110
This is essentially
your electric field.

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.320
And we do this
approximation, here.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.199
Because we are interested in
the quantum features of mode

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:33.540
a-- a is our quantum
mode, with single photons,

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.719
or with a vacuum state,
and we want to squeeze it.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:41.090
b is just, they have
parametric drive.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:46.900
With this approximation, we
have only the a operators.

00:34:58.175 --> 00:34:59.050
This is our operator.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.724
Any question?

00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:12.194
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] would
give us a [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.780
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.450
That means, here should
be a minus sign, yes.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:28.816
OK.

00:35:28.816 --> 00:35:34.440
I've motivated our discussion
with this nonlinear crystal,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.900
which generates pair of photons.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.500
This is the Hamiltonian
which describes it.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.330
And if you want to have a time
evolution by this Hamiltonian,

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.300
you put this Hamiltonian into
a time evolution operator.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:59.869
In other words, you--
e to the minus iHt

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:00.785
is the time evolution.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:11.390
If you now evolve a quantum
state of light for a fixed

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:16.890
time, t, we apply the
operator, e to the minus iHt,

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:20.440
to the quantum state of light.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:26.020
What I've just said
is now the motivation

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:31.700
for the definition of
the squeezing operator.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.620
The squeezing
operator, S of r, is

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:52.794
defined to be the exponent
of minus r over 2,

00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:56.000
a squared minus a dega squared.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.560
This is related to
the discussion above.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.820
You would say, hey, you want
to do that time evolution,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.240
where is the i?

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.630
Well, I've just made
a choice of phi.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:31.770
If phi is chosen
to be pi over 2,

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.880
then the time evolution
with the Hamiltonian,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.340
above, gives me the
squeezing operator, below.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.810
So with that motivation
we are now studying,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.745
what is the squeezing
operator doing

00:37:46.745 --> 00:37:47.890
to quantum states of light?

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.950
Any questions about that?

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.720
I know I spent a
lot of time on it.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.930
I could have taught this
class by just saying, here

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:01.370
is an operator, the
squeezing operator.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.120
Trust me, it does
wonderful things.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:05.110
And then we can
work out everything.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.530
But I find his
unsatisfying, so I

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.940
wanted to show you what is
really behind this operator.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.885
And I want you to
have a feeling,

00:38:14.885 --> 00:38:17.260
where does this operator come
from, and what is it doing?

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:24.300
In essence, what I've
introduced into our description

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.270
is now an operator, which
is creating and destroying

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.240
pairs of photons.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.480
And this will actually
do wonderful things

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.500
to our quantum states.

00:38:46.037 --> 00:38:48.120
What are the properties
of the squeezing operator?

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.516
What is important
is, it is unitary.

00:38:57.516 --> 00:38:58.890
It does a unitary
time evolution.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.610
You may not see
that immediately, so

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.136
let me explain that.

00:39:08.136 --> 00:39:12.190
You know from your basic
quantum mechanics course,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:22.660
that e to the i operator A is
unitary, when A is Hermitian.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:33.210
So the squeezing operator--
with the definition

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:38.220
above-- can be written
as, I factor out

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:48.490
2 i's over 2 a squared
minus a dega squared.

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:54.479
And you can immediately
verify that this part, here,

00:39:54.479 --> 00:39:55.020
is Hermitian.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.620
If you do the
Hermitian conjugate,

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.490
a squared turns
into a dega squared.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:06.210
a dega squared turns
into a squared.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.370
So we have a problem
with a minus sign.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.990
But if you do the
complex conjugate of i,

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.720
this takes care
of the minus sign.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.490
So this part is Hermitian.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:17.930
We multiply it with i,
therefore this whole operator.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:21.140
Thus a unitary transformation
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:27.222 --> 00:40:27.805
Any questions?

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:33.270
OK.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:47.410
So after being familiar with
this operator, we want to know,

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.370
what is this operator doing?

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:00.190
I can describe, now, what this
operator does, in a Schrodinger

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.400
picture, or in a
Heisenberg picture.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.410
I pick whatever is
more convenient.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.920
And for now, this is
the Heisenberg picture.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:15.740
In the Heisenberg picture, what
is changing are the operators.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.180
Therefore, in the
Heisenberg picture,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:25.330
this unitary transformation
transforms the operators.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:35.311
And we can study what happens
when we transform the operator,

00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:35.810
x.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:51.125
The unitary transformation
is done by-- the operator, x,

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:54.900
is transformed by multiplying
from the left side

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.610
with S, from the righthand
side with S dega.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:11.450
You are familiar with
expressions like, this,

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.600
and how to disentangle them.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.920
If you have an e to
the i alpha, e to

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:25.430
the minus alpha, if you
could move the alpha past x.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.500
So if A and x commute,
i A, minus i A

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.940
would just give unity.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.720
So therefore, this
expression is just

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:38.830
x, unless you have non-Hermitian
commutators between A and x.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:43.480
I think you have solved, in
your basic mechanics course,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:50.680
many such problems which
involve identities of that form.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.430
Then there are higher
order commutator,

00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:02.330
the commutator of A with
the commutator of a x.

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.220
Unless one of those
commutator vanishes,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.725
you can get an infinite series.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:30.140
Our operator, A, is nothing else
than the annihilation operator,

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.900
a squared minus the creation
operator, a dega squared.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.432
So we can express everything
in terms of a, and a dega.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:51.990
The position operator in
our harmonic oscillator

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.000
can also be expressed
by a, and a dega.

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.860
By doing elementary
manipulations

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.110
on the righthand side,
and recouping terms,

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:14.080
you find immediately that
the unitary transformation

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:22.620
of the Heisenberg operator, x,
gives you an x operator back.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:28.440
But multiplied with an
exponential, e to the r.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:38.830
And if we would do the same to
the momentum operator, which

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:43.130
is a minus a dega
over square root 2,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:49.770
we will find that the unitary
transformation of the momentum

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:56.520
operator is de-amplifying
the momentum

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.660
operator by an
exponential factor.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.660
If we would assume
that we have a vacuum

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.740
state in the
harmonic oscillator,

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.140
and while classically, it
would be at x equals 0,

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.730
p equals 0, quantum
mechanically,

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.590
we have single-point noise in
x, and single-point noise in p.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.390
Then you would find that
the squeezing operator is

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:40.900
amplifying the
quantum noise in x.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:46.450
But it squeezes, or
reduces, the noise in p.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:46:06.460
If we apply this squeezing
operator to the vacuum state,

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:14.470
we obtain what is usually
called, squeezed vacuum.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:38.080
And it means that, in this
quasi-probability diagram,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:47.250
the action of the
squeezing operator

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:52.895
is turning the vacuum
state into an ellipse.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.640
What happens to energy, here?

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.810
The vacuum state is the
lowest-energy state.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:32.890
If you now act with a
squeezing operator to it,

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:38.150
we obtain a state which
has-- the same energy?

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.578
Is it energy-conserving,
or very high energy?

00:47:41.578 --> 00:47:43.800
AUDIENCE: Higher [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.910
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.484
Why?

00:47:45.484 --> 00:47:47.192
AUDIENCE: It's no
longer the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.950
PROFESSOR: Sure, yeah.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:55.244
It's a vacuum state.

00:47:55.244 --> 00:47:56.660
We act on the
vacuum state, but we

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.660
get a state which is no
longer the vacuum state.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.970
The reason why we
have extra energy--

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.950
the squeezed vacuum is
very, very energetic.

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:19.630
Because the squeezing operator
had a dega squared, a squared.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.300
Well a squared, the annihilation
operator acting on the vacuum,

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.920
gives 0.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.380
But what we are creating now,
we are acting on the vacuum,

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.790
and we are creating
pairs of photons.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.430
So we are adding, literally,
energy to the system.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:38.240
And the energy, of course,
comes from the drive laser,

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.230
from the laser 2 omega 0, which
delivers the energy in forms

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.632
of photons which
are split into half,

00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:46.090
and they go into
our quantum field.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.555
In the limit of
infinite squeezing--

00:48:51.555 --> 00:48:53.270
I will show it to
you, mathematically,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.220
but it's nice to
discuss it already here.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.761
In the limit of
infinite squeezing,

00:48:58.761 --> 00:49:00.135
what is the state
we are getting?

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.444
AUDIENCE: Eigenstate
of momentum.

00:49:05.444 --> 00:49:06.735
PROFESSOR: Eigenstate momentum.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:12.980
We get the p equals
0 eigenstate.

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.175
What is the energy of the
p equals 0 eigenstate?

00:49:27.681 --> 00:49:28.647
AUDIENCE: Infinite.

00:49:28.647 --> 00:49:33.102
It has to contain
all number states.

00:49:33.102 --> 00:49:34.810
PROFESSOR: It contains
all number states?

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:40.140
OK, you think immediately into
number states, which is great.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.100
But in a more
pedestrian way, the p

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.560
equals 0 state has
no kinetic energy.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.240
But if a state is localized
in momentum, p equals 0,

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.990
it has to be infinitely
smeared out on the x-axis.

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:56.690
And don't forget, we have an
harmonic oscillator potential.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.720
If you have a particle which
is completely delocalized in x,

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.850
it has infinite potential
energy at the wings.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.430
So therefore in the limit
of extreme squeezing,

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:10.249
we involve an extreme
number of number states.

00:50:10.249 --> 00:50:12.540
Actually, I want to be more
specific-- of photon pairs.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.170
We have states with 2n, and
n can be infinitely large.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:21.700
But we'll see in the classical
picture, what we get here

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.370
when we squeeze it is,
we get the p equals

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:28.205
0 eigenstate, which has infinite
energy, due to the harmonic

00:50:28.205 --> 00:50:29.080
oscillator potential.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.080
If we would allow
with the system

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.390
now, after we have squeezed
it, to evolve for a quarter

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:42.610
period in the
harmonic oscillator,

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:50.370
then the ellipse would turn
into an vertical ellipse.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:57.340
So this is now an
eigenstate of x.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.190
It's the x equals 0 eigenstate.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:05.560
But the x equals 0 eigenstate
has also infinite energy,

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.130
because due to Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.950
it involves momentum states
of infinite momentum.

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:16.110
Questions?

00:51:33.254 --> 00:51:35.719
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a is
the photon field, right?

00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:39.915
So p is roughly the
electrical field, right?

00:51:39.915 --> 00:51:40.540
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:44.492
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of that
the electric field counts 0,

00:51:44.492 --> 00:51:49.760
and x is kind of the a,
the-- and it-- because of

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.902
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:51.902 --> 00:51:54.866
The electrical
field is squeezed?

00:51:54.866 --> 00:51:56.348
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:56.348 --> 00:51:58.324
AUDIENCE: It means we
have no electrical field?

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.190
PROFESSOR: We'll come
to that in a moment.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:07.130
I want to do a little bit
more math, to show you.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:10.400
I wanted to derive for you
an expression of the squeeze

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.990
state, in number
basis, and such.

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.610
Your question
mentioned something

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.776
which is absolutely correct.

00:52:20.776 --> 00:52:26.150
By squeezing that, we
have now the p-axis

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.990
is the electric field axis.

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:31.810
So now we have, actually, in
the limit of infinite squeezing,

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:37.010
we have an electric field which
has no uncertainty anymore.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:45.330
By squeezing the coherent state
into a momentum eigenstate,

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.630
we have created a sharp
value for the electric field.

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:51.560
We have created an
electric field eigenstate.

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.270
Well you would say,
it's pretty boring,

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.650
because the only electric
field state we have created

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:01.840
is electric field e equals 0.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.000
But in the next
half-hour, we want

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.640
to discuss the
displacement operator,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.000
and I will tell you what it is.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.170
That we can now
move the ellipses,

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:13.280
and move the circles,
anywhere where we want.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.820
So once we have
an electric field

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.226
state which has a sharp value
of the electric field at e

00:53:18.226 --> 00:53:22.450
equals 0, we can
just translate it.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.710
But before you get too
excited about having

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.440
an eigenstate of
the electric field,

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.590
I want you to think
about what happened

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.920
after one quarter-period it
of the harmonic oscillator

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.590
frequency.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:40.160
It turns upside down,
and your electric field

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.880
has an infinite variance.

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.470
That's what quantum
mechanics tells us.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:53.120
We can create
electric fields which

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.640
are very precise, but
only for a short moment.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.350
So in other words, this
electric field state

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:02.300
which we have created
would have a sharp value.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.940
A moment later, it would
be very smeared out,

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.820
then it has a sharp
value again, and then

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.020
it's smeared out again.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.852
I mean, that's what
squeezed states are.

00:54:12.852 --> 00:54:14.030
Other questions?

00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:15.405
AUDIENCE: That's
why [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.530
PROFESSOR: That's why we
need homodyne detection.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:23.710
Yes, exactly.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:27.520
If we have squeezed something,
which is sort of narrow,

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.870
that's great for measurement.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:32.190
Now we can do a
measurement of, maybe,

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:36.086
a LIGO measurement for
gravitational waves with higher

00:54:36.086 --> 00:54:37.460
precision, because
we have a more

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.900
precise value in
our quantum state.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.885
But we have to look at
it at the right time.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:47.510
We have to look
at it synchronized

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.280
with the harmonic motion.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:54.290
Homodyne detection means we
look only at the sine component,

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.970
or at the cosine component.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.390
Or if I want to simplify
it, what you want to do

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.140
is, if you have a
state like this,

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:02.470
you want to measure the
electric field, so to speak,

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:03.280
stroboscopically.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.071
You want to look at
your system always when

00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:06.860
the ellipse is like this.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.240
The stroboscopic measurement
is, as I will show you,

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.450
in essence, a
lock-in measurement,

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:13.740
which is phase-sensitive.

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:15.550
And this will be
homodyne detection.

00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.250
So we can only take
advantage of the squeezing,

00:55:18.250 --> 00:55:21.410
of having less uncertainty
in one quadrature component,

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:23.924
if you do phase-sensitive
detection, which

00:55:23.924 --> 00:55:24.840
is homodyne detection.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:32.071
But now I'm already an
hour ahead of the course.

00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:32.570
OK.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:33.245
Back to basics.

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:48.610
We want to explicitly
calculate, now,

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:50.820
how does a squeezed
vacuum look like.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.600
We actually want to do it
twice, because it's useful.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.730
We have to see it in
two different basis.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.420
One is, I want to write down
the squeezed vacuum for you

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.420
in a number representation.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.665
And then in a coherent
state representation.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:26.200
The squeezing operator is an
exponential function involving

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.750
a squared, and a dega squared.

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:34.610
And of course, we're now using
the Taylor expansion of that.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.475
We are acting on
the vacuum state.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:46.710
I will not do the calculation.

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:47.970
It's again, elementary.

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:54.710
You have n factorial, you have
terms with a dega acts on c,

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.550
well, you pay 2 photons.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:59.900
If it acts again, it
adds 2 more photons,

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.120
and the matrix element
of a dega acting on n

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.030
is square root n plus 1.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:07.180
You just sort of
rearrange the terms.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.280
And what you find is,
what I will write you down

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.190
in the next line.

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:13.545
The important thing you
should immediately realize

00:57:13.545 --> 00:57:17.820
is, the squeeze state is
something very special.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:22.140
It is the superposition
of number states,

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:27.020
but all number states are even
because our squeezing operator

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.810
creates pairs of photons.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.140
This is what the parametric
down-conversion does.

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.690
We inject photons
into the vacuum,

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:37.300
but always exactly in pairs.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.620
And therefore, it's
not a random state.

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:42.380
It's a highly correlated state
with very special properties.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:45.570
OK.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:52.770
If you do the calculation
and recoup the terms,

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:57.400
you get factorials,
you get 2 to the n,

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.540
you get another factorial.

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:06.840
You get hyperbolic tangent--
sorry, to the power n.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:22.725
And the normalization is done
by the square root of the cos

00:58:22.725 --> 00:58:23.225
function.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.640
And the more we
squeeze, the larger

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.850
are the amplitudes at
higher and higher n.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.700
But this is also obvious from
the graphic representation

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:42.610
I've shown you.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:53.370
Let me add the coherent
state representation.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:18.640
The coherence states are
related to the number

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:25.650
states in that way.

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:43.530
If we transform now from number
states to coherent states,

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.740
the straightforward
calculation gives, now,

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:51.520
superposition over
coherent states.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.920
Coherent states
require an integral.

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:12.310
e to the minus e to the
r over 2, divided by--

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.260
Anyway, all this
expressions, they

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.800
may not be in its general
form, too illuminating.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.910
But those things can
be done analytically.

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:34.720
I just want to mention the
interesting limiting case

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.845
of infinite squeezing.

01:00:37.845 --> 01:00:39.761
AUDIENCE: When you do
the integral over alpha,

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.921
is this over like, a
magnitude of alpha,

01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:43.212
or a real part, or [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:21.204 --> 01:01:22.620
PROFESSOR: I
remember, but I'm not

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:26.330
100% sure that
alpha is real, here.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:28.230
I mean, it sort of
makes sense, because we

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:29.890
start with the vacuum state.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:33.070
And if we squeeze
it, we are not really

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.260
going into the
imaginary direction.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.551
So I think what is involved
here are only real alpha.

01:01:38.551 --> 01:01:40.717
AUDIENCE: For negative r,
we should get [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.977
PROFESSOR: For negative r,
we need imaginary state.

01:01:50.977 --> 01:01:52.435
AUDIENCE: So we
should [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:01.220
PROFESSOR: Let me double-check.

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:02.260
I don't remember that.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.400
You know that,
sometimes, I admit

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.870
it, the issue-- if
you research material,

01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:13.420
prepare a course some years
ago, you forget certain things.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.660
If I prepared the lecture,
and everything worked out

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:16.868
yesterday, I would know that.

01:02:16.868 --> 01:02:19.740
But certain things
you don't remember.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.380
As far as I know,
it's the real axis.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.505
But I have to double-check.

01:02:25.786 --> 01:02:30.320
The limiting case
is interesting.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.850
If r goes to infinity, you
can show that this is simply

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:39.410
the integral, d alpha
over coherent states.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:57.670
We have discussed,
graphically, the situation

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:04.100
where we had-- so these
are quasi-probabilities.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:13.130
In that case of
infinite squeezing,

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.900
we have the momentum
eigenstate, p equals 0.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:27.150
This is the limit of the
infinitely squeezed vacuum,

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:31.270
and in a coherent
state representation,

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:37.860
it is the integral over
coherent state alpha.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:42.180
I'm pretty sure alpha is
real here, seeing that now.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:50.410
There is a second limit, which
happens simply-- you can say,

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.252
by rotation, or by time
evolution-- which is the x

01:03:54.252 --> 01:03:56.700
equals 0 eigenstate.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.880
And this is proportional
to the integral over alpha

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.120
when we take the
coherent state i alpha,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.370
and we integrate from
minus to plus infinity.

01:04:13.811 --> 01:04:14.310
OK.

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:17.070
So we have connected
our squeezed states,

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:22.285
the squeezed vacuum, with number
states, with coherent states.

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:29.830
Now we need one more thing.

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:33.660
So far we've only
squeezed the vacuum,

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:37.580
and we have defined
the squeezing operator

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:42.590
that it takes a vacuum
state and elongates it.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:46.210
In order to generate
more general states,

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:48.834
we want to get away
from the origin.

01:04:48.834 --> 01:04:50.750
And this is done by the
displacement operator.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:16.060
The definition of the
displacement operator

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.130
is given here.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.890
The displacement by
a complex number,

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:28.620
alpha, is done by putting
alpha, and alpha star,

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:32.110
into an exponential function.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:38.030
In many quantum
mechanic courses,

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:43.380
you show very easily the
elementary properties.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:48.820
If the displacement
operator is used

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:55.210
to transform the annihilation
operator, it just does that.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:13.067
If you take the complex
conjugate of it--

01:06:13.067 --> 01:06:14.650
so in other words,
what that means is,

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.850
it's called the
displacement operator,

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:18.790
I just take that
as the definition.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.230
But you immediately
see why it's called

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.160
the displacement
operator when we

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:26.560
do the unitary transformation
of the annihilation operator,

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:32.140
we get the annihilation operator
displaced by a complex number.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.740
So the action,
the transformation

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.750
of the annihilation operator
is the annihilator operator

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:41.020
itself, minus a c number.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.060
So therefore, we say, the
annihilation operator data

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.175
has been displaced.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:53.290
So this is the action of
the displacement operator

01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:57.030
on an operator-- on the
annihilation operator.

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.820
The question is now, how does
the displacement operator

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.160
act on quantum states?

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:12.360
And the simplest quantum
state we want to test out

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.720
is the vacuum state.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.660
And well, not surprisingly,
the displacement operator,

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.320
displacing the vector
state by alpha,

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.849
is creating the
coherent state, alpha.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.310
This can be proven in one line.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:41.950
We take our displaced
vacuum, and we act on it

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:43.380
with the annihilation operator.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.570
If we act with the annihilation
operator on something,

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.730
and we get the same thing
back times an eigenvalue,

01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:58.010
we know it's a coherent state.

01:07:58.010 --> 01:08:00.350
Because this was the
definition of coherent states.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.080
So therefore, in order to show
that this is a coherent state,

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.170
we want to show that it's an
eigenstate of the annihilation

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.390
operator.

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:11.200
So this is what we want to do.

01:08:14.945 --> 01:08:18.890
The proof is very easy.

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:24.450
By multiplying this expression
with unity, which is DD dega,

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.240
we have this.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.290
And now we can use the
result for the transformation

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:31.390
of operators.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:36.850
Namely, that this is simply
the annihilation operator,

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.210
plus alpha.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:45.359
If the annihilation operator
acts on the vacuum state,

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.359
we get 0.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:51.890
If alpha acts on the vacuum
state, we get alpha times 0.

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:58.825
So therefore, what
we obtain is that.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:07.050
When the annihilation
operator acts on this state,

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:10.590
we get alpha times the state,
and therefore the state

01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:13.130
is a coherent state
with eigenvalue alpha.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.740
In a graphical way, if
you have a vacuum state

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:33.330
the displacement operator, D
alpha, takes a vacuum state

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:36.451
and creates a
coherent state alpha.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:59.340
If you want to have squeezed
states with a finite value,

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:03.512
well, we just discussed
the electric field.

01:10:03.512 --> 01:10:04.970
Related to the
harmonic oscillator,

01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:07.210
we want squeeze
states, which are not

01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:13.420
centered at the origin, which
have a finite value of x or p.

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:25.510
We can now create them by
first squeezing the vacuum,

01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:26.760
and then displacing the state.

01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:39.306
AUDIENCE: What's the
physical realization

01:10:39.306 --> 01:10:42.510
of the displacement operator?

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.832
PROFESSOR: What is the
physical realization

01:10:44.832 --> 01:10:46.040
of the displacement operator?

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.530
Just one second.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:02.090
The physical representation
of the displacement operator--

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.480
we'll do that on Monday--
is the following.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:10.250
If you pass an arbitrary state
through a beam splitter--

01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:12.780
but it's a beam splitter
which has very, very

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:17.600
high transmission-- and then,
from the-- I'll just show that.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:20.900
If you have a state-- this
is a beam splitter-- which

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.870
has a very high transmission,
T is approximately 1,

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:26.130
then the state passes through.

01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:30.750
But then from the other
side of the beam splitter,

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.780
you come with a very
strong coherent state.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.510
You have a coherent state
which is characterized

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:40.210
by a large complex number, beta.

01:11:40.210 --> 01:11:44.870
And then there is a
reflection coefficient,

01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:47.620
r, which is very small.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:53.080
It sort of reflects the coherent
state with an amplitude r beta.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.215
If you mix together the
transmitted state and r

01:11:56.215 --> 01:11:59.030
beta-- I will show
that to you explicitly,

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:01.750
by doing a quantum treatment
of the beam splitter--

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.990
what you get is,
the initial state

01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:07.330
is pretty much transmitted
without attenuation.

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:12.100
But the reflected part of
the strong coherent state--

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.010
you compensate for the
small r by a large beta--

01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:17.540
does actually an exact
displacement of r beta.

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:21.270
It's actually great.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.560
The beam splitter is
a wonderful device.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.460
You think you have a
displacement operator

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:29.560
formulated with a's
and a dega's, it

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.250
looks like something extract.

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:34.610
But you can go to the lab,
simply get one beam splitter,

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:36.610
take a strong laser
beam, and whatever

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:38.090
you send through
the beam splitter

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:41.390
gets displaced, gets acted
upon by the beam splitter.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:45.490
Yes.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:48.020
AUDIENCE: You showed the
displacement operator, when

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:51.760
you acted on the vacuum state,
will displace the vacuum

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.336
state to a state alpha.

01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.766
Does it still hold
if you acted on,

01:12:55.766 --> 01:12:57.710
like another coherent state.

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.710
Or in this case, a
squeeze state like that?

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:04.280
I haven't shown it,
but it's really--

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.060
it displaces-- When we
use this representation

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.930
with quasi-probabilities,
it simply

01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:11.310
does a displacement
in the plane.

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.830
But no.

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:29.371
To be honest, when I say it does
a displacement on the plane,

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:32.480
it reminds me that we
have three different ways

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.420
of defining quasi-probabilities.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:36.805
The w, the p, and
the q representation.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:42.060
I know we use it all the
time, that we displace things

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.130
in the plane.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:46.000
But I'm wondering if the
displacement operator does

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.045
an exact displacement of
all representations, or only

01:13:49.045 --> 01:13:51.000
of the q representation.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.625
That's something I
don't know for sure.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:54.875
AUDIENCE: I was thinking it
could also, like-- I mean,

01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:57.260
are you going to be able to
displace all types of light,

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:01.033
like thermal light, or any
representation of light

01:14:01.033 --> 01:14:03.366
that you could put in, is the
same displacement operator

01:14:03.366 --> 01:14:03.949
going to work?

01:14:03.949 --> 01:14:10.850
Or is its domain just the
vacuum and coherent states?

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:13.730
PROFESSOR: The fact is,
the coherent states--

01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:15.415
I've shown you that
it's a vacuum state.

01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:23.600
I know that's the next thing to
show, the displacement operator

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.190
if you have a displacement
by alpha followed

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.530
by displacement by beta,
it is equal to displacement

01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:31.090
by alpha plus beta.

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.470
So displacement
operator forms a group,

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.950
and if you do two
displacements, they

01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:38.310
equal into one area
of displacement,

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:42.220
which is the sum of
two complex numbers.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.850
What I'm just saying, if you
do the first displacement

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:47.000
you can get an arbitrarily
coherent state.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.530
So therefore, the
displacement operator

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:55.430
is exactly displacing
a coherent state

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:58.510
by the argument of the
displacement operator.

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:01.060
And now if you take an
arbitrary quantum state

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:04.835
and expand it into coherent
states-- coherent states are

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.319
not only complete,
they are over-complete.

01:15:07.319 --> 01:15:09.360
All you have done is,
you've done a displacement.

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:16.216
Now the over-completeness,
of course,

01:15:16.216 --> 01:15:17.590
means you have to
think about it,

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:21.120
because you can represent
states in more than one way

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.270
by coherent states.

01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:24.030
But if you have
your representation,

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.831
you just displace
it, and this is

01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:27.497
the result of the
displacement operator.

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:36.910
So since the q
representation is simply,

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:38.520
you take the
statistical operator

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.480
and look for the
elements in alpha,

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.780
and if you displace alpha,
the q representation

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.730
has been moved around.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.590
So I'm sure that for
the q representation,

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:52.720
for the q quasi-probabilities,
the displacement operator

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.840
shifted around in this place.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:00.685
For the w and p
representation, I'm not sure.

01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:02.310
Maybe there's an
expert in the audience

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:06.830
who knows more
about it than I do.

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:08.840
OK.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.520
We have just five minutes left.

01:16:15.610 --> 01:16:18.410
I want to discuss now
the electric field

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:20.720
of squeezed states.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.840
And for that, let
me load a picture.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.145
Insert picture.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:40.870
Classroom files.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:02.561
Let us discuss, now, the
electric field of squeezed

01:17:02.561 --> 01:17:03.060
states.

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:23.380
Just as a reminder, we can
discuss the electric field

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.740
by using the quasi-probability
representation.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.880
And the electric field
is the projection

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.225
of the quasi-probabilities
on the vertical axis.

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:40.000
And then the time evolution
is, that everything rotates

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.880
with omega in this
complex plane.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.900
We discussed it already.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.700
For coherent state, we have
a circle which rotates.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.220
Therefore, the projected
fuzziness of the electric field

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:01.710
is always the same.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.400
And as time goes by, we have
a sinusoidal-bearing electric

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.972
field.

01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:09.180
Let me just make one comment.

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:13.450
If you look into the literature,
some people actually say,

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:15.760
the electric field
is the projection

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.420
on the horizontal axis.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:21.240
So there are people who say,
the electric field is given

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.285
by the x-coordinate of
the harmonic oscillator,

01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:28.220
whereas I'm telling you,
it's the p-coordinate.

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:30.450
Well, if you think
one person is wrong,

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:33.330
I would suggest you just
wait a quarter-period

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:36.320
of the harmonic oscillator, and
then the other person is right.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320
It's really just a
phase convention.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.560
What do you assume
to be t equals

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.385
0-- it's really arbitrary.

01:18:44.385 --> 01:18:46.510
But here in this course,
I will use the projections

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.451
on the vertical axis.

01:18:48.451 --> 01:18:48.950
OK.

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:53.320
If you project the number
state, we get always,

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.302
0 electric field, with
a large uncertainty.

01:18:56.302 --> 01:18:57.385
So that's just a reminder.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:05.200
But now we have
a squeezed state.

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.430
It's a displaced squeezed state.

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:12.740
If you project it
onto the y-axis,

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.070
we have first some
large uncertainty.

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:20.830
I think this plot assumes that
we rotate with negative time,

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:24.020
so I apologize for that.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.080
You can just invert
time, if you want.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:30.670
So after a quarter-period,
the ellipse is now horizontal,

01:19:30.670 --> 01:19:34.690
and that means the electric
field is very sharp.

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:37.680
As time goes by, you
see that the uncertainty

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.040
of the electric field
is large, small, large,

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.140
small-- it modulates.

01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:49.930
It can become very extreme,
when you do extreme squeezing,

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:53.050
so you have an extremely precise
value of the electric field,

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:57.360
here, but you've a large
uncertainty, there.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.540
Sometimes you want
to accurately measure

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.560
the 0 crossing of
the electric field.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.240
This may be something
which interests you,

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.870
for an experiment.

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.750
In that case, you
actually want to have

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:13.480
an ellipse which is
horizontally squeezed.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:16.130
Now, whenever the
electric field is 0,

01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:17.740
there is very little noise.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:20.590
But after a quarter-period,
when the electric field

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:23.220
reaches its maximum,
you have a lot of noise.

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:27.330
So it's sort of your choice
which way you squeeze.

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:32.310
Whether you want the
electric field to be precise,

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:35.835
have little fluctuations
when it goes through 0,

01:20:35.835 --> 01:20:37.335
or when it goes
through the maximum.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:49.440
So what we have done
here is, we have first

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.420
created the squeezed
vacuum, and then we

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.590
have acted on it with a
displacement operator.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.120
OK.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.950
I think that's a
good moment to stop.

01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:16.650
Let me just say what I wanted
to take from this picture.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:22.130
The fact that the electric
field is precise only

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:29.780
at certain moments means that
we can only take advantage of it

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.200
when we do a
phase-sensitive detection.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.280
We only want to
sort of, measure,

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.600
the electric field
when it's sharp.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:51.120
Or-- this is equivalent-- we
should regard light is always

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.155
composed of two
quadrature components.

01:21:54.155 --> 01:21:57.670
You can say, the cosine,
the sine oscillation, the x,

01:21:57.670 --> 01:21:59.000
and the p.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.170
And the squeezing is
squeezed in one quadrature,

01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:06.300
by it is elongated in
the other quadrature.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.540
Therefore, we want to
be phase-sensitive.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:11.690
We want to pick out
either the cosine omega

01:22:11.690 --> 01:22:14.110
T, or the sine
omega T oscillation.

01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:15.990
This is sort of,
homodyne detection.

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.204
We'll discuss it on Monday.

01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:18.745
Any question?

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:21.850
OK.

01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:23.400
Good.
