00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.000
PROFESSOR: Back to
master equations

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.340
an optical Bloch equations.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.940
I hope you remember
that on Monday we

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.070
derived, under very
general conditions,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.950
how dissipation, relaxation
comes about in a quantum

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.880
system, namely because we
have a quantum system which

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.070
interacts with a reservoir.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.020
The total system evolves, as
quantum mechanics tells us,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.275
with a unitary time evolution.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.610
When we derive life what
happens with the small system,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.810
due to the coupling
with a bigger system,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.310
there are now suddenly-- the
time evolution of the density

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.250
matrix has relaxation
terms, and we derived that.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.360
And the special equation
we are interested

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.140
in for two level
system interacting

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.350
with the vacuum--
interacting with a vacuum

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.380
for spontaneous emission
are optical Bloch equations.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.510
Today I want to discuss with you
some characteristic solutions

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.190
of the optical Bloch equations.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.480
But before I do that, let
me first discuss with you

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.820
the assumptions we made to
derive a master equation.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.960
And I hope you remember the Born
approximation and the Markov

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.220
approximation.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.001
The Born approximation says
that the reservoir will never

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:38.500
change.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.100
The reservoir is always, for
instance, in the vacuum state.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.230
And the Markov
approximation said

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.520
that the correlations
in the reservoir

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.510
are delta function related.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.360
It can absorb photons
instantaneously.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.320
The vacuum has no memory time.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.370
It's like a black hole.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.280
It sucks up everything.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.410
But it's always what it was
initially, namely the vacuum.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.440
Do you know examples where those
assumptions are not fulfilled?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.701
I make it so natural.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.325
These are the most
natural assumptions,

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:11.310
but what are systems which
cannot be described with this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.480
approach.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.768
AUDIENCE: I was thinking maybe
like an atom in a cavity.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.670
If you change the
vacuum somehow.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.100
PROFESSOR: An atom in a cavity.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.230
Very good.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.320
If an atom emits--
now it depends.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.560
We talk today about the master
equation for photons and atoms

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.470
in the cavity,
but we will assume

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.980
that the cavity
is rapidly damped.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.310
If it's a high Q cavity,
the atom emits a photon,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.960
but the cavity has memory.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.230
It stores the photon, and after
one period of the vacuum Rabi

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.030
oscillation, the photon
goes back to the atom.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.970
So the vacuum has memory time.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.580
The vacuum has now
a time constant,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.680
which is the same as the
time constant for the atom,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.280
namely the period of
the Rabi oscillation.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.420
Big violation of the
Markov approximation.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.100
We do not have the very short
correlation time of the system.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.700
We just integrate over in
the much longer time scale,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.560
during which we are interested
in the dynamics of the system.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.040
Maybe another example.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.060
Actually, this example violates
both the Markov approximation,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.020
also the Born approximation,
because the vacuum

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.536
has changed when
it has a photon.

00:03:24.536 --> 00:03:26.160
Do you know an example
where maybe only

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.630
the Born approximation
is violated,

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.594
namely the reservoir is
changing due to interaction

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:35.260
with the system?

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.900
Well?

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.790
Before we talked about the
system in a big reservoir.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.350
What happens when you make
the reservoir smaller?

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.960
Well then when it
absorbs energy.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.140
It will heat up and such.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.670
It will change.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.450
The Born approximation
is actually,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.210
when it would come to energy
transfer, the assumption

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.770
that the reservoir has an
infinite heat capacity.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.010
It can just take
whatever the system wants

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.954
to deliver without changing,
for instance, it's temperature.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.470
OK, so at least
you know now there

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.140
are systems for which
the treatment has

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.660
to be generalized, and you
understand maybe better

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.950
the nature of
approximations we have made.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.855
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:33.938
AUDIENCE: Just a question.

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:36.753
For the last case which is where
the Born approximation is not

00:04:36.753 --> 00:04:40.399
violated, is there
any example of that?

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:48.920
PROFESSOR: Well for instance,
spontaneous emission

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.170
into the vacuum, but
the speed of light

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.810
is so slow that it takes forever
for the photon to escape.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.190
The Markov approximation
is more about the time

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.460
scale for the
reservoir to react.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.200
And the Born approximation
is if the reservoir is really

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.955
big enough to simply absorb
everything without changing.

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:14.280
I don't know.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.190
You could maybe think about
you have some reservoir,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.630
but it has very bad heat
conduction or something.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.330
The transport is just very
slow, and therefore you

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.430
do not have the hierarchy
of the two time scales.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.600
OK, any other questions
about the master equation?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.695
Optical Bloch equations?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:43.572
Well, then we can
learn more about

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:48.040
the characteristic features
of the optical Bloch equations

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.275
by looking at solutions.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.705
And I would like to discuss
three aspects of solution.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:15.400
I want to discuss the spectrum
and the intensity of light

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.525
emitted by the atoms.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:32.275
Secondly, we want to talk about
transient and steady state

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:32.775
solutions.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.970
And finally, actually I put it
in the chapter of optical Bloch

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:47.890
equations, but I
will use a cavity

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.650
for that example,
which will actually

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.067
go beyond optical
Bloch equations.

00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:52.733
It's also nice for
you to see that there

00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:54.530
is more than the
optical Bloch equation,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.130
but it's the same formalism.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.440
And this is when we discuss the
damping of the damped vacuum

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.190
Rabi oscillations.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.040
I also picked this
one example sort

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.980
of as an appetizer,
because I can introduce

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.560
two concepts for you
in this last example.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.910
One is the quantum Zeno effect.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.370
And the other one is the
adiabatic elimination

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.300
of coherences, which
plays a major role

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.100
in many, many
theoretical treatments.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:31.480
But let's start with the first
part, namely the spectrum

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.800
and intensity of emitted light.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.790
And I want to start off this
discussion with a clicker

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.290
question.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.620
Do everybody take a
clicker out of the box?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.850
So the situation is that
we have an atom which

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:55.020
is excited by laser light
of frequency omega L.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.920
The atom has frequency omega 0.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.370
I'm discussing the limit
of very low intensity.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.270
And the question
for you is what is

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.260
the spectrum of the
emitted radiation?

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.500
So in other words,
we have our atom.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.670
We have the laser
beam which comes here.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:39.750
And now the atom emits
in all directions.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:44.190
And you collect and
frequency analyze the light.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.852
And I want to give you
four possibilities how

00:08:50.852 --> 00:08:56.330
the spectrum of the emitted
light may look like.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.850
Let's assume that on
the frequency axis

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.990
this is the laser frequency.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.570
And this is the
frequency of the atom.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.270
And the first possibility
is that we observed

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.900
a spectrum which is centered
at the atomic frequency where

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.270
the line meets gamma.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.810
The second option is that
we observe a delta function,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.290
a very sharp peak at
the frequency omega 0.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.640
The third possibility is
the we observe a sharp peak

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.210
at the laser frequency.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:38.550
And the fourth option is that
we observe radiation centered

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.250
at the laser frequency,
but with gamma.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.110
So I would ask
you for your vote.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:51.650
A, B, C, or D.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.570
Was there any questions
about the choices?

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.460
40 for in spectra.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.390
The low intensity limit
of light scattered

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.800
emitted by an atom which is
excited with a laser beam.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.040
We can assume close
to resonance, but not

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.910
on resonance, so we can
distinguish between the laser

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.000
frequency and the
atomic frequency.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.216
Anybody had a chance?

00:10:28.216 --> 00:10:28.715
OK.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.730
OK, good.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.860
A, B, C, D.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.890
Yes, let's discuss it.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.950
I want to draw your attention
to one thing I said,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.940
namely low intensity.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.760
At low intensity, you can assume
that there's only one photon

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.850
scattered at a time, because
the intensity-- we work

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.860
in the limit of
infinitesimal intensity.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.080
So I want to as you
now, why don't you

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.560
consider energy conservation and
think about the problem again?

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.330
OK, maybe I'm indicating I'm
not happy with the answer.

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:47.950
Maybe an obvious question
which sometimes people

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.450
get confused about, what
about Doppler shifts?

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.280
We assume the atom is infinitely
heavy and cannot move.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.450
Or we trap it in an ion trap.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.610
It's in the ground
state of the ion trap,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.960
and no kinetic
energy is exchanged.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.260
So don't get confused,
and I think none of you

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.315
got confused about Doppler
shifts in kinetic energy here.

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:09.225
We eliminate that.

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:09.725
OK.

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.055
Well it's moving in
the right direction.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.440
Now the two most frequent
answers are those two.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.680
OK, I've asked you to take
energy conservation really

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.140
seriously.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.690
If you start with an
atom in the ground state,

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.500
and the monochromatic photon at
the laser frequency, and you've

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.920
done a wonderful job,
which many labs can do.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.720
You've stabilized your laser
with a precision of 1 hertz.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.930
And 1 Hertz, this is sort of
what I do as a delta function.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.910
So if you take energy
conservation absolutely

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.780
seriously, the
photon, which can--

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.470
the atom is in the ground state
after it has scattered light,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.660
so the energy of the
atom has not changed.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.590
And you can only fulfill
energy conservation

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.360
if there is no change in
the spectrum of the light.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.150
And that means delta function
in, delta function out.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.560
Now I know I say it as if
it would be the simplest

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.910
thing in the world, but
maybe you have questions.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.960
Does anybody want to
maybe argue or defend

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.960
why the light
should be broadened?

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.680
And actually discuss
very soon other examples.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.360
We go to higher intensity,
and at higher intensity

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.600
other things end and
other things are possible.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.210
But at the low
intensity limit, do

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.670
you have any
suggestion what could

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.120
cause the broadening of light?

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.035
AUDIENCE: I guess this is more
if [INAUDIBLE] but then look

00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:10.790
at it as pinned down,
but you're going

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.360
to see a Doppler shift from the
recoil as the light comes out.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:20.370
So it accepts the light,
and then it moves something,

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.180
so then it has some velocity.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.432
And then when it
emits, it's going

00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:27.210
to be emitting in
a random direction.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.626
And so its final
velocity is going

00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:32.540
to be in some basically
arbitrary direction,

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.180
because the two
[INAUDIBLE] boosts

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.460
that you get from
accepting and emitting.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.670
PROFESSOR: OK now first of
all, I wanted for this problem

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.740
to assume that the mass
of the atom is infinite.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.040
And at that point,
the recoil energy

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.300
has 1 over the mass term.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.840
The recoil energy is 0
and we can neglect it.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.080
So the limit I'm
talking about is sound.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.850
But you're right.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.440
If you want to bring in the
recoil energy, what would then

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.260
happen is if an atom
absorbs a photon

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.730
and emits it pretty much
in the same direction,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.710
there is no momentum exchange.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.730
Then it will be close
to the laser frequency.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.910
But then you will find,
depending on the angle now,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:18.320
there is a shift between
0 and 2 recoil energies.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.550
If you would, however, measure
the light at a specific angle,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.180
you would still find
a delta function,

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.060
but you would find it shifted.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.100
But this is really
a complication

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.535
which involves now the
mechanical effect of light

00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:30.975
and the recoil of a photon.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.070
It doesn't change the result.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.890
Energy conservation requires
the spectrum to be, so to speak,

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.280
a delta function
in total energy.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.420
And what we have
just discussed is

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.440
that, depending on the
scattering angle, maybe

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.085
there's a kinetic
energy to consider.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.330
So what else can
broaden the light?

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.104
Yes?

00:16:10.104 --> 00:16:12.080
AUDIENCE: Finite pulse time?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.460
So things are very different
if I use a pulse laser.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.640
But here I said the incident
light is monochromatic,

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.220
just one frequency.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.760
And therefore you don't
have any time resolution

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.720
in the experiment.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.710
The moment you have
time resolution,

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.780
you would introduce into
the whole discussion

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.190
Fourier [INAUDIBLE] and such.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:41.440
But frankly, I ask this question
every time I teach the course.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.502
And every time the vast
majority of the class

00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:45.460
gives the wrong answer.

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:49.430
Let me ask you
something else which

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.830
is maybe a little bit simpler,
and that's the following.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.540
You have a harmonic
oscillator which

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.840
has an eigen frequency omega 0.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.610
You drive the
harmonic oscillator

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.869
at frequency omega L.
What is the oscillation

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:05.990
of the oscillator?

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:09.470
Is it omega 0, the harmonic
oscillator frequency?

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.662
Or omega L, the drive frequency?

00:17:13.662 --> 00:17:15.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.859
PROFESSOR: Of course,
the drive frequency.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.109
There may be a short
transient, but if we do not

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:24.920
switch on the drive suddenly,
we avoid the transient.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.140
The steady state solution is
the harmonic oscillator always

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:32.150
oscillates at the
drive frequency.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.992
Now, isn't the atom a
harmonic oscillator?

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.300
In 8421 we discuss the
oscillator strings.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.740
We discuss that
the polarizability

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.880
of the atom, the dipole
moment, the AC stock shift

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.320
can really be regarded as an
oscillating dipole moment.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.170
So the atom for that
purpose is nothing else

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.940
than a driven
harmonic oscillator.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.050
And when you drive the
atom at a laser frequency,

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:05.620
the dipole moment oscillates
at which frequency?

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.350
The laser frequency.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.380
Not the resonant frequency.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.310
And therefore, the light
which is scattered--

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.170
think about it semi classically.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:15.670
This is like an antenna.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.630
It's an electron.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.390
It's a charge.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.140
It's a dipole moment
which oscillates

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.490
at the drive frequency.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.407
And the light, which is emitted
by this accelerated charge

00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:24.490
is at the drive frequency.

00:18:27.634 --> 00:18:31.330
The atom is, for that
purpose, nothing else

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.610
than a driven
harmonic oscillator.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.960
And I'm saying that
probably several times

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.480
in that course, when you
have a semi classical picture

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.490
and a fully quantum picture,
and they do not fully agree.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.300
I've never gone wrong with
the semi classical picture.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.100
But myself and
many of my students

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:56.730
have come to very wrong answers
by somehow holding on just

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.580
to the quantum
picture, and now seeing

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.700
what the semi
classical limit is.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.650
You may think too
much here in the atom

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.340
not as a harmonic oscillator,
but a two level system.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.120
The two level
system gets excited,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.820
and then after it is excited, it
emits at the natural frequency.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.830
But you've taken something
to seriously here.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:23.480
It's a two level system, but you
cannot read the system that you

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.000
first populate a level,
and then you emit,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.860
because the energy of the
laser is not exactly the energy

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.810
needed to populate the level.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.800
So therefore you shouldn't do
first order perturbation theory

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.040
where you populate a level
and then you wait and wait

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.340
for the emitted photon.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.760
This is light scattering.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.790
It's a second order problem.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.540
One photon in, one photon out.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.420
And you have to conserve energy.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.070
Sorry for hammering
on it, but it's

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.640
really an example
where you can maybe

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.570
realize certain
misconceptions, and I really

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.659
want to make sure that
you fully understand

00:19:57.659 --> 00:19:59.075
what's going on
in this situation.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.240
Questions?

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.450
Well, then let's make
it more interesting.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.420
Let's introduce
higher intensity.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.170
So let me first maybe
show you-- we've

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.630
talked a lot about
diagrams-- what

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.910
the diagram for this process is.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.720
So we have the laser
frequency, and then we

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.940
have the photon emitted.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.580
And of course, the length of
this vector, this frequency

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.445
is the same as the
laser frequency.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.086
So let's move on now and
talk about higher intensity.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.940
The high intensity
case we discuss

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.890
in great detail in 8421,
but you pretty much I think

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:37.780
know also from basic
quantum physics

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.840
what happens if you
take a two level system

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.800
and drive it strongly.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.920
If you drive it
strongly, stronger

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.800
than spontaneous
emission, that means

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.280
there is a limit
where you can just

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.820
forget about spontaneous
emission in leading order,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.520
and the system is nothing else
than a two level system coupled

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.680
by a strong monochromatic drive.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.300
So I assume you've all
heard about this solution?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.690
Get the Rabi oscillation between
ground and excited state.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:25.600
So the high intensity
limit are Rabi oscillations

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.950
at the Rabi frequency.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:35.830
So what happens now to the
spectrum of the emitted light

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.640
if you are in the
limit that you have

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.580
Rabi oscillation of
the atomic system?

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.440
And I want you to think
classically or semi

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.940
classically.

00:23:01.675 --> 00:23:03.670
AUDIENCE: Three peaks.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.160
PROFESSOR: Three peaks
you generate side bends.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.250
Classically, you have an
emitter, an oscillating charge.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.310
But now you want to throw
in that the atom goes

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.320
from the ground to
the excited state,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.435
from the excited to
the ground state.

00:23:17.435 --> 00:23:19.970
So, so to speak, when
it's in the ground state,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:20.800
it cannot emit.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.600
When it's in the excited
state, it can emit and such.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.430
So you should think about
an oscillating dipole

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.580
which is now
intensity modulated.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.030
And you know when you take
a classic light source which

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:38.700
is monochromatic, but put on top
of it an intensity modulation

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.570
at frequency omega Rabi,
the solution of that

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.370
are three peaks.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:48.560
The carrier, which is the
laser frequency, plus two side

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.170
bends at omega Rabi.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:57.360
So therefore, what we now
expect for the spectrum is we

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.730
have the laser
frequency, and this

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.430
is sort of our result
for low intensity.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:14.182
However, when we-- in the
limit of strong drive,

00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:15.890
and you will see in
a moment where strong

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.400
drive clearly comes in.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.450
So if you have this modulation
at the Rabi frequency,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.940
you obtain side bends
at the Rabi frequency.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.900
And the fact that there is
a structure with three peaks

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.630
is actually the
famous Mollow triplet.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.170
I know when I was
a graduate student

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.170
there was big excitement
because people measured

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.880
for the first time
the Mollow triplet.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.020
You need high resolution
lasers and such,

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.530
and people were just
ready to measure that.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:54.570
Now it seems something which we
just mention in basic courses

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.800
because it's such
a basic phenomenon.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.680
OK, but let's work a
little bit more on that,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:09.190
namely the Rabi frequency is
the Rabi frequency of the drive,

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.230
or you can say the
coupling matrix element.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:15.980
But when we have a
detuning-- and this

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.710
is what you want
to discuss now--

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.640
you have to add the
detuning in quadrature.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.010
So this is a frequency at
which the atomic population

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.510
oscillates, and it is
just semi classically

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.320
the modulation of the
atomic population which

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.560
creates the side bends.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.030
Now if you take that to the
limit of large detuning,

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:44.850
or small drive, small Rabi
frequency, this becomes delta.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:55.830
So that actually means if you
go to our stick diagram here,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.430
the laser frequency is, of
course, detuned by delta

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.110
from the atomic frequency.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.590
But the Rabi frequency is delta,
and this is the Rabi frequency.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:15.520
Maybe some people who pressed
A and B feel now vindicated,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:23.410
because now you have a component
of the emission spectrum, which

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.770
is at the atomic
resonance frequency.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.760
And you have a
second peak, which

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.670
is omega 0 minus 2
delta or 2 omega Rabi.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.110
Question.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.760
How would you give
a simple answer

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.190
if I would ask you but what
about energy conservation?

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.530
I was hammering so much
on energy conservation.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.490
How can we conserve energy
by have a laser photon

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.615
and emitting one at a
different frequency?

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.630
PROFESSOR: It's
compensated with that.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.770
And now let me ask
you another question.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.470
If you would scatter n photons
and you do an experiment,

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.360
you would expect that, due to
Poisson fluctuation and such--

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.990
we've talked about fluctuations
of intensity and squeezed light

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.680
and all that.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.340
But unless you do
something special,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.600
you would expect if you excite
an atom it emits n photons.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.430
You experiment.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.017
You measure plus
minus square root

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.600
and you measure
Poisson in statistics.

00:27:36.815 --> 00:27:39.920
But now let's
expect you observe n

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.224
plus photons on the
upper side bend.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.280
And you measure and you observe
n minus photons on the lower

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.730
side bend.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.110
Would you expect that
n plus and n minus both

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.430
have now Poisson
fluctuations, or would you

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.680
expect something else?

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.930
In other words, let
me be very specific,

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:17.250
if you count n plus-- we can
make it a clicker question.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.540
So you have a
counting experiment,

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:31.320
and you have n plus photons
in the upper side bend and n

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.797
minus in the lower side bend.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:44.910
And if you simply look
at the variance, which

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.200
is the square of the standard
deviation from n plus,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.610
you find that it is
Poisson distributed.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.440
So the question
which I have now is

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:02.090
what is the variance between
n plus minus n minus.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:08.505
Is it simply the variance
of n plus plus the variance

00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:09.355
of n minus?

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.520
The second answer I
want to give you is 0.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.340
And the third answer
is something else.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:30:04.760
So this is A. This
is B. And this is C.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.888
Yes.

00:30:05.888 --> 00:30:08.030
Energy conservation.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.590
So there shouldn't
be any fluctuation.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:16.044
The emission of the upper side
bend and the lower side bend

00:30:16.044 --> 00:30:16.960
have to be correlated.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:24.420
And you would immediately
verify that if I

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.990
show you what is the diagram.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.950
We have ground
and excited state.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.180
We excite with a laser
which has detuning.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.000
But then we emit a photon
on the lower side bend.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.270
The second laser photon
can now resonantly reach

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.530
the excited state.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.840
And so you see we have absorbed
two photons from the laser

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.640
beam.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.050
And what we have
emitted in this diagram

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.540
is one lower and
one upper side bend.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:01.020
This is what happens
in second order-- well,

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.300
second order in the laser
beam, but fourth order

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:03.980
in the diagram.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.770
We emit four photons.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:10.390
And each time the
system does it,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.560
goes through that,
it fulfills energy.

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.430
Or if I call the upper side
bend click and the lower side

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:20.720
bend clack.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.160
The atom only makes click
clack click clack clack click

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.950
clack clack click clack.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.876
It never does click
click clack clack.

00:31:27.876 --> 00:31:32.410
It cannot do two clicks because
it has to fulfill this diagram,

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.330
and they always come in pair.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.322
The two photons always
come correlated.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:51.750
OK, so we understand
now the spectrum.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.650
We understand when the
resonant photons emerge.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.760
They emerge in
the high intensity

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.435
limit due to Rabi oscillations.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:08.890
The question is now what is
the widths of those peaks?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:18.870
And I'm want to short you
that too, because no you

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:23.640
realize some things are easy,
but other things are harder.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.740
In order to get that, you have
to solve the optical Bloch

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.470
equations, but I want to show
you in the next half hour

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:33.456
how we can at least get the
salient features of this.

00:32:33.456 --> 00:32:34.580
Colin, you have a question?

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:39.760
AUDIENCE: The picture you just
offered about the [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.245
That's assuming that
we're not depleting

00:32:42.245 --> 00:32:45.094
the carrier [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:45.094 --> 00:32:46.718
Because if we're
depleting the carrier,

00:32:46.718 --> 00:32:49.700
wouldn't we expect
to see sort of

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:55.745
like a high order, almost
like a Bessel function.

00:32:55.745 --> 00:32:56.620
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.810
OK, yes.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.470
AUDIENCE: First order on
to the second [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.100
PROFESSOR: Yes, thanks for
bringing that to our attention.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.480
There is an assumption.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.810
When I said we
have a laser beam,

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.860
I assume we have
a laser beam which

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:14.670
delivers zillions of
photons in such a way

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.820
that depletion
doesn't play a role.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.420
What that means technically
we replace a laser beam by a c

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.700
number, and a c
number never changes,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.580
therefore cannot be depleted.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.630
But if you would use a
very weak laser beam,

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.350
we have to modify the answer.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:37.100
The extreme case would be if
we use single photon sources,

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.360
then of course we can
never scatter two photons

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.310
because there's only one
photon in the source.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.465
But already if you would
have hundreds or photons

00:33:46.465 --> 00:33:49.570
in your cavity and you
put in a single atom,

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.870
the scheduling of
single photons would not

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.290
cause major depletion effects.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.191
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:58.137
AUDIENCE: In regards to the semi
classical [? fabrication ?],

00:33:58.137 --> 00:34:00.101
we said we have
a Rabi frequency,

00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:02.065
and when it's excited
it's likely to emit,

00:34:02.065 --> 00:34:04.892
and when it's in the ground
state it's not likely to emit.

00:34:04.892 --> 00:34:06.975
So whatever frequency you
emit should be modulated

00:34:06.975 --> 00:34:11.148
by your Rabi frequency,
but aren't you

00:34:11.148 --> 00:34:13.849
most likely to emit when
you have a dipole moment?

00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:16.873
Which would be in the
intermediate states between e

00:34:16.873 --> 00:34:20.006
and g, in which case those
occur at twice the Rabi

00:34:20.006 --> 00:34:21.693
frequencies I think.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.579
PROFESSOR: OK, now
you go to subtleties

00:34:29.579 --> 00:34:31.969
of a semi classical picture.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.409
Number one is-- I just want
to say we're a little bit

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.630
dangerous, on
slippery slope here.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.400
One is I really discuss
the spectrum here.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.909
When I discuss the
spectrum, I don't

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.909
know when the photon is emitted.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.780
So when I said we have
a Rabi oscillation,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.340
I told you that the
system is modulated,

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.400
and this gives
rise to side bends.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:03.010
But I can only spectrally
solve the side bends

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:06.910
if I fundamentally do not have
the time resolution to measure

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.910
when in the Rabi cycle
is the photon emitted.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.880
The moment I would localize
when the photon is emitted,

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.500
whether the atom is in the
ground or in the excited state,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.670
if I have a time resolution
better than the Rabi

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.380
oscillation, I do not have
the spectral resolution

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.310
to resolve the side bends.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:28.050
So therefore the question
when the photon is emitted

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.095
is not compatible with
observing the spectrum.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:46.420
The second question, I
think, can be addressed.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.790
And that's the following.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.110
I will show you in
the next 45 minutes

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.770
during this class
that the steady states

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.710
solution of the
optical Bloch equations

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:05.830
give us a rate of
photon scattering

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.580
which is simply gamma times
the excited state fraction.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.940
So I think from that I would
say the more you have atoms

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.560
in the excited state, the
larger is the scattering rate.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.420
So therefore, the
semi classical picture

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.240
that you have only a dipole
moment when you are halfway

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.380
between ground and excited
state is overly simplistic here.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:37.520
Also, I just want to give
you one word of warning.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.810
It's really an
important comment.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.710
And this is the following.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:46.780
The oscillating dipole
moment is a picture

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.035
which uses sort of the
analogy with the atom

00:36:50.035 --> 00:36:51.696
and the harmonic oscillator.

00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:53.070
And I mean yeah,
I really sort of

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.903
was a bit provocative
a few minutes ago when

00:36:54.903 --> 00:36:58.160
I said just regard the atom
as a harmonic oscillator.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.720
But you have to be careful.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.770
There is one fundamental
limit between-- one

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:07.330
fundamental difference between
the harmonic oscillator

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.230
and a two level atom.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:10.960
And the fact is the following.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:17.610
This is a two level atom, and
this is a harmonic oscillator.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.570
So the difference
is the following.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.110
An harmonic oscillator
can be excited.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:24.160
You can pump more and
more energy in it.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.230
You can go to larger
amplitude coherent states,

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:29.860
and there is no non linearity.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.820
The atom saturates.

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.050
And this is the difference.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.730
Saturation.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.690
When saturation comes, when you
put more than a few percent,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.330
let's say 50%, into
the excited state,

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.100
you have to be very,
very, very careful

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.380
with analogies with the
harmonic oscillator.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:49.890
So if you have most of the
population in the ground

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.400
state, a little bit here,
and almost nothing here,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.320
then we can describe the atom
as an harmonic oscillator.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.810
And everything you glean
from the model of an electron

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.740
tethered with a spring is
not only qualitatively,

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.330
it's quantitatively
correct if you

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.600
throw in the oscillator
strength of the atom.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:14.080
But the moment you pile
up more population here,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.000
and you just ask
about 50-50, at least

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.010
I would say
immediately be careful.

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.560
Do not take the harmonic
oscillator fully seriously

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.200
at this point, because there's
a fundamental difference.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.870
In the harmonic oscillator,
when you're 50% here,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.650
you would have
things over there.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.400
The harmonic oscillator
stays linear.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.340
But the two level system
starts to saturate.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:41.750
Good.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.230
So the question is now we
understand the stick diagram

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.510
of the Mollow
triplet that we have

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.990
always a line at the carrier.

00:39:01.662 --> 00:39:03.440
Let me just put marks here.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.230
We have the carrier and
the resonance frequency,

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.810
but the question is now what
is the width of the spectrum.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.340
The general answer
is rather difficult,

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.030
but let me give it to you.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.950
And I will derive it from
the optical Bloch equation.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.900
Let me discuss that one
limit where the detuning is

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.800
larger than anything else.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.070
And the other case
is the resonant case.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:46.220
In general we
started out by saying

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.950
we have a delta function
at low intensity.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.810
If you now go to higher
and higher intensity,

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.650
you still sort of have the delta
function from the lowest order

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:01.550
diagram, but the higher order
diagram become more important.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:09.340
And the spectrum is in
general a superposition

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.060
of three broadened peaks
and the delta function.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.320
At low intensity, you only
have the delta function.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.800
At high intensity, the
weight of the elastic scatter

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.050
the delta function goes to 0.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.250
And now let's
discuss the widths.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.790
And that shows you that even
light scattering by a two level

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:33.550
system, those very, very
simple Jaynes Cummings model

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.530
has interesting and maybe
non intuitive aspect.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.620
The side bends have
a width of gamma.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.060
The carrier has a
width of 2 gamma.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:51.680
But when you are on resonance,
the situation changes.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.540
The carrier has now a width
of gamma and side bends

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:02.631
have a width of 3/2 gamma.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:15.060
But if you look at it, the
sum of the three widths

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.266
is always 4 gamma.

00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:19.580
And you will understand
that in a few minutes.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:37.740
OK, so this was more
qualitative discussion.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:48.330
Let's now work
more quantitatively

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:52.780
and describe the Mollow triplet.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:07.960
The Hamiltonian for our system
is the atomic Hamiltonian

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.840
times the the z Pauli matrix.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.390
The z Pauli matrix
is excited excited

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.940
minus ground ground state.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:31.220
And because of the
conservation of probability,

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.310
it's 2 times the excited.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.300
Also just mathematically
it's just that.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.310
We have the three
Hamiltonian of the radiation

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.920
field, which is a dagger a.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.620
And then we have the coupling
of a two level system, which

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:55.810
is the product of the
atomic dipole moment written

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:59.110
as sigma plus plus sigma minus
raising and lowering operator.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.960
Just to remind us,
sigma plus is e g.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:12.950
And sigma minus is g e.

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:19.040
And then we have to multiply
with a plus a dagger.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.930
If you want, the atomic
part is the dipole moment,

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.660
and this is the electric field
both written as operators.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.030
So this is the electric field.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:38.950
And if you look at
the coupling term--

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.200
we've discussed it before.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.110
You have four terms.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.905
But in the rotating
wave approximation,

00:43:45.905 --> 00:43:49.980
which we want to use
here, we keep only

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.160
the two resonant
terms, which is when

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.630
we raise an excitation
in the atom,

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.810
we lose an excitation
in the light field.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:04.150
Or if you go from the
excited to the ground state,

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.890
we emit a photon.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.800
So we have two terms which
form the rotating wave

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.910
approximation.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.880
The other two terms
are highly of resonant

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.370
and can often be neglected.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.590
So this rotating
wave approximation

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.050
becomes of course the
better, the more we

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.710
go in resonant, because in
one term is fully resonant

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.140
and the other one is
very off resonant.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:43.790
And in this case, we can
simplify the Hamiltonian

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:48.770
because the number of
excitations is conserved.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.680
The number of
excitations is the number

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.980
of excitations in
the photon field

00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:02.840
plus the number
of excited atoms.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.583
So this is the
operator which measures

00:45:04.583 --> 00:45:05.666
the number of excitations.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.390
If in a [INAUDIBLE]
counter rotating term,

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.995
this operator is conserved.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:33.910
So if I introduce as
usual the detuning--

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.420
this is what my notes say.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.060
It seems to have
the opposite sign.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.090
I'm not sure if I made a
sign error here or later,

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:42.550
or if I changed the definition.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.720
Let's just move on and
see how it works out.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.020
So if you now do the
rotating wave approximation,

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:54.730
our Hamiltonian has now-- by
introducing the operator N,

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:58.220
the number of [INAUDIBLE]
times h bar omega.

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.320
However, we have
multiplied the N operator

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.010
with the photon energy.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.970
If the energy is in
the atom, we have

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:12.500
made a mistake, which is
delta, and we correct that

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.090
by using the z Pauli matrix.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:22.200
And then our interaction
term is a dagger times sigma

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.240
minus plus a times sigma plus.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:52.590
Let's now discuss
what are the eigen

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:58.620
states of this Hamiltonian
In the simple case

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.030
when the detuning is 0.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:18.510
And we have sort of two
levels of eigen state.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:23.620
One is the ground
state with n photons.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:27.870
And one is the excited
state with n photons.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.400
0, 1, 2.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.220
So we can label this
by the photon number.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:39.690
And the excited state
of course starts

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.690
with a higher
energy for 0 photon.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.470
This is the energy
with one photon.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:56.100
And in the case of 0 detuning,
the two letters are degenerate.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:09.510
And if we introduce the
interaction, if g is now non 0,

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.110
the levels split.

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:25.660
And the splitting is given by g.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.420
There's a factor of two.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.970
But now if you have
photons in the field,

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:37.400
a dagger acting on the photon
field gives n plus one.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.960
So therefore for one photon
we have square root 2.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.530
In general, we get an expression
which is square root n plus 1.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:49:00.680
Or to write it
mathematically, if we

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:05.150
have strong mixing
between an excited

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:09.570
state with n atoms--
with n photons.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:14.450
And a ground state with n plus
1 photons, for the case of delta

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.690
equals 0, it's just plus minus.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.870
You metric as a metric
contribution times 1

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:21.790
over square root 2.

00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:25.180
And these are now with the
states we label plus minus.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:29.810
The upper and lower
state of each manifold.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.980
And n is the photon number
in the excited state.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.840
n plus 1 is the photon
number in the ground state.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:50.990
And the energy of those states
is the number of [INAUDIBLE] n

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:53.330
plus 1.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:57.770
But then we have the
resonant splitting g.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:02.220
And because of the matrix
element of a and a dagger,

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.750
we get square root n plus 1.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:16.130
Now if you use
very strong drive--

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:24.050
and this addresses Colin's
question about depletion--

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:29.210
we use a laser beam, which is
described by a Rabi frequency.

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:32.460
This is proportional
to the electric field.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.530
So be introduce
the Rabi frequency,

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.680
which is given by that.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.510
And the laser beam
has so many photons

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.140
that we don't care about n plus
1 or scattering a few photons,

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:49.530
so we simply replace n n plus 1
n minus 1, whatever contains n,

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:53.689
by the z number, which is the
Rabi frequency of the laser

00:50:53.689 --> 00:50:54.189
beam.

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:13.871
So this eventually means
that we have too many folds.

00:51:13.871 --> 00:51:15.070
Plus, minus.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.010
Plus, minus.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:19.800
So we have two
states plus minus,

00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.900
and they are periodic when we
add one photon to the field.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:30.037
Periodic in n.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:42.170
The splitting is the Rabi
frequency defined above.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:47.930
And now we realize that when
we have spontaneous emission

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:58.980
between the manifold for n
minus 1 and the manifold n,

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.800
we have two possibilities.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.720
To emit light on resonance.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:18.190
And we have then one possibility
to emit an upper side bend.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:20.770
And one possibility to
emit the lower side bend.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:32.480
So what is called
the dressed atom

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:38.420
picture is nothing else than
the solution of an atom driven

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.520
by a strong monochromatic field.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.410
The atom is dressed
with photons,

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.330
and the eigen states are
no longer just atomic eigen

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:47.040
states.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.550
These are dressed eigenstates
of the combined atomic system

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.870
plus laser field.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:59.440
So this dressed atom picture
explains the Mollow triplet.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:13.590
And you can immediately
generalize it

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.860
if you want to
arbitrarily tuning

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.660
when the superposition
states plus minus do not

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.450
have equal weight.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.030
But it's what you've
seen a million times,

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.880
the diagonalization of
a two by two matrix.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.616
Colin?

00:53:26.616 --> 00:53:29.192
AUDIENCE: How does this
explain the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:29.192 --> 00:53:30.150
PROFESSOR: It does not.

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.070
This is what I
just wanted to say.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:38.220
It explains the Mollow triplet,
but not the line widths.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:47.360
The line widths cannot be
obtained perturbatively.

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:55.550
So for that we have to discuss
now the Bloch vector, which

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.720
is a solution of the
optical Bloch equation.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.260
So now I'm going to explain
you not all glorious details,

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.250
but the salient feature
of the line bits.

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:18.030
So the density matrix
for two level atom

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:24.190
can be written as-- let
me back up a moment.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.830
The density matrix has
four matrix elements.

00:54:27.830 --> 00:54:30.470
But if the sum of the
diagonal matrix element

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:32.550
is one conservation
of probability,

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.360
we have actually three
independent matrix elements.

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.440
And those three
independent matrix elements

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:44.400
can be parametrized by what
is called the Bloch vector.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.890
A lot of you have seen it.

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:49.760
We also discuss it in
great detail in 8421.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.500
But I'm giving you
the definition.

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:58.020
And sigma is the vector
of Pauli matrices.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:02.390
To be specific, the three
components of the Bloch vector

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.370
are as follows.

00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:07.680
The z comportment
measures, you can say,

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.920
the population inversion.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:15.430
The difference between ground
and excited state population.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:21.800
And the x and y component
measure the coherencies.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:27.090
Either the sum of
the coherencies

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.880
or the difference
of the coherencies.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.370
And here is minus
imaginary unit.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.600
If you replace the density
matrix or the matrix elements

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:54.310
sigma ee, or ee,
or gg by definition

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:58.290
the optical Bloch equation
turns into differential

00:55:58.290 --> 00:55:59.230
equation for r.

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.050
It's now a differential
equation for r.

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:23.950
And let me just write it down.

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:27.780
Let me just write down
the Hamiltonian part.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.670
This is the equation of
motion for the density matrix.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:48.819
I will add on in a minute
the relaxation part

00:56:48.819 --> 00:56:50.360
which comes from
the master equation.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.970
This is just the
Hamiltonian part.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:58.230
And this would result
into an equation

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:02.410
of motion for the
Bloch vector, which

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:11.388
has delta here minus
delta here minus g.

00:57:11.388 --> 00:57:17.070
g and the rest of the
matrix elements is 0.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:22.990
The Hamiltonian, using
rotation matrices,

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:26.890
can be written by
a z rotation matrix

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:31.992
plus g times the x rotation.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:56.120
And if you actually look at the
solution-- it's not a finite.

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.970
It's an infinitesimal rotation.

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:21.810
This matrix tells you that the
detuning does a z rotation,

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:27.246
and the drive is responsible
for an x rotation.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.890
Let me tell you what happens.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:43.670
You have seen the Bloch
vector many cases.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:46.835
If you don't drive the
system, the Bloch vector

00:58:46.835 --> 00:58:48.880
in the ground state is down.

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.220
In the upper state it's up.

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:56.500
If it's in between-- that's
where Timo's dipole moment

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.000
comes in-- we have
a superposition

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.190
of ground and excited state.

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:04.940
And it rotates at the
atomic frequency omega 0.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.550
But we are in the rotating
frame of the laser at omega,

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.940
so in the rotating frame, when
the frame rotates with omega.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.270
And omega 0 rotation becomes
the rotation with delta.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.120
So therefore, the free
evolution of the atom

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.760
is based on this Hamiltonian
that the Bloch vector rotates

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.190
with delta in the rotating
frame of the laser.

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:31.790
And it's a rotation
around the z-axis.

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.860
If you drive the system now,
we take the Bloch vector

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:39.910
from ground to excited,
there are Rabi oscillations.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:43.290
And this is now a rotation
around the x-axis.

00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:46.540
Well, whether it's x or y
is a convention of notation,

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.235
and I've defined it such
that the driven system is

00:59:49.235 --> 00:59:50.640
an x rotation.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.300
The free evolution
is a z rotation.

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.780
And that's all you have to know.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:56.490
This is the most
general solution

00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:00.070
of two level system
without dissipation

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:02.300
that we have two
rotation angles.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:05.830
One is the free rotation,
which is the detuning.

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.300
It is the z-axis.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.550
And the driven system
rotates around the x-axis.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.660
But now this is well known.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.810
This is boring.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:25.690
But now we want to add what
the master equation gives us.

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:34.150
And the master equation uses
as its [? limb ?] platform

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.960
where we have the sigma
plus jump operator.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:48.490
And I told you that we have
to use the following form.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.040
We'll hear more about
it, probably not today,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:52.910
but on Friday.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.530
You know that this gives
simply the optical--

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:04.630
this gives us simply the
optical Bloch equations.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:10.330
We discussed it on Monday that
we have now a damping gamma

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.470
term for the population.

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:16.490
An excited state population
decays with a rate of gamma.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.510
And the coherences, the off
diagonal matrix elements,

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.730
decay with a rate
of gamma over 2,

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.380
and we spent a long time
discussing this vector of 2.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:31.850
So this would mean now that the
equation for the Bloch vector

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:40.500
has gamma 2 terms, which
comes from the dampening

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.280
of the coherences.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.115
And it has gamma, which is
the damping of the population.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.240
Well if that would be all,
everything is damped to 0,

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:07.000
but everything is in the end
leads to the ground state

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.700
population.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.990
So we have to add this term.

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.940
It's just a different way of
the optical Bloch equations.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.470
We have discussed
in great lengths

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:20.480
this form of the
optical Bloch equations.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.080
And the sigma plus sigma minus
is because these are just

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.635
simple matrices with
one matrix element.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.900
You've seen the optical
Bloch equation, I think.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.200
We did also that
in 8421 21 that you

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.620
have the derivative
of the density matrix

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:41.990
includes now damping of the
off diagonal matrix elements

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:44.646
by gamma over 2 damping by
the diagonal matrix elements

01:02:44.646 --> 01:02:45.145
by gamma.

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:56.020
If you simply substitute the r
vector for the matrix element,

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.190
you get this
equation in one step.

01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:06.880
These are now the
optical Bloch equations

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:10.055
written as a differential
equation for the Bloch vector.

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:25.910
OK, sorry if that was confusing,
but it's simple definition

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:28.010
substitution no brainer.

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:30.980
These are the optical
Bloch equations

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:33.180
written in terms
of the Bloch vector

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:36.020
and no longer in terms
of the density matrix.

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.115
And questions about that?

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:46.470
OK, because now I want
to draw conclusions.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:51.430
Our goal is to understand
the spectrum and the line

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.820
widths of the Mollow triplet
of the emitted light.

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:58.990
So I have to make
the connection.

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:05.170
How do I make the connection
from the Bloch vector

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:09.080
to emitted light?

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.720
Well, it's done by
the dipole moment,

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.630
because it is the
oscillating dipole which

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:18.470
is responsible for emitting
and scattering light.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.880
The dipole moment
can of course be

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.420
obtained from the solution
of the optical Bloch

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.500
equation for the density matrix.

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.020
It is the trace of
the density matrix

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.870
times the operator
we are interested in.

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:39.300
And this involves the
matrix element dge.

01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:50.500
The dipole moment has
only matrix elements

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.600
between excited
and ground state.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.550
And ground and excited state.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.045
Trace rho other parentheses.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.780
So this is the matrix element.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:39.660
Let me now write down
the density matrix

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:45.140
in its matrix element
rho ge plus rho eg.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.110
But now we want to
go from the rotating

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:53.910
frame back to the lab frame.

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:58.360
And the rotating frame
rotates at omega.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.540
So now I have to put back
e to the i omega t and e

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.600
to the minus i omega t.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.890
This is sort of going back from
the rotating frame to the lab

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:09.390
frame.

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:18.080
And the picture
of we want to use

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.780
is-- the intuitive picture
is to use the Bloch vector.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.340
So I'm expressing now
those matrix elements

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:32.213
by the component x and
y of the Bloch vector.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.120
And since the x and y component
was the sum or difference

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:45.750
of diagram matrix element of
the density the coherences.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.640
I get now cosine omega
t and sine omega t.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:07:03.510
So that tells us that one
component is in phase--

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:11.970
well in phase means with respect
to the driving field we assume

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:15.730
that the system is
driven by classical field

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.130
e0 cosine omega t.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:22.190
And now we find that the
oscillating dipole moment,

01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:23.870
it's a driven
harmonic oscillator.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.700
And there is a part which is
driven in phase with the drive

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.840
field, and one which
is in quadrature.

01:07:37.167 --> 01:07:38.500
So we have those two components.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:49.100
And the fact is
now the following.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:58.070
If you have an
oscillating dipole,

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:04.730
this gives rise to immediate--
or more accurately,

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:08.050
I should say scattered light.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:11.600
Remember, if you assume there
is photon first emitted and then

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:14.780
a resonant photon absorbed,
this picture is wrong.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:17.569
You should rather think
of scattering light,

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:20.460
but the light scattering is
induced by the oscillating

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.630
dipole.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:26.439
And what happens
now is-- and this

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:29.470
is why the Bloch vector
and the Bloch sphere

01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:32.590
is such a wonderful picture.

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:38.470
The dipole moment are
the transverse component

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.330
of the Bloch vector.

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:47.630
So therefore, you can
say that if you're

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:50.630
interested in the spectrum of
the emitted light, what you

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:55.029
should find out is what
is the spectrum of r.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.189
Let me back up one step.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:21.040
If you want to get the
spectrum of the emitted light

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.050
from first principles-- I'm
cheating a little bit here.

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:27.350
I'm saying let's get it
from the dipole moment.

01:09:27.350 --> 01:09:29.800
You should actually get it
from the correlation function

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.800
of the dipole moment.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:35.960
It's sort of the two time
correlation function.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.920
But you can show-- and this
takes another 10, 20, 30

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.880
pages in API.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:51.950
The temporal correlation
function of the dipole moment

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.850
fulfils the same differential
equation as the Bloch vector.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:09:59.660
So I've given you here
sort of the intuitive link

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.390
that would oscillates is the
Bloch vector it emits it.

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:04.720
But technically,
because you may not

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.990
control the phase of each
atom, you should rather

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.190
say the spectrum
is a correlation

01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:14.330
function of the
dipole, and we should

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.660
look at the spectrum of
the correlation function.

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:19.260
But instead, I'm looking
now at the spectrum

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.690
of the optical Bloch vector.

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.790
And you can show mathematically
exactly that they

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.530
obey the same
differential equation,

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:32.110
but it's a little bit
tedious to do that.

01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:39.400
OK, so therefore if you take
this little inaccuracy--

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.400
forgive me this inaccuracy.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.060
Once we know what
the optical Bloch

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.915
vector is doing spectrally,
we know the spectrum

01:10:49.915 --> 01:10:52.620
of the emitted light.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:11:01.980
And for that, for the
optical Bloch vector,

01:11:01.980 --> 01:11:07.180
we simply look at
this matrix, and we

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.590
ask what are the
eigenvalues of this matrix?

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:20.420
This matrix has three by three
matrices, three eigenvalues.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.890
The real part of
those eigenvalues

01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:26.000
gives us the position
of the Mollow triplet.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.420
And the imaginary part gives
us the widths of those peaks.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.730
So if you look at
this matrix-- and I'm

01:11:33.730 --> 01:11:35.780
not doing the
complicated cases here.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:42.830
If you look at this matrix for
delta equals 0 and g equals 0.

01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:46.020
Well it is already
in diagonal form,

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.440
so it has three
imaginary eigenvalues

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:52.050
minus gamma over 2 minus
gamma 2 minus gamma.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:12.170
So this matrix has three
complex eigenvalues.

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:14.900
And I want to discuss two cases.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:26.810
For this case we have
minus gamma over 2

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:36.920
for the x and y component
of the optical Bloch vector.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.050
And the z component
is minus gamma.

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:50.730
And this is the situation.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.250
Apart from a factor
of two that we

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.420
have gamma, 2 gamma, and gamma.

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:08.280
The fact of 2 comes of course.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.070
Are you asking what is the
spectrum of the electric field

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:12.740
or what is the
spectrum of the power?

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.390
If you go from e
to e squared, then

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:19.362
if you have an exponential
decay with gamma of e,

01:13:19.362 --> 01:13:21.220
e squared decays with two gamma.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.772
So that's where
factors of 2 come from.

01:13:23.772 --> 01:13:28.191
AUDIENCE: Can you label the top
of the diagram with [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:28.191 --> 01:13:29.664
just the delta equals 0.

01:13:34.855 --> 01:13:35.480
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:46.180
Give me a second.

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:51.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
g equals 0, right?

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.870
PROFESSOR: The
fact is here we're

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:55.750
looking at limiting cases.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.500
And the more important
thing is that this

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.490
is the case of weak drive.

01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:05.790
So what is more important is
that the drive frequency is 0.

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.770
I'm not giving you
the full picture here.

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.180
The full glorious
derivation is in API.

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:18.110
And just tried to
sort of entertain

01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:20.160
you by giving you
a few appetizers.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.620
If you want, read it up there.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:24.860
But what I want to show you
is they're two simple cases,

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.565
but it looks already
intriguing because here this

01:14:27.565 --> 01:14:31.090
is wider than the side bends,
and here it's the opposite.

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.140
And I want to give
you a taste of it.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.550
And I'm not doing it
rigorously, and you're right,

01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:37.060
I have to think about it.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:41.810
But the important part is
that the drive frequency is 0.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:45.220
We are not driving, we
are not rotating in x.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.980
The system is mainly
rotating around the z-axis.

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:57.690
And at that moment, the matrix
for the differential equation

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:01.420
for the optical Bloch vector
has three imaginary parts.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.400
It's gamma, 2 gamma,
and gamma or half of it

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.920
if you look at the amplitude.

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.520
And now I want to just
show you in a second how

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.450
we can get the second part.

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:12.770
But yeah, I'm guilty as charged.

01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:14.600
There are small
gaps in my argument.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.130
But all I want to
show you is how

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:20.160
you find-- I want to
just sort of convince you

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.470
that the optical Bloch
equations with this matrix

01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:25.470
have all the ingredients
to explain it.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.980
OK, so what I've done
here is I've shown you

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:40.160
that we have those
three ingredients.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:47.210
And actually the moment--
I should have said it

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.810
before answering your question.

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:53.620
When we now crank up delta,
what we're physically doing

01:15:53.620 --> 01:16:09.620
is we're doing a rapid
rotation of the Bloch vector

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:11.540
around the z-axis.

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.860
So when we rapidly
around the z-axis,

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.090
we're not doing anything
to the z component,

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:18.990
but we're strongly mixing
the x and y component,

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:21.290
but since [? half ?]
the imaginary part--

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:22.600
I'm waving my hands now.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.340
We're not changing the
imaginary part for x and y.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.070
And we still have two imaginary
parts, which are gamma over 2.

01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:31.450
One imaginary part
which is gamma.

01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.200
I know I'm running out
of time, but I only

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200
need a few more minutes.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:53.940
So if you do a rapid
rotation around the z-axis,

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.850
we obtain three eigenvalues.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:04.365
Since we rotate around the
z-axis, we have minus gamma.

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:32.566
Sorry, my notes are better
than what I remember.

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:33.690
I looked through the notes.

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:36.180
But what I wanted to
say was the following.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.340
I first show you what
are the eigenvalues

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.750
of this matrix in one case,
which is just a warm up.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:46.400
I'm telling you there
are those three values.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.570
And now I'm saying
we are interested

01:17:48.570 --> 01:17:51.520
in the physical situation
of rapid rotation.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:18:00.030
The rapid rotation modifies
the three eigenvalues.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:03.830
The three eigenvalues
are no longer real.

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:06.780
The rapid rotation
around the z-axis

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.210
adds an imaginary i delta
to the x and y-axis.

01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:14.890
Because now we are rotating,
x and y are getting mixed.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:19.110
And this means now that
we have three peaks.

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:22.560
They are located in the
rotating frame at 0.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:27.750
This is the carrier
at plus minus delta.

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:29.450
These are the two side bends.

01:18:29.450 --> 01:18:32.380
And this part are
the widths of it.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.000
This is how you have to
interpret the result.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.170
So we have to know three peaks.

01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:40.730
And the full widths
of half maximum

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:44.970
for the intensity, which
is the amplitude squared

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:47.510
is gamma, 2 gamma, and gamma.

01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:57.400
And we can now immediately
proceed to the next case.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:03.270
If we are on resonance, and
we drive The system strongly,

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:08.850
now we are driving the
system strongly around,

01:19:08.850 --> 01:19:12.860
not the z-axis,
around the x-axis.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:17.850
So now if we add the strong
drive around the x-axis,

01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:22.740
we have now eigenvalues
which is plus minus ig.

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.580
This is the rotation
we add, and this

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.120
gives e to the
i-- in rotation ge

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.675
to the i omega t gives an ig.

01:19:32.890 --> 01:19:35.860
And what happens
is the following.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:47.340
The rapid rotation
around the x-axis-- well,

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.110
if you rotate around the
x-axis, you're not touching x.

01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:56.410
And without any rotation,
we had an eigenvalue

01:19:56.410 --> 01:19:58.970
for x which was
minus gamma over 2.

01:19:58.970 --> 01:20:01.230
And if you take the matrix
of whatever the system

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:10.356
and rotate it around the
x-axis, this is preserved.

01:20:10.356 --> 01:20:11.210
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:13.020
PROFESSOR: Yep, I
need one more minute.

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.310
Sorry.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:20.910
But the rotation around
x strongly mixes y and z.

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:23.310
So therefore the two
other eigenvalues

01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:26.320
appear at rotation ig.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:30.820
And it is now the average
of gamma and gamma over 2,

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.300
which is 3/4 gamma.

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:38.260
And if you go to the
amplitude squared, it is 3/2.

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.670
So therefore we
have the situation

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:46.676
that we have those
three eigenvalues.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:55.370
And this is responsible
for the three peaks

01:20:55.370 --> 01:21:01.680
at plus minus g and 0.

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.860
And the widths of it
is I have to multiply

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.700
by a factor of 2
gamma and 3/2 gamma.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:13.170
And this explains the
two limiting cases

01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:15.620
I presented to you earlier.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.840
No time for question, the
other people are waiting.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.900
Reminder we have
class on Friday.
