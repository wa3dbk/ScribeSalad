00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:16.401
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.520
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.800
What we did so far was
a lot of fun, was

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.050
it useful for anything?

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.380
I suppose the answer
is going to be yes.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.930
If these metacircular
interpreters are a valuable

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.180
thing to play with.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.300
Well, there have been times I
spend 50% of my time, over a

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.590
year, trying various design
alternatives by experimenting

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.600
with them with metacircular
interpreters--

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.570
metacircular interpreters like
the sort you just saw.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.910
Metacircular is because they
are defined in terms of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.830
themselves in such a way that
the language they interpret

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.270
contains itself.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.080
Such interpreters are a
convenient medium for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.800
exploring language issues.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.010
If you want to try adding a new
feature, it's sort of a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.490
snap, it's easy, you just do
it and see what happens.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.710
You play with that language for
a while you say, gee, I'm

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.090
didn't like that, you
throw it away.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.640
Or you might want to see what
the difference is if you'd

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.080
make a slight difference in the
binding strategy, or some

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.720
more complicated things
that might occur.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.810
In fact, these metacircular
interpreters are an excellent

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.030
medium for people exchanging
ideas about language design,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.960
because they're pretty easy to
understand, and they're short,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.690
and compact, and simple.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.360
If I have some idea that I want
somebody to criticize

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.770
like say, Dan Friedman at
Indiana, I'd write a little

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.260
metacircular interpreter and
send him some network mail

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.450
with this interpreter in it.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.900
He could whip it up on his
machine and play with it and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.940
say, that's no good.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.706
And then send it back to me and
say, well, why don't you

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:16.880
try this one, it's
a little better.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.160
So I want to show you some
of that technology.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.750
See, because, really, it's the
essential, simple technology

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.760
for getting started in designing
your own languages

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.790
for particular purposes.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.210
Let's start by adding a very
simple feature to a Lisp.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.800
Now, one thing I want
to tell you about is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.370
features, before I start.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.100
There are many languages that
have made a mess of themselves

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.620
by adding huge numbers
of features.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.620
Computer scientists have a joke
about bugs that transform

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.520
it to features all the time.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.120
But I like to think of it is
that many systems suffer from

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.820
what's called creeping
featurism.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.740
Which is that George has a pet
feature he'd like in the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.170
system, so he adds it.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.480
And then Harry says, gee, this
system is no longer what

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.640
exactly I like, so I'm going
to add my favorite feature.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.710
And then Jim adds his
favorite feature.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.280
And, after a while, the thing
has a manual 500 pages long

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.790
that no one can understand.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.780
And sometimes it's the same
person who writes all of these

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.830
features and produces this
terribly complicated thing.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.250
In some cases, like editors,
it's sort of reasonable to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.940
have lots of features, because
there are a lot of things you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.730
want to be able to do and
many of them arbitrary.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.440
But in computer languages, I
think it's a disaster to have

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.690
too much stuff in them.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.860
The other alternative you get
into is something called

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.300
feeping creaturism, which is
where you have a box which has

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.370
a display, a fancy display, and
a mouse, and there is all

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.010
sorts of complexity associated
with all this fancy IO.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.430
And your computer language
becomes a dismal, little, tiny

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.430
thing that barely works because
of all the swapping,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.080
and disk twitching, and so on,
caused by your Windows system.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.650
And every time you go near the
computer, the mouse process

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.910
wakes up and says, gee do you
have something for me to do,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.440
and then it goes
back to sleep.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.210
And if you accidentally push
mouse with you elbow, a big

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.600
puff of smoke comes out
of your computer

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.940
and things like that.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.030
So two ways to disastrously
destroy a

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.500
system by adding features.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.730
But try right now to add a
little, simple feature.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.350
This actually is a good
one, and in fact,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.250
real Lisps have it.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.420
As you've seen, there are
procedures like plus and times

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.430
that take any number
of arguments.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.440
So we can write things like the
sum of the product of a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.540
and x and x, and the product
of b and x and c.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.210
As you can see here, addition
takes three arguments or two

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.230
arguments, multiplication takes
two arguments or three

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.290
arguments, taking numbers of
arguments all of which are to

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.000
be treated in the same way.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.300
This is a valuable thing,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.960
indefinite numbers of arguments.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.460
Yet the particular Lisp system
that I showed you is one where

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.600
the numbers of arguments is
fixed, because I had to match

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.910
the arguments against the
formal parameters in the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.850
binder, where there's
a pairup.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.460
Well, I'd like to be able to
define new procedures like

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.590
this that can have any
number of arguments.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.150
Well there's several parts
to this problem.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.870
The first part is coming
up with the syntactic

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.620
specification, some way of
notating the additional

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.480
arguments, of which you don't
know how many there are.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.980
And then there's the other
thing, which is once we've

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.940
notated it, how are we going to
interpret that notation so

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.980
as to do the right thing,
whatever the right thing is?

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.230
So let's consider an example
of a sort of thing we might

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.480
want to be able to do.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.380
So an example might be, that
I might want to be able to

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.490
define a procedure which is a
procedure of one required

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.820
argument x and a bunch of
arguments, I don't know how

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.090
many there are, called y.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:07:00.725
So x is required, and there are
many y's, many argument--

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.990
y will be the list of them.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.370
Now, with such a thing, we might
be able to say something

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.720
like, map--

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.590
I'm going to do something
to every one--

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:30.055
of that procedure of one
argument u, which multiplies x

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:36.890
by u, and we'll apply
that to y.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.020
I've used a dot here to indicate
that the thing after

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.300
this is a list of all the
rest of the arguments.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.745
I'm making a syntactic
specification.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.870
Now, what this depends upon, the
reason why this is sort of

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.440
a reasonable thing to do, is
because this happens to be a

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.640
syntax that's used in
the Lisp reader for

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.631
representing conses.

00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.080
We've never introduced
that before.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.680
You may have seen when playing
with the system that if you

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.740
cons two things together, you
get the first, space, dot, the

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.800
second, space--

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.880
the first, space, dot, space,
the second with parentheses

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.980
around the whole thing.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:36.350
So that, for example, this x dot
y corresponds to a pair,

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.870
which has got an x in
it and a y in it.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.520
The other notations that you've
seen so far are things

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:55.720
like a procedure of arguments x
and y and z which do things,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.590
and that looks like--

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.910
Just looking at the bound
variable list, it looks like

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:18.280
this, x, y, z, and
the empty thing.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.590
If I have a list of arguments I
wish to match this against,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.110
supposing, I have a list of
arguments one, two, three, I

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:36.300
want to match these against. So
I might have here a list of

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:46.380
three things, one, two, three.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.220
And I want to match x, y, z
against one, two, three.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.830
Well, it's clear that the one
matches the x, because I can

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.130
just sort of follow the
structure, and the two matches

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.480
the y, and the three
matches the z.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.560
But now, supposing I were to
compare this x dot y--

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.460
this is x dot y--

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.010
supposing I compare that with
a list of three arguments,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.510
one, two, three.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.000
Let's look at that again.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.930
One, two, three--

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.970
Well, I can walk along here and
say, oh yes, x matches the

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:43.740
one, the y matches the list,
which is two and three.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.150
So the notation I'm choosing
here is one that's very

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.160
natural for Lisp system.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.790
But I'm going to choose this as
a notation for representing

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.040
a bunch of arguments.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.770
Now, there's an alternative
possibility.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.560
If I don't want to take one
special out, or two special

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.300
ones out or something like that,
if I don't want to do

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.420
that, if I want to talk about
just the list of all the

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.950
arguments like in addition, well
then the argument list

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.370
I'm going to choose to be that
procedure of all the arguments

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:25.140
x which does something with x.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.190
And which, for example, if I
take the procedure, which

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:35.040
takes all the arguments x and
returned the list of them,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:45.850
that's list. That's the
procedure list.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.840
How does this work?

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.610
Well, indeed what I had as the
bound variable list in this

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.450
case, whatever it is,
is being matched

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.140
against a list of arguments.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.145
This symbol now is all
of the arguments.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.830
And so this is the choice I'm
making for a particular

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:08.060
syntactic specification, for the
description of procedures

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.285
which take indefinite numbers
of arguments.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:18.420
There are two cases of it,
this one and this one.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.330
When you make syntactic
specifications, it's important

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.410
that it's unambiguous, that
neither of these can be

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.100
confused with a representation
we already have, this one.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.350
I can always tell whether
I have a fixed number of

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.180
explicitly named arguments
made by these formal

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.470
parameters, or a fixed number
of named formal parameters

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:49.240
followed by a thing which picks
up all the rest of them,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.620
or a list of all the arguments
which will be matched against

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.170
this particular formal parameter
called x, because

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.465
these are syntactically
distinguishable.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.960
Many languages make terrible
errors in that form where

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.340
whole segments of interpretation
are cut off,

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.560
because there are syntactic
ambiguities in the language.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.330
They are the traditional
problems with ALGOL like

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:22.810
languages having to do with
the nesting of ifs in the

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.060
predicate part.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.510
In any case, now, so I've told
you about the syntax, now,

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:35.250
what are we going to do about
the semantics of this?

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.590
How do we interpret it?

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.440
Well this is just super easy.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.900
I'm going to modify
the metacircular

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.396
interpreter to do it.

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:46.020
And that's a one liner.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.590
There it is.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.560
I'm changing the way
you pair things up.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:06.070
Here's the procedure that
pairs the variables, the

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:12.090
formal parameters, with the
arguments that were passed

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.080
from the last description of the
metacircular interpreter.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.840
And here's some things
that are the same

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.670
as they were before.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.880
In other words, if the list of
variables is empty, then if

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.050
the list of values is empty,
then I have an empty list.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:36.890
Otherwise, I have too many
arguments, that is, if I have

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.580
empty variables but
not empty values.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.713
If I have empty values, but the
variables are not empty, I

00:14:47.713 --> 00:14:50.090
have too few arguments.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.340
The variables are a symbol--

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.130
interesting case--

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:04.040
then, what I should do is say,
oh yes, this is the special

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.255
case that I have a
symbolic tail.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.900
I have here a thing just like
we looked over here.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.630
This is a tail which
is a symbol, y.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.730
It's not a nil.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.290
It's not the empty list. Here's
a symbolic tail that is

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.600
just the very beginning
of the tail.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.790
There is nothing else.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:36.540
In that case, I wish to match
that variable with all the

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:44.500
values and add that to the
pairing that I'm making.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.660
Otherwise, I go through the
normal arrangement of making

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.910
up the whole pairing.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.510
I suppose that's very simple.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.080
And that's all there is to it.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.330
And now I'll answer
some questions.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.220
The first one--

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.600
Are there any questions?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:06.950
Yes?

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.450
AUDIENCE: Could you explain
that third form?

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.590
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.280
Well, maybe we should look
at the thing as a

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.570
piece of list structure.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.400
This is a procedure which
contains a lambda.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.110
I'm just looking at
the list structure

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.090
which represents this.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.730
Here's x.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.980
These are our symbols.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.580
And then the body is
nothing but x.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.040
If I were looking for the bound
variable list part of

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.400
this procedure, I would go
looking at the CADR, and I'd

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.010
find a symbol.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.750
So the, naturally, which is
this pairup thing I just

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.570
showed you, is going to be
matching a symbolic object

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.760
against a list of arguments
that were passed.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.559
And it will bind that symbol
to the list of arguments.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.560
In this case, if I'm looking
for it, the match will be

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.920
against this in the bound
variable list position.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.020
Now, if what this does is it
gets a list of arguments and

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.450
returns it, that's list. That's
what the procedure is.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.140
Oh well, thank you.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.830
Let's take a break.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:18:20.358
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:20.358 --> 00:18:23.260
PROFESSOR: Well let's see.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.760
Now, I'm going to tell you
about a rather more

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:32.440
substantial variation, one
that's a famous variation that

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:38.250
many early Lisps had.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.770
It's called dynamic binding
of variables.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.680
And we'll investigate a little
bit about that right now.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.710
I'm going to first introduce
this by showing you the sort

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.740
of thing that would make
someone want this idea.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.680
I'm not going to tell what it is
yet, I'm going to show you

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.640
why you might want it.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.100
Suppose, for example, we looked
at the sum procedure

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:08.140
again for summing up
a bunch of things.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:15.860
To be that procedure, of a term,
lower bound, method of

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:25.560
computing the next index, and
upper bound, such that, if a

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:34.020
is greater than b then the
result is 0, otherwise, it's

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:40.680
the sum, of the term, procedure,
applied to a and

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:51.925
the result of adding up, terms,
with the next a being

00:19:51.925 --> 00:20:06.970
the a, the next procedure passed
along, and the upper

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.220
bound being passed along.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.760
Blink, blink, blink--

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.350
Now, when I use this sum
procedure, I can use it, for

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.450
example, like this.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:38.680
We can define the sum of the
powers to be, for example, sum

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.240
of a bunch of powers x to the
n, to be that procedure

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.970
of a, b, and n--

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.150
lower bound, the upper
bound, and n--

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:54.530
which is sum, of lambda of x,
the procedure of one argument

00:20:54.530 --> 00:21:05.720
x, which exponentiates x to
the n, with the a, the

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.440
incrementer, and b, being
passed along.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.340
So we're adding up x
to n, given an x.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.740
x takes on values from a to
b, incrementing by one.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.300
I can also write the--

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.780
That's right.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.910
Product, excuse me.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.220
The product of a bunch
of powers.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.020
It's a strange name.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.960
I'm going to leave it there.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.210
Weird--

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.890
I write up what I have.
I'm sure that's right.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.720
And if I want the product
of a bunch of powers--

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:03.400
That was 12 brain cells,
that double-take.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.890
I can for example use the
procedure which is like sum,

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.080
which is for making products,
but it's similar to that, that

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.450
you've seen before.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:16.725
There's a procedure of three
arguments again.

00:22:16.725 --> 00:22:24.080
Which is the product of terms
that are constructed, or

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.480
factors in this case,
constructed from

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:35.970
exponentiating x to the n,
where I start with a, I

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.850
increment, and I go to b.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:48.690
Now, there's some sort of thing
here that should disturb

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.750
you immediately.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.180
These look the same.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.590
Why am I writing this
code so many times?

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.270
Here I am, in the same boat
I've been in before.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.810
Wouldn't it be nice to make
an abstraction here?

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.980
What's an example of a good
abstraction to make?

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.470
Well, I see some codes
that's identical.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.080
Here's one, and here's
another.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.090
And so maybe I should be
able to pull that out.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:21.580
I should be able to say, oh
yes, the sum of the powers

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.350
could be written in terms
of something called

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.710
the nth power procedure.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.690
Imagine somebody wanted to write
a slightly different

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.030
procedure that looks
like this.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:49.300
The sum powers to be a procedure
of a, b, and n, as

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.556
the result of summing
up the nth power.

00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:59.720
We're going to give a name to
that idea, for starting at a,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.170
going by one, and ending at b.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.480
And similarly, I might want to
write the product powers this

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.270
way, abstracting
out this idea.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:17.520
I might want this.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:35.350
Product powers, to be a
procedure of a, b, and n,

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:47.540
which is the product of the nth
power operation on a with

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:56.380
the incrementation and b being
my arguments for the

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.380
analogous-thing product.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.840
And I'd like to be able to
define, I'd like to be able to

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.680
define nth power--

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.930
I'll put it over here.

00:25:11.215 --> 00:25:12.990
I'll put it at the top.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:30.630
--to be, in fact, my procedure
of one argument x which is the

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.390
result of exponentiating
x to the n.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.640
But I have a problem.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.160
My environment model, that is my
means of interpretation for

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.010
the language that we've defined
so far, does not give

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.810
me a meaning for this n.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:26:06.410
Because, as you know, this n
is free in this procedure.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.600
The environment model tells us
that the meaning of a free

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.760
variable is determined in the
environment in which this

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.640
procedure is defined.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.120
In a way I have written it,
assuming these things are

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.830
defined on the blackboard as
is, this is defined in the

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:25.850
global environment, where
there is no end.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.720
Therefore, n is unbound
variable.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.390
But it's perfectly clear, to
most of us, that we would like

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.220
it to be this n and this n.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.840
On the other hand,
it would be nice.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.290
Certainly we've got to be
careful here of keeping this

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:51.005
to be this, and this one
over here, wherever it

00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:52.900
is to be this one.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:01.360
Well, the desire to make
this work has led to

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.040
a very famous bug.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.310
I'll tell you about
the famous bug.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.660
Look at this slide.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.990
This is an idea called
dynamic binding.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.980
Where, instead of the free
variable being interpreted in

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.820
the environment of definition
of a procedure, the free

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.770
variable is interpreted as
having its value in the

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.125
environment of the caller
of the procedure.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.680
So what you have is a system
where you search up the chain

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.990
of callers of a particular
procedure, and, of course, in

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.240
this case, since nth power is
called from inside product

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.010
whatever it is--

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.140
I had to write our own sum
which is the analogous

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.530
procedure--

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:55.300
and product is presumably called
from product powers, as

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.490
you see over here, then since
product powers bind with

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.220
variable n , then nth powers
n would be derived

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.470
through that chain.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.600
Similarly, this n, the nth power
in n in this case, would

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.800
come through nth power here
being called from inside sum.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.730
You can see it being called
from inside sum here.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.900
It's called term here.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.930
But sum was called from inside
of sum powers, which bound n.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:35.245
Therefore, there would be an n
available for that n to get

00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:36.495
it's value from.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.630
What we have below this white
line plus over here, is what's

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.540
called a dynamic binding
view of the world.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.850
If that works, that's a
dynamic binding view.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.310
Now, let's take a look, for
example, at just what it takes

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.990
to implement that.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.480
That's real easy.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.400
In fact, the very first Lisps
that had any interpretations

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.440
of the free variables at all,
had dynamic binding

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.490
interpretations for the
free variables.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.570
APL has dynamic binding
interpretation for the free

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:15.220
variables, not lexical
or static binding.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.790
So, of course, the change
is in eval.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.780
And it's really in two places.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.760
First of all, one thing we see,
is that things become a

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.010
little simpler.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.930
If I don't have to have the
environment be the environment

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.490
of definition for procedure, the
procedure need not capture

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.030
the environment at the
time it's defined.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:47.900
And so if we look here at this
slide, we see that the clause

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.890
for a lambda expression, which
is the way a procedure is

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:57.820
defined, does not make up a
thing which has a type closure

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.290
and a attached environment
structure.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:02.540
It's just the expression
itself.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:06.440
And we'll decompose that some
other way somewhere else.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:12.210
The other thing we see is the
applicator must be able to get

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.290
the environment of the caller.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:19.560
The caller of a procedure
is right here.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.810
If the expression we're
evaluating is anpplication or

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.680
a combination, then we're going
to call a procedure

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.980
which is the value
of the operator.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.100
The environment of the caller
is the environment we have

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.890
right here, available now.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.570
So all I have to do is pass
that environment to the

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.490
applicator, to apply.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:44.680
And if we look at that here,
the only change we have to

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.720
make is that fellow takes that
environment and uses that

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:57.240
environment for the purpose of
extending that environment

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.100
when abiding the formal
parameters of the procedure to

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.560
the arguments that were passed,
not an environment

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.810
that was captured in
the procedure.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.780
The reason why the first Lisps
were implemented this way, is

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.130
the sort of the obvious,
accidental implementation.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.990
And, of course, as usual,
people got used to

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.250
it and liked it.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.730
And there were some people
said, this is

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.590
the way to do it.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.870
Unfortunately that causes some
serious problems. The most

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:31.240
important, serious problem in
using dynamic binding is

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.460
there's a modularity crisis
that's involved it.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.370
If two people are working
together on some big system,

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.580
then an important thing to want
is that the names used by

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.580
each one don't interfere with
the names of the other.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.060
It's important that when I
invent some segment of code

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.985
that no one can make my code
stop working by using my names

00:31:54.985 --> 00:31:59.850
that I use internal to my code,
internal to his code.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.140
However, dynamic binding
violates that particular

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.670
modularity constraint
in a clear way.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:12.540
Consider, for example, what
happens over here.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.590
Suppose it was the case
that I decided to

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:19.810
change the word next.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:25.870
Supposing somebody is writing
sum, and somebody else is

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.970
going to use sum.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:33.790
The writer of sum has a choice
of what names he may use.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.760
Let's say, I'm that writer.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.300
Well, by gosh, just happens I
didn't want to call this next.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.500
I called it n.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:48.140
So all places where you see
next, I called it n.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.940
Whoops.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.700
I changed nothing about the
specifications of this

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:56.110
program, but this program
stops working.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.730
Not only that, unfortunately,
this one does too.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.260
Why do these programs
stop working?

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.480
Well, it's sort of clear.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.890
Instead of chasing out the value
of the n that occurs in

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:16.450
nth power over here or over
here, through the environment

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.940
of definition, where this one is
always linked to this one,

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.660
if it was through the
environment of definition,

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:24.370
because here is the
definition.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.320
This lambda expression was
executed in the environment

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.700
where that n was defined.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.150
If instead of doing that, I have
to chase through the call

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:37.320
chain, then look what horrible
thing happens.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:44.780
Well, this was called from
inside sum as term, term a.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.350
I'm looking for a value of n.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.700
Instead of getting this
one, I get that one.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.430
So by changing the insides of
this program, this program

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.680
stops working.

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.770
So I no longer have
a quantifier,

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.020
as I described before.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.430
The lambda symbol is supposed
to be a quantifier.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:09.650
A thing which has the property
that the names that are bound

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.739
by it are unimportant, that I
can uniformly substitute any

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.230
names for these throughout this
thing, so long as they

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.699
don't occur in here, the new
names, and the meaning of this

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:24.040
expression should remain
unchanged.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.050
I've just changed the meaning of
the expression by changing

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.690
the one of the names.

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:32.170
So lambda is no longer
a well defined idea.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.550
It's a very serious problem.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:40.850
So for that reason, I and my
buddies have given up this

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.650
particular kind of abstraction,
which I would

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:48.090
like to have, in favor of
a modularity principle.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.310
But this is the kind of
experiment you can do if you

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.530
want to play with these
interpreters.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:58.270
You can try them out this way,
that way, and the other way.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.070
You see what makes
a nicer language.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.990
So that's a very important
thing to be able to do.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.260
Now, I would like to give you
a feeling for I think the

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.880
right thing to do is here.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.190
How are you going to I get
this kind of power in a

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.280
lexical system?

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.610
And the answer is, of course,
what I really want is a

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.790
something that makes up for
me an exponentiator for a

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.690
particular n.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.280
Given an n, it will make
me an exponentiator.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.170
Oh, but that's easy too.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.570
In other words, I can write
my program this way.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:40.720
I'm going to define a thing
called PGEN, which is a

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.240
procedure of n which produces
for me an exponentiator.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.490
--x to the n.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:00.310
Given that I have that, then I
can capture the abstraction I

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.090
wanted even better, because now
it's encapsulated in a way

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.890
where I can't be destroyed
by a change of names.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:20.200
I can define some powers to be a
procedure again of a, b, and

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:28.070
n which is the sum of the term
function generated by using

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:37.590
this generator, PGEN, n, with
a, incrementer, and b.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:57.100
And I can define the product of
powers to be a procedure of

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:09.010
a, b, and n which is the product
PGEN, n, with a,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.150
increment, and b.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.340
Now, of course, this is a very
simple example where this

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.280
object that I'm trying to
abstract over is small.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.100
But it could be a 100
lines of code.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.350
And so, the purpose
of this is, of

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.670
course, to make it simple.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.630
I'd give a name to it, it's
just that here it's a

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.200
parameterized name.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.460
It's a name that depends upon,
explicitly, the lexically

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.050
apparent value of n.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.210
So you can think of this
as a long name.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:45.150
And here, I've solved my problem
by naming the term

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:49.220
generation procedures
within an n in them.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.140
Are there any questions?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.380
Oh, yes, David.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:04.820
AUDIENCE: Is the only solution
to the problem you raise to

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.470
create another procedure?

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.020
In other words, can this only
work in languages that are

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.402
capable of defining objects
as procedures?

00:38:12.402 --> 00:38:13.765
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.530
My solution to making this
abstraction, when I didn't

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.950
want include the procedure
inside the body, depends upon

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.190
my ability to return a procedure
or export one.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.410
And that's right.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.550
If I don't have that, then I
just don't have this ability

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:39.490
to make an abstraction in
a way where I don't have

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.930
possibilities of symbol
conflicts that were

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.000
unanticipated.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.610
That's right.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:52.690
I consider being able to return
the procedural value

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.780
and, therefore, to sort of have
first class procedures,

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.840
in general, as being essential
to doing very good modular

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.700
programming.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.440
Now, indeed there are many other
ways to skin this cat.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.500
What you can do is take for each
of the bad things that

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.420
you have to worry about, you
can make a special feature

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.840
that covers that thing.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.930
You can make a package system.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.240
You can make a module system
as in Ada, et cetera.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.440
And all of those work, or they
cover little regions of it.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.820
The thing is that returning
procedures as values cover all

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:35.820
of those problems. And so it's
the simplest mechanism that

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:40.110
gives you the best modularity,
gives you all of the known

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:45.590
modularity mechanisms.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.248
Well, I suppose it's time for
the next break, thank you.

00:39:48.248 --> 00:40:41.871
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:41.871 --> 00:40:43.690
PROFESSOR: Well, yesterday
when you learned about

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:52.110
streams, Hal worried to you
about the order of evaluation

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.420
and delayed arguments
to procedures.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.620
The way we played with streams
yesterday, it was the

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:07.170
responsibility of the caller and
the callee to both agree

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:12.180
that an argument was delayed,
and the callee must force the

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.250
argument if it needs
the answer.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.400
So there had to be a lot of
hand shaking between the

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:26.100
designer of a procedure and user
of it over delayedness.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.670
That turns out, of course, to
be a fairly bad thing, it

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:33.120
works all right with streams.
But as a general thing, what

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.520
you want is an idea to have a
locus, a decision, a design

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.580
decision in general, to have
a place where it's made,

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.900
explicitly, and notated
in a clear way.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.780
And so it's not a very good
idea to have to have an

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.670
agreement, between the person
who writes a procedure and the

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:56.730
person who calls it, about such
details as, maybe, the

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.500
arguments of evaluation, the
order of evaluation.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.750
Although, that's not so bad.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.920
I mean, we have other such
agreements like,

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.540
the input's a number.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.650
But it would be nice if only one
of these guys could take

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:11.020
responsibility, completely.

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.510
Now this is not a new idea.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:22.020
ALGOL 60 had two different ways
of calling a procedure.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.590
The arguments could be passed
by name or by value.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:31.110
And what that meant was that a
name argument was delayed.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.020
That when you passed an argument
by name, that its

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:39.620
value would only be obtained if
you accessed that argument.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.870
So what I'd like to do now is
show you, first of all, a

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.040
little bit about, again, we're
going to make a modification

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.320
to a language.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.370
In this case, we're going
to add a feature.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.900
We're going to add the feature
of, by name parameters, if you

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.430
will, or delayed parameters.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:05.580
Because, in fact, the default
in our Lisp system is by the

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.220
value of a pointer.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.530
A pointer is copied, but
the data structure it

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:13.410
points at is not.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:17.580
But I'd like to, in fact, show
you is how you add name

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.990
arguments as well.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.100
Now again, why would we
need such a thing?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.930
Well supposing we wanted to
invent certain kinds of what

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:29.720
otherwise would be special
forms, reserve words?

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.180
But I'd rather not take
up reserve words.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:36.360
I want procedures that can
do things like if.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.420
If is special, or cond,
or whatever it is.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:40.600
It's the same thing.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.080
It's special in that it
determines whether or not to

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.360
evaluate the consequent or the
alternative based on the value

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.840
of the predicate part
of an expression.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.230
So taking the value of one thing
determines whether or

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:57.270
not to do something else.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.240
Whereas all the procedures like
plus, the ones that we

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.900
can define right now, evaluate
all of their arguments before

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.670
application.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.750
So, for example, supposing I
wish to be able to define

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:19.452
something like the reverse
of if in terms of if.

00:44:19.452 --> 00:44:20.702
Call it unless.

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.760
We've a predicate, a
consequent, and an

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.190
alternative.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.995
Now what I would like to sort of
be able to do is say-- oh,

00:44:30.995 --> 00:44:32.440
I'll do it in terms of cond.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:41.660
Cond, if not the predicate,
then take the consequent,

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:45.350
otherwise, take the
alternative.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:54.320
Now, what I'd like this to
mean, is supposing I do

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.920
something like this.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:05.860
I'd like this unless say if
equals one, 0, then the answer

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:11.350
is two, otherwise, the quotient
of one and 0.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:20.170
What I'd like that to mean is
the result of substituting

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.450
equal one, 0, and two, and
the quotient of one, 0

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.580
for p, c, and a.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.750
I'd like that to mean, and this
is funny, I'd like it to

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:40.940
transform into or mean cond
not equal one, 0, then the

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:48.910
result is two, otherwise
I want it to be the

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:51.160
quotient one and 0.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.210
Now, you know that if I
were to type this into

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.970
Lisp, I'd get a two.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.910
There's no problem with that.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.940
However, if I were to type this
into Lisp, because all

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.590
the arguments are evaluated
before I start, then I'm going

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:10.840
to get an error out of this.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.130
So that if the substitutions
work at all, of course, I

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.880
would get the right answer.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.160
But here's a case where the
substitutions don't work.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.860
I don't get the wrong answer.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.670
I get no answer.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:25.920
I get an error.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.860
Now, however, I'd like to be
able to make my definition so

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.270
that this kind of thing works.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:36.010
What I want to do
is say something

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:39.930
special about c and a.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.715
I want them to be delayed
automatically.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.520
I don't want them to be
evaluated at the time I call.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.980
So I'm going to make a
declaration, and then I'm

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.600
going to see how to implement
such a declaration.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.870
But again, I want you to say
to yourself, oh, this is an

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.140
interesting kluge he's
adding in here.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.750
The piles of kluges make
a big complicated mess.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.240
And is this going to
foul up something

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.120
else that might occur.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.860
First of all, is it
syntactically unambiguous?

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.120
Well, it will be syntactically
unambiguous with what we've

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.840
seen so far.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.670
But what I'm going to do may,
in fact, cause trouble.

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.450
It may be that the thing I had
will conflict with type

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.700
declarations I might want to add
in the future for giving

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.730
some system, some compiler or
something, the ability to

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.300
optimize given the
types are known.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.130
Or it might conflict with other
types of declarations I

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:40.570
might want to make about
the formal parameters.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.520
So I'm not making a general
mechanism here where I can add

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:44.925
declarations.

00:47:44.925 --> 00:47:46.750
And I would like to be
able to do that.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.010
But I don't want to talk
about that right now.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.680
So here I'm going to do, I'm
going to build a kluge.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:08.770
So we're going to define
unless of a predicate--

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.180
and I'm going to call
these by name--

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.930
the consequent, and name
the alternative.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:22.670
Huh, huh--

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.280
I got caught in the corner.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.165
If not p then the result
is c, else--

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:41.360
that's what I'd like.

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:49.500
Where I can explicitly declare
certain of the parameters to

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.650
be delayed, to be
computed later.

00:48:55.008 --> 00:48:57.910
Now, this is actually a very
complicated modification to an

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:00.450
interpreter rather than
a simple one.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:05.270
The ones you saw before, dynamic
binding or adding

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.630
indefinite argument procedures,

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:09.280
is relatively simple.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.120
But this one changes
a basic strategy.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.070
The problem here is that our
interpreter, as written,

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:24.420
evaluates a combination by
evaluating the procedure, the

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.910
operator producing the
procedure, and evaluating the

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:31.410
operands producing the
arguments, and then doing

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:36.110
apply of the procedure
to the arguments.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:40.540
However, here, I don't want to
evaluate the operands to

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.640
produce the arguments until
after I examined the procedure

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.810
to see what the procedure's
declarations look like.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.680
So let's look at that.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.480
Here we have a changed
evaluator.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.110
I'm starting with the simple
lexical evaluator, not

00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:06.730
dynamic, but we're going to have
to do something sort of

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.750
similar in some ways.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:13.710
Because of the fact that,
if I delay a procedure--

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.790
I'm sorry-- delay an argument
to a procedure, I'm going to

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.360
have to attach and environment
to it.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.380
Remember how Hal implemented
delay.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.650
Hal implemented delay as being
a procedure of no arguments

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:31.180
which does some expression.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.670
That's what delay of
the expression is.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:36.620
--of that expression.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.950
This turned into something
like this.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.760
Now, however, if I evaluate a
lambda expression, I have to

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.010
capture the environment.

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:56.920
The reason why is because there
are variables in there

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.280
who's meaning I wish to derive
from the context where this

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.530
was written.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:06.095
So that's why a lambda
does the job.

00:51:06.095 --> 00:51:08.070
It's the right thing.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:17.070
And such that the forcing of a
delayed expression was same

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:21.090
thing as calling that
with no arguments.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.100
It's just the opposite
of this.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.120
Producing an environment of the
call which is, in fact,

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.713
the environment where this was
defined with an extra frame in

00:51:31.713 --> 00:51:33.132
it that's empty.

00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:36.240
I don't care about that.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:42.460
Well, if we go back to this
slide, since it's the case, if

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.290
we look at this for a second,
everything is the same as it

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:51.980
was before except the case of
applications or combinations.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.680
And combinations are going
to do two things.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.010
One, is I have to evaluate
the procedure--

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.425
forget the procedure-- by
evaluating the operator.

00:52:00.425 --> 00:52:02.380
That's what you see
right here.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.990
I have to make sure that that's
current, that is not a

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.530
delayed object, and evaluate
that to the point where it's

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.730
forced now.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:18.460
And then I have to somehow apply
that to the operands.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.040
But I have to keep the
environment, pass that

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.530
environmental along.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.710
So some of those operands
I may have to delay.

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:29.302
I may have to attach that
environment to those operands.

00:52:29.302 --> 00:52:32.990
This is a rather complicated
thing happening here.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.240
Looking at that in apply.

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.370
Apply, well it has a
primitive procedure

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:42.610
thing just like before.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.390
But the compound one is a
little more interesting.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.920
I have to evaluate the body,
just as before, in an

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.010
environment which is the result
of binding some formal

00:52:56.010 --> 00:53:00.290
parameters to arguments
in the environment.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:01.530
That's true.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:03.070
The environment is the
one that comes from

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:03.820
the procedure now.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:08.040
It's a lexical language,
statically bound.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.230
However, one thing I have
to do is strip off the

00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:12.960
declarations to get the names
of the variables.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.450
That's what this guy
does, vnames.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.940
And the other thing I have
to do is process these

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:21.770
declarations, deciding which
of these operands--

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.150
that's the operands now, as
opposed to the arguments--

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.010
which of these operands to
evaluate, and which of them

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:33.770
are to be encapsulated in
delays of some sort.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.720
The other thing you see here is
that we got a primitive, a

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.170
primitive like plus, had better

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.820
get at the real operands.

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.690
So here is a place where we're
going to have to force them.

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:49.306
And we're going to look at what
evlist is going to have

00:53:49.306 --> 00:53:51.340
to do a bunch of forces.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.780
So we have two different
kinds of evlist now.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.980
We have evlist and gevlist.
Gevlist is going to wrap

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.870
delays around some things and
force others, evaluate others.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:07.900
And this guy's going to do
some forcing of things.

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.770
Just looking at this a little
bit, this is a game you must

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.250
play for yourself, you know.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:14.870
It's not something that you're
going to see all possible

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:19.730
variations on an evaluator
talking to me.

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.410
What you have to do is
do this for yourself.

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:24.610
And after you feel this, you
play this a bit, you get to

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.580
see all the possible design
decisions and what they might

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.930
mean, and how they interact
with each other.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:33.160
So what languages might
have in them.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.340
And what are some of the
consistent sets that make a

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.200
legitimate language.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.135
Whereas what things are
complicated kluges that are

00:54:39.135 --> 00:54:41.850
just piles of junk.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:45.050
So evlist of course, over here,
just as I said, is a

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:49.450
list of operands which are going
to be undelayed after

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.750
evaluation.

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.600
So these are going to
be forced, whatever

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.050
that's going to mean.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.490
And gevlist, which is
the next thing--

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.040
Thank you.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:09.810
What we see here, well there's
a couple of possibilities.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:13.750
Either it's a normal, ordinary
thing, a symbol sitting there

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:18.020
like the predicate in the
unless, and that's

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.390
what we have here.

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:21.710
In which case, this is intended
to be evaluated in

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.340
applicative order.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.630
And it's, essentially, just
what we had before.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:30.400
It's mapping eval down the
list. In other words, I

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.690
evaluate the first expression
and continue gevlisting the

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.900
CDR of the expression
in the environment.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:43.600
However, it's possible that
this is a name parameter.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.320
If it's a name parameter, I want
to put a delay in which

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:53.480
combines that expression, which
I'm calling by name,

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:59.250
with the environment that's
available at this time and

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.790
passing that as the parameter.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.350
And this is part of the
mapping process

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:05.600
that you see here.

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:12.040
The only other interesting
place in this

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.700
interpreter is cond.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.440
People tend to write this thing,
and then they leave

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.550
this one out.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:20.510
There's a place where
you have to force.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:25.260
Conditionals have to know
whether or not the answer is

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:25.990
true or false.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.550
It's like a primitive.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.890
When you do a conditional,
you have to force.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:32.880
Now, I'm not going to
look at any more

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.350
of this in any detail.

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:36.750
It isn't very exciting.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:38.990
And what's left is how
you make delays.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:42.680
Well, delays are data structures
which contain an

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.840
expression, an environment,
and a type on them.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.680
And it says they're a thunk.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:50.100
That comes from ALGOL language,
and it's claimed to

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:52.970
be the sound of something
being pushed on a stack.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:53.410
I don't know.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:57.830
I was not an ALGOLician or an
ALGOLite or whatever, so I

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:58.740
don't know.

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:00.270
But that's what was claimed.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:03.400
And undelay is something which
will recursively undelay

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.860
thunks until the thunk becomes
something which isn't a thunk.

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.930
This is the way you implement
a call by name

00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.050
like thing in ALGOL.

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:15.210
And that's about all there is.

00:57:15.210 --> 00:57:16.460
Are there any questions?

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.560
AUDIENCE: Gerry?

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.626
PROFESSOR: Yes, Vesko?

00:57:29.626 --> 00:57:33.900
AUDIENCE: I noticed you avoided
calling by name in the

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:38.480
primitive procedures,
I was wondering what

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.350
cause you have on that?

00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.070
You never need that?

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:44.720
PROFESSOR: Vesko is asking if
it's ever reasonable to call a

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:47.140
primitive procedure by name?

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.270
The answer is, yes.

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:51.680
There's one particular case
where it's reasonable,

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.930
actually two.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.250
Construction of a data structure
like cons where

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.100
making an array if you
have arrays with

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.690
any number of elements.

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.440
It's unnecessary to evaluate
those arguments.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.180
All you need is promises to
evaluate those arguments if

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:11.160
you look at them.

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:17.310
If I cons together two things,
then I could cons together the

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:21.830
promises just as easily as I can
cons together the things.

00:58:21.830 --> 00:58:23.720
And it's not even when
I CAR CDR them that I

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.840
have to look at them.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.150
That just gets out
the promises and

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.260
passes them to somebody.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.320
That's why the lambda calculus
definition, the Alonzo Church

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.420
definition of CAR, CDR,
and cons makes sense.

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:36.630
It's because no work is done
in CAR, CDR, and cons, it's

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:40.760
just shuffling data, it's just
routing, if you will.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:42.960
However, the things that do
have to look at data are

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.280
things like plus.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.910
Because they have a look at the
bits that the numbers are

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:50.220
made out of, unless they're
lambda calculus

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.460
numbers which are funny.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.630
They have to look at the bits
to be able to crunch them

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:55.880
together to do the add.

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:03.280
So, in fact, data constructors,
data selectors,

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.500
and, in fact, things that
side-effect data objects don't

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:13.300
need to do any forcing in the
laziest possible interpreters.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.700
On the other hand predicates
on data structures have to.

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:23.560
Is this a pair?

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:24.640
Or is it a symbol?

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.690
Well, you better find out.

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:26.940
You got to look at it then.

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.550
Any other questions?

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:41.610
Oh, well, I suppose it's
time for a break.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.106
Thank you.

00:59:42.106 --> 01:00:02.950
