00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:19.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.720
PROFESSOR: Well, Hal just told
us how you build robust

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.960
systems. The key idea was--

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm sure that many of you don't
really assimilate that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.980
yet-- but the key idea is that
in order to make a system

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.850
that's robust, it has to be
insensitive to small changes,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.680
that is, a small change in the
problem should lead to only a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.340
small change in the solution.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.670
There ought to be
a continuity.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.275
The space of solutions ought to
be continuous in this space

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.120
of problems.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.270
The way he was explaining how
to do that was instead of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.240
solving a particular problem
at every level of

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.520
decomposition of the problem at
the subproblems, where you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.570
solve the class of problems,
which are a neighborhood of

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.440
the particular problem that
you're trying to solve.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.980
The way you do that is by
producing a language at that

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.500
level of detail in which the
solutions to that class of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.170
problems is representable
in that language.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.370
Therefore when you makes more
changes to the problem you're

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.140
trying to solve, you generally
have to make only small local

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.640
changes to the solution you've
constructed, because at the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.190
level of detail you're working,
there's a language

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.940
where you can express the
various solutions to alternate

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.170
problems of the same type.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.090
Well that's the beginning of a
very important idea, the most

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.950
important perhaps idea that
makes computer science more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.320
powerful than most of the other
kinds of engineering

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500
disciplines we know about.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.350
What we've seen so far
is sort of how to use

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.500
embedding of languages.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.570
And, of course, the power of
embedding languages partly

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.480
comes from procedures
like this one that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.500
I showed you yesterday.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.210
What you see here is the
derivative program that we

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.280
described yesterday.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.270
It's a procedure that takes a
procedure as an argument and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.880
returns a procedure
as a value.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.680
And using such things
is very nice.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.480
You can make things like push
combinators and all that sort

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020
of wonderful thing that
you saw last time.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.730
However, now I'm going to
really muddy the waters.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.430
See this confuses the issue of
what's the procedure and what

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.310
is data, but not very badly.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.260
What we really want to do is
confuse it very badly.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.400
And the best way to do that is
to get involved with the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.980
manipulation of the algebraic
expressions that the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.750
procedures themselves
are expressed in.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.660
So at this point, I want to talk
about instead of things

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.300
like on this slide, the
derivative procedure being a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.880
thing that manipulates
a procedure--

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.870
this is a numerical method
you see here.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.440
And what you're seeing is
a representation of the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.275
numerical approximation
to the derivative.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:00.980
That's what's here.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.180
In fact what I'd like to talk
about is instead things that

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.170
look like this.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.080
And what we have here are rules
from a calculus book.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.010
These are rules for finding
the derivatives of the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.190
expressions that one
might write in

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.520
some algebraic language.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.990
It says things like a derivative
of a constant is 0.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.700
The derivative of the valuable
with respect to which you are

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.250
taking the derivative is 1.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.490
The derivative of a constant
times the function is the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.980
constant times the derivative
of the function,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.300
and things like that.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.690
These are exact expressions.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.090
These are not numerical
approximations.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.560
Can we make programs?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.000
And, in fact, it's very easy
to make programs that

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.250
manipulate these expressions.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.480
Well let's see.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.350
Let's look at these rules
in some detail.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.850
You all have seen these rules
in your elementary calculus

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.140
class at one time or another.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.570
And you know from calculus
that it's easy to produce

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.840
derivatives of arbitrary
expressions.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.900
You also know from your
elementary calculus that it's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.140
hard to produce integrals.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.690
Yet integrals and derivatives
are opposites of each other.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.800
They're inverse operations.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.360
And they have the same rules.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.110
What is special about these
rules that makes it possible

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.310
for one to produce derivatives
easily and

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.100
integrals why it's so hard?

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.510
Let's think about that
very simply.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.390
Look at these rules.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.190
Every one of these rules, when
used in the direction for

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.260
taking derivatives, which is
in the direction of this

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.830
arrow, the left side is
matched against your

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.710
expression, and the right side
is the thing which is the

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.810
derivative of that expression.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.570
The arrow is going that way.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.830
In each of these rules, the
expressions on the right-hand

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.600
side of the rule that are
contained within derivatives

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.630
are subexpressions, are proper
subexpressions, of the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.670
expression on the
left-hand side.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.510
So here we see the derivative
of the sum, with is the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.260
expression on the left-hand
side is the sum of the

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.030
derivatives of the pieces.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.070
So the rule of moving to the
right are reduction rules.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.110
The problem becomes easier.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.810
I turn a big complicated problem
it's lots of smaller

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.000
problems and then combine the
results, a perfect place for

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.730
recursion to work.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.310
If I'm going in the other
direction like this, if I'm

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.160
trying to produce integrals,
well there are several

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.340
problems you see here.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.460
First of all, if I try to
integrate an expression like a

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.930
sum, more than one
rule matches.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.610
Here's one that matches.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.850
Here's one that matches.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.210
I don't know which
one to take.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.870
And they may be different.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.250
I may get to explore
different things.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.660
Also, the expressions become
larger in that direction.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.910
And when the expressions become
larger, then there's no

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.940
guarantee that any particular
path I choose will terminate,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.380
because we will only terminate
by accidental cancellation.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.840
So that's why integrals
are complicated

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.170
searches and hard to do.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.640
Right now I don't want to do
anything as hard as that.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.260
Let's work on derivatives
for a while.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.860
Well, these roles are
ones you know for

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.860
the most part hopefully.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.410
So let's see if we can write a
program which is these rules.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.790
And that should be very easy.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.830
Just write the program.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.010
See, because while I showed you
is that it's a reduction

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.180
rule, it's something appropriate
for a recursion.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.230
And, of course, what we have for
each of these rules is we

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.375
have a case in some
case analysis.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.350
So I'm just going to write
this program down.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.780
Now, of course, I'm going to be
saying something you have

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.450
to believe.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.890
Right?

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.870
What you have to believe is I
can represent these algebraic

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.210
expressions, that I can grab
their parts, that I can put

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.330
them together.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.620
We've invented list structures
so that you can do that.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.810
But you don't want to worry
about that now.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.680
Right now I'm going to write the
program that encapsulates

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.920
these rules independent of
the representation of the

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.170
algebraic expressions.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.610
You have a derivative of
an expression with

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.280
respect to a variable.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.020
This is a different
thing than the

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.040
derivative of the function.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.130
That's what we saw last time,
that numerical approximation.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.860
It's something you can't
open up a function.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.990
It's just the answers.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.450
The derivative of
an expression is

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.990
the way it's written.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.410
And therefore it's a syntactic
phenomenon.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.540
And so a lot of what we're going
to be doing today is

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.400
worrying about syntax,
syntax of expressions

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.830
and things like that.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.700
Well, there's a case analysis.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.420
Anytime we do anything
complicated thereby a

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.690
recursion, we presumably
need a case analysis.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.340
It's the essential
way to begin.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.590
And that's usually
a conditional

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.170
of some large kind.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.000
Well, what are their
possibilities?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.290
the first rule that you saw is
this something a constant?

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.510
And what I'm asking is, is the
expression a constant with

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.920
respect to the variable given?

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.460
If so, the result is 0,
because the derivative

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.880
represents the rate of
change of something.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.169
If, however, the expression that
I'm taking the derivative

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:42.770
of is the variable I'm varying,
then this is the same

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:52.560
variable, the expression var,
then the rate of change of the

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.560
expression with respect
to the variable is 1.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.810
It's the same 1.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.490
Well now there are a couple
of other possibilities.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.010
It could, for example,
be a sum.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.140
Well, I don't know how I'm going
to express sums yet.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.180
Actually I do.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.370
But I haven't told you yet.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.630
But is it a sum?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.520
I'm imagining that there's
some way of telling.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.860
I'm doing a dispatch on the type
of the expression here,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.960
absolutely essential in
building languages.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.520
Languages are made out of
different expressions.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.930
And soon we're going to see
that in our more powerful

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.760
methods of building languages
on languages.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.530
Is an expression a sum?

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.360
If it's a sum, well, we know the
rule for derivative of the

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.160
sum is the sum of the
derivatives of the parts.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.370
One of them is called
the addend and the

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.050
other is the augend.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.710
But I don't have enough space
on the blackboard

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.810
to such long names.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.660
So I'll call them A1 and A2.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.250
I want to make a sum.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.300
Do you remember which is the sum
for end or the menu end?

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.310
Or was it the dividend
and the divisor or

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.700
something like that?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:08.720
Make sum of the derivative
of the A1, I'll call it.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.640
It's the addend of the
expression with respect to the

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:23.506
variable, and the derivative of
the A2 of the expression,

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:27.020
because the two arguments,
the addition with

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.270
respect to the variable.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.350
And another rule that we know is
product rule, which is, if

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.600
the expression is a product.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.070
By the way, it's a good idea
when you're defining things,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.440
when you're defining predicates,
to give them a

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.290
name that ends in
a question mark.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.140
This question mark doesn't
mean anything.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.730
It's for us as an agreement.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.710
It's a conventional interface
between humans so you can read

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.980
my programs more easily.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.510
So I want you to, when you write
programs, if you define

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.330
a predicate procedure, that's
something that rings true of

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.720
false, it should have a name
which ends in question mark.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.740
The list doesn't care.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.740
I care.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.400
I want to make a sum.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.280
Because the derivative of a
product is the sum of the

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.920
first times the derivative of
the second plus the second

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.620
times the derivative of the
first. Make a sum of two

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:37.710
things, a product of, well, I'm
going to say the M1 of the

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:47.560
expression, and the derivative
of the M2 of the expression

00:11:47.560 --> 00:12:01.680
with respect to the variable,
and the product of the

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:10.720
derivative of M1, the multiplier
of the expression,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.450
with respect to the variable.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.340
It's the product of that and the
multiplicand, M2, of the

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.590
expression.

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.630
Make that product.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.850
Make the sum.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.080
Close that case.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.590
And, of course, I could add as
many cases as I like here for

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.960
a complete set of rules you
might find in a calculus book.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:41.184
So this is what it takes to
encapsulate those rules.

00:12:41.184 --> 00:12:43.080
And you see, you have to realize
there's a lot of

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.690
wishful thinking here.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.620
I haven't told you anything
about how I'm going to make

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.570
these representations.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.830
Now, once I've decided that
this is my set of rules, I

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.820
think it's time to play with
the representation.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.030
Let's attack that/

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.120
Well, first of all, I'm
going to play a pun.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.870
It's an important pun.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.590
It's a key to a sort
of powerful idea.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.790
If I want to represent sums, and
products, and differences,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.450
and quotients, and things like
that, why not use the same

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.660
language as I'm writing
my program in?

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.130
I write my program in algebraic
expressions that

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:29.280
look like the sum of the product
on a and the product

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.330
of x and x, and things
like that.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.390
And the product of b and x and
c, whatever, make that a sum

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.960
of the product.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.230
Right now I don't want to have
procedures with unknown

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:48.300
numbers of arguments, a product
of b and x and c.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.280
This is list structure.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.950
And the reason why this is nice,
is because any one of

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.380
these objects has a property.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.970
I know where the car is.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.100
The car is the operator.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.190
And the operands are the
successive cdrs the successive

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.276
cars of the cdrs of the
list that this is.

00:14:12.276 --> 00:14:14.470
It makes it very convenient.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.560
I have to parse it.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.590
It's been done for me.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.685
I'm using the embedding
and Lisp to advantage.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:29.340
So, for example, let's start
using list structure to write

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:35.390
down the representation that I'm
implicitly assuming here.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.590
Well I have to define various
things that are implied in

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.640
this representation.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.210
Like I have to find out
how to do a constant,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.520
how you do same variable.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.890
Let's do those first. That's
pretty easy enough.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.410
Now I'm going to be introducing
lots of primitives

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.680
here, because these are
the primitives that

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.745
come with list structure.

00:14:51.745 --> 00:14:53.015
OK, you define a constant.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.350
And what I mean by a constant,
an expression that's constant

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.860
with respect to a veritable,
is that the expression is

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.530
something simple.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.550
I can't take it into
pieces, and yet

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.550
it isn't that variable.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.940
I can't break it up, and yet
it isn't that variable.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.840
That does not mean that there
may be other expressions that

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.230
are more complicated
that are constants.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.700
It's just that I'm going to
look at the primitive

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.510
constants in this way.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.080
So what this is, is it says
that's it's the and.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.030
I can combine predicate
expressions which return true

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:38.610
or false with and.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:45.600
Something atomic, The expression
is atomic, meaning

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.050
it cannot be broken
into parts.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.150
It doesn't have a car and a cdr.
It's not a list. It adds

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.250
a special test built
into the system.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:06.950
And it's not identically
equal to that variable.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.810
I'm representing my variable
by things that are symbols

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.550
which cannot be broken into
pieces, things like x, and y,

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.800
things like this.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.890
Whereas, of course, something
like this can be broken up

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.140
into pieces.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:40.560
And the same variable of an
expression with respect to a

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:48.840
variable is, in fact, an
atomic expression.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.040
I want to have an atomic

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:59.330
expression, which is identical.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:13.329
I don't want to look inside
this stuff anymore.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.040
These are primitive maybe.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.180
But it doesn't matter.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.569
I'm using things that are given
to me with a language.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.300
I'm not terribly interest
in them

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.900
Now how do we deal with sums?

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.100
Ah, something very interesting
will happen.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.380
A sum is something which is not
atomic and begins with the

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.230
plus symbol.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.680
That's what it means.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.125
So here, I will define.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:18:08.380
An question is a sum if and it's
not atomic and it's head,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:15.140
it's beginning, its car of the
expression is the symbol plus.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:21.730
Now you're about to see
something you haven't seen

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.690
before, this quotation.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.440
Why do I have that
quotation there?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.970
Say your name,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:31.410
AUDIENCE: Susanna.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.270
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.190
AUDIENCE: Susanna

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.250
PROFESSOR: Say your name.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.160
AUDIENCE: Your name.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.910
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:36.960
AUDIENCE: Your name.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.040
What I'm showing you here
is that the words

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.520
of English are ambiguous.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:52.220
I was saying, say your name.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.070
I was also possibly saying
say, your name.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.100
But that cannot be distinguished
in speech.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:09.600
However, we do have a notation
in writing, which is quotation

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.180
for distinguishing these
two possible meanings.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:19.490
In particular, over here, in
Lisp we have a notation for

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.510
distinguishing these meetings.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.992
If I were to just write a plus
here, a plus symbol, I would

00:19:24.992 --> 00:19:29.400
be asking, is the first element
of the expression, is

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.220
the operator position
of the expression,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.760
the addition operator?

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.330
I don't know.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.550
I would have to have written the
addition operator there,

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.330
which I can't write.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.470
However, this way I'm asking,
is this the symbolic object

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.790
plus, which normally stands
for the addition operator?

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.420
That's what I want.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.110
That's the question
I want to ask.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.430
Now before I go any further,
I want to point out the

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:59.780
quotation is a very complex
concept, and adding it to a

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.510
language causes a great
deal of troubles.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.370
Consider the next slide.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:11.830
Here's a deduction which we
should all agree with.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:17.530
We have, Alyssa is smart and
Alyssa is George's mother.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.350
This is an equality, is.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.470
From those two, we can deduce
that George's mother is smart.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.320
Because we can always substitute
equals for equals

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.250
in expressions.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.420
Or can we?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.400
Here's a case where we have
"Chicago" has seven letters.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.100
The quotation means that I'm
discussing the word Chicago,

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.365
not what the word represents.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.830
Here I have that Chicago is the
biggest city in Illinois.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.160
As a consequence of this, I
would like to deduce that the

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.250
biggest city in Illinois
has seven letters.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.785
But that's manifestly false.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.420
Wow, it works.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.420
OK, so once we have things like
that, our language gets

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.540
much more complicated.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.440
Because it's no longer true that
things we tend to like to

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.750
do with languages, like
substituting equals for equals

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.840
and getting right answers, are
going to work without being

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.550
very careful.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.470
We can't substitute into what's
called referentially

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.410
opaque contexts, of which a
quotation is the prototypical

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.380
type of referentially
opaque context.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.560
If you know what that means, you
can consult a philosopher.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.790
Presumably there is
one in the room.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.280
In any case, let's continue now,
now that we at least have

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.660
an operational understanding of
a 2000-year-old issue that

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.350
has to do with name, and
mention, and all sorts of

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.600
things like that.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:59.790
I have to define what I mean,
how to make a sum of two

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.250
things, an a1 and a2.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.590
And I'm going to do
this very simply.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:13.600
It's a list of the symbol
plus, and a1, and a2.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.075
And I can determine
the first element.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:34.510
Define a1 to be cadr. I've just

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.370
introduced another primitive.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.990
This is the car of the
cdr of something.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.950
You might want to know why car
and cdr are names of these

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.720
primitives, and why they've
survived, even though they're

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.970
much better ideas like
left and right.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.380
We could have called them
things like that.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.340
Well, first of all, the names
come from the fact that in the

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.470
great past, when Lisp was
invented, I suppose in '58 or

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.730
something, it was on a
704 or something like

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.870
that, which had a machine.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.440
It was a machine that had an
address register and a

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.340
decrement register.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.610
And these were the contents of
the address register and the

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.270
decrement register.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.880
So it's an historical
accident.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.880
Now why have these
names survived?

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.110
It's because Lisp programmers
like to talk to each other

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.900
over the phone.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.460
And if you want to have a long
sequence of cars and cdrs you

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.530
might say, cdaddedr, which
can be understood.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.330
But left of right or right of
left is not so clear if you

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.970
get good at it.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.570
So that's why we have
these words.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.566
All of them up to four deep
are defined typically in a

00:23:33.566 --> 00:23:34.816
Lisp system.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.540
A2 to be--

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.170
and, of course, you can see
that if I looked at one of

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:54.630
these expressions like the sum
of 3 and 5, what that is is a

00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:06.100
list containing the symbol
plus, and a number 3,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.470
and a number 5.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.100
Then the car is the
symbol plus.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.210
The car of the cdr. Well
I take the cdr and

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.070
then I take the car.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.200
And that's how I get to the 3.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.630
That's the first argument.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:24.370
And the car of the cdr
of the cdr gets me to

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:25.640
this one, the 5.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.970
And similarly, of course, I
can define what's going on

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.300
with products.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.550
Let's do that very quickly.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.130
Is the expression a product?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:25:01.910
Yes if and if it's true, that's
it's not atomic and

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:13.260
it's EQ quote, the asterisk
symbol, which is the operator

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.800
for multiplication.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:35.090
Make product of an M1 and an
M2 to be list, quote, the

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:40.930
asterisk operation
and M1 and M2.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:26:00.596
and I define M1 to be cadr and
M2 to be caddr. You get to be

00:26:00.596 --> 00:26:02.690
a good Lisp programmer because
you start talking that way.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.430
I cdr down lists and console
them up and so on.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.480
Now, now that we have
essentially a complete program

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.880
for finding derivatives,
you can add more

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.360
rules if you like.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.800
What kind of behavior
do we get out of it?

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.930
I'll have to clear that x.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:28.060
Well, supposing I define foo
here to be the sum of the

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.450
product of ax square
and bx plus c.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.020
That's the same thing we see
here as the algebraic

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.260
expression written in the
more conventional

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.860
notation over there.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.620
Well, the derivative of foo with
respect to x, which we

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:46.250
can see over here, is this
horrible, horrendous mess.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.760
I would like it to
be 2ax plus b.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.240
But it's not.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.620
It's equivalent to it.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.090
What is it?

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.510
I have here, what do I have?

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.550
I have the derivative of
the product of x and x.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:09.410
Over here is, of course,
the sum of x times

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.830
1 and 1 times x.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.100
Now, well, it's the first times
the derivative of the

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.330
second plus the second times the
derivative of the first.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.780
It's right.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.220
That's 2x of course.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:26.600
a times 2x is 2ax plus 0X square
doesn't count plus B

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.100
over here plus a bunch of 0's.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.130
Well the answer is right.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.390
But I give people take off
points on an exam for that,

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.690
sadly enough.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.830
Let's worry about that
in the next segment.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.080
Are there any questions?

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:44.070
Yes?

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.790
AUDIENCE: If you had left the
quote when you put the plus,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:51.120
then would that be referring
to the procedure plus and

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.560
could you do a comparison
between that procedure and

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.460
some other procedure
if you wanted to?

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.320
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.960
Good question.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:05.650
If I had left this quotation
off at this point, if I had

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.720
left that quotation off at that
point, then I would be

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.790
referring here to the procedure
which is the thing

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.510
that plus is defined to be.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:22.810
And indeed, I could compare
some procedures with each

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.070
other for identity.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.080
Now what that means is
not clear right now.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.100
I don't like to think
about it.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.840
Because I don't know exactly
what it would need to compare

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.450
procedures.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.610
There are reasons why that
may make no sense at all.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.890
However, the symbols,
we understand.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.240
And so that's why I
put that quote in.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.510
I want to talk about
the symbol that's

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:43.760
apparent on the page.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.700
Any other questions?

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.720
OK.

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.060
Thank you.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.210
Let's take a break.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:29:30.010
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:31.580
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.560
We've just developed a fairly
plausible program for

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.390
computing the derivatives of
algebraic expressions.

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.400
It's an incomplete program,
if you would

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.330
like to add more rules.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.020
And perhaps you might extend
it to deal with uses of

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.390
addition with any number of
arguments and multiplication

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.950
with any of the number
of arguments.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.470
And that's all rather easy.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:57.620
However, there was a little
fly in that ointment.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.980
We go back to this slide.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:09.000
We see that the expressions that
we get are rather bad.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.620
This is a rather
bad expression.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.000
How do we get such
an expression?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.940
Why do we have that
expression?

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.060
Let's look at this expression
in some detail.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.850
Let's find out where all
the pieces come from.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.590
As we see here, we
have a sum--

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.012
just what I showed you at the
end of the last time--

00:30:27.012 --> 00:30:30.110
of X times 1 plus 1
time X. That is a

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.590
derivative of this product.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.270
The produce of a times that,
where a does not depend upon

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:40.430
x, and therefore is constant
with respect to x, is this

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.910
sum, which goes from here all
the way through here and

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.840
through here.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:48.470
Because it is the first thing
times the derivative of the

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:54.900
second plus the derivative of
the first times the second as

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.970
the program we wrote
on the blackboard

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:00.740
indicated we should do.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:06.690
And, of course, the product of
bx over here manifests itself

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:15.220
as B times 1 plus 0 times X
because we see that B does not

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.085
depend upon X. And so the
derivative of B is this 0, and

00:31:19.085 --> 00:31:23.100
the derivative of X with respect
itself is the 1.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.510
And, of course, the derivative
of the sums over here turn

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.360
into these two sums of the
derivatives of the parts.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.620
So what we're seeing here is
exactly the thing I was trying

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.760
to tell you about with Fibonacci
numbers a while ago,

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:44.430
that the form of the process
is expanded from the local

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:48.850
rules that you see in the
procedure, that the procedure

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.720
represents a set of local rules
for the expansion of

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.520
this process.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:59.440
And here, the process left
behind some stuff, which is

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.370
the answer.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.850
And it was constructed by the
walk it takes of the tree

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.775
structure, which is
the expression.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.540
So every part in the answer we
see here derives from some

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:14.670
part of the problem.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.360
Now, we can look at, for
example, the derivative of

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.500
foo, which is ax square plus
bx plus c, with respect to

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.320
other things, like here, for
example, we can see that the

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.860
derivative of foo with
respect to a.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.390
And it's very similar.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:32.840
It's, in fact, the identical
algebraic expression, except

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.320
for the fact that theses
0's and 1's are

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.900
in different places.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.260
Because the only degree of
freedom we have in this tree

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.285
walk is what's constant with
respect to the variable we're

00:32:42.285 --> 00:32:44.550
taking the derivative
with respect to and

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.800
was the same variable.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:51.660
In other words, if we go back
to this blackboard and we

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.302
look, we have no choice what
to do when we take the

00:32:55.302 --> 00:32:58.150
derivative of the sum
or a product.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.840
The only interesting place here
is, is the expression the

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.590
variable, or is the expression
a constant with respect to

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.130
that variable for very, very
small expressions?

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.220
In which case we get various
1's and 0's, which if we go

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:17.290
back to this slide, we can see
that the 0's that appear here,

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:21.740
for example, this 1 over here
in derivative of foo with

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.980
respect to A, which gets us an
X square, because that 1 gets

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:32.770
the multiply of X and X into
the answer, that 1 is 0.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.173
Over here, we're not taking
the derivative of foo with

00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:36.690
respect to c.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.301
But the shapes of these
expressions are the same.

00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:42.561
See all those shapes.

00:33:42.561 --> 00:33:43.811
They're the same.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.750
Well is there anything
wrong with our rules?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.030
No.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.250
They're the right rules.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.160
We've been through
this one before.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.020
One of the things you're going
to begin to discover is that

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.270
there aren't too many
good ideas.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:12.139
When we were looking at rational
numbers yesterday,

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:14.909
the problem was that we got
6/8 rather then 3/4.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.949
The answer was unsimplified.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:21.150
The problem, of course,
is very similar.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.350
There are things I'd like to be
identical by simplification

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.350
that don't become identical.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.690
And yet the rules for doing
addition a multiplication of

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.000
rational numbers were correct.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.350
So the way we might solve this
problem is do the thing we did

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:37.940
last time, which always works.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.690
If something worked last time
it ought to work again.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.120
It's changed representation.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.350
Perhaps in the representation
we could put in a

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.940
simplification step that
produces a simplified

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.199
representation.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.580
This may not always
work, of course.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.210
I'm not trying to say that
it always works.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:59.540
But it's one of the pieces of
artillery we have in our war

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.560
against complexity.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.360
You see, because we solved our
problem very carefully.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.170
What we've done, is
we've divided the

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.630
world in several parts.

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.980
There are derivatives rules and
general rules for algebra

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.420
of some sort at this
level of detail.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.925
and i have an abstraction
barrier.

00:35:21.874 --> 00:35:32.710
And i have the representation of
the algebraic expressions,

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.960
list structure.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:43.050
And in this barrier, I have
the interface procedures.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:49.410
I have constant, and things
like same-var.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.095
I have things like
sum, make-sum.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:06.770
I have A1, A2.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.370
I have products and things
like that, all the other

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.490
things I might need for various
kinds of algebraic

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.000
expressions.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.080
Making this barrier allows me
to arbitrarily change the

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.710
representation without changing
the rules that are

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.060
written in terms of that
representation.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.220
So if I can make the problem
go away by changing

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.320
representation, the composition
of the problem

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.660
into these two parts has
helped me a great deal.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.860
So let's take a very simple
case of this.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.330
What was one of the problems?

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:44.115
Let's go back to this
transparency again.

00:36:44.115 --> 00:36:48.280
And we see here, oh yes, there's
horrible things like

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.190
here is the sum of an
expression and 0.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.590
Well that's no reason to think
of it as anything other than

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.300
the expression itself.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.970
Why should the summation
operation have

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.450
made up this edition?

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.550
It can be smarter than that.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.080
Or here, for example, is
a multiplication of

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.816
something by 1.

00:37:10.816 --> 00:37:12.990
It's another thing like that.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.960
Or here is a product of
something with 0, which is

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.800
certainly 0.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.430
So we won't have to make
this construction.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.800
So why don't we just do that?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.340
We need to change the way
the representation

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.990
works, almost here.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.060
Make-sum to be.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.020
Well, now it's not something
so simple.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.500
I'm not going to make a list
containing the symbol plus and

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.322
things unless I need to.

00:37:51.322 --> 00:37:52.630
Well, what are the
possibilities?

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.420
I have some sort
of cases here.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:09.160
If I have numbers, if
anyone is a number--

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.930
and here's another primitive
I've just introduced, it's

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:15.230
possible to tell whether
something's number--

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:23.090
and if number A2, meaning
they're not symbolic

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.280
expressions, then why not
do the addition now?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.540
The result is just a
plus of A1 and A2.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.000
I'm not asking if these
represent numbers.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.100
Of course all of these symbols
represent numbers.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.100
I'm talking about whether
the one I've got is the

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.420
number 3 right now.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:59.070
And, for example, supposing A1
is a number, and it's equal to

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:06.900
0, well then the answer
is just A2.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.698
There is no reason to
make anything up.

00:39:10.698 --> 00:39:27.630
And if A2 is a number,
and equal A20, then

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:30.210
the result is A1.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.770
And only if I can't figure out
something better to do with

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:41.160
this situation, well, I can
start a list. Otherwise I want

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.790
the representation to be the
list containing the quoted

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:51.850
symbol plus, and A1, and A2.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.660
And, of course, a very
similar thing

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.020
can be done for products.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.650
And I think I'll avoid
boring you with them.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.740
I was going to write it
on the blackboard.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.080
I don't think it's necessary.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.830
You know what to do.

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:12.880
It's very simple.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.890
But now, let's just see the kind
of results we get out of

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:21.870
changing our program
in this way.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.920
Well, here's the derivatives
after having just changed the

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.810
constructors for expressions.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:35.810
The same foo, aX square plus bX
plus c, and what I get is

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:40.265
nothing more than the derivative
of that is 2aX plus

00:40:40.265 --> 00:40:40.660
B.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.670
Well, it's not completely
simplified.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.170
I would like to collect
common terms and sums.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.180
Well, that's more work.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:51.130
And, of course, programs to do
this sort of thing are huge

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.440
and complicated.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.510
Algebraic simplification, it's
a very complicated mess.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.240
There's a very famous program
you may have heard of called

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.750
Maxima developed at MIT in the
past, which is 5,000 pages of

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.830
Lisp code, mostly the algebraic
simplification

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.080
operations.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.210
There we see the derivative
of foo.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.390
In fact, X is at something I
wouldn't take off more than 1

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:18.390
point for on an elementary
calculus class.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.960
And the derivative of foo with
respect to a, well it's gone

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.730
down to X times X, which
isn't so bad.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:28.200
And the derivative of foo with
respect to b is just X itself.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.730
And the derivative of foo with
respect to c comes out 1.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.260
So I'm pretty pleased
with this.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.830
What you've seen is, of
course, a little bit

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.020
contrived, carefully organized
example to show you how we can

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.610
manipulate algebraic
expressions, how we do that

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.890
abstractly in terms of abstract
syntax rather than

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:53.910
concrete syntax and how we can
use the abstraction to control

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.850
what goes on in building
these expressions.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.910
But the real story isn't just
such a simple thing as that.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.890
The real story is, in fact, that
I'm manipulating these

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.450
expressions.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.860
And the expressions are
the same expressions--

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.150
going back to the slide--

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.110
as the ones that are
Lisp expressions.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.890
There's a pun here.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.020
I've chosen my representation
to be the same as the

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:22.830
representation in my language
of similar things.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.990
By doing so, I've invoked
a necessity.

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:30.890
I created the necessity to have
things like quotation

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.690
because of the fact that my
language is capable of writing

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.820
expressions that talk about
expressions of the language.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.420
I need to have something that
says, this is an expression

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.320
I'm talking about rather than
this expression is talking

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.400
about something, and I want
to talk about that.

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:54.420
So quotation stops and says,
I'm talking about this

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.670
expression itself.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.030
Now, given that power, if I can
manipulate expressions of

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:07.370
the language, I can begin to
build even much more powerful

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.860
layers upon layers
of languages.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.370
Because I can write languages
that not only are embedded in

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.730
Lisp or whatever language you
start with, but languages that

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.400
are completely different, that
are just, if we say,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.280
interpreted in Lisp or
something like that.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.232
We'll get to understand those
words more in the future.

00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:30.150
But right now I just want to
leave you with the fact that

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:36.160
we've hit a line which gives
us tremendous power.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.900
And this point we've bought
a sledgehammer.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:42.250
We have to be careful to what
flies when we apply it.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:42.570
Thank you.
