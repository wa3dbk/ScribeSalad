00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.270
PROFESSOR: Well, yesterday we
learned a bit about symbolic

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.140
manipulation, and we wrote a
rather stylized program to

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.620
implement a pile of calculus
rule from the calculus book.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.790
Here on the transparencies, we
see a bunch of calculus rules

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.470
from such a book.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.030
And, of course, what we did is
sort of translate these rules

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.040
into the language
of the computer.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.340
But, of course, that's a
sort of funny strategy.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.570
Why should we have to translate
these rules into the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.989
language of the computer?

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.320
And what do I really
mean by that?

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.170
These are--the program we wrote

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.240
yesterday was very stylized.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.210
It was a conditional, a dispatch
on the type of the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.660
expression as observed
by the rules.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.450
What we see here are rules that
say if the object being

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.850
the derivative is being taken
of, if that expression is a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.350
constant, then do one thing.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.590
If it's a variable,
do another thing.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.040
If it's a product of a constant
times a variable, do

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.220
something and so on.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.630
There's sort of a dispatch
there on a type.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.260
Well, since it has such a
stylized behavior and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.110
structure, is there some other
way of writing this program

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.401
that's more clear?

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:52.280
Well, what's a rule,
first of all?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.530
What are these rules?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.130
Let's think about that.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.910
Rules have parts.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.400
If you look at these rules in
detail, what you see, for

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.750
example, is the rule has
a left-hand side and a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.940
right-hand side.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.220
Each of these rules has a
left-hand side and the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.960
right-hand side.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.640
The left-hand side is somehow
compared with the expression

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.250
you're trying to take
the derivative of.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.440
The right-hand side is the
replacement for that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.690
expression.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.070
So all rules on this page
are something like this.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.990
I have patterns, and somehow,
I have to produce, given a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.845
pattern, a skeleton.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.950
This is a rule.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.650
A pattern is something that
matches, and a skeleton is

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.470
something you substitute into
in order to get a new

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.720
expression.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.960
So what that means is that the
pattern is matched against the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.910
expression, which is the
source expression.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.620
And the result of the
application of the rule is to

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:38.070
produce a new expression, which
I'll call a target, by

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.620
instantiation of a skeleton.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.870
That's called instantiation.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.530
So that is the process by which

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.780
these rules are described.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.680
What I'd like to do today is
build a language and a means

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.950
of interpreting that language,
a means of executing that

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.770
language, where that language
allows us to directly express

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.550
these rules.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.150
And what we're going to do is
instead of bringing the rules

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.920
to the level of the computer by
writing a program that is

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.279
those rules in the computer's
language--

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.170
at the moment, in a Lisp--

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.740
we're going to bring the
computer to the level of us by

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.400
writing a way by which the
computer can understand rules

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.670
of this sort.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.210
This is slightly emphasizing the
idea that we had last time

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.560
that we're trying to make
a solution to a class of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.630
problems rather than
a particular one.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.740
The problem is if I want to
write rules for a different

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.990
piece of mathematics, say,
to simple algebraic

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.050
simplification or something like
that, or manipulation of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.160
trigonometric functions,
I would have to write a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.130
different program in using
yesterday's method.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.550
Whereas I would like to
encapsulate all of the things

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.770
that are common to both of those
programs, meaning the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.870
idea of matching, instantiation,
the control

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.090
structure, which turns out to be
very complicated for such a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.420
thing, I'd like to encapsulate
that separately from the rules

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.010
themselves.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.730
So let's look at, first of
all, a representation.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.670
I'd like to use the
overhead here.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.975
I'd like-- there it is.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.440
I'd like to look at a
representation of the rules of

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.010
calculus for derivatives in a
sort of simple language that

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.140
I'm writing right here.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.420
Now, I'm going to avoid--I'm
going to avoid

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.250
worrying about syntax.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.340
We can easily pretty this, and
I'm not interested in making--

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.230
this is indeed ugly.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.810
This doesn't look like the
beautiful text set dx by dt or

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.730
something that I'd
like to write,

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.710
but that's not essential.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.480
That's sort of an accidental
phenomenon.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.220
Here, we're just worrying
about the fact that the

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.060
structure of the rules is that
there is a left-hand side

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.510
here, represents the thing I
want to match against the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.720
derivative expression.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.140
This is the representation
I'm going to say for the

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.980
derivative of a constant, which
we will call c with

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.730
respect to the variable we will
call v. And what we will

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.010
get on the right-hand
side is 0.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.620
So this represents a rule.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.980
The next rule will be the
derivative of a variable,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.010
which we will call v with
respect to the same variable

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.560
v, and we get a 1.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.360
However, if we have the
derivative of a variable

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.490
called u with respect to
a different variables

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.790
v, we will get 0.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.880
I just want you look at these
rules a little bit and see how

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.750
they fit together.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.310
For example, over here, we're
going to have the derivative

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.360
of the sum of an expression
called x1 and an

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.790
expression called x2.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.960
These things that begin with
question marks are called

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.910
pattern variables in the
language that we're inventing,

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.820
and you see we're just making
it up, so pattern variables

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.960
for matching.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.050
And so in this--

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.140
here we have the derivative of
the sum of the expression

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.380
which we will call x1.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.150
And the expression we will call
x2 with respect to the

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.500
variable we call v will be--
here is the right-hand side:

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.700
the sum of the derivative of
that expression x1 with

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.910
respect to v-- the right-hand
side is the skeleton--

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.950
and the derivative of x2 with
respect to v. Colons here will

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.170
stand for substitution
objects.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.480
They're--we'll call them
skeleton evaluations.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.420
So let me put up here on the
blackboard for a second some

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.380
syntax so we'll know
what's going on

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.620
for this rule language.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.730
First of all, we're going to
have to worry about the

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.980
pattern matching.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.950
We're going to have things like
a symbol like foo matches

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.200
exactly itself.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:35.919
The expression f of a and b will
be used to match any list

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:51.130
whose first element is f, whose
second element is a, and

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:58.550
whose third element is b.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.200
Also, another thing we might
have in a pattern is that--

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.150
a question mark with some
variable like x.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:17.965
And what that means, it says
matches anything, which we

00:09:17.965 --> 00:09:19.215
will call x.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:30.922
Question mark c x will
match only constants.

00:09:30.922 --> 00:09:41.140
So this is something which
matches a constant colon x.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:55.920
And question mark v x will
match a variable,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.170
which we call x.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.140
This is sort of the language
we're making up now.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.240
If I match two things against
each other, then they are

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.200
compared element by element.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.630
But elements in the pattern may
contain these syntactic

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:19.310
variables, pattern variables,
which will be used to match

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.160
arbitrary objects.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.480
And we'll get that object as the
value in the name x here,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.030
for example.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:39.290
Now, when we make skeletons
for instantiation.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.320
Well, then we have
things like this.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.160
foo, a symbol, instantiates
to itself.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.630
Something which is a list
like f of a and b,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:06.350
instantiates to--

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:14.270
well, f instantiates to a
3-list, a list of three

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:27.420
elements, okay, which are the
results of instantiating each

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:33.320
of f, a, and b.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:53.470
And x well--we instantiate to
the value of x as in the

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.720
matched pattern.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.630
So going back to the overhead
here, we see--we see that all

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:14.040
of those kinds of objects, we
see here a pattern variable

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.180
which matches a constant, a
pattern variable which matches

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.660
a variable, a pattern variable
which will match anything.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.810
And if we have two instances of
the same name, like this is

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:29.840
the derivative of the expression
which is a variable

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.510
only whose name will be v with
respect to some arbitrary

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.560
expression which we will call v,
since this v appears twice,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.770
we're going to want that to mean
they have to be the same.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.630
The only consistent match is
that those are the same.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.170
So here, we're making
up a language.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.440
And in fact, that's a very
nice thing to be doing.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.555
It's so much fun to make
up a language.

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:54.320
And you do this all the time.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.390
And the really most powerful
design things you ever do are

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.050
sort of making up a language to
solve problems like this.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.780
Now, here we go back here and
look at some of these rules.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.070
Well, there's a whole
set of them.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.540
I mean, there's one for
addition and one for

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.390
multiplication, just
like we had before.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.900
The derivative of the product of
x1 and x2 with respect to v

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.660
is the sum of the product of x1
and the derivative x2 with

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.750
respect to v and the
product of the

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.200
derivative of x1 and x2.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.180
And here we have
exponentiation.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.880
And, of course, we run off
the end down here.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.540
We get as many as we like.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.270
But the whole thing over here,
I'm giving this--this list of

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.910
rules the name "derivative
rules."

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.240
What would we do with such
a thing once we have it?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.080
Well, one of the nicest ideas,
first of all, is I'm going to

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.230
write for you, and we're going
to play with it all day.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.680
What I'm going to write for
you is a program called

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.150
simplifier, the general-purpose
simplifier.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:09.150
And we're going to say something
like define dsimp to

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:17.260
be a simplifier of the
derivative rules.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.390
And what simplifier is going
to do is, given a set of

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.670
rules, it will produce for
me a procedure which will

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.200
simplify expressions containing
the things that are

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.680
referred to by these rules.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.110
So here will be a procedure
constructed for your purposes

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.150
to simplify things with
derivatives in them such that,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.050
after that, if we're typing at
some list system, and we get a

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:58.030
prompt, and we say dsimp, for
example, of the derivative of

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:03.885
the sum of x and y with
respect to x--

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.740
note the quote here because
I'm talking about the

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.660
expression which is
the derivative--

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:19.970
then I will get back as
a result plus 1 0.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.760
Because the derivative of x plus
y is the derivative of x

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.490
plus derivative y.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.300
The derivative of x with
respect to x is 1.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.260
The derivative of y with
respect to x is 0.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.170
It's not what we're
going to get.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.280
I haven't put any simplification
at that level--

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.440
algebraic simplification--

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.010
yet.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.702
Of course, once we have such a
thing, then we can--then we

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:42.340
can look at other rules.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:49.310
So, for example, we can, if
we go to the slide, OK?

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.480
Here, for example, are other
rules that we might have,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.780
algebraic manipulation rules,
ones that would be used for

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.960
simplifying algebraic
expressions.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.470
For example, just looking at
some of these, the left-hand

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.220
side says any operator applied
to a constant e1 and a

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.310
constant e2 is the result of
evaluating that operator on

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.850
the constants e1 and e2.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.660
Or an operator, applied to e1,
any expression e1 and a

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.520
constant e2, is going to move
the constant forward.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.980
So that'll turn into
the operator with

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.770
e2 followed by e1.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.200
Why I did that, I don't know.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.560
It wouldn't work if I had
division, for example.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.610
So there's a bug in the
rules, if you like.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:42.120
So the sum of 0 and e is e.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.110
The product of 1 and any
expression e is e.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.520
The product of 0 and any
expression e is 0.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.130
Just looking at some more of
these rules, we could have

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.670
arbitrarily complicated ones.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:59.050
We could have things like the
product of the constant e1 and

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.230
any constant e2 with e3 is the
result of multiplying the

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:10.310
result of--multiplying now the
constants e1 and e2 together

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.319
and putting e3 there.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.760
So it says combine the constants
that I had, which

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.480
was if I had a product of e1 and
e2 and e3 just multiply--I

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.800
mean and e1 and e2 are both
constants, multiply them.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.690
And you can make up the
rules as you like.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.619
There are lots of them here.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.300
There are things as complicated,
for example, as--

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.910
oh, I suppose down here some
distributive law, you see.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:39.150
The product of any object c and
the sum of d and e gives

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.340
the result as the same as the
sum of the product of c and d

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.320
and the product of c and e.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.770
Now, what exactly these
rules are doesn't very

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.220
much interest me.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.970
We're going to be writing the
language that will allow us to

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.480
interpret these rules so that
we can, in fact, make up

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.430
whatever rules we like, another
whole language of

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.680
programming.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.130
Well, let's see.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:07.520
I haven't told you how we're
going to do this.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.760
And, of course, for a while,
we're going to work on that.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.980
But there's a real question of
what is--what am I going to do

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.940
at all at a large scale?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.930
How do these rules work?

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.830
How is the simplifier program
going to manipulate these

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:26.190
rules with your expression to
produce a reasonable answer?

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.410
Well, first, I'd like to think
about these rules as being

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.100
some sort of deck of them.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:42.030
So here I have a whole bunch
of rules, right?

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.660
Each rule--

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.930
here's a rule--

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.720
has a pattern and a skeleton.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.410
I'm trying to make up a control
structure for this.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:19:02.720
Now, what I have is a matcher,
and I have something which is

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.970
an instantiater.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.950
And I'm going to pass from the
matcher to the instantiater

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.200
some set of meaning for the
pattern variables, a

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.560
dictionary, I'll call it.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.740
A dictionary, which will say
x was matched against the

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.410
following subexpression and y
was matched against another

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.170
following subexpression.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.040
And from the instantiater, I
will be making expressions,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.130
and they will go into
the matcher.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.380
They will be expressions.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.190
And the patterns of the rules
will be fed into the matcher,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.600
and the skeletons from the same
rule will be fed into the

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.190
instantiater.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.920
Now, this is a little
complicated because when you

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.965
have something like an algebraic
expression, where

00:20:00.965 --> 00:20:02.290
someth--the rules are intended
to be able to allow you to

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.290
substitute equal for equal.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.860
These are equal transformation
rules.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.710
So all subexpressions
of the expression

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.090
should be looked at.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.440
You give it an expression,
this thing, and the rules

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.010
should be cycled around.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.540
First of all, for every
subexpression of the

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.340
expression you feed in, all
of the rules must be

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.390
tried and looked at.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.200
And if any rule matches, then
this process occurs.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.620
The dictionary--the dictionary
is to have some values in it.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.800
The instantiater makes a new
expression, which is basically

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.000
replaces that part of the
expression that was matched in

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.800
your original expression.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.700
And then, then, of course, we're
going to recheck that,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.170
going to go around these rules
again, seeing if that could be

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.520
simplified further.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.960
And then, then we're going
to do that for every

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.940
subexpression until the thing
no longer changes.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.890
You can think of this as sort
of an organic process.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.190
You've got some sort
of stew, right?

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.076
You've got bacteria or
something, or enzymes in some,

00:21:03.076 --> 00:21:05.590
in some gooey mess.

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.470
And there's these--and these
enzymes change things.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.320
They attach to your expression,
change it, and

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.300
then they go away.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.080
And they have to match.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.740
The key-in-lock phenomenon.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.660
They match, they change
it, they go away.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.310
You can imagine it as a parallel
process of some sort.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.250
So you stick an expression into
this mess, and after a

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.440
while, you take it out, and
it's been simplified.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.660
And it just keeps changing
until it no

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.170
longer can be changed.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.840
But these enzymes can attach
to any part of the, of the

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.230
expression.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.990
OK, at this point, I'd like to
stop and ask for questions.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.950
Yes.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.550
AUDIENCE: This implies that the
matching program and the

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.460
instantiation program
are separate

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.650
programs; is that right?

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.690
Or is that-- they are.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.090
PROFESSOR: They're separate
little pieces.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.170
They fit together in
a larger structure.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm going through
and matching and passing the

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.520
information about what I matched
to an instantiater,

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.620
which makes the changes.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.480
And then I pass that back
to the matcher?

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.060
PROFESSOR: It won't
make a change.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.540
It will make a new expression,
which has, which has

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.980
substituted the values of the
pattern variable that were

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.860
matched on the left-hand side
for the variables that are

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.570
mentioned, the skeleton
variables or evaluation

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.170
variables or whatever I called
them, on the right-hand side.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.660
AUDIENCE: And then that's passed
back into the matcher?

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.490
PROFESSOR: Then this is going
to go around again.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.330
This is going to go through
this mess until

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.240
it no longer changes.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.440
AUDIENCE: And it seems that
there would be a danger of

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.170
getting into a recursive loop.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.240
Yes, if you do not write your
rules nicely, you are--

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.870
indeed, in any programming
language you invent, if it's

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.190
sufficiently powerful to do
anything, you can write

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:49.280
programs that will go
into infinite loops.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.600
And indeed, writing a program
for doing algebraic

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.010
manipulation for long will
produce infinite loops.

00:23:00.722 --> 00:23:01.680
Go ahead.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.580
AUDIENCE: Some language
designers feel that this

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.850
feature is so important that it
should become part of the

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.670
basic language, for example,
scheme in this case.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.960
What are your thoughts on--

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.722
PROFESSOR: Which language
feature?

00:23:15.722 --> 00:23:17.290
AUDIENCE: The pairs matching.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.840
It's all application of
such rules should be--

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.650
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
mean like Prolog?

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.595
AUDIENCE: Like Prolog, but it
becomes a more general--

00:23:26.595 --> 00:23:28.470
PROFESSOR: It's possible.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.740
OK, I think my feeling about
that is that I would like to

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.840
teach you how to do it so you
don't depend upon some

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.490
language designer.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.870
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:41.850
PROFESSOR: You make
it yourself.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.640
You can roll your own.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.890
Thank you.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.800
Well, let's see.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.100
Now we have to tell
you how it works.

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:24.445
It conveniently breaks up
into various pieces.

00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:28.680
I'd like to look now
at the matcher.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.730
The matcher has the following
basic structure.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:44.500
It's a box that takes as its
input an expression and a

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:53.570
pattern, and it turns
out a dictionary.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.440
A dictionary, remember, is a
mapping of pattern variables

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.990
to the values that were found
by matching, and it puts out

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:20.370
another dictionary, which is the
result of augmenting this

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.350
dictionary by what was found
in matching this expression

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.600
against this pattern.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.180
So that's the matcher.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.600
Now, this is a rather
complicated program, and we

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.530
can look at it on the overhead
over here and see, ha, ha,

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.430
it's very complicated.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.740
I just want you to look
at the shape of it.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.670
It's too complicated to look
at except in pieces.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.720
However, it's a fairly large,
complicated program with a lot

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.140
of sort of indented structure.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.090
At the largest scale--

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.740
you don't try to read those
characters, but at the largest

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.130
scale, you see that there is a
case analysis, which is all

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.100
these cases lined up.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.400
What we're now going to do is
look at this in a bit more

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.970
detail, attempting to understand
how it works.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.810
Let's go now to the first slide,
showing some of the

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.710
structure of the matcher
at a large scale.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:33.440
And we see that the matcher, the
matcher takes as its input

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.050
a pattern, an expression,
and a dictionary.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.370
And there is a case analysis
here, which is made out of

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:46.630
several cases, some of which
have been left out over here,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:50.560
and the general case, which
I'd like you to see.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.920
Let's consider this
general case.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.230
It's a very important pattern.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.650
The problem is that we have
to examine two trees

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.000
simultaneously.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.230
One of the trees is the tree
of the expression, and the

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.660
other is the tree
of the pattern.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.540
We have to compare them with
each other so that the

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.230
subexpressions of the expression
are matched against

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.380
subexpressions of the pattern.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.170
Looking at that in a bit more
detail, suppose I had a

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:29.820
pattern, a pattern, which was
the sum of the product of a

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:38.130
thing which we will call x and
a thing which we will call y,

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.000
and the sum of that, and the
same thing we call y.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:49.902
So we're looking for a sum of a
product whose second--whose

00:27:49.902 --> 00:27:53.790
second argument is the
same as the second

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.960
argument of the sum.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.650
That's a thing you might
be looking for.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.770
Well, that, as a pattern,
looks like this.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:09.660
There is a tree, which consists
of a sum, and a

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.640
product with a pattern variable
question mark x and

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.960
question mark y, the other
pattern variable, and question

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.785
mark y, just looking at the
same, just writing down the

00:28:25.785 --> 00:28:28.760
list structure in
a different way.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.040
Now, suppose we were matching
that against an expression

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.990
which matches it, the sum of,
say, the product of 3 and x

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.420
and, say, x.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.380
That's another tree.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:56.250
It's the sum of the product
of 3 and x and of x.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.030
So what I want to do is traverse
these two trees

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.410
simultaneously.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.670
And what I'd like to do is
walk them like this.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.880
I'm going to say are
these the same?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.200
This is a complicated object.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.240
Let's look at the
left branches.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.460
Well, that could be the car.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.250
How does that look?

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.880
Oh yes, the plus looks
just fine.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.080
But the next thing here is
a complicated thing.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.170
Let's look at that.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.780
Oh yes, that's pretty
fine, too.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.560
They're both asterisks.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.410
Now, whoops!

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.300
My pattern variable, it
matches against the 3.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.400
Remember, x equals 3 now.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.290
That's in my dictionary, and
the dictionary's going to

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.490
follow along with me:
x equals three.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:46.800
Ah yes, x equals 3 and y
equals x, different x.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.060
The pattern x is the expression
x, the pattern y.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.570
Oh yes, the pattern variable
y, I've already

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.270
got a value for it.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.410
It's x.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:59.050
Is this an x?

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.070
Oh yeah, sure it is.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.040
That's fine.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.380
Yep, done.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.070
I now have a dictionary,
which I've accumulated

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.320
by making this walk.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.080
Well, now let's look at this
general case here and see how

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.830
that works.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.150
Here we have it.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.520
I take in a pattern variable--a
pattern, an

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.310
expression, and a dictionary.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.650
And now I'm going to do a
complicated thing here, which

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.610
is the general case.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.480
The expression is made out of
two parts: a left and a right

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.470
half, in general.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.080
Anything that's complicated is
made out of two pieces in a

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.950
Lisp system.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.870
Well, now what do
we have here?

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.840
I'm going to match the car's of
the two expressions against

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.190
each other with respect to the
dictionary I already have,

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:55.620
producing a dictionary as its
value, which I will then use

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.130
for matching the cdr's
against each other.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.580
So that's how the dictionary
travels,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.580
threads the entire structure.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.310
And then the result of that is
the dictionary for the match

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:11.230
of the car and the cdr, and
that's what's going to be

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.640
returned as a value.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.670
Now, at any point, a
match might fail.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.670
It may be the case, for example,
if we go back and

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:24.010
look at an expression that
doesn't quite match, like

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:29.040
supposing this was a 4.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.520
Well, now these two don't match
any more, because the x

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.190
that had to be-- sorry, the y
that had to be x here and this

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.410
y has to be 4.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.510
But x and 4 were not the same
object syntactically.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.130
So this wouldn't match, and
that would be rejected

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.220
sometimes, so matches
may fail.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.140
Now, of course, because this
matcher takes the dictionary

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.110
from the previous match as
input, it must be able to

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.520
propagate the failures.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.090
And so that's what the
first clause of

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.420
this conditional does.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.330
It's also true that if it turned
out that the pattern

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.540
was not atomic--

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.280
see, if the pattern was atomic,
I'd go into this

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.060
stuff, which we haven't
looked at yet.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.250
But if the pattern is
not atomic and the

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.825
expression is atomic--

00:32:17.825 --> 00:32:20.010
it's not made out of pieces--

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.560
then that must be a failure,
and so we go over here.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.660
If the pattern is not atomic
and the pattern is not a

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.420
pattern variable--

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.716
I have to remind myself
of that--

00:32:29.716 --> 00:32:30.850
then we go over here.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.570
So that way, failures
may occur.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.612
OK, so now let's look at the
insides of this thing.

00:32:39.612 --> 00:32:42.080
Well, the first place to look
is what happens if I have an

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.870
atomic pattern?

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.870
That's very simple.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.945
A pattern that's not made
out of any pieces: foo.

00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:49.200
That's a nice atomic pattern.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.060
Well, here's what we see.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.750
If the pattern is atomic, then
if the expression is atomic,

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.200
then if they are the same thing,
then the dictionary I

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.120
get is the same one
as I had before.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.730
Nothing's changed.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:09.160
It's just that I matched plus
against plus, asterisk against

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.440
asterisk, x against x.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.920
That's all fine.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.110
However, if the pattern is
not the one which is the

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.405
expression, if I have two
separate atomic objects, then

00:33:19.405 --> 00:33:25.810
it was matching plus against
asterisk, which case I fail.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.300
Or if it turns out that the
pattern is atomic but the

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.310
expression is complicated,
it's not atomic,

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.560
then I get a failure.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.800
That's very simple.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.040
Now, what about the various
kinds of pattern variables?

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.610
We had three kinds.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.340
I give them the names.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.990
They're arbitrary constants,
arbitrary variables, and

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.770
arbitrary expressions.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:34:01.210
A question mark x is an
arbitrary expression.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.830
A question mark cx is an
arbitrary constant, and a

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.537
question mark vx is an
arbitrary variable.

00:34:08.537 --> 00:34:10.540
Well, what do we do here?

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.139
Looking at this, we see that
if I have an arbitrary

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.080
constant, if the pattern is an
arbitrary constant, then it

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.560
had better be the case
that the expression

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.480
had better be a constant.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.620
If the expression is
not a constant,

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.920
then that match fails.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.780
If it is a constant, however,
then I wish to extend the

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.620
dictionary.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.380
I wish to extend the dictionary
with that pattern

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.650
being remembered to be that
expression using the old

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.900
dictionary as a starting
point.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.179
So really, for arbitrary
variables, I have to check

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.440
first if the expression is a
variable by matching against.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.750
If so, it's worth extending
the dictionary so that the

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.639
pattern is remembered to
be matched against that

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.900
expression, given the original
dictionary, and this makes a

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.880
new dictionary.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.310
Now, it has to check.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.860
There's a sorts of failure
inside extend dictionary,

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:04.990
which is that--

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:09.200
if one of these pattern
variables already has a value

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.810
and I'm trying to match the
thing against something else

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.310
which is not equivalent to the
one that I've already matched

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:17.760
it against once, then a failure
will come flying out

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.220
of here, too.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.890
And I will see that some time.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.850
And finally, an arbitrary
expression does not have to

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.010
check anything syntactic about
the expression that's being

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.670
matched, so all it does is
it's an extension of the

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.355
dictionary.

00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:39.300
So you've just seen a complete,
very simple matcher.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.640
Now, one of the things that's
rather remarkable about this

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.670
is people pay an awful lot of
money these days for someone

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.290
to make a, quote, AI expert
system that has nothing more

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:53.470
in it than a matcher and maybe
an instantiater like this.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.780
But it's very easy to do, and
now, of course, you can start

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.070
up a little start-up company and
make a couple of megabucks

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.835
in the next week taking some
people for a ride.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.510
20 years ago, this
was remarkable,

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.610
this kind of program.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.870
But now, this is sort of easy.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.660
You can teach it to freshmen.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.380
Well, now there's an
instantiater as well.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.710
The problem is they're all
going off and making more

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.190
money than I do.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.660
But that's always been
true of universities.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:33.140
As expression, the purpose of
the instantiater is to make

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.245
expressions given a dictionary
and a skeleton.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.770
And that's not very
hard at all.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:53.590
We'll see that very simply in
the next, the next slide here.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.570
To instantiate a skeleton,
given a particular

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.230
dictionary--

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.650
oh, this is easy.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:04.050
We're going to do a recursive
tree walk over the skeleton.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.540
And for everything which is
a skeleton variable--

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.390
I don't know, call it a
skeleton evaluation.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.612
That's the name and the abstract
syntax that I give it

00:37:10.612 --> 00:37:13.610
in this program: a skeleton
evaluation, a thing beginning

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:18.180
with a colon in the rules.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.850
For anything of that case, I'm
going to look up the answer in

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.470
the dictionary, and we'll worry
about that in a second.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.700
Let's look at this as a whole.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.530
Here, I have--

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:32.740
I'm going to instantiate a
skeleton, given a dictionary.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.300
Well, I'm going to define some
internal loop right there, and

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.190
it's going to do something
very simple.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.600
Even if a skeleton--even if a
skeleton is simple and atomic,

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.450
in which case it's nothing more
than giving the skeleton

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:51.140
back as an answer, or in
the general case, it's

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.150
complicated, in which case
I'm going to make up the

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:59.360
expression which is the result
of instantiating--

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.000
calling this loop
recursively--

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.870
instantiating the car of the
skeleton and the cdr.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.090
So here is a recursive
tree walk.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:12.410
However, if it turns out to be a
skeleton evaluation, a colon

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:18.020
expression in the skeleton, then
what I'm going to do is

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.520
find the expression that's
in the colon--

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.820
the CADR in this case.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.110
It's a piece of abstract syntax
here, so I can change

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.480
my representation of rules.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.330
I'm going to evaluate that
relative to this dictionary,

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.940
whatever evaluation means.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.100
We'll find out a lot about
that sometime.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.650
And the result of that
is my answer.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:39.830
so.

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.240
I start up this loop-- here's
my initialization--

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.900
by calling it with the whole
skeleton, and this will just

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.100
do a recursive decomposition
into pieces.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:55.090
Now, one more little bit
of detail is what

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.130
happens inside evaluate?

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.030
I can't tell you that
in great detail.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:01.650
I'll tell you a little
bit of it.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.130
Later, we're going to see--look
into this in much

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.970
more detail.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:10.120
To evaluate some form, some
expression with respect to a

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:15.355
dictionary, if the expression is
an atomic object, well, I'm

00:39:15.355 --> 00:39:18.620
going to go look it up.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.610
Nothing very exciting there.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.900
Otherwise, I'm going to do
something complicated here,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.790
which is I'm going to apply a
procedure which is the result

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:30.220
of looking up the operator part
in something that we're

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.150
going to find out
about someday.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.630
I want you realize you're
seeing magic now.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:40.000
This magic will become clear
very soon, but not today.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.540
Then I'm looking at--looking
up all the pieces, all the

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.460
arguments to that in
the dictionary.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.390
So I don't want you to look
at this in detail.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.330
I want you to say that there's
more going on here, and we're

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:59.000
going to see more about this.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.490
But it's--

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.490
the magic is going to stop.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:07.140
This part has to do with Lisp,
and it's the end of that.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:15.040
OK, so now we know about
matching and instantiation.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.505
Are there any questions
for this segment?

00:40:27.936 --> 00:40:29.870
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:30.880
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.600
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
bring up a previous slide?

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.160
It's about this define
match pattern.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.590
You'd like to see the overall
slide define match pattern.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.890
Can somebody put up the--

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:42.940
no, the overhead.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.300
That's the biggest scale one.

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.640
What part would you
like to see?

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.930
AUDIENCE: Well, the
top would be fine.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:54.540
Any of the parts where you're
passing failed.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.625
AUDIENCE: The idea is to pass
failed back to the dictionary;

00:40:58.625 --> 00:40:59.000
is that right?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.180
PROFESSOR: The dictionary is the
answer to a match, right?

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:13.150
And it is either some mapping
or there's no match.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.560
It doesn't match.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.150
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:18.110
PROFESSOR: So what you're seeing
over here is, in fact,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:21.620
because the fact that a match
may have another match pass in

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.950
the dictionary, as you see in
the general case down here.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:27.325
Here's the general case where
a match passes another match

00:41:27.325 --> 00:41:28.090
to the dictionary.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.860
When I match the cdr's, I match
them in the dictionary

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.070
that is resulting from
matching the car's.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:37.180
OK, that's what I have here.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.430
So because of that, if the match
of the car's fails, then

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:44.770
it may be necessary that the
match of the cdr's propagates

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.570
that failure, and that's
what the first line is.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:51.400
AUDIENCE: OK, well, I'm still
unclear what matches--

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.800
what comes out of one instance
of the match?

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.320
PROFESSOR: One of two
possibilities.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.350
Either the symbol failed, which
means there is no match.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:41:59.840
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.360
PROFESSOR: Or some mapping,
which is an abstract thing

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.480
right now, and you should know
about the structure of it,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:13.170
which relates the pattern
variables to their values as

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.490
picked up in the match.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.930
AUDIENCE: OK, so it is--

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.810
PROFESSOR: That's constructed
by extend dictionary.

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:22.450
AUDIENCE: So the recursive
nature brings about the fact

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:28.290
that if ever a failed gets
passed out of any calling of

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.430
match, then the first condition
will pick it up--

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.820
PROFESSOR: And just propagate
it along without any further

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.530
ado, right.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:34.370
AUDIENCE: Oh, right.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.460
OK.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.650
PROFESSOR: That's just the
fastest way to get that

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.900
failure out of there.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:43.850
Yes.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.530
AUDIENCE: If I don't fail, that
means that I've matched a

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.230
pattern, and I run the procedure
extend dict and then

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.655
pass in the pattern
in the expression.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.290
But the substitution will
not be made at that

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.400
point; is that right?

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.110
I'm just--

00:42:59.110 --> 00:42:59.420
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.960
There's no substitution being
there because there's no

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.520
skeleton to be substituted in.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:02.950
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:03.070
So what--

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:04.760
PROFESSOR: All you've got there
is we're making up the

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.270
dictionary for later
substitution.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.680
AUDIENCE: And what would the
dictionary look like?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.540
Is it ordered pairs?

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.940
PROFESSOR: That's--that's
not told to you.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.700
We're being abstract.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:18.850
PROFESSOR: Why do you
want to know?

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.075
What it is, it's a function.

00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:21.330
It's a function.

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.090
AUDIENCE: Well, the reason
I want to know is--

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.300
PROFESSOR: A function
abstractly is a

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.130
set of ordered pairs.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.040
It could be implemented as
a set of list pairs.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.590
It could be implemented as some
fancy table mechanism.

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.780
It could be implemented
as a function.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.500
And somehow, I'm building
up a function.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.560
But I'm not telling you.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.090
That's up to George, who's going
to build that later.

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.470
I know you really badly want
to write concrete things.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.280
I'm not going to let
you do that.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.020
AUDIENCE: Well, let me at
least ask, what is the

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.530
important information
there that's being

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.750
passed to extend dict?

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.720
I want to pass the
pattern I found--

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.630
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.870
The pattern that's matched
against the expression.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.680
You want to have the pattern,
which happens to be in those

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.970
cases pattern variables,
right?

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.420
All of those three
cases for extend

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.220
dict are pattern variables.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.090
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.370
PROFESSOR: So you have a pattern
variable that is to be

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.965
given a value in a dictionary.

00:44:18.965 --> 00:44:19.250
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.760
PROFESSOR: The value is the
expression that it matched

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.260
against. The dictionary is the
set of things I've already

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.195
figured out that I have
memorized or learned.

00:44:30.195 --> 00:44:33.250
And I am going to make a new
dictionary, which is extended

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:36.870
from the original one by having
that pattern variable

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.880
have a value with the
new dictionary.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.580
AUDIENCE: I guess what I don't
understand is why can't the

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.450
substitution be made right
as soon as you find--

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.760
PROFESSOR: How do I know what
I'm going to substitute?

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.590
I don't know anything
about this skeleton.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:49.550
This pattern, this matcher
is an independent unit.

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.090
OK.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:51.350
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.200
PROFESSOR: I take the matcher.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:54.170
I apply the matcher.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.532
If it matches, then it was worth
doing instantiation.

00:44:57.532 --> 00:44:58.516
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:44:58.516 --> 00:44:59.008
Yeah.

00:44:59.008 --> 00:45:00.484
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:45:00.484 --> 00:45:02.880
AUDIENCE: Can you just do that
answer again using that

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.940
example on the board?

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.390
You know, what you just passed
back to the matcher.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.900
PROFESSOR: Oh yes.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.480
OK, yes.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.660
You're looking at
this example.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.470
At this point when I'm
traversing this structure, I

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:16.630
get to here: x.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:18.760
I have some dictionary,
presumably an empty dictionary

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:22.020
at this point if this is
the whole expression.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.550
So I have an empty dictionary,
and I've matched x against 3.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.850
So now, after this point,
the dictionary

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:33.550
contains x is 3, OK?

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.290
Now, I continue walking
along here.

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.040
I see y.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.780
Now, this is a particular
x, a pattern x.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.690
I see y, a pattern y.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:48.940
The dictionary says, oh yes, the
pattern y is the symbol x

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.360
because I've got
a match there.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.380
So the dictionary now contains
at this point two entries.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:02.180
The pattern x is 3, and the
pattern y is the expression x.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.230
Now, I get that, I can
walk along further.

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:08.100
I say, oh, pattern y
also wants to be 4.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.680
But that isn't possible,
producing a failure.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:14.830
Thank you.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.080
Let's take a break.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:07.020
OK, you're seeing your first
very big and hairy program.

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:10.380
Now, of course, one of the goals
of this subsegment is to

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.440
get you to be able to read
something like this and not be

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.760
afraid of it.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.715
This one's only about
four pages of code.

00:47:16.715 --> 00:47:20.460
By the end of the subject, I
hope a 50-page program will

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.510
not look particularly
frightening.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:25.310
But I don't expect-- and I don't
want you to think that I

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.200
expect you to be getting
it as it's coming out.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.760
You're supposed to feel the
flavor of this, OK?

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.800
And then you're supposed to
think about it because it is a

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.220
big program.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.812
There's a lot of stuff
inside this program.

00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:44.400
Now, I've told you about the
language we're implementing,

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.770
the pattern match substitution
language.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.320
I showed you some rules.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.490
And I've told you about matching
and instantiation,

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.240
which are the two halves
of how a rule works.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.350
Now we have to understand the
control structure by which the

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:03.220
rules are applied to the
expressions so as to do

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.470
algebraic simplification.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:12.060
Now, that's also a big
complicated mess.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:16.450
The problem is that there is
a variety of interlocking,

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:20.140
interwoven loops, if you
will, involved in this.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.540
For one thing, I
have to apply--

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.910
I have to examine every
subexpression of my expression

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:29.070
that I'm trying to simplify.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:29.960
That we know how to do.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:34.090
It's a car cdr recursion of some
sort, or something like

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.480
that, and some sort
of tree walk.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.850
And that's going to
be happening.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:43.660
Now, for every such place, every
node that I get to in

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.270
doing my traversal of the
expression I'm trying to

00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:53.390
simplify, I want to apply
all of the rules.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:56.380
Every rule is going to
look at every node.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.750
I'm going to rotate
the rules around.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:07.530
Now, either a rule will
or will not match.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.140
If the rule does not match,
then it's not very

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.270
interesting.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.090
If the rule does match, then I'm
going to replace that node

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:20.110
in the expression by an
alternate expression.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.360
I'm actually going
to make a new

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.530
expression, which contains--

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.560
everything contains that new
value, the result of

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.950
substituting into the skeleton,
instantiating the

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.480
skeleton for that rule
at this level.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.670
But no one knows whether that
thing that I instantiated

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.180
there is in simplified form.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.690
So we're going to have to
simplify that, somehow to call

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.370
the simplifier on the thing
that I just constructed.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:48.710
And then when that's done, then
I sort of can build that

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:51.820
into the expression I
want as my answer.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.490
Now, there is a basic idea
here, which I will call a

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:57.110
garbage- in, garbage-out
simplifier.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:03.570
It's a kind of recursive
simplifier.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.750
And what happens is the way you
simplify something is that

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.660
simple objects like variables
are simple.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.110
Compound objects, well,
I don't know.

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.260
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to build up from simple

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.940
objects, trying to make simple
things by assuming that the

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.220
pieces they're made
out of are simple.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.830
That's what's happening here.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.400
Well, now, if we look
at the first slide--

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:31.965
no, overhead, overhead.

00:50:31.965 --> 00:50:35.780
If we look at the overhead, we
see a very complicated program

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.810
like we saw before for the
matcher, so complicated that

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:41.260
you can't read it like that.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.590
I just want you to get the feel
of the shape of it, and

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.880
the shape of it is that this
program has various

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.210
subprograms in it.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:57.080
One of them--this part is the
part for traversing the

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:02.560
expression, and this part is
the part for trying rules.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.490
Now, of course, we can look at
that in some more detail.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:13.370
Let's look at--let's look at the
first transparency, right?

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:17.990
The simplifier is made
out of several parts.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.500
Now, remember at the very
beginning, the simplifier is

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.100
the thing which takes a rules--a
set of rules and

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.190
produces a program which will
simplify it relative to them.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.390
So here we have our
simplifier.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:36.150
It takes a rule set.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.440
And in the context where that
rule set is defined, there are

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.260
various other definitions
that are done here.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.660
And then the result of this
simplifier procedure is, in

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.110
fact, one of the procedures
that was defined.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.400
Simplify x.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.480
What I'm returning as the
value of calling the

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.340
simplifier on a set of rules is
a procedure, the simplify x

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.680
procedure, which is defined in
that context, which is a

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.200
simplification procedure
appropriate for using those

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.450
set of rules.

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.460
That's what I have there.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:21.440
Now, the first two of these
procedures, this one and this

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.070
one, are together going to be
the recursive traversal of an

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:26.950
expression.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.680
This one is the general
simplification for any

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.620
expression, and this is the
thing which simplifies a list

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.540
of parts of an expression.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.940
Nothing more.

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:38.770
For each of those, we're going
to do something complicated,

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:40.340
which involves trying
the rules.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.700
Now, we should look at
the various parts.

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.710
Well let's look first at the
recursive traversal of an

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:48.530
expression.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:54.210
And this is done in a
sort of simple way.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:59.310
This is a little nest of
recursive procedures.

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:02.580
And what we have here
are two procedures--

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.600
one for simplifying an
expression, and one for

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.982
simplifying parts of
an expression.

00:53:08.982 --> 00:53:12.130
And the way this works
is very simple.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:16.270
If the expression I'm trying
to simplify is a compound

00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:19.920
expression, I'm going to
simplify all the parts of it.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.480
And that's calling--that
procedure, simplify parts, is

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.020
going to make up a new
expression with all the parts

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.920
simplified, which I'm then
going to try the

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.840
rules on over here.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.560
If it turns out that the
expression is not compound, if

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.990
it's simple, like just a symbol
or something like pi,

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:40.300
then in any case, I'm going to
try the rules on it because it

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.900
might be that I want in my set
of rules to expand pi to

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:48.290
3.14159265358979,
dot, dot, dot.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:49.570
But I may not.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:52.750
But there is no reason
not to do it.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:59.010
Now, if I want to simplify the
parts, well, that's easy too.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.480
Either the expression is an
empty one, there's no more

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.730
parts, in which case I have
the empty expression.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:11.460
Otherwise, I'm going to make a
new expression by cons, which

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.360
is the result of simplifying
the first part of the

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.370
expression, the car, and
simplifying the rest of the

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:21.060
expression, which is the cdr.

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.250
Now, the reason why I'm showing
you this sort of stuff

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.740
this way is because I want you
get the feeling for the

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:29.800
various patterns that are very
important when writing

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.970
programs. And this could be
written a different way.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.850
There's another way to write
simplified expressions so

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.355
there would be only
one of them.

00:54:37.355 --> 00:54:39.530
There would only be one
little procedure here.

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.540
Let me just write that on the
blackboard to give you a

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.790
feeling for that.

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:52.170
This in another idiom,
if you will.

00:54:58.449 --> 00:55:02.696
To simplify an expression
called x, what

00:55:02.696 --> 00:55:03.400
am I going to do?

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:11.100
I'm going to try the rules on
the following situation.

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.170
If--

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.090
on the following expression--

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.690
compound, just like
we had before.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:24.270
If the expression is compound,
well, what am I going to do?

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:25.970
I'm going to simplify
all the parts.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:30.950
But I already have a cdr
recursion, a common pattern of

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:33.590
usage, which has been captured
as a high-order procedure.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:36.040
It's called map.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.180
So I'll just write that here.

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:47.290
Map simplify the expression,
all the parts of the

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:49.060
expression.

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.580
This says apply the
simplification operation,

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:55.780
which is this one, every part
of the expression, and then

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:02.440
that cuts those up into a list.
It's every element of

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.254
the list which the expression is
assumed to be made out of,

00:56:06.254 --> 00:56:08.910
and otherwise, I have
the expression.

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:12.650
So I don't need the helper
procedure, simplify parts,

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:15.370
because that's really this.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.690
So sometimes, you just
write it this way.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.830
It doesn't matter very much.

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:24.410
Well, now let's take
a look at--

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:27.660
let's just look at how
you try rules.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:30.540
If you look at this slide,
we see this is a

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.680
complicated mess also.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.140
I'm trying rules on
an expression.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:38.030
It turns out the expression
I'm trying it on is some

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.490
subexpression now of the
expression I started with.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.040
Because the thing I just
arranged allowed us to try

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.290
every subexpression.

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:50.140
So now here we're taking in
a subexpression of the

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.080
expression we started with.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:52.225
That's what this is.

00:56:52.225 --> 00:56:55.670
And what we're going to define
here is a procedure called

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:58.640
scan, which is going
to try every rule.

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.920
And we're going to start it up
on the whole set of rules.

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.670
This is going to go cdr-ing down
the rules, if you will,

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.370
looking for a rule to apply.

00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:14.140
And when it finds one,
it'll do the job.

00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:17.630
Well, let's take a look at
how try rules works.

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.720
It's very simple:
the scan rules.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.066
Scan rules, the way
of scanning.

00:57:22.066 --> 00:57:23.270
Well, is it so simple?

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:25.510
It's a big program, of course.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.060
We take a bunch of rules,
which is a sublist

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.700
of the list of rules.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:33.080
We've tried some of them
already, and they've not been

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.360
appropriate, so we
get to some here.

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:36.490
We get to move to
the next one.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.600
If there are no more rules, well
then, there's nothing I

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.200
can do with this expression,
and it's simplified.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:46.790
However, if it turns out that
there are still rules to be

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:52.180
done, then let's match the
pattern of the first rule

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.280
against the expression using the
empty dictionary to start

00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.270
with and use that as
the dictionary.

00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.830
If that happens to
be a failure, try

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.080
the rest of the rules.

00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.790
That's all it says here.

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:11.080
It says discard that rule.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.640
Otherwise, well, I'm going to
get the skeleton of the first

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.890
rule, instantiate that relative
to the dictionary,

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:20.940
and simplify the result, and
that's the expression I want.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.380
So although that was a
complicated program, every

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.940
complicated program is made out
of a lot of simple pieces.

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:34.760
Now, the pattern of recursions
here is very complicated.

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.950
And one of the most important
things is not

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.126
to think about that.

00:58:38.126 --> 00:58:41.130
If you try to think about the
actual pattern by which this

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:45.250
does something, you're going
to get very confused.

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:47.420
I would.

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:51.470
This is not a matter of you
can do this with practice.

00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:53.761
These patterns are hard.

00:58:53.761 --> 00:58:55.840
But you don't have to
think about it.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.010
The key to this--

00:58:57.010 --> 00:59:00.120
it's very good programming and
very good design-- is to know

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.990
what not to think about.

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:07.540
The fact is, going back to this
slide, I don't have to

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:11.640
think about it because I have
specifications in my mind for

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.000
what simplify x does.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.735
I don't have to know
how it does it.

00:59:16.735 --> 00:59:20.720
And it may, in fact, call scan
somehow through try rules,

00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:22.190
which it does.

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.230
And somehow, I've got another
recursion going on here.

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:28.470
But since I know that simplify
x is assumed by wishful

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:31.446
thinking to produce the
simplified result, then I

00:59:31.446 --> 00:59:33.900
don't have to think
about it anymore.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.030
I've used it.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.480
I've used it in a
reasonable way.

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.468
I will get a reasonable
answer.

00:59:39.468 --> 00:59:41.760
And you have to learn how
to program that way--

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.010
with abandon.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.390
Well, there's very little
left of this thing.

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.610
All there is left is a few
details associated with what a

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.060
dictionary is.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.520
And those of you who've been
itching to know what a

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.130
dictionary is, well, I will flip
it up and not tell you

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.110
anything about it.

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.020
Dictionaries are easy.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.570
It's represented in terms of
something else called an A

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:14.730
list, which is a particular
pattern of usage for making

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.730
tables in lists.

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:17.220
They're easy.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:21.670
They're made out of pairs,
as was asked a bit ago.

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.270
And there are special procedures
for dealing with

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:27.020
such things called assq, and you
can find them in manuals.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.730
I'm not terribly excited
about it.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.710
The only interesting thing here
in extend dictionary is I

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:36.480
have to extend the dictionary
with a pattern, a datum, and a

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.910
dictionary.

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:42.896
This pattern is, in fact, at
this point a pattern variable.

01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:44.880
And what do I want to do?

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.220
I want to pull out the name of
that pattern variable, the

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:52.100
pattern variable name, and I'm
going to look up in the

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.750
dictionary and see if it
already has a value.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.030
If not, I'm going to
add a new one in.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:00.730
If it does have one, if it has a
value, then it had better be

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:03.920
equal to the one that was
already stored away.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.690
And if that's the case, the
dictionary is what I

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:06.940
expected it to be.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:11.605
Otherwise, I fail.

01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:13.430
So that's easy, too.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.940
If you open up any program,
you're going to find inside of

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:20.000
it lots of little pieces,
all of which are easy.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.340
So at this point, I suppose,
I've just told you some

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:27.995
million-dollar valuable
information.

01:01:27.995 --> 01:01:30.320
And I suppose at this point
we're pretty much done with

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.930
this program.

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:34.330
I'd like to ask about
questions.

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:35.940
AUDIENCE: Yes, can you give me
the words that describe the

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.650
specification for a simplified
expression?

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:39.475
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:01:39.475 --> 01:01:43.330
A simplified expression takes
an expression and produces a

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:44.838
simplified expression.

01:01:44.838 --> 01:01:48.120
That's it, OK?

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.212
How it does it is very easy.

01:01:51.212 --> 01:01:53.710
In compound expressions, all the
pieces are simplified, and

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.910
then the rules are tried
on the result.

01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:59.216
And for simple expressions, you
just try all the rules.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.280
AUDIENCE: So an expression
is simplified by

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.535
virtue of the rules?

01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:03.660
PROFESSOR: That's,
of course, true.

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:04.140
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.060
PROFESSOR: And the way this
works is that simplifi

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.000
expression, as you see here,
what it does is it breaks the

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.190
expression down into the
smallest pieces, simplifies

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.690
building up from the bottom
using the rules to be the

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:21.100
simplifier, to do the
manipulations, and constructs

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.400
a new expression
as the result.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.290
Eventually, one of things you
see is that the rules

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.880
themselves, the try rules, call
a simplified expression

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.280
on the results when it changes
something, the

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.830
results of a match.

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.420
I'm sorry, the results of
instantiation of a skeleton

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.900
for a rule that has matched.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.570
So the spec of a simplified
expression is that any

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.860
expression you put into it comes
out simplified according

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:49.590
to those rules.

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:50.190
Thank you.

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.860
Let's take a break.
