[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.320
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.050
You've seen that the job of
a programmer is to design

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.070
processes that accomplish
particular goals, such as

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.050
finding the square roots of
numbers or other sorts of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.830
things you might want to do.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.080
We haven't introduced
anything else yet.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.370
Of course, the way in which a
programmer does this is by

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.440
constructing spells, which are
constructed out of procedures

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.050
and expressions.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.000
And that these spells are
somehow direct a process to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.190
accomplish the goal that was
intended by the programmer.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.670
In order for the programmer to
do this effectively, he has to

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.330
understand the relationship
between the particular things

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.830
that he writes, these particular
spells, and the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.630
behavior of the process that
he's attempting to control.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.560
So what we're doing this
lecture is attempt to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.630
establish that connection in
as clear a way as possible.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.450
What we will particularly do is
understand how particular

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.300
patterns of procedures and
expressions cause particular

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.230
patterns of execution,
particular

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.050
behaviors from the processes.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.190
Let's get down to that.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.240
I'm going to start with
a very simple program.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.680
This is a program to compute
the sum of the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.630
squares of two numbers.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:45.970
And we'll define the sum of the
squares of x and y to be

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.835
the sum of the square of x--

00:01:49.835 --> 00:01:51.460
I'm going to write
it that way--

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:08.690
and the square of y where
the square of x is the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.830
product of x and x.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.670
Now, supposing I were to say
something to this, like, to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.845
the system after having defined
these things, of the

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:26.200
form, the sum of the squares of
three and four, I am hoping

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.310
that I will get out a 25.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.400
Because the square of three is
nine, and the square of four

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.900
is 16, and 25 is the
sum of those.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.720
But how does that happen?

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.730
If we're going to understand
processes and how we control

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.910
them, then we have to have a
mapping from the mechanisms of

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.540
this procedure into the way in
which these processes behave.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.380
What we're going to have is
a formal, or semi-formal,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.180
mechanical model whereby you
understand how a machine

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.920
could, in fact, in principle,
do this.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.660
Whether or not the actual
machine really does what I'm

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.860
about to tell you is completely

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.840
irrelevant at this moment.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.290
In fact, this is an engineering
model in the same

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.600
way that, electrical resistor,
we write down a model v equals

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.330
i r, it's approximately true.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.880
It's not really true.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.860
If I put up current through
the resistor it goes boom.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.410
So the voltage is not always
proportional to the current,

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.200
but for some purposes the
model is appropriate.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.640
In particular, the model we're
going to describe right now,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.770
which I call the substitution
model, is the simplest model

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.700
that we have for understanding
how procedures work and how

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.310
processes work.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.350
How procedures yield
processes.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.150
And that substitution model will
be accurate for most of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.790
the things we'll be dealing
with in the next few days.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.240
But eventually, it will become
impossible to sustain the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.060
illusion that that's the way the
machine works, and we'll

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.490
go to other more specific and
particular models that will

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.590
show more detail.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.200
OK, well, the first thing, of
course, is we say, what are

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.170
the things we have here?

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.550
We have some cryptic symbols.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.350
And these cryptic symbols
are made out of pieces.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.990
There are kinds of
expressions.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.410
So let's write down
here the kinds of

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.660
expressions there are.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.295
And we have-- and so far I
see things like numbers.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.030
I see things like symbols
like that.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.430
We have seen things before like
lambda expressions, but

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.190
they're not here.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.180
I'm going to leave them out.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.650
Lambda expressions, we'll
worry about them later.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.880
Things like definitions.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.150
Things like conditionals.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.155
And finally, things
like combinations.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.470
These kinds of expressions
are--

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.880
I'll worry about later--

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.940
these are special forms.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.670
There are particular rules
for each of these.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.950
I'm going to tell you, however,
the rules for doing a

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.120
general case.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.510
How does one evaluate
a combination?

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.820
Because, in fact, over here,
all I really have are

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.180
combinations and some
symbols and numbers.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.290
And the simple things like
a number, well, it

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.370
will evaluate to itself.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.180
In the model I will
have for you, the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.170
symbols will disappear.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.220
They won't be there at the time
when you need them, when

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.680
you need to get at them.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000
So the only thing I really have
to explain to you is, how

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.250
do we evaluate combinations?

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.340
OK, let's see.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.430
So first I want to get
the first slide.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.450
Here is the rule for evaluating
an application.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.030
What we have is a rule that
says, to evaluate a

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.530
combination, there are
two parts, three

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.740
parts to the rule.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.390
The combination has
several parts.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.630
It has operators and
it has operands.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.180
The operator returns
into a procedure.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.480
If we evaluate the operator,
we will get a procedure.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.330
And you saw, for example, how
I'll type at the machine and

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.880
out came compound procedure
something or other.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.940
And the operands produce
arguments.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.690
Once we've gotten the operator
evaluated to get a procedure,

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.050
and the argument is evaluated
to get argument--

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.550
the operand's value
to get arguments--

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.320
we apply the procedure to these
arguments by copying the

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.000
body of the procedure, which
is the expression that the

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.800
procedure is defined
in terms of.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.500
What is it supposed to do?

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.060
Substituting the argument
supplied for the formal

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.120
parameters of the procedure,
the formal parameters being

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.100
the names defined by the
declaration of the procedure.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.700
Then we evaluate the resulting
new body, the body resulting

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.350
from copying the old body with
the substitutions made.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.900
It's a very simple rule, and
we're going to do it very

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.300
formally for a little while.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.620
Because for the next few
lectures, what I want you to

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.330
do is to say, if I don't
understand something, if I

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.260
don't understand something, be
very mechanical and do this.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.360
So let's see.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.590
Let's consider a particular
evaluation, the one we were

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.550
talking about before.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.330
The sum of the squares
of three and three.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.010
What does that mean?

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.600
It says, take--

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.470
well, I could find out what's
on the square-- it's some

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.500
procedure, and I'm not going
to worry about the

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.870
representation, and I'm not
going to write it on the

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.800
blackboard for you.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.000
And I have that three represents
some number, but if

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.690
I have to repeat that number,
I can't tell you the number.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.580
The number itself is some
abstract thing.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.670
There's a numeral which
represents it, which I'll call

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.680
three, and I'll use that
in my substitution.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.880
And four is also a number.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.590
I'm going to substitute three
for x and four for y in the

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.540
body of this procedure that
you see over here.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.560
Here's the body of
the procedure.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.300
It corresponds to this

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.860
combination, which is an addition.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.210
So what that reduces to, as a
reduction step, we call it, is

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:30.450
the sum of the square of three
and the square of four.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.200
Now, what's the next step
I have to do here?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.100
I say, well, I have
to evaluate this.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.299
According to my rule, which you
just saw on that overhead

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:44.430
or slide, what we had
was that we have to

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.260
evaluate the operands--

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.220
and here are the operands,
here's one and

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.120
here's the next operand--

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.060
and how we have to evaluate
procedure.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.830
The order doesn't matter.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.810
And then we're going to apply
the procedure, which is plus,

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.830
and magically somehow that's
going to produce the answer.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.500
I'm not to open up plus
and look inside of it.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.380
However, in order to evaluate
the operand, let's pick some

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.780
arbitrary order and do them.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.540
I'm going to go from
right to left.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.530
Well, in order to evaluate
this operand, I have to

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.350
evaluate the parts of
it by the same rule.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.260
And the parts are I have to find
out what square is-- it's

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.580
some procedure, which has
a formal parameter x.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:25.510
And also, I have an operand
which is four, which I have to

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.710
substitute for x in the
body of square.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.170
So the next step is basically to
say that this is the sum of

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:40.990
the square of three and the
product of four and four.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.460
Of course, I could open up
asterisk if I liked--

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.920
the multiplication operation--

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.900
but I'm not going to do that.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.610
I'm going to consider
that primitive.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.320
And, of course, at any level of
detail, if you look inside

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.540
this machine, you're going to
find that there's multiple

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.250
levels below that that
you don't know about.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.620
But one of the things we
have to learn how to

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.520
do is ignore details.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.960
The key to understanding
complicated things is to know

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.710
what not to look at and
what not compute

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.500
and what not to think.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.380
So we're going to stop this
one here and say, oh, yes,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.510
this is the product
of two things.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.930
We're going to do it now.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.690
So this is nothing more than
the sum of the square

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.340
of three and 16.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.910
And now I have another thing I
have to evaluate, but that

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.430
square of three, well,
it's the same thing.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:36.310
That's the sum of the product
of three and three and 16,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.740
which is the sum of nine
and 16, which is 25.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.366
So now you see the basic method
of doing substitutions.

00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:54.980
And I warn you that this is not
a perfect description of

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.200
what the computer does.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.800
But it's a good enough
description for the problems

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.090
that we're going to have in the
next few lectures that you

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.220
should think about
this religiously.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.880
And this is how the machine
works for now.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.130
Later we'll get more detailed.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.500
Now, of course, I made a
specific choice of the order

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.780
of evaluation here.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.180
There are other possibilities.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.360
If we go back to the telestrator
here and look at

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.130
the substitution rule, we see
that I evaluated the operator

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.910
to get the procedures, and I
evaluated the operands to get

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.110
the arguments first, before
I do the application.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.320
It's entirely possible, and
there are alternate rules

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.570
called normal order evaluation
whereby you can do the

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:41.150
substitution of the expressions
which are the

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.760
operands for the formal
parameters

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.470
inside the body first.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.880
And you'll get also
the same answer.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.970
But right now, for concreteness,
and because this

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.780
is the way our machine really
does it, I'm going to give you

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.510
this rule, which has
a particular order.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.440
But that order is to some
extent arbitrary, too.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.110
In the long run, there are some
reasons why you might

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.920
pick one order or another,
and we'll get to that

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.170
later in the subject.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.500
OK, well now the only other
thing I have to tell you about

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.530
just to understand what's going
on is let's look at the

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.840
rule for conditionals.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.200
Conditionals are very simple,
and I'd like to examine this.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.490
A conditional is something
that is if-- there's also

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.720
cond, of course--

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.980
but I'm going to give names to
the parts of the expression.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.340
There's a predicate, which
is a thing that is

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.900
either true or false.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.920
And there's a consequent, which
is the thing you do if

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.370
the predicate is true.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.970
And there's an alternative,
which is the thing you do if

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.470
the predicate is false.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.202
It's important, by the way, to
get names for, to get names

00:13:00.202 --> 00:13:03.810
for, the parts of things, or
the parts of expressions.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.410
One of the things that every
sorcerer will tell you is if

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.350
you have the name of a spirit,
you have power over it.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.320
So you have to learn these names
so that we can discuss

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.790
these things.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.570
So here we have a predicate,
a consequent, and an

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.860
alternative.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.830
And, using such words, we see
that an if expression, the

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.160
problems you evaluate to the
predicate expression, if that

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.630
yields true, then you then go on
to evaluate the consequent.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.975
Otherwise, you evaluate the
alternative expression.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.290
So I'd like to illustrate that
now in the context of a

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.600
particular little program.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.620
Going to write down a
program which we're

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.870
going to see many times.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:58.380
This is the sum of x and y done
by what's called Peano

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.140
arithmetic, which is all we're
doing is incrementing and

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.510
decrementing.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.070
And we're going to see this
for a little bit.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.240
It's a very important program.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:12.190
If x equals zero, then
the result is y.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:17.980
Otherwise, this is the sum of
the decrement of x and the

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.590
increment of y.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.000
We're going to look at this
a lot more in the future.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.360
Let's look at the overhead.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.830
So here we have this procedure,
and we're going to

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.930
look at how we do the
substitutions, the sequence of

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.110
substitutions.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.370
Well, I'm going to try and add
together three and four.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.950
Well, using the first rule
that I showed you, we

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.230
substitute three for x and four
four y in the body of

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.980
this procedure.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.000
The body of the procedure is the
thing that begins with if

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.410
and finishes over here.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.130
So what we get is, of course,
if three is zero, then the

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.010
result is four.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.960
Otherwise, it's the sum of the
decrement of three and the

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.360
increment of four.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.330
But I'm not going to worry about
these yet because three

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.610
is not zero.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.310
So the answer is not four.

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.250
Therefore, this if reduces
to an evaluation of the

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.550
expression, the sum to the
decrement of three and the

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.860
increment of four.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.540
Continuing with my evaluation,
the increment I presume to be

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.010
primitive, and so I
get a five there.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.540
OK, and then the decrement
is also

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.090
primitive, and I get a two.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.560
And so I change the problem
into a simpler problem.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:33.480
Instead of adding three to four,
I'm adding two to five.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.380
The reason why this is a simpler
problem is because I'm

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.000
counting down on x,
and eventually,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.540
then, x will be zero.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.090
So, so much for the
substitution rule.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.240
In general, I'm not going to
write down intermediate steps

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.160
when using substitutions having
to do with ifs, because

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.520
they just expand things
to become complicated.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.940
What we will be doing is saying,
oh, yes, the sum of

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.860
three and four results in the
sum of two and five and

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.940
reduces to the sum of two and
five, which, in fact, reduces

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.240
to the sum of one and six, which
reduces to the sum of

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:14.130
zero and seven over here, which
reduces to a seven.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.550
That's what we're going
to be seeing.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.600
Are there any questions for
the first segment yet?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.942
Yes?

00:16:21.942 --> 00:16:24.858
STUDENT: You're using one
plus and minus one plus.

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:25.830
Are those primitive
operations?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.810
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.370
One of the things you're going
to be seeing in this subject

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:33.360
is I'm going to, without
thinking about it, introduce

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.180
more and more primitive
operations.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.400
There's presumably some large
library of primitive

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.830
operations somewhere.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.620
But it doesn't matter that
they're primitive--

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.860
there may be some manual
that lists them all.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.900
If I tell you what they do,
you say, oh, yes, I

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.960
know what they do.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.070
So one of them is the
decrementor--

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.500
minus one plus-- and the other
operation is increment, which

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.310
is one plus.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:53.840
Thank you.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.662
That's the end of the
first segment.

00:16:55.662 --> 00:17:19.230
[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.079
PROFESSOR: Now that we have a
reasonably mechanical way of

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:28.349
understanding how a program
made out of procedures and

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:32.390
expressions evolves a process,
I'd like to develop some

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.920
intuition about how particular
programs evolve particular

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.930
processes, what the shapes of
programs have to be in order

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.940
to get particular shaped
processes.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.110
This is a question about,
really, pre-visualizing.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.230
That's a word from
photography.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.140
I used to be interested in
photography a lot, and one of

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.140
the things you discover when
you start trying to learn

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.330
about photography is that you
say, gee, I'd like to be a

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.910
creative photographer.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:01.820
Now, I know the rules, I push
buttons, and I adjust the

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.430
aperture and things like that.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.710
But the key to being a creative
person, partly, is to

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.595
be able to do analysis
at some level.

00:18:09.595 --> 00:18:13.880
To say, how do I know what it
is that I'm going to get on

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.170
the film before I
push the button.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:23.060
Can I imagine in my mind the
resulting image very precisely

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.300
and clearly as a consequence of
the particular framing, of

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:32.620
the aperture I choose, of the
focus, and things like that?

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.755
That's part of the art of doing
this sort of thing.

00:18:35.755 --> 00:18:39.230
And learning a lot
of that involves

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.970
things like test strips.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.950
You take very simple images that
have varying degrees of

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.870
density in them, for example,
and examine what those look

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.630
like on a piece of paper when
you print them out.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.270
You find out what is the range
of contrasts that you can

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.850
actually see.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.650
And what, in a real scene,
would correspond to the

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.790
various levels and zones
that you have of

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.440
density in an image.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.410
Well, today I want to look at
some very particular test

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:12.000
strips, and I suppose one of
them I see here is up on the

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.880
telestrator, so we should
switch to that.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.350
There's a very important, very
important pair of programs for

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:24.500
understanding what's going on in
the evolution of a process

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.320
by the execution of a program.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.090
What we have here are
two procedures

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.340
that are almost identical.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.440
Almost no difference between
them at all.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.860
It's a few characters that
distinguish them.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.140
These are two ways of adding
numbers together.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:48.660
The first one, which you see
here, the first one is the sum

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.880
of two numbers-- just
what we did before--

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.580
is, if the first one is
zero, it's the answer

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.600
of the second one.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.480
Otherwise, it's the sum of the
decrement of the first and the

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.960
increment of the second.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:04.480
And you may think of that
as having two piles.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.280
And the way I'm adding these
numbers together to make a

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.560
third pile is by moving marbles
from one to the other.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.640
Nothing more than that.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.520
And eventually, when I run
out of one, then the

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.650
other is the sum.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:20.690
However, the second procedure
here doesn't do it that way.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.960
It says if the first number
is zero, then the

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.330
answer is the second.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.550
Otherwise, it's the increment of
the sum of the decrement of

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.360
the first number
and the second.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.930
So what this says is add
together the decrement of the

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:38.870
first number and the second-- a
simpler problem, no doubt--

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.190
and then change that result
to increment it.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.900
And so this means that if you
think about this in terms of

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.320
piles, it means I'm holding
in my hand the

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.120
things to be added later.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.990
And then I'm going
to add them in.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.710
As I slowly decrease one pile to
zero, I've got what's left

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.330
here, and then I'm going
to add them back.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.360
Two different ways of adding.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.270
The nice thing about these two
programs is that they're

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.580
almost identical.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.530
The only thing is where
I put the increment.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.860
A couple of characters
moved around.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.370
Now I want to understand the
kind of behavior we're going

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.650
to get from each of
these programs.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.670
Just to get them firmly
in your mind--

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.120
I usually don't want to
be this careful--

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.490
but just to get them firmly in
your mind, I'm going to write

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.155
the programs again on the
blackboard, and then I'm going

00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:28.150
to evolve a process.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.350
And you're going to
see what happens.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.910
We're going to look at the
shape of the process as a

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.390
consequence of the program.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:44.170
So the program we started with
is this: the sum of x and y

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:51.160
says if x is zero, then
the result is y.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.090
Otherwise, it's the sum of the
decrement of x and the

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.630
increment of y.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:05.600
Now, supposing we wish to do
this addition of three and

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.900
four, the sum of three and
four, well, what is that?

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.580
It says that I have to
substitute the arguments for

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.750
the formal parameters
in the body.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.940
I'm doing that in my mind.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.670
And I say, oh, yes, three is
substituted for x, but three

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:28.650
is not zero, so I'm going to go
directly to this part and

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.710
write down the simplified
consequent here.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.420
Because I'm really interested
in the behavior of addition.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.400
Well, what is that?

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.460
That therefore turns into
the sum of two and five.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.750
In other words, I've reduced
this problem to this problem.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.820
Then I reduce this problem to
the sum of one and six, and

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.290
then, going around again
once, I get the

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.390
sum of zero and seven.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.870
And that's one where x equals
zero so the result is y, and

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.260
so I write down here a seven.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.790
So this is the behavior of the
process evolved by trying to

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.410
add together three and four
with this program.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:20.060
For the other program, which
is over here, I will define

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.376
the sum of x and y.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:24.626
And what is it?

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.100
If x is zero, then the result
is y-- almost the same--

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.200
otherwise the increment
of the sum of the

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.550
decrement of x and y.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.020
No.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.490
I don't have my balancer
in front of me.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.060
OK, well, let's do it now.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.560
The sum of three and four.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.660
Well, this is actually a little
more interesting.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:07.820
Of course, three is not zero as
before, so that results in

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.920
the increment of the sum of the
decrement of x, which is

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:19.470
two and four, which is
the increment of

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.240
the sum of one and--

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.000
whoops: the increment
of the increment.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.040
What I have to do now is compute
what this means.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.310
I have to evaluate this.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.160
Or what that is, the result of
substituting two and four for

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.690
x and y here.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:40.420
But that is the increment
of the sum of one

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.810
and four, which is--

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:47.820
well, now I have
to expand this.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:52.520
Ah, but that's the increment
of the increment of the

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.520
increment of the sum
of zero and four.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.190
Ah, but now I'm beginning
to find things I can do.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.430
The increment of the increment
of the increment of-- well,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.850
the sum of zero and
four is four.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.235
The increment of four is five.

00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:20.760
So this is the increment of the
increment of five, which

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:26.112
is the increment of six,
which is seven.

00:25:26.112 --> 00:25:29.960
Two different ways of
computing sums.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.430
Now, let's see.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.250
These processes have very
different shapes.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.760
I want you to feel
these shapes.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.740
It's the feeling for the
shapes that matters.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.000
What's some things we
can see about this?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.650
Well, somehow this is
sort of straight.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.750
It goes this way-- straight.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:54.130
This right edge doesn't vary
particularly in size.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.610
Whereas this one, I see that
this thing gets bigger and

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.860
then it gets smaller.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.110
So I don't know what
that means yet,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.080
but what are we seeing?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.170
We're seeing here that somehow
these increments are expanding

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.070
out and then contracting back.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.470
I'm building up a bunch
of them to do later.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.960
I can't do them now.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.770
There's things to be deferred.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.000
Well, let's see.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.830
I can imagine an abstract
machine.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.680
There's some physical machine,
perhaps, that could be built

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.260
to do it, which, in fact,
executes these programs

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.730
exactly as I tell you,
substituting character strings

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.540
in like this.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.910
Such a machine, the number of
such steps is an approximation

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.040
of the amount of
time it takes.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.290
So this way is time.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.890
And the width of the thing is
how much I have to remember in

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.150
order to continue the process.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.400
And this much is space.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.800
And what we see here is a
process that takes a time

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.710
which is proportional
to the argument x.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.030
Because if I made x larger
by one, then I'd

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.280
had an extra line.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.080
So this is a process which
is space-- sorry--

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.640
time.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.630
The time of this process is
what we say order of x.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:24.390
That means it is proportional
to x by some constant of

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:26.430
proportionality, and I'm not
particularly interested in

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.580
what the constant is.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.360
The other thing we see here is
that the amount of space this

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.150
takes up is constant, it's
proportional to one.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:42.070
So the space complexity of
this is order of one.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.180
We have a name for
such a process.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.950
Such a process is called
an iteration.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.390
And what matters here is not
that some particular machine I

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.590
designed here and talked to
you about and called a

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:00.240
substitution machine
or whatever--

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.480
substitution model--

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.550
managed to do this in
constant space.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.140
What really matters is this
tells us a bound.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.680
Any machine could do this
in constant space.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.275
This algorithm represented by
this procedure is executable

00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:15.250
in constant space.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.330
Now, of course, the model is
ignoring some things, standard

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.120
sorts of things.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.390
Like numbers that are bigger
take up more space and so on.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.990
But that's a level of
abstraction at which I'm

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.360
cutting off.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.290
How do you represent numbers?

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.090
I'm considering every number
to be the same size.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.540
And numbers grow slowly for the
amount of space they take

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.240
up and their size.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.000
Now, this algorithm is different
in its complexity.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.850
As we can see here, this
algorithm has a time

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:48.220
complexity which is also
proportional to the input

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.460
argument x.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.640
That's because if I were to add
one to three, if I made a

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.620
larger problem, which is larger
by one here, then I'd

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.670
add a line at the top and I'd
add a line at the bottom.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.300
And the fact that it's a
constant amount, like this is

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.420
twice as many lines as that,
is not interesting at the

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.030
level of detail I'm talking
about right now.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:13.020
So this is a time complexity
order of the input argument x.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:18.500
And space complexity, well,
this is more interesting.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.130
I happen to have some overhead,
which you see over

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.670
here, which is constant
approximately.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.620
Constant overhead.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.240
But then I have something which
increases and decreases

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.950
and is proportional to
the input argument x.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.350
The input argument x is three.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.590
That's why there are three
deferred increments sitting

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.700
around here.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.720
See?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.060
So the space complexity
here is also order x.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.835
And this kind of process, named
for the kind of process,

00:29:44.835 --> 00:29:46.085
this is a recursion.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:56.020
A linear recursion, I will call
it, because of the fact

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.920
that it's proportional to
the input argument in

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.170
both time and space.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.225
This could have been
a linear iteration.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.740
So then what's the essence
of this matter?

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.100
This matter isn't so obvious.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.320
Maybe there are other models by
which we can describe the

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.780
differences between iterative
and recursive processes.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.520
Because this is hard now.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.975
Remember, we have-- those are
both recursive definitions.

00:30:27.975 --> 00:30:32.020
What we're seeing there are both
recursive definitions,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.170
definitions that refer to the
thing being defined in the

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.330
definition.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.770
But they lead to different
shape processes.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:42.220
There's nothing special about
the fact that the definition

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:46.140
is recursive that leads to
a recursive process.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.770
OK.

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.210
Let's think of another model.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.940
I'm going to talk to you
about bureaucracy.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.730
Bureaucracy is sort
of interesting.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:31:00.076
Here we see on a slide
an iteration.

00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:04.220
An iteration is sort of
a fun kind of process.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.150
Imagine that there's a
fellow called GJS--

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.140
that stands for me--

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.180
and he's got a problem:
he wants to add

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.240
together three and four.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.176
This fella here wants to add
together three and four.

00:31:16.176 --> 00:31:18.850
Well, the way he's going to do
it-- he's lazy-- is he's going

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.420
to find somebody else
to help him do it.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.340
They way he finds someone
else to--

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.300
he finds someone else to help
him do it and says, well, give

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.715
me the answer to three
and four and return

00:31:26.715 --> 00:31:28.040
the result to me.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.040
He makes a little piece of paper
and says, here, here's a

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.140
piece of paper-- you go ahead
and solve this problem and

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:35.310
give the result back to me.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.370
And this guy, of course,
is lazy, too.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.310
He doesn't want to see this
piece of paper again.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:46.550
He says, oh, yes, produce a new
problem, which is the sum

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.420
of two ad five, and return
the result back to GJS.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.290
I don't want to see it again.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:56.130
This guy does not want to
see this piece of paper.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.070
And then this fellow makes a
new problem, which is the

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.120
addition of the sum of one and
six, and he give it to this

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.440
fella and says, produce that
answer and returned it to GJS.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.160
And that produces a problem,
which is to add together zero

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.190
and seven, and give
the result to GJS.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.500
This fella finally just says,
oh, yeah, the answer is seven,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.480
and sends it back to GJS.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.160
That's what an iteration is.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.680
By contrast, a recursion
is a slightly

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.930
different kind of process.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.520
This one involves more
bureaucracy.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.150
It keeps more people busy.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.680
It keeps more people employed.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.850
Perhaps it's better
for that reason.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.570
But here it is: I want
the answer to the

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.860
problem three and four.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.780
So I make a piece of paper that
says, give the result

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.260
back to me.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.670
Give it to this fella.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:48.050
This fellow says, oh, yes, I
will remember that I have to

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.260
add later, and I want to get
the answer the problem two

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.980
plus four, give that one to
Harry, and have the results

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.710
sent back to me--

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.830
I'm Joe.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.800
When the answer comes back from
Harry, which is a six, I

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:07.600
will then do the increment and
give that seven back to GJS.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.240
So there are more pieces of
paper outstanding in the

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.600
recursive process than
the iteration.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.850
There's another way to think
about what an iteration is and

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.780
the difference between an
iteration and a recursion.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:27.090
You see, the question is, how
much stuff is under the table?

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.650
If I were to stop--

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:32.250
supposing I were to kill this
computer right now, OK?

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:37.040
And at this point I lose the
state of affairs, well, I

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.340
could continue the computation
from this point but everything

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.860
I need to continue the
computation is in the

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.050
valuables that were defined
in the procedure that the

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.300
programmer wrote for me.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.080
An iteration is a system that
has all of its state in

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.330
explicit variables.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:01.290
Whereas the recursion is
not quite the same.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:05.820
If I were to lose this pile of
junk over here, and all I was

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.070
left with was the sum of one
and four, that's not enough

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:10.719
information to continue the
process of computing out the

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.880
seven from the original problem
of adding together

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.870
three of four.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:20.570
Besides the information that's
in the variables of the formal

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.190
parameters of the program,
there is also information

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.360
under the table belonging to
the computer, which is what

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.440
things have been deferred
for later.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.500
And, of course, there's a
physical analogy to this,

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.300
which is in differential
equations, for example, when

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.300
we talk about something
like drawing a circle.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.920
Try to draw a circle, you make
that out of a differential

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:51.940
equation which says the change
in my state as a function of

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.190
my current state.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.830
So if my current state
corresponds to particular

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.020
values of y and x, then I can
compute from them a derivative

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.480
which says how the state
must change.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.470
And, in fact, you can see this
was a circle because if I

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:15.330
happen to be, say, at this place
over here, at one, zero,

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:20.950
for example, on this graph,
then it means that the

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.620
derivative of y is x, which
we see over here.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:26.140
That's one, so I'm going up.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.075
And the derivative of
x is minus y, which

00:35:29.075 --> 00:35:31.510
means I'm going backwards.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.580
I'm actually doing nothing at
this point, then I start going

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:37.920
backwards as y increases.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.090
So that's how you
make a circle.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:43.960
And the interesting thing to see
is a little program that

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.400
will draw a circle
by this method.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.675
Actually, this won't draw a
circle because it's a forward

00:35:47.675 --> 00:35:49.230
oil or integrator and
will eventually

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.090
spiral out and all that.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.200
But it'll draw a circle
for a while

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.240
before it starts spiraling.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.050
However, what we see here is two
state variables, x and y.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:01.120
And there's an iteration that
says, in order to circle,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.920
given an x and y, what I want
is to circle with the next

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.260
values of x and y being the old
value of x decrement by y

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:14.140
times dt where dt is the time
step and the old value of y

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:17.560
being implemented by x times dt,
giving me the new values

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.810
of x and y.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.360
So now you have a feeling for
at least two different kinds

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.900
of processes that can
be evolved by

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.150
almost the same program.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.630
And with a little bit of
perturbation analysis like

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:37.320
this, how you change a program
a little bit and see how the

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.940
process changes, that's how
we get some intuition.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.320
Pretty soon we're going to use
that intuition to build big,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.700
hairy, complicated systems.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.627
Thank you.

00:36:47.627 --> 00:37:06.513
[MUSIC PLAYING BY J.S. BACH]

00:37:06.513 --> 00:37:09.100
PROFESSOR: Well, you've just
seen a simple perturbational

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.920
analysis of some programs.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.640
I took a program that was very
similar to another program and

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.540
looked at them both and saw how
they evolved processes.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.580
I want to show you some variety
by showing you some

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.660
other processes and shapes
they may have.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.890
Again, we're going to take very
simple things, programs

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.070
that you wouldn't want
to ever write.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.565
They would be probably the worst
way of computing some of

00:37:32.565 --> 00:37:34.080
the things we're going
to compute.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.040
But I'm just going to show you
these things for the purpose

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:42.750
of feeling out how to program
represents itself as the rule

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.486
for the evolution
of a process.

00:37:46.486 --> 00:37:50.770
So let's consider a fun thing,
the Fibonacci numbers.

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.340
You probably know about
the Fibonacci numbers.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.740
Somebody, I can't remember who,
was interested in the

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.035
growth of piles of rabbits.

00:38:00.035 --> 00:38:03.670
And for some reason or other,
the piles of rabbits tend to

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.870
grow exponentially,
as we know.

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:09.700
And we have a nice model for
this process, is that we start

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.750
with two numbers,
zero and one.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.000
And then every number
after this is the

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.040
sum of the two previous.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.240
So we have here a one.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.760
Then the sum of these
two is two.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.570
The sum of those two is three.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.465
The sum of those two is five.

00:38:26.465 --> 00:38:28.640
The sum of those two is eight.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.650
The sum of those two is 13.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.800
This is 21.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.940
34.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.160
55.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.640
Et cetera.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.170
If we start numbering these
numbers, say this is the

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.280
zeroth one, the first one, the
second one, the third one, the

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.780
fourth one, et cetera.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.850
This is the 10th one, the
10th Fibonacci number.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.980
These numbers grow very fast.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.010
Just like rabbits.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.750
Why rabbits grow this way I'm
not going to hazard a guess.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.550
Now, I'm going to try to write
for you the very simplest

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:05.740
program that computes
Fibonacci numbers.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.375
What I want is a program that,
given an n, will produce for

00:39:13.375 --> 00:39:14.625
me Fibonacci event.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.470
OK?

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.080
I'll write it right here.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.275
I want the Fibonacci of n, which
means the-- this is the

00:39:33.275 --> 00:39:36.066
n, and this is Fibonacci of n.

00:39:36.066 --> 00:39:38.160
And here's the story.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:45.330
If n is less than two,
then the result is n.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.260
Because that's what these are.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.090
That's how you start it up.

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:58.870
Otherwise, the result is the sum
of Fib of n minus one and

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.344
the Fibonacci number,
n minus two.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.620
So this is a very simple, direct
specification of the

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.765
description of Fibonacci numbers
that I gave you when I

00:40:16.765 --> 00:40:18.460
introduced those numbers.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.670
It represents the recurrence
relation in the simplest

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.650
possible way.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.920
Now, how do we use
such a thing?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.230
Let's draw this process.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.610
Let's figure out
what this does.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.620
Let's consider something very
simple by computing

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.870
Fibonacci of four.

00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:39.070
To compute Fibonacci of
four, what do I do?

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.080
Well, it says I have--

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.070
it's not less than two.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.500
Therefore it's the sum
of two things.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.430
Well, in order to compute that
I have to compute, then,

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:52.860
Fibonacci of three and
Fibonacci of two.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.940
In order to compute Fibonacci
of three, I have to compute

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.340
Fibonacci of two and
Fibonacci of one.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.730
In order to compute Fibonacci
of two, I have to compute

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.090
Fibonacci of one and
Fibonacci of zero.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.380
In order to compute Fibonacci
of one, well,

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.010
the answer is one.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:26.070
That's from the base case
of this recursion.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.923
And in order to compute
Fibonacci of one, well, that

00:41:28.923 --> 00:41:30.480
answer is zero, from
the same base.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:33.200
And here is a one.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.238
And Fibonacci of two is really
the sum of Fibonacci of one.

00:41:38.238 --> 00:41:43.023
And Fib of zero, in order to
compute that, I get a one, and

00:41:43.023 --> 00:41:44.273
here I've got a zero.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.310
I've built a tree.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.700
Now, we can observe some
things about this tree.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.340
We can see why this is an
extremely bad way to compute

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.420
Fibonacci numbers.

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.960
Because in order to compute
Fibonacci of four, I had to

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.045
compute Fibonacci of two's
sub-tree twice.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:10.326
In fact, in order way to add one
more, supposing I want to

00:42:10.326 --> 00:42:13.940
do Fibonacci of five, what I
really have to do then is

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.100
compute Fibonacci of four
plus Fibonacci of three.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.990
But Fibonacci of three's
sub-tree has

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.240
already been built.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.700
This is a prescription
for a process that's

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.570
exponential in time.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.740
To add one, I have to multiply
by something because I take a

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.350
proportion of the existing thing
and add it to itself to

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:39.880
add one more step.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:48.270
So this is a thing whose time
complexity is order of--

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.520
actually, it turns out
to be Fibonacci--

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.770
of n.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:01.130
There's a thing that grows
exactly at Fibonacci numbers.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.620
It's a horrible thing.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.640
You wouldn't want to do it.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.170
The reason why the time has to
grow that way is because we're

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.110
presuming in the model--

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.220
the substitution model that I
gave you, which I'm not doing

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:14.130
formally here, I sort of now
spit it out in a simple way--

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:17.880
but presuming that everything
is done sequentially.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.810
That every one of these
nodes in this

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.350
tree has to be examined.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.350
And so since the number of
nodes in this tree grows

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.960
exponentially, because I add a
proportion of the existing

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.820
nodes to the nodes I already
have to add one, then I know

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.860
I've got an exponential
explosion here.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.610
Now, let's see if we can
think of how much

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:41.860
space this takes up.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.140
Well, it's not so bad.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.020
It depends on how much we have
to remember in order to

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:50.220
continue this thing running.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.650
Well, that's not so hard.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.815
It says, gee, in order to know
where I am in this tree, I

00:43:54.815 --> 00:43:56.760
have to have a path
back to the root.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.210
In other words, in order to--
let's consider the path I

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.795
would have to execute this.

00:44:00.795 --> 00:44:03.190
I'd say, oh, yes, I'm going
to go down here.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.950
I don't care which
direction I go.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.265
I have to do this.

00:44:06.265 --> 00:44:06.935
I have to then do this.

00:44:06.935 --> 00:44:09.300
I have to traverse this tree
in a sort of funny way.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.290
I'm going to walk this
nice little path.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:15.740
I come back to here.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.050
Well, I've got to remember where
I'm going to be next.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.110
I've got to keep that in mind.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:21.240
So I have to know
what I've done.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.740
I have to know what's left.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.756
In order to compute Fibonacci
of four, at some point I'm

00:44:26.756 --> 00:44:28.580
going to have to be down here.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.170
And I have to remember that I
have to go back and then go

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:33.750
back to here to do
an addition.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.200
And then go back to here to do
an addition to something I

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.060
haven't touched yet.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.390
The amount of space that
takes up is the

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.800
path, the longest path.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.920
How long it is.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.360
And that grows as n.

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.550
So the space--

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.040
because that's the length
of the deepest

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.660
line through the tree--

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.210
the space is order of n.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.460
It's a pretty bad process.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.930
Now, one thing I want to see
from this is a feeling of

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.660
what's going on here.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.460
Why are there--

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.712
how is this program related
to this process?

00:45:20.712 --> 00:45:22.150
Well, what are we seeing here?

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:25.110
There really are only
two sorts of things

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.460
this program does.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.950
This program consists of
two rules, if you will.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:36.100
One rule that says Fibonacci of
n is this sum that you see

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.120
over here, which is a node
that's shaped like this.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.165
It says that I break up
something into two parts.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.640
Under some condition over here
that n is greater than two,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.880
then the node breaks
up into two parts.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.920
Less than two.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.390
No.

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.704
Greater than two.

00:46:00.704 --> 00:46:01.830
Yes.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.700
The other possibility is
that I have a reduction

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.950
that looks like this.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.950
And that's this case.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:14.470
If it's less than two, the
answer is n itself.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.990
So what we're seeing here is
that the process that got

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:22.210
built locally at every place is
an instance of this rule.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.130
Here's one instance
of the rule.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.350
Here is another instance
of the rule.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.460
And the reason why people think
of programming as being

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.230
hard, of course, is because
you're writing down a general

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:37.310
rule, which is going to be used
for lots of instances,

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.710
that a particular instance--

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:43.900
it's going to control each
particular instance for you.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.820
You've got to write down
something that's a general in

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.400
terms of variables, and you
have to think of all the

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.640
things that could possibly fit
in those variables, and all

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.600
those have to lead to the
process you want to work.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.770
Locally, you have to break up
your process into things that

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.490
can be represented in
terms of these very

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.740
specific local rules.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.030
Well, let's see.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:08.190
Fibonaccis are, of course,
not much fun.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.180
Yes, they are.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.820
You get something called the
golden ratio, and we may even

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.420
see a lot of that some time.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.840
Well, let's talk about
another thing.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.310
There's a famous game called the
Towers of Hanoi, because I

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:24.170
want to teach you how to think
about these recursively.

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:29.700
The problem is this one: I have
a bunch of disks, I have

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.130
a bunch of spikes, and it's
rumored that somewhere in the

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:38.420
Orient there is a 64-high tower,
and the job of various

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:41.320
monks or something is to move
these spikes in some

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:43.860
complicated pattern
so eventually--

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.220
these disks--

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.450
so eventually I moved all
of the disks from one

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.555
spike to the other.

00:47:50.555 --> 00:47:54.000
And if it's 64 high, and it's
going to take two to the 64th

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.746
moves, then it's a long time.

00:47:57.746 --> 00:48:03.820
They claim that the universe
ends when this is done.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.630
Well, let's see.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.830
The way in which you would
construct a recursive process

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.990
is by wishful thinking.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:14.600
You have to believe.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.610
So, the idea.

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.360
Supposing I want to move this
pile from here to here, from

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:25.400
spike one to spike two, well,
that's not so hard.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.470
See, supposing somehow, by some
magic-- because I've got

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.310
a simpler problem--

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:31.240
I move a three-high
pile to here--

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.070
I can only move one
disk at a time, so

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.900
identifying how I did it.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.910
But supposing I could do that,
well, then I could just pick

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:41.500
up this disk and move it here.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.980
And now I have a
simple problem.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.110
I have to move a three-high
tower to

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.220
here, which is no problem.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:48.860
So by two moves of a three high
tower plus one move of a

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:53.140
single object, I can move the
tower from here to here.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.530
Now, whether or not--

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:02.730
this is not obvious in any
deep way that this works.

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.300
And why?

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.320
Now, why is it the case that I
can presume, maybe, that I can

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.570
move the three-high tower?

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:14.550
Well, the answer is because I'm
always counting down, and

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:16.840
eventually I get down to
zero-high tower, and a

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.070
zero-high tower requires
no moves.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:24.060
So let's write the algorithm
for that.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.670
Very easy.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.260
I'm going to label these towers
with numbers, but it

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:31.120
doesn't matter what they're
labelled with.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.020
And the problem is to move an
n-high tower from a spike

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.785
called From to a spike called
To with a particular spike

00:49:37.785 --> 00:49:39.968
called Spare.

00:49:39.968 --> 00:49:41.414
That's what we're going to do.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.070
Using the algorithm I informally
described to you,

00:49:53.070 --> 00:50:02.532
move of a n-high tower from
From to To with a Spare.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:11.540
Well, I've got two cases, and
this is a case analysis, just

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.840
like it is in all the other
things we've done.

00:50:20.285 --> 00:50:23.160
If n is zero, then--

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.600
I'm going to put out
some answers--

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.870
Done, we'll say.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.530
I don't know what that means.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.200
Because we'll never use that
answer for anything.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.350
We're going to do these moves.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.640
Else.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.890
I'm going to do a move.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.495
Move a tower of height
less than n, the

00:50:44.495 --> 00:50:48.140
decrement of n height.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:51.030
Now, I'm going to move it
to the Spare tower.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:55.220
The whole idea now is to move
this from here to here, to the

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.550
Spare tower-- so from
From to Spare--

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.700
using To as a spare tower.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:14.680
Later, somewhere later, I'm
going to move that same n-high

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.340
tower, after I've done this.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.650
Going to move that same n minus
one-high tower from the

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:24.750
Spare tower to the To
tower using the

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.380
From tower as my spare.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:40.410
So the Spare tower to
the To tower using

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:44.225
the From as the spare.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.670
All I have to do now is when
I've gotten it in this

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:56.600
condition, between these two
moves of a whole tower--

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.950
I've got it into that
condition--

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:03.100
now I just have to
move one disk.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.543
So I'm going to say that some
things are printing a move and

00:52:04.543 --> 00:52:05.793
I don't care how it works.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.660
From the To.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.410
Now, you see the reason why I'm
bringing this up at this

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:24.800
moment is this is an almost
identical program to this one

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.980
in some sense.

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.810
It's not computing the same
mathematical quantity, it's

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:34.620
not exactly the same tree, but
it's going to produce a tree.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:38.760
The general way of making these
moves is going to lead

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.760
to an exponential tree.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.060
Well, let's do this four-high.

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:50.660
I have my little crib sheet here
otherwise I get confused.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.320
Well, what I'm going to put in
is the question of move a

00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:10.080
tower of height four from one to
spike two using spike three

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.980
as a spare.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.190
That's all I'm really
going to do.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:15.550
You know, let's just do it.

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:17.140
I'm not going to worry
about writing out

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:17.950
the traits of this.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:21.950
You can do that yourself because
it's very simple.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:26.680
I'm going to move disk
one to disk three.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.760
And how do I get to move
disk one to disk three?

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.530
How do I know that?

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:32.790
Well, I suppose I have to look
at the trace a little bit.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:33.810
What am I doing here?

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.560
Well, and this is not--
n is not zero.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.650
So I'm going to look
down here.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:41.000
This is going to require
doing two moves.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.320
I'm only going to look
at the first one.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.570
It's going to require moving--

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.010
why do I have move tower?

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:52.910
It makes it harder
for me to move.

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:59.950
I'm going to move a three-high
tower from the from place,

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:04.750
which is four, to the
spare, which is two,

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:07.940
using three as my--

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:15.220
no, using from--

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:15.988
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:54:15.988 --> 00:54:16.944
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:16.944 --> 00:54:18.370
I'm sorry.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:19.710
From two--

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:26.230
from one to three using
two as my spare.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.520
That's right.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:32.940
And then there's another move
over here afterwards.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.790
So now I say, oh, yes, that
requires me moving a two-high

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:42.950
tower from one to two using
three as a spare.

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.760
And so, are the same, and that's
going to require me

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:52.470
moving and one-high tower
from one to three

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:53.720
using two as a spare.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.720
Well, and then there's lots of
other things to be done.

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:09.265
So I move my one-high tower from
one to three using two as

00:55:09.265 --> 00:55:11.490
a spare, which I didn't
do anything with.

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:15.570
Well, this thing just proceeds
very simply.

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:17.652
I move this from one to two.

00:55:17.652 --> 00:55:21.500
And I move this disk
from three to two.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.060
And I don't really want
to do it, but I

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.310
move from one to three.

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:29.390
Then I move two to one.

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.150
Then I move two to three.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:36.310
Then one to three.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.620
One to two.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:41.390
Three to two.

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.055
Three to one.

00:55:44.055 --> 00:55:46.380
This all got worked out
beforehand, of course.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.090
Two to one.

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.810
Three to two.

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.950
One to three.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.176
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:55:54.176 --> 00:55:55.650
PROFESSOR: Oh, one to three.

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:55.823
Excuse me.

00:55:55.823 --> 00:55:56.460
Thank you.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.020
One to two.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.850
And then three to two.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.100
Whew.

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:07.920
Now what I'd like you to think
about, you just saw a

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:09.920
recursive algorithm for doing
this, and it takes exponential

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:11.040
time, of course.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.530
Now, I don't know if there's
any algorithm that doesn't

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.820
take exponential time--
it has to.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.320
As I'm doing one operation--

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.890
I can only move one
thing at a time--

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:18.590
there's no algorithm
that's not going to

00:56:18.590 --> 00:56:20.570
take exponential time.

00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:24.420
But can you write an iterative
algorithm rather than a

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:25.670
recursive algorithm
for doing this?

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.700
One of the sort of little things
I like to think about.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:38.970
Can you write one that, in
fact, doesn't break this

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:41.510
problem into two sub-problems
the way I described, but

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:45.250
rather proceeds a step at a time
using a more local rule?

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.660
That might be fun.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:52.025
Thank you so much for
the third segment.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.910
Are there questions?

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.670
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] a way to
reduce a tree or recursion

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:06.970
problem, how do you save the
immediate work you have done

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:08.985
in computing the Fibonacci
number?

00:57:08.985 --> 00:57:12.760
PROFESSOR: Oh, well, in fact,
one of the ways to do is what

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.890
you just said.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:16.480
You said, I save the
intermediate work.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:16.960
OK?

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.310
Well, let me tell you--

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:21.010
this, again, we'll see later--

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:24.710
but suppose it's the case that
anytime I compute anything,

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:28.240
any one of these Fibonacci
numbers, I remember the table

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.790
that takes only linear time
to look up the answer.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:35.180
Then if I ever see it again,
instead of doing the

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:37.050
expansional tree,
I look it up.

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:39.820
I've just transformed my problem
into a problem that's

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.380
much simpler.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.380
Now, of course, there are the
way to do this, as well.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.240
That one's called memoization,
and you'll see it sometime

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.280
later in this term.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.890
But I suppose there's a very
simple linear time, and, in

00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:57.110
fact, iterative model for
computing Fibonaccis, and

00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.320
that's another thing you should
sit down and work out.

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:01.340
That's important.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:05.560
It's important to see
how to do this.

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.310
I want you to practice.
