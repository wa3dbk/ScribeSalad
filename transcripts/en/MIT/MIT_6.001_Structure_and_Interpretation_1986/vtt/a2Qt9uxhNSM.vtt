00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.230
PROFESSOR: Well, last time Gerry
really let the cat out

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
of the bag.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.350
He introduced the idea
of assignment.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.405
Assignment and state.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.500
And as we started to see, the
implications of introducing

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.860
assignment and state into the
language are absolutely

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.350
frightening.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.240
First of all, the substitution
model of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.865
evaluation breaks down.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:52.210
And we have to use this much
more complicated environment

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.780
model and this very mechanistic
thing with

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.530
diagrams, even to say what
statements in the programming

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.130
language mean.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.260
And that's not a mere
technical point.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.090
See, it's not that we had this
particular substitution model

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.200
and, well, it doesn't quite
work, so we have to do

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.870
something else.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.730
It's that nothing like the
substitution model can work.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.950
Because suddenly, a variable
is not just something that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.080
stands for a value.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.390
A variable now has to somehow
specify a place

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.630
that holds a value.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.885
And the value that's in
that place can change.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.110
Or for instance, an expression
like f of x might have a side

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.410
effect in it.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.160
So if we say f of x and it has
some value, and then later we

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.890
say f of x again, we might
get a different value

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.730
depending on the order.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.780
So suddenly, we have to think
not only about values but

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.030
about time.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.070
And then things like pairs are
no longer just their CARs and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.520
their CDRs.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.310
A pair now is not quite its CAR
and its CDR. It's rather

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.449
its identity.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.650
So a pair has identity.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.900
It's an object.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.280
And two pairs that have the same
CAR and CDR might be the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.650
same or different, because
suddenly we have to worry

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.900
about sharing.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.910
So all of these things enter
as soon as we introduce

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.480
assignment.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.340
See, this is a really far cry
from where we started with

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.400
substitution.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.420
It's a technically harder way
of looking at things because

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.710
we have to think more
mechanistically about our

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.540
programming language.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.960
We can't just think about
it as mathematics.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.860
It's philosophically harder,
because suddenly there are all

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.020
these funny issues about what
does it mean that something

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.050
changes or that two things
are the same.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.910
And also, it's programming
harder, because as Gerry

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.070
showed last time, there are all
these bugs having to do

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.420
with bad sequencing and aliasing
that just don't exist

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.210
in a language where we don't
worry about objects.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.635
Well, how'd we get
into this mess?

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:27.500
Remember what we did, the reason
we got into this is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.750
because we were looking to
build modular systems. We

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.250
wanted to build systems that
fall apart into chunks that

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.760
seem natural.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.260
So for instance, we want to take
a random number generator

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.660
and package up the state of that
random number generator

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.840
inside of it so that we can
separate the idea of picking

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.640
random numbers from the general
Monte Carlo strategy

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.740
of estimating something and
separate that from the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.060
particular way that you work
with random numbers in that

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.980
formula developed by
Cesaro for pi.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.400
And similarly, when we go off
and construct some models of

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.440
things, if we go off and model
a system that we see in the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.050
real world, we'd like our
program to break into natural

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.310
pieces, pieces that mirror the
parts of the system that we

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.900
see in the real world.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.780
So for example, if we look at
a digital circuit, we say,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.910
gee, there's a circuit and
it has a piece and

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.160
it has another piece.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.580
And these different pieces
sort of have identity.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.550
They have state.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.580
And the state sits
on these wires.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.020
And we think of this piece as
an object that's different

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.610
from that as an object.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.400
And when we watch the system
change, we think about a

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.500
signal coming in here and
changing a state that might be

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.860
here and going here and
interacting with a state that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.170
might be stored there,
and so on and so on.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.760
So what we'd like is we'd like
to build in the computer

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.340
systems that fall into pieces
that mirror our view of

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.870
reality, of the way that the
actual systems we're modeling

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.365
seem to fall into pieces.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:28.970
Well, maybe the reason that
building systems like this

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.600
seems to introduce such
technical complications has

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.610
nothing to do with computers.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.960
See, maybe the real reason that
we pay such a price to

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.910
write programs that mirror our
view of reality is that we

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.550
have the wrong view
of reality.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.460
See, maybe time is just
an illusion, and

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.150
nothing ever changes.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.910
See, for example, if I take this
chalk, and we say, gee,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.820
this is an object and
it has a state.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.710
At each moment it has a position
and a velocity.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.240
And if we do something,
that state can change.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.900
But if you studied any
relativity, for instance, you

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.760
know that you don't think of
the path of that chalk as

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.340
something that goes on
instant by instant.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.870
It's more insightful to think
of that whole chalk's

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.020
existence as a path
in space-time.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.040
that's all splayed out.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.840
There aren't individual
positions and velocities.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.640
There's just its unchanging
existence in space-time.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.080
Similarly, if we look at this
electrical system, if we

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.450
imagine this electrical system
is implementing some sort of

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.730
signal processing system, the
signal processing engineer who

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.010
put that thing together doesn't
think of it as, well,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.490
at each instance there's
a voltage coming in.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.340
And that translates
into something.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.400
And that affects the state over
here, which changes the

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.810
state over here.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.060
Nobody putting together a
signal processing system

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.420
thinks about it like that.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.830
Instead, you say there's
this signal that's

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.060
splayed out over time.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.100
And if this is acting as a
filter, this whole thing

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:09.570
transforms this whole thing for
some sort of other output.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.790
You don't think of it as what's
happening instant by

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.160
instant as the state
of these things.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.990
And somehow you think of this
box as a whole thing, not as

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.980
little pieces sending messages
of state to each other at

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.230
particular instants.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.130
Well, today we're going to
look at another way to

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.260
decompose systems that's more
like the signal processing

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.050
engineer's view of the world
than it is like thinking about

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.130
objects that communicate
sending messages.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.310
That's called stream
processing.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:08:01.790
And we're going to start by
showing how we can make our

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:08.550
programs more uniform and see
a lot more commonality if we

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.490
throw out of these programs
what you might say is an

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.210
inordinate concern with
worrying about time.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.910
Let me start by comparing
two procedures.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.690
The first one does this.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.770
We imagine that there's
a tree.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.179
Say there's a tree
of integers.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.429
It's a binary tree.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.230
So it looks like this.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.990
And there's integers in
each of the nodes.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:51.000
And what we would like to
compute is for each odd number

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.210
sitting here, we'd like to find
the square and then sum

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.210
up all those squares.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.480
Well, that should be a familiar
kind of thing.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.930
There's a recursive strategy
for doing it.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.880
We look at each leaf, and
either it's going to

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.690
contribute the square of
the number if it's odd

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.680
or 0 if it's even.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.280
And then recursively, we can say
at each tree, the sum of

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.330
all of them is the sum coming
from the right branch and the

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.640
left branch, and recursively
down through the nodes.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.360
And that's a familiar way of
thinking about programming.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.960
Let's actually look at
that on the slide.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.960
We say to sum the odd squares
in a tree, well, there's a

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.520
test. Either it's a leaf node,
and we're going to check to

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.710
see if it's an integer, and then
either it's odd, in which

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.160
we take the square,
or else it's 0.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.260
And then the sum of the whole
thing is the sum coming from

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.120
the left branch and
the right branch.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.560
OK, well, let me contrast that
with a second problem.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.810
Suppose I give you an integer
n, and then some function to

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:59.270
compute of the first of each
integer in 1 through n.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.810
And then I want to collect
together in a list all those

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.600
function values that satisfy
some property.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.880
That's a general
kind of thing.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.750
Let's say to be specific, let's
imagine that for each

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.270
integer, k, we're
going to compute

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.210
the k Fibonacci number.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.550
And then we'll see which of
those are odd and assemble

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.050
those into a list.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.710
So here's a procedure
that does that.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.240
Find the odd Fibonacci numbers
among the first n.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.910
And here is a standard loop the
way we've been writing it.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.800
This is a recursion.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.740
It's a loop on k, and says if
k is bigger than n, it's the

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.990
empty list. Otherwise we compute
the k-th Fibonacci

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.370
number, call that f.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.180
If it's odd, we CONS it on
to the list starting

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.690
with the next one.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.390
And otherwise, we just
take the next one.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.000
And this is the standard
way we've been

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
writing iterative loops.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.600
And we start off calling
that loop with 1.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.600
OK, so there are
two procedures.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.900
Those procedures look
very different.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.390
They have very different
structures.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.740
Yet from a certain point of
view, those procedures are

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.330
really doing very much
the same thing.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.930
So if I was talking like a
signal processing engineer,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:25.730
what I might say is that the
first procedure enumerates the

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.980
leaves of a tree.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.510
And then we can think of a
signal coming out of that,

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.330
which is all the leaves.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:43.970
We'll filter them to see which
ones are odd, put them through

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.190
some kind of filter.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.000
We'll then put them through
a kind of transducer.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.420
And for each one of those
things, we'll take the square.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.290
And then we'll accumulate
all of those.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.570
We'll accumulate them by
sticking them together with

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.340
addition starting from 0.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.210
That's the first program.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.620
The second program, I can
describe in a very, very

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:11.780
similar way.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:17.450
I'll say, we'll enumerate the
numbers on this interval, for

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.080
the interval 1 through n.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.080
We'll, for each one, compute the
Fibonacci number, put them

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.270
through a transducer.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.780
We'll then take the result
of that, and we'll

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.976
filter it for oddness.

00:12:35.976 --> 00:12:39.350
And then we'll take those and
put them into an accumulator.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.730
This time we'll build up a list,
so we'll accumulate with

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:47.110
CONS starting from
the empty list.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.940
So this way of looking at the
program makes the two seem

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:51.900
very, very similar.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.880
The problem is that that
commonality is completely

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.050
obscured when we look at the
procedures we wrote.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.670
Let's go back and look at some
odd squares again, and say

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.300
things like, where's
the enumerator?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.140
Where's the enumerator
in this program?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.230
Well, it's not in one place.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.990
It's a little bit in this
leaf-node test,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.160
which is going to stop.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.380
It's a little bit in the
recursive structure of the

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.630
thing itself.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.120
Where's the accumulator?

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.680
The accumulator isn't
in one place either.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:32.180
It's partly in this 0 and
partly in this plus.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.510
It's not there as a thing
that we can look at.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:40.550
Similarly, if we look at odd
Fibs, that's also, in some

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.940
sense, an enumerator and
an accumulator, but

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.470
it looks very different.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:49.260
Because partly, the enumerator
is here in this greater than

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.100
sign in the test. And partly
it's in this whole recursive

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.680
structure in the loop, and
the way that we call it.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.100
And then similarly, that's also
mixed up in there with

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.010
the accumulator, which is partly
over there and partly

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.600
over there.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.790
So these very, very natural
pieces, these very natural

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.770
boxes here don't appear in our
programs. Because they're kind

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.360
of mixed up.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.290
The programs don't chop things
up in the right way.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.240
Going back to this fundamental
principle of computer science

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.620
that in order to control
something, you need the name

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.820
of it, we don't really have
control over thinking about

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.500
things this way because we don't
have our hands in them

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.060
explicitly.

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.510
We don't have a good language
for talking about them.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:42.850
Well, let's invent an
appropriate language in which

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.515
we can build these pieces.

00:14:44.515 --> 00:14:48.650
The key to the language is these
guys, is what is these

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:50.480
things I called signals?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.070
What are these things that
are flying on the

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.320
arrows between the boxes?

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.840
Well, those things are going to
be data structures called

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.770
streams. That's going
to be the key to

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.980
inventing this language.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.600
What's a stream?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.820
Well, a stream is, like
anything else, a data

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.220
abstraction.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.000
So I should tell you what
its selectors and

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.870
constructors are.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.185
For a stream, we're going to
have one constructor that's

00:15:20.185 --> 00:15:21.435
called CONS-stream.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.060
CONS-stream is going to put two
things together to form a

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.040
thing called a stream.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.250
And then to extract things from
the stream, we're going

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.010
to have a selector called
the head of the stream.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.340
So if I have a stream, I
can take its head or I

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.720
can take its tail.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.290
And remember, I have to tell you
George's contract here to

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:53.160
tell you what the axioms
are that relate these.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:16:04.080
And it's going to be for any
x and y, if I form the

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:11.420
CONS-stream and take the head,
the head of CONS-stream of x

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:26.590
and y is going to be x and the
tail of CONS-stream of x and y

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.440
is going to be y.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.180
So those are the constructor,
two selectors for

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.750
streams, and an axiom.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:36.980
There's something fishy here.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.060
So you might notice that these
are exactly the axioms for

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.100
CONS, CAR, and CDR. If instead
of writing CONS-stream I wrote

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.810
CONS and I said head was the
CAR and tail was the CDR,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.810
those are exactly the
axioms for pairs.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.130
And in fact, there's
another thing here.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:02.930
We're going to have a thing
called the-empty-stream, which

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.319
is like the-empty-list.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.030
So why am I introducing
this terminology?

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.780
Why don't I just keep talking
about pairs and lists?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.510
Well, we'll see.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.440
For now, if you like, why don't
you just pretend that

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.560
streams really are just a
terminology for lists.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.890
And we'll see in a little while
why we want to keep this

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.150
extra abstraction layer and
not just call them lists.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.860
OK, now that we have streams, we
can start constructing the

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.990
pieces of the language to
operate on streams. And there

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.330
are a whole bunch of very useful
things that we could

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.120
start making.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:54.850
For instance, we'll make our map
box to take a stream, s,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:18:00.400
and a procedure, and to generate
a new stream which

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.640
has as its elements the
procedure applied to all the

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.666
successive elements of s.

00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:07.400
In fact, we've seen
this before.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.950
This is the procedure map
that we did with lists.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.000
And you see it's exactly map,
except we're testing for

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.650
empty-stream.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.560
Oh, I forgot to mention that.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.420
Empty-stream is like the null
test. So if it's empty, we

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.510
generate the empty stream.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.700
Otherwise, we form a new stream
whose first element is

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.950
the procedure applied to the
head of the stream, and whose

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.570
rest is gotten by mapping along
with the procedure down

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.140
the tail of the stream.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.920
So that looks exactly like
the map procedure

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.030
we looked at before.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.350
Here's another useful thing.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.460
Filter, this is our
filter box.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.890
We're going to have a predicate
and a stream.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.720
We're going to make a new stream
that consists of all

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.310
the elements of the
original one

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.160
that satisfy the predicate.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.270
That's case analysis.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.140
When there's nothing
in the stream, we

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.280
return the empty stream.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.060
We test the predicate on
the head of the stream.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.520
And if it's true, we add the
head of the stream onto the

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.220
result of filtering the
tail of the stream.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.870
And otherwise, if that predicate
was false, we just

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.500
filter the tail of the stream.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.595
Right, so there's filter.

00:19:16.595 --> 00:19:18.560
Let me run through a couple
more rather quickly.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.880
They're all in the book and
you can look at them.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.110
Let me just flash through.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.260
Here's accumulate.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:27.690
Accumulate takes a way of
combining things and an

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.560
initial value in a stream and
sticks them all together.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.970
If the stream's empty, it's
just the initial value.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.930
Otherwise, we combine the head
of the stream with the result

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.550
of accumulating the tail of the
stream starting from the

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.900
initial value.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.830
So that's what I'd use to add
up everything in the stream.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.830
I'd accumulate with plus.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.060
How would I enumerate the
leaves of a tree?

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:54.530
Well, if the tree is just a leaf
itself, I make something

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.640
which only has that
node in it.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.100
Otherwise, I append together the
stuff of enumerating the

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.340
left branch and the
right branch.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.130
And then append here is like the
ordinary append on lists.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.850
You can look at that.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.410
That's analogous to the
ordinary procedure for

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.150
appending two lists.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.810
How would I enumerate
an interval?

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.500
This will take two integers, low
and high, and generate a

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.106
stream of the integers going
from low to high.

00:20:28.106 --> 00:20:31.890
And we can make a whole
bunch of pieces.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.860
So that's a little language of
talking about streams. Once we

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.670
have streams, we can build
things for manipulating them.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.200
Again, we're making
a language.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.270
And now we can start expressing

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.060
things in this language.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.590
Here's our original procedure
for summing the odd

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.310
squares in a tree.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.210
And you'll notice it looks
exactly now like the block

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.590
diagram, like the signal
processing block diagram.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:21:00.230
So to sum the odd squares in a
tree, we enumerate the leaves

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.320
of the tree.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.830
We filter that for oddness.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.220
We map that for squareness.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.460
And we accumulate the result
of that using addition,

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.760
starting from 0.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.290
So we can see the pieces
that we wanted.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:22.050
Similarly, the Fibonacci one,
how do we get the odd Fibs?

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.900
Well, we enumerate the interval
from 1 to n, we map

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.920
along that, computing the
Fibonacci of each one.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.810
We filter the result of
those for oddness.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.460
And we accumulate all of that
stuff using CONS starting from

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:43.650
the empty-list.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.680
OK, what's the advantage
of this?

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.260
Well, for one thing, we now have
pieces that we can start

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.880
mixing and matching.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.230
So for instance, if I wanted to
change this, if I wanted to

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.400
compute the squares of the
integers and then filter them,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.810
all I need to do is pick up a
standard piece like this in

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.210
that square and put it in.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.150
Or if we wanted to do this whole
Fibonacci computation on

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.980
the leaves of a tree rather than
a sequence, all I need to

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:18.030
do is replace this enumerator
with that one.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.650
See, the advantage of this
stream processing is that

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.995
we're establishing--

00:22:21.995 --> 00:22:25.330
this is one of the big themes
of the course--

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:35.570
we're establishing conventional
interfaces that

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.130
allow us to glue things
together.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:41.730
Things like map and filter are
a standard set of components

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.900
that we can start using for
pasting together programs in

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.750
all sorts of ways.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:50.090
It allows us to see the
commonality of programs.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.390
I just ought to mention, I've
only showed you two

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.860
procedures.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.800
But let me emphasize that this
way of putting things together

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.780
with maps, filters,
and accumulators

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.410
is very, very general.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:08.010
It's the generate and test
paradigm for programs. And as

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.970
an example of that, Richard
Waters, who was at MIT when he

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.060
was a graduate student, as part
of his thesis research

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.700
went and analyzed a large chunk
of the IBM scientific

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:22.340
subroutine library, and
discovered that about 60% of

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.830
the programs in it could be
expressed exactly in terms

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.940
using no more than what
we've put here--

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.710
map, filter, and accumulate.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.960
All right, let's take a break.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.870
Questions?

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.033
AUDIENCE: It seems like the
essence of this whole thing is

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:45.980
just that you have a very
uniform, simple data structure

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.380
to work with, the stream.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:48.920
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.670
The essence is that you, again,
it's this sense of

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.710
conventional interfaces.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.610
So you can start putting a
lot of things together.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:59.830
And the stream is as you say,
the uniform data structure

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.890
that supports that.

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.600
This is very much like
APL, by the way.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.330
APL is very much the same idea,
except in APL, instead

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.560
of this stream, you have
arrays and vectors.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.565
And a lot of the power of APL is
exactly the same reason of

00:24:13.565 --> 00:24:14.815
the power of this.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.910
OK, thank you.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.160
Let's take a break.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.610
All right.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:25:02.830
We've been looking at ways of
organizing computations using

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:07.560
streams. What I want to do now
is just show you two somewhat

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.810
more complicated examples
of that.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.000
Let's start by thinking about
the following kind of utility

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.810
procedure that will
come in useful.

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.960
Suppose I've got a stream.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.730
And the elements of this stream
are themselves streams.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.530
So the first thing
might be 1, 2, 3.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.880
So I've got a stream.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:40.100
And each element of the stream
is itself a stream.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.580
And what I'd like to do is build
a stream that collects

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.870
together all of the elements,
pulls all of the elements out

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.840
of these sub-streams and
strings them all

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.080
together in one thing.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.220
So just to show you the use of
this language, how easy it is,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:56.960
call that flatten.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:13.020
And I can define to flatten this
stream of streams. Well,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:13.960
what is that?

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.240
That's just an accumulation.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:25.240
I want to accumulate
using append, by

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.450
successively appending.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:36.590
So I accumulate using append
streams, starting with

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:54.370
the-empty-stream down that
stream of streams.

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:58.290
OK, so there's an example of how
you can start using these

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.830
higher order things to do some
interesting operations.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.230
In fact, there's another
useful thing

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.100
that I want to do.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:18.700
I want to define a procedure
called flat-map, flat map of

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.840
some function and a stream.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.920
And what this is going
to do is f will

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.720
be a stream of elements.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.930
f is going to be a function that
for each element in the

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.950
stream produces another
stream.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.950
And what I want to do is take
all of the elements and all of

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.000
those streams and combine
them together.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:51.350
So that's just going to be the
flatten of map f down s.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.290
Each time I apply f to an
element of s, I get a stream.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.690
If I map it all the way down, I
get a stream of streams, and

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.385
I'll flatten that.

00:27:58.385 --> 00:28:04.670
Well, I want to use that to
show you a new way to do a

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.360
familiar kind of problem.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.310
The problem's going to be like a
lot of problems you've seen,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:14.190
although maybe not this
particular one.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.490
I'm going to give you
an integer, n.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:31.020
And the problem is going to be
find all pairs and integers i

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:42.740
and j, between 0 and i, with j
less than i, up to n, such

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:51.910
that i plus j is prime.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.520
So for example, if n equals 6,
let's make a little table

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:06.640
here, i and j and i plus j.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:15.520
So for, say, i equals 2 and
j equals 1, I'd get 3.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.940
And for i equals 3, I could
have j equals 2, and that

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.210
would be 5.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:28.400
And 4 and 1 would be 5 and so
on, up until i goes to 6.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.640
And what I'd like to return is
to produce a stream of all the

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.350
triples like this, let's
say i, j, and i plus j.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.530
So for each n, I want to
generate this stream.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.680
OK, well, that's easy.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.230
Let's build it up.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.150
We start like this.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:55.510
We're going to say for
each i, we're going

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.440
to generate a stream.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.830
For each i in the interval 1
through n, we're going to

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.660
generate a stream.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.230
What's that stream
going to be?

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:04.180
We're going to start by
generating all the pairs.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:11.840
So for each i, we're going to
generate, for each j in the

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.450
interval 1 to i minus 1, we'll
generate the pair, or the list

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.710
with two elements i and j.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:30.712
So we map along the interval,
generating the pairs.

00:30:30.712 --> 00:30:33.170
And for each i, that generates
a stream of pairs.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.590
And we flatmap it.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.390
Now we have all the pairs
i and j, such that i

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.730
is less than j.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.850
So that builds that.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.990
Now we're got to test them.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.160
Well, we take that thing we just
built, the flatmap, and

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.090
we filter it to see
whether the i--

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.660
see, we had an i and a j.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.180
i was the first thing in the
list, j was the second thing

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:59.030
in the list. So we have a
predicate which says in that

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.870
list of two elements
is the sum of the

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.070
CAR and the CDR prime.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:06.540
And we filter that collection
of pairs we just built.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.420
So those are the
pairs we want.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.340
Now we go ahead and we take the
result of that filter and

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:19.610
we map along it, generating the
list i and j and i plus j.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.910
And that's our procedure
prime-sum-pairs.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.480
And then just to flash it up,
here's the whole procedure.

00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:30.750
A map, a filter, a flatmap.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.350
There's the whole thing,
even though this isn't

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.120
particularly readable.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.000
It's just expanding
that flatmap.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.090
So there's an example which
illustrates the general point

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.350
that nested loops in this
procedure start looking like

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.370
compositions of flatmaps of
flatmaps of flatmaps of maps

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.200
and things.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.900
So not only can we enumerate
individual things, but by

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.890
using flatmaps, we can do what
would correspond to nested

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.230
loops in most other languages.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.870
Of course, it's pretty awful to
keep writing these flatmaps

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.410
of flatmaps of flatmaps.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:13.830
Prime-sum-pairs you saw looked
fairly complicated, even

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.480
though the individual
pieces were easy.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.800
So what you can do, if you
like, is introduced some

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.040
syntactic sugar that's
called collect.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.570
And collect is just an
abbreviation for that nest of

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.160
flatmaps and filters arranged
in that particular way.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.620
Here's prime-sum-pairs again,
written using collect.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.670
It says to find all those pairs,
I'm going to collect

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:40.910
together a result, which is the
list i, j, and i plus j,

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:44.510
that's going to be generated as
i runs through the interval

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:51.440
from 1 to n and as j runs
through the interval from 1 to

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:58.040
i minus 1, such that
i plus j is prime.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.690
So I'm not going to say what
collect does in general.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.420
You can look at that by looking
at it in the book.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.010
But pretty much, you can see
that the pieces of this are

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.820
the pieces of that original
procedure I wrote.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.550
And this collect is just some
syntactic sugar for

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.310
automatically generating that
nest of flatmaps and flatmaps.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:21.120
OK, well, let me do one more
example that shows you the

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.120
same kind of thing.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.740
Here's a very famous problem
that's used to illustrate a

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.980
lot of so-called backtracking
computer algorithms. This is

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.200
the eight queens problem.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.370
This is a chess board.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.570
And the eight queens problem
says, find a way to put down

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.660
eight queens on a chess board
so that no two are attacking

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.000
each other.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.685
And here's a particular
solution to the

00:33:39.685 --> 00:33:41.430
eight queens problem.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.450
So I have to make sure to put
down queens so that no two are

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.570
in the same row or the
same column or sit

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.410
along the same diagonal.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:56.400
Now, there's sort of a standard
way of doing that.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.200
Well, first we need
to do is below the

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.940
surface, at George's level.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.340
We have to find some way to
represent a board, and

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:08.095
represent positions.

00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:09.800
And we'll not worry
about that.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.540
But let's assume that there's
a predicate called safe.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.090
And what safe is going to do is
going to say given that I

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.520
have a bunch of queens down on
the chess board, is it OK to

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.400
put a queen in this
particular spot?

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:32.889
So safe is going to take
a row and a column.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.510
That's going to be a place where
I'm going to try and put

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:42.370
down the next queen, and
the rest of positions.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.679
And what safe will say is given
that I already have

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:53.920
queens down in these positions,
is it safe to put

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.300
another queen down in that
row and that column?

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.360
And let's not worry
about that.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.380
That's George's problem. and
it's not hard to write.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:06.350
You just have to check whether
this thing contains any things

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:10.530
on that row or that column
or in that diagonal.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.590
Now, how would you organize
the program given that?

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.010
And there's sort of a
traditional way to organize it

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.116
called backtracking.

00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:27.570
And it says, well, let's think
about all the ways of putting

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.290
the first queen down in
the first column.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:32.580
There are eight ways.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.880
Well, let's say try
the first column.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.300
Try column 1, row 1.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:41.300
These branches are going to
represent the possibilities at

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.360
each level.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.875
So I'll try and put a queen
down in the first column.

00:35:45.875 --> 00:35:48.360
And now given that it's in the
first column, I'll try and put

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.980
the next queen down in
the first column.

00:35:53.035 --> 00:35:55.470
I'll try and put the first
queen, the one in the first

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:56.920
column, down in the first row.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.050
I'm sorry.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.780
And then given that, we'll
put the next queen down

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:01.390
in the first row.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.090
And that's no good.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.200
So I'll back up to here.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.280
And I'll say, oh, can I put the
first queen down in the

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.510
second row?

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.550
Well, that's no good.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.760
Oh, can I put it down
in the third row?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.790
Well, that's good.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.290
Well, now can I put the
next queen down

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:15.380
in the first column?

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.030
Well, I can't visualize this
chess board anymore, but I

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.195
think that's right.

00:36:19.195 --> 00:36:20.450
And I try the next one.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.170
And at each place, I go as far
down this tree as I can.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.640
And I back up.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.970
If I get down to here and find
no possibilities below there,

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.740
I back all the way up to here,
and now start again generating

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.260
this sub-tree.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.050
And I sort of walk around.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.870
And finally, if I ever manage to
get all the way down, I've

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.090
found a solution.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:45.020
So that's a typical sort of
paradigm that's used a lot in

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.930
AI programming.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.300
It's called backtracking
search.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:03.860
And it's really unnecessary.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.550
You saw me get confused when I
was visualizing this thing.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.550
And you see the complication.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.760
This is a complicated
thing to say.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.390
Why is it complicated?

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:16.190
Its because somehow this program
is too inordinately

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.580
concerned with time.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.200
It's too much--

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.670
I try this one, and I try this
one, and I go back to the last

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:22.320
possibility.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.340
And that's a complicated
thing.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.590
If I stop worrying about time
so much, then there's a much

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.200
simpler way to describe this.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:40.320
It says, let's imagine that I
have in my hands the tree down

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.400
to k minus 1 levels.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:50.670
See, suppose I had in my hands
all possible ways to put down

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.560
queens in the first k columns.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.610
Suppose I just had that.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.070
Let's not worry about
how we get it.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.200
Well, then, how do
I extend that?

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.420
How do I find all possible ways
to put down queens in the

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.480
next column?

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.620
It's really easy.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:12.210
For each of these positions I
have, I think about putting

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:16.160
down a queen in each row
to make the next thing.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.930
And then for each one I put
down, I filter those by the

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.080
ones that are safe.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.190
So instead of thinking about
this tree as generated step by

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.860
step, suppose I had
it all there.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.990
And to extend it from level k
minus 1 to level k, I just

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:36.840
need to extend each thing in
all possible ways and only

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.800
keep the ones that are safe.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.300
And that will give me
the tree to level k.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.675
And that's a recursive strategy
for solving the eight

00:38:41.675 --> 00:38:44.530
queens problem.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.780
All right, well, let's
look at it.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.360
To solve the eight queens
problem on a board of some

00:38:54.360 --> 00:39:00.390
specified size, we write
a sub-procedure called

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.030
fill-columns.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.050
Fill-columns is going to
put down queens up

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:06.086
through column k.

00:39:06.086 --> 00:39:07.700
And here's the pattern
of the recursion.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.990
I'm going to call fill-columns
with the size eventually.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.630
So fill-columns says how to put
down queens safely in the

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.255
first k columns of this chess
board with a size number of

00:39:19.255 --> 00:39:20.360
rows in it.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.946
If k is equal to 0, well,
then I don't have to

00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:23.940
put anything down.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.710
So my solution is just
an empty chess board.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.070
Otherwise, I'm going
to do some stuff.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.522
And I'm going to use collect.

00:39:30.522 --> 00:39:31.772
And here's the collect.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:40.590
I find all ways to put
down queens in the

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.910
first k minus 1 columns.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:43.320
And this was just
what I set for.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:48.880
Imagine I have this tree down
to k minus 1 levels.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:53.230
And then I find all ways of
trying a row, that's just each

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.130
of the possible rows.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:58.040
They're size rows, so that's
enumerate interval.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:03.950
And now what I do is I collect
together the new row I'm going

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.950
to try and column k with
the rest of the queens.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.200
I adjoin a position.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.290
This is George's problem.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.640
An adjoined position
is like safe.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.530
It's a thing that takes a row
and a column and the rest of

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:19.660
the positions and makes a
new position collection.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:26.230
So I adjoin a position of a new
row and a new column to

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.310
the rest of the queens, where
the rest of the queens runs

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.870
through all possible ways
of solving the problem

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.620
in k minus 1 columns.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.730
And the new row runs through all
possible rows such that it

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.240
was safe to put one there.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:46.500
And that's the whole program.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.840
There's the whole procedure.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.990
Not only that, that doesn't just
solve the eight queens

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:56.010
problem, it gives you
all solutions to the

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:56.680
eight queens problem.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.480
When you're done, you
have a stream.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.650
And the elements of that stream
are all possible ways

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:01.900
of solving that problem.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.260
Why is that simpler?

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:10.170
Well, we threw away the whole
idea that this is some process

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.720
that happens in time
with state.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.420
And we just said it's a whole
collection of stuff.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.260
And that's why it's simpler.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.110
We've changed our view.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.820
Remember, that's where
we started today.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:26.230
We've changed our view of what
it is we're trying to model.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:30.570
we stop modeling things that
evolve in time and have steps

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:31.750
and have state.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.990
And instead, we're trying to
model this global thing like

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.950
the whole flight of the
chalk, rather than its

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.750
state at each instant.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.000
Any questions?

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:46.190
AUDIENCE: It looks to me like
backtracking would be

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.970
searching for the first solution
it can find, whereas

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:54.030
this recursive search would be
looking for all solutions.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:58.090
And it seems that if you have a
large enough area to search,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:01.360
that the second is going
to become impossible.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.610
PROFESSOR: OK, the answer to
that question is the whole

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.570
rest of this lecture.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.540
It's exactly the
right question.

00:42:13.522 --> 00:42:15.540
And without trying to anticipate
the lecture too

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.910
much, you should start being
suspicious at this point, and

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:22.220
exactly those kinds
of suspicions.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.830
It's wonderful, but isn't it
so terribly inefficient?

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.100
That's where we're going.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.020
So I won't answer now, but
I'll answer later.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.600
OK, let's take a break.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:35.600
Well, by now you should be
starting to get suspicious.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.450
See, I've showed your this
simple, elegant way of putting

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.440
programs together, very unlike
these other traditional

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:50.490
programs that sum the odd
squares or compute the odd

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.740
Fibonacci numbers.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.080
Very unlike these programs that
mix up the enumerator and

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.440
the filter and the
accumulator.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.770
And by mixing it up, we don't
have all of these wonderful

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.990
conceptual advantages of these
streams pieces, these

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.840
wonderful mix and match
components for putting

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.800
together lots and lots
of programs.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.810
On the other hand, most of the
programs you've seen look like

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.340
these ugly ones.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.460
Why's that?

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.705
Can it possibly be that computer
scientists are so

00:44:23.705 --> 00:44:28.370
obtuse that they don't notice
that if you'd merely did this

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:33.620
thing, then you can get this
great programming elegance?

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.760
There's got to be a catch.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.510
And it's actually pretty easy
to see what the catch is.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.030
Let's think about the
following problem.

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:47.510
Suppose I tell you to find the
second prime between 10,000

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.020
and 1 million, or if your
computer's larger, say between

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.105
10,000 and 100 billion,
or something.

00:44:54.105 --> 00:44:55.550
And you say, oh, that's easy.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.080
I can do that with a stream.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.530
All I do is I enumerate
the interval

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:04.160
from 10,000 to 1 million.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.800
So I get all those integers
from 10,000 to 1 million.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.520
I filter them for prime-ness, so
test all of them and see if

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.762
they're prime.

00:45:11.762 --> 00:45:13.170
And I take the second element.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.130
That's the head of the tail.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:17.380
Well, that's clearly
pretty ridiculous.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.620
We'd not even have room in the
machine to store the integers

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.040
in the first place, much
less to test them.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.810
And then I only want
the second one.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:36.500
See, the power of this
traditional programming style

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.860
is exactly its weakness, that
we're mixing up the

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:45.090
enumerating and the testing
and the accumulating.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.670
So we don't do it all.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:52.580
So the very thing that makes
it conceptually ugly is the

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.210
very thing that makes
it efficient.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.800
It's this mixing up.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.840
So it seems that all I've done
this morning so far is just

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.420
confuse you.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.930
I showed you this wonderful
way that programming might

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.840
work, except that it doesn't.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.040
Well, here's where the wonderful
thing happens.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.210
It turns out in this game that
we really can have our cake

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.870
and eat it too.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:20.280
And what I mean by that is
that we really can write

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:24.210
stream programs exactly like the
ones I wrote and arrange

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.830
things so that when the machine
actually runs, it's as

00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.690
efficient as running this
traditional programming style

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:36.310
that mixes up the generation
and the test.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:40.770
Well, that sounds
pretty magic.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.690
The key to this is that
streams are not lists.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.070
We'll see this carefully in a
second, but for now, let's

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.115
take a look at that
slide again.

00:46:52.115 --> 00:46:55.060
The image you should have here
of this signal processing

00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:00.940
system is that what's going to
happen is there's this box

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.360
that has the integers
sitting in it.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.680
And there's this filter that's
connected to it and it's

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.940
tugging on them.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.680
And then there's someone who's
tugging on this stuff saying

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.790
what comes out of the filter.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.630
And the image you should have
is that someone says, well,

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.590
what's the first prime, and
tugs on this filter.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:28.020
And the filter tugs
on the integers.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.830
And you look only at that much,
and then say, oh, I

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:30.930
really wanted the second one.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:33.710
What's the second prime?

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.730
And that no computation gets
done except when you tug on

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:40.500
these things.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.410
Let me try that again.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.815
This is a little device.

00:47:43.815 --> 00:47:46.400
This is a little stream machine
invented by Eric

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.830
Grimson who's been teaching
this course at MIT.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:52.940
And the image is here's a stream
of stuff, like a whole

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.780
bunch of the integers.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.700
And here's some processing
elements.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.600
And if, say, it's filter of
filter of map, or something.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.760
And if I really tried to
implement that with streams as

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.520
lists, what I'd say is, well,
I've got this list of things,

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.670
and now I do the first filter.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.070
So do all this processing.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:18.570
And I take this and I process
and I process and I process

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.610
and I process.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.910
And now I'm got this
new stream.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:24.070
Now I take that result
in my hand someplace.

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:25.260
And I put that through
the second one.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.110
And I process the whole thing.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.510
And there's this new stream.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.230
And then I take the result and
I put it all the way through

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.360
this one the same way.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.760
That's what would happen to
these stream programs if

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.860
streams were just lists.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.065
But in fact, streams aren't
lists, they're streams. And

00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:47.240
the image you should have
is something a little

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.230
bit more like this.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:55.880
I've got these gadgets connected
up by this data

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.130
that's flowing out of them.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:04.190
And here's my original source
of the streams. It might be

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.980
starting to generate
the integers.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:07.580
And now, what happens
if I want a result?

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:10.200
I tug on the end here.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.090
And this element says, gee,
I need some more data.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.830
So this one comes here
and tugs on that one.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.890
And it says, gee, I need
some more data.

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:19.960
And this one tugs on this
thing, which might be a

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:21.640
filter, and says, gee, I
need some more data.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.755
And only as much of this thing
at the end here gets generated

00:49:24.755 --> 00:49:25.780
as I tugged.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.030
And only as much of this stuff
goes through the processing

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.760
units as I'm pulling
on the end I need.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.720
That's the image you should have
of the difference between

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:36.580
implementing what we're actually
going to do and if

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.830
streams were lists.

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.430
Well, how do we make
this thing?

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:43.400
I hope you have the image.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.947
The trick is how to make it.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:52.080
We want to arrange for a stream
to be a data structure

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.670
that computes itself
incrementally, an on-demand

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:56.920
data structure.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.700
And the basic idea is, again,
one of the very basic ideas

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.490
that we're seeing throughout
the whole course.

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.440
And that is that there's not
a firm distinction between

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.240
programs and data.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.260
So what a stream is going to be
is simultaneously this data

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.270
structure that you think of,
like the stream of the leaves

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:16.810
of this tree.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.880
But at the same time, it's
going to be a very clever

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.550
procedure that has the method
of computing in it.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.930
Well, let me try this.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.460
It's going to turn out that we
don't need any more mechanism.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.150
We already have everything we
need simply from the fact that

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:32.770
we know how to handle
procedures

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.460
as first-class objects.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.880
Well, let's go back
to the key.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.030
The key is, remember, we
had these operations.

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:48.080
CONS-stream and head and tail.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.580
When I started, I said you can
think about this as CONS and

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.340
think about this as CAR and
think about that as

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.080
CDR, but it's not.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.550
Now, let's look at what
they really are.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:09.360
Well, CONS-stream of x and y is
going to be an abbreviation

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:19.540
for the following thing.

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.470
CONS form a pair, ordinary CONS,
of x to a thing called

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.000
delay of y.

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:34.670
And before I explain that, let
me go and write the rest. The

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:39.790
head of a stream is going
to be just the CAR.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.610
And the tail of a stream is
going to be a thing called

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:56.120
force the CDR of the stream.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.060
Now let me explain this.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:01.420
Delay is going to be a
special magic thing.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.240
What delay does is take an
expression and produce a

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.380
promise to compute
that expression

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.600
when you ask for it.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.980
It doesn't do any computation
here.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:14.820
It just gives you
a rain check.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.110
It produces a promise.

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:23.280
And CONS-stream says I'm going
to put together in a pair x

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.360
and a promise to compute y.

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:30.200
Now, if I want the head, that's
just the CAR that I put

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.840
in the pair.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.350
And the key is that the
tail is going to be--

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:39.110
force calls in that promise.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:43.690
Tail says, well, take
that promise and now

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:44.610
call in that promise.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:47.430
And then we compute
that thing.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.740
That's how this is
going to work.

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:51.550
That's what CONS-stream, head,
and tail really are.

00:52:54.196 --> 00:52:55.570
Now, let's see how this works.

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:58.410
And we'll go through this
fairly carefully.

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:01.990
We're going to see how this
works in this example of

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:08.650
computing the second prime
between 10,000 and a million.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:11.610
OK, so we start off and we
have this expression.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:20.380
The second prime-- the head of
the tail of the result of

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.060
filtering for primality
the integers between

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.710
10,000 and 1 million.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:28.400
Now, what is that?

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:35.790
What that is, that interval
between 10,000 and 1 million,

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.480
well, if you trace through
enumerate interval, there

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.250
builds a CONS-stream.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.880
And the CONS-stream is the CONS
of 10,000 to a promise to

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:54.480
compute the integers between
10,001 and 1 million.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.750
So that's what this
expression is.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:57.640
Here I'm using the substitution
model.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.690
And we can use the substitution
model because we

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.010
don't have side effects
and state.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:07.860
So I have CONS of 10,000 to a
promise to compute the rest of

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:08.380
the integers.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.850
So only one integer, so
far, got enumerated.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:16.580
Well, I'm going to filter that
thing for primality.

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.360
Again, you go back and look
at the filter code.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.460
What the filter will first
do is test the head.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:31.580
So in this case, the filter will
test 10,000 and say, oh,

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.500
10,000's not prime.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.260
Therefore, what I have
to do recursively

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.220
is filter the tail.

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.550
And what's the tail of it, well,
that's the tail of this

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:46.340
pair with a promise in it.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.680
Tail now comes in and says,
well, I'm going to force that.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:53.790
I'm going to force that promise,
which means now I'm

00:54:53.790 --> 00:55:00.880
going to compute the integers
between 10,001 and 1 million.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.970
OK, so this filter now
is looking at that.

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.100
That enumerate itself, well, now
we're back in the original

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.960
enumerate situation.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.920
The enumerate is the CONS of the
first thing, 10,001, onto

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.740
a promise to compute the rest.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.060
So now the primality filter is
going to go look at 10,001.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:25.120
It's going to decide if
it likes that or not.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.550
It turns out 10,001
isn't prime.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.610
So it'll force it again
and again and again.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:37.100
And finally, I think the first
prime it hits is 10,009.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.465
And at that point, it'll stop.

00:55:40.465 --> 00:55:42.500
And that will be the first
prime, and then eventually,

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.240
it'll need the second prime.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.030
So at that point, it
will go again.

00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:51.880
So you see what happens is that
no more gets generated

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.130
than you actually need.

00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:00.060
That enumerator is not going to
generate any more integers

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.410
than the filter asks it for as
it's pulling in things to

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:04.930
check for primality.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.290
And the filter is not going to
generate any more stuff than

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.255
you ask it for, which is
the head of the tail.

00:56:11.255 --> 00:56:17.180
You see, what's happened is
we've put that mixing of

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:20.130
generation and test into what
actually happens in the

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:24.250
computer, even though that's
not apparently what's

00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:28.160
happening from looking
at our programs.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:30.230
OK, well, that seemed easy.

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:33.326
All of this mechanism got put
into this magic delay.

00:56:33.326 --> 00:56:36.900
So you're saying, gee, that must
be where the magic is.

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:39.070
But see there's no magic
there either.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:40.610
You know what delay is.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:50.040
Delay on some expression is
just an abbreviation for--

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.490
well, what's a promise to
compute an expression?

00:56:56.490 --> 00:57:00.700
Lambda of nil, procedure of no
arguments, which is that

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.000
expression.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.930
That's what a procedure is.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.050
It says I'm going to compute
an expression.

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:07.460
What's force?

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.800
How do I take up a promise?

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.890
Well, force of some procedure,
a promise, is just run it.

00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:20.120
Done.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.580
So there's no magic
there at all.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.440
Well, what have we done?

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.510
We said the old style,
traditional style of

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:30.960
programming is more efficient.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.260
And the stream thing is
more perspicuous.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:40.070
And we managed to make the
stream procedures run like the

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.350
other procedures
by using delay.

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.880
And the thing that delay did
for us was to de-couple the

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.150
apparent order of events in our
programs from the actual

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:54.440
order of events that happened
in the machine.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.540
That's really what
delay is doing.

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:58.290
That's exactly the
whole point.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:04.720
We've given up the idea that our
procedures, as they run,

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.182
or as we look at them, mirror
some clear notion of time.

00:58:09.182 --> 00:58:12.960
And by giving that up, we give
delay the freedom to arrange

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.690
the order of events in the
computation the way it likes.

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:17.610
That's the whole idea.

00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:20.640
We de-couple the apparent
order of events in our

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.200
programs from the actual order
of events in the computer.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.770
OK, well there's one
more detail.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.750
It's just a technical detail,
but it's actually

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.730
an important one.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:32.190
As you run through these
recursive programs unwinding,

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:35.360
you'll see a lot of things that
look like tail of the

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.320
tail of the tail.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.840
That's the kind of thing that
would happen as I go CONSing

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.860
down a stream all the way.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.170
And if each time I'm doing that,
each time to compute a

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:51.830
tail, I evaluate a procedure
which then has to go

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:54.270
re-compute its tail, and
re-compute its tail and

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.380
recompute its tail each time,
you can see that's very

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.610
inefficient compared to just
having a list where the

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:02.510
elements are all there, and I
don't have to re-compute each

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.290
tail every time I get
the next tail.

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:15.030
So there's one little hack to
slightly change what delay is,

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.380
and make it a thing which is--

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.390
I'll write it this way.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:27.360
The actual implementation, delay
is an abbreviation for

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:31.000
this thing, memo-proc
of a procedure.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.150
Memo-proc is a special thing
that transforms a procedure.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:39.250
What it does is it takes a
procedure of no arguments and

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:42.190
it transforms it into a
procedure that'll only have to

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:44.806
do its computation once.

00:59:44.806 --> 00:59:48.700
And what I mean by that is,
you give it a procedure.

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:51.950
The result of memo-proc will be
a new procedure, which the

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.370
first time you call it, will
run the original procedure,

00:59:55.370 --> 01:00:00.040
remember what result it got, and
then from ever on after,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.610
when you call it, it just
won't have to do the

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:02.360
computation.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.200
It will have cached that
result someplace.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.550
And here's an implementation
of memo-proc.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.710
Once you have the idea, it's
easy to implement.

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:15.830
Memo-proc is this little
thing that has two

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:17.390
little flags in there.

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:20.320
It says, have I already
been run?

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.620
And initially it says, no, I
haven't already been run.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:29.070
And what was the result I got
the last time I was run?

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.200
So memo-proc takes a procedure
called proc, and it returns a

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.360
new procedure of no arguments.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.610
Proc is supposed to be a
procedure of no arguments.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:42.970
And it says, oh, if I'm not
already run, then I'm going to

01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:44.430
do a sequence of things.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:48.450
I'm going to compute proc,
I'm going to save that.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:51.140
I'm going to stash that in
the variable result.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.510
I'm going to make a note to
myself that I've already been

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.610
run, and then I'll return
the result.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:59.010
So that's if you compute it
if it's not already run.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.040
If you call it and it's already
been run, it just

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.420
returns the result.

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:08.400
So that's a little clever
hack called memoization.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:12.100
And in this case, it short
circuits having to re-compute

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:15.270
the tail of the tail of the tail
of the tail of the tail.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.810
So there isn't even that
kind of inefficiency.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:20.590
And in fact, the streams will
run with pretty much the same

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:24.210
efficiency as the other
programs precisely.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:28.110
And remember, again, the whole
idea of this is that we've

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:32.390
used the fact that there's no
really good dividing line

01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:33.610
between procedures and data.

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:36.510
We've written data structures
that, in fact, are sort of

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.760
like procedures.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:45.280
And what that's allowed us to
do is take an example of a

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.620
common control structure,
in this place iteration.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.460
And we've built a data structure
which, since itself

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.530
is a procedure, kind of has
this iteration control

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.496
structure in it.

01:01:55.496 --> 01:01:58.650
And that's really what
streams are.

01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.900
OK, questions?

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:06.110
AUDIENCE: Your description
of tail-tail-tail, if I

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:10.050
understand it correctly, force
is actually execution of a

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:13.052
procedure, if it's done without
this memo-proc thing.

01:02:13.052 --> 01:02:16.380
And you implied that memo-proc
gets around that problem.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.580
Doesn't it only get around it
if tail-tail-tail is always

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.550
executing exactly the same--

01:02:22.550 --> 01:02:23.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's--

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:23.910
sure.

01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.050
AUDIENCE: I guess I
missed that point.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:26.540
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.790
I mean the point is--

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:31.290
yeah.

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.160
I mean I have to do a
computation to get the answer.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.590
But the point is, once I've
found the tail of the stream,

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.530
to get the tail of the tail,
I shouldn't have had to

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.980
re-compute the first tail.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.370
See, and if I didn't use
memo-proc, that re-computation

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.460
would have been done.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.710
AUDIENCE: I understand now.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.550
AUDIENCE: In one of your
examples, you mentioned that

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.010
we were able to use the
substitution model because

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.830
there are no side effects.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:01.040
What if we had a single
processing unit--

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.620
if we had a side effect,
if we had a state?

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:09.120
Could we still practically
build the stream model?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.530
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:10.540
That's a hard question.

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:15.540
I'm going to talk a little bit
later about the places where

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.960
substitution and side effects
don't really mix very well.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.170
But in general, I think the
answer is unless you're very

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:23.920
careful, any amount of side
effect is going to mess up

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.170
everything.

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:36.150
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I didn't
quite understand

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.410
the memo-proc operation.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.990
When do you execute
the lambda?

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:46.270
In other words, when memo-proc
is executed, just this lambda

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.600
expression is being generated.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:50.390
But it's not clear to me
when it's executed.

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:51.350
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.890
What memo-proc does-- remember,
the thing that's

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.290
going into memo-proc, the thing
proc, is a procedure of

01:03:57.290 --> 01:03:57.930
no arguments.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:00.390
And someday, you're
going to call it.

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:03.350
Memo-proc translates that
procedure into another

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:05.110
procedure of no arguments,
which someday

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:06.620
you're going to call.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.890
That's that lambda.

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:17.370
So here, where I initially
built as my tail of the

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.680
stream, say, this procedure
of no arguments, which

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.100
someday I'll call.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.130
Instead, I'm going to have
the tail of the stream be

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.650
memo-proc of it, which
someday I'll call.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:35.340
So that lambda of nil, that gets
called when you call the

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:40.990
memo-proc, when you call the
result of that memo-proc,

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:44.400
which would be ordinarily when
you would have called the

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.642
original thing that
you set it.

01:04:47.642 --> 01:04:49.690
AUDIENCE: OK, the reason I ask
is I had a feeling that when

01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:52.610
you call memo-proc, you just
return this lambda.

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:53.770
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:58.100
When you call memo-proc,
you return the lambda.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.090
You never evaluate the
expression at all, until the

01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.270
first time that you would
have evaluated it.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.000
AUDIENCE: Do I understand it
right that you actually have

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.980
to build the list up, but
the elements of the

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:14.240
list don't get evaluated?

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.630
The expressions don't
get evaluated?

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:18.540
But at each stage, you actually
are building a list.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.750
PROFESSOR: That's--

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:20.700
I really should have
said this.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.270
That's a really good point.

01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:23.660
No, it's not quite right.

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:25.080
Because what happens is this.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.890
Let me draw this as pairs.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.710
Suppose I'm going to make a
big stream, like enumerate

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.740
interval, 1 through 1 billion.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:43.045
What that is, is a pair with
a 1 and a promise.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.890
That's exactly what it is.

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.140
Nothing got built up.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.370
When I go and force this,
and say, what happens?

01:05:56.370 --> 01:06:00.530
Well, this thing is now also
recursively a CONS.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:07.770
So that this promise now is the
next thing, which is a 2

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:11.350
and a promise to do more.

01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:14.470
And so on and so on and so on.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:18.200
So nothing gets built up until
you walk down the stream.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.790
Because what's sitting here is
not the list, but a promise to

01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:24.250
generate the list.
And by promise,

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.500
technically I mean procedure.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:30.485
So it doesn't get built up.

01:06:30.485 --> 01:06:34.280
Yeah, I should have said
that before this point.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.490
OK.
