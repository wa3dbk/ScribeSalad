00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.060
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.310
In this video, what
we'd like to do

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.190
is find the volume
of a paraboloid--

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.280
this one that I've drawn
on the board-- using

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.160
what we know about Riemann
sums and integrals.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.520
And so, this paraboloid,
just so you understand,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.040
what we do is we take the
curve y equals x squared

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.380
and we rotate it
around the y-axis.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.680
And we're looking in
particular, from height--

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.840
the height of capital H,
so from 0 to capital H,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.110
that's what our y-value
is ranging over.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
And what we'd like to do
is find the volume enclosed

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.650
by the rotation of y equals
x squared around the y-axis.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.320
So what I'd like you
to do is to think

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.690
about how you could write
the volume as an integral.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.480
And I would suggest
that you think

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.990
about integrating in the
y variable as opposed

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.740
to the x variable.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.550
So we're going to do
it in the y variable.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.716
So I'll give you a little
while to think about that.

00:00:57.716 --> 00:01:00.440
Start as a Riemann sum,
take it to an integral,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.890
and then I'll come back
and show you how I did it.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.986
OK, welcome back.

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:14.360
So again, what
we're trying to do

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.320
is find the volume
of this paraboloid.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
And we're hoping to write it
as an integral in the end.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.330
So I'm going to give us a
little understanding of how

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.490
we start the process.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.540
And what I want to do is break
up this paraboloid first,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.060
into our first-best guess.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.810
And I'm going to estimate the
volume using four different--

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.390
I'm breaking it up
into four pieces,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.960
so I'll use four cylinders.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.240
So let me actually just
draw these cylinders.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.346
So I'm going to start
at the top radius.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:44.824
And that would maybe
be my first cylinder.

00:01:44.824 --> 00:01:46.990
And then the next radius
would be the one down here.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.871
Actually maybe I
can alternate color.

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.620
You'd be able to see
them a little better.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.365
The next radius would
actually be this one kind

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:57.710
of right here coming around
that way, going down,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.205
so it sticks out a
little bit from there.

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:03.270
Let me just kind of
shade that lightly.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.470
And the next one is
using this cylinder.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.210
So that's our diameter here.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.990
And then the last one-- well,
that doesn't look very even.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.570
But we'll just say
that there are four.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.950
To keep it with four,
I'll say the last one

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.590
is starting right here.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.840
So I don't have to
draw any more pictures.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.780
And the last one
is that cylinder.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.430
So there are four
cylinders here.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.260
This one comes around behind.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.510
There are four cylinders here.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.551
There's the blue one here,
a white one, a red one

00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:34.580
and another blue one.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.970
And I can actually estimate
the volume of this paraboloid

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.840
by finding the volume
of these cylinders.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.340
So we have to
understand how to find

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.607
the volume of the cylinders.

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:45.190
And then what we'd like to do
is to get better approximations,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.570
we're going to make
these cylinders flatter.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.670
So we're going to
make them not as tall.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.070
And then as they get flatter
and flatter and flatter,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.986
we're going to get better
and better estimates

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:55.230
of the paraboloid's volume.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750
And then in the
limit, we will get

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.110
the volume of the paraboloid.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.651
So this again should
remind you, this

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.344
sounds a lot like Riemann sums.

00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.010
What we've been doing
with Riemann sums.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.070
You're adding up--
you're estimating area

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.736
under the curve, in
the case that you've

00:03:06.736 --> 00:03:07.611
seen mostly in class.

00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:09.277
But maybe this reminds
you of the volume

00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:11.880
of the pyramid problem that
you saw on the lecture videos.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.240
So it's very similar
to that idea.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.500
Now let's figure out how we can
write this sum of these four

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.209
cylinders in terms of y.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.250
So what do we need to do?

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.520
Well, first we're going
to designate the height

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.860
of the cylinder as delta y.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.080
That's the change in y.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.360
That does not look like a y.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.230
Let me try that again.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.986
Delta y.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.270
OK.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.010
So each height-- and even
though it doesn't look like it,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.302
we're going to say that
they're evenly divided.

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:45.760
So let's make, in your mind
this one should be a bit bigger

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.301
and this one should
be a bit smaller.

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:50.220
So delta y is going
to be a constant.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.555
And then I have to
figure out the radius.

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:54.560
Right?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.345
Well, we know that at height y
the radius squared is height y.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:01.190
Right?

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.500
r squared equals h.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.220
So what I actually need is that
at height h, or at height y,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.982
the radius is square root y.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:12.240
Right?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.254
So at height y radius
is the square root of y.

00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:22.420
So when I want to look at
the volume of the cylinder

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.610
at height y-- I'm using the
upper value here-- so at height

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.140
y, what is the volume
of the cylinder?

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.040
We know in general the volume
is equal to pi r squared h.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.780
And so, the height here
of the cylinder-- this

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.560
is not the height
on the whole thing;

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.830
this is the height of
that individual cylinder--

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.530
the height of the
cylinder is delta y.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.350
And r is square root y.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.530
So r squared is just y.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.196
So the volume of a single
cylinder is pi y delta y.

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:53.070
So again, we find the
volume of this cylinder

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.800
by taking the y-value
here, multiplying it by pi

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.309
and then multiplying
it by delta y.

00:04:57.309 --> 00:04:59.850
And I do that for this one, this
one, this one, and this one.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.840
And then I add them up.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.530
And that's my estimate of the
volume of the whole paraboloid.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.420
So now what can I do?

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.060
Well, again, I mentioned we can
divide into more subintervals.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.560
And let's say we
only divide-- let's

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.947
say we divide it into
n subintervals. right?

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:14.030
What would this look like?

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.610
I'm going to be
taking a sum to find

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.280
the volume of the whole thing.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.520
I'm going to take a sum
from i equals 1 to n

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.190
of these kinds of things.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.200
Pi y sub i delta y.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.720
So each y sub i represents the
y-value at the different height

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.930
where I'm taking my cylinder.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.830
Now delta y, in this
case, if I divide

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.470
into n equal subintervals,
delta y is H divided by n.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.990
And then you can actually figure
out the y sub i's from that.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.790
The first one would be H over n.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.700
The second one would be 2H over
n and so on until the top one

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.680
would be H*n over n and you'd
have H as the top height.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.680
So those are the values
that we're ranging over.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.670
And now, as we let
n go to infinity,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.730
this is our Riemann sum.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.570
This is actually going
to be an integral.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.170
Delta y goes to dy.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.690
And let's look at what happens.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.817
So we get dy here.

00:06:09.817 --> 00:06:11.150
We're going to have an integral.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.650
And what are we
actually evaluating?

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.040
We're evaluating the
function pi y at what places?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.310
Well, as delta y goes to
0, the first value of y

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.050
sub i that I get is
pushing down to 0.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.590
And the last value we know is
H. So we're actually taking

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.320
an integral from
0 to H of pi*y*dy.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.840
And that is the
integral representation

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.590
of the volume of the paraboloid.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.940
Now this is a very easy
thing to take an integral on,

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.290
so you could actually
evaluate this and find it.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.030
I believe you'll get something
like pi y squared over 2 from 0

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.630
to H. So you should
get something

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.550
like pi over 2
capital H squared.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.230
You can check my math, but
I think that's correct.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.350
So that is actually the volume
of the paraboloid carved out

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.180
by this particular
curve, y equals

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.660
x squared, from, or
at height capital H.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.520
So that's where we'll stop.
