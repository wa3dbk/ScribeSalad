00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.040
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.350
In this video I want us to
work on some problems looking

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.150
at integrals that may
converge or diverge.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.880
So these are improper integrals.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.820
And we want to know if
each of the integrals

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.489
below converges or diverges.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.530
And if they converge, I
want you to compute them.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.500
I want you to actually
evaluate it, find a number that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.390
is the area under the curve.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.790
So that's really, remember,
what the integral is.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.200
So we should be able
to find, actually,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.580
the finite number
that represents that.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.890
So there are three of them.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.660
The first one is
the integral from 0

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.880
to infinity of cosine x dx.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.890
The second one is the integral
from 0 to 1 of natural log

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.840
x divided by x to the 1/2 dx.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.100
So that's just square
root x, down there.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.680
And the third one is the
integral from minus 1 to 1

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.690
of x to the minus 2/3 dx.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.840
So why don't you take a
while to work on this.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.630
Pause the video.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.660
When you're feeling
good about your answers

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.830
bring the video back up.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.610
I'll be back then to
show you how I do them.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.670
OK, welcome back.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.110
Well hopefully you were able
to answer these questions.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.120
The question again
was that we wanted

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.190
to know if the following
intervals intervals integrals

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.180
converged or diverged.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.870
And then I wanted us to actually
compute them if they converged.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.110
So again, we're going to
start with the integral

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.610
of cosine x dx.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.845
Then we'll look at the
integral of natural log

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.372
x over root x dx.

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:43.580
And then we'll look at the
integral from minus 1 to 1

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.259
of x to the minus 2/3 dx.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.550
So let's look at the first one.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.910
And I'll rewrite it
up here so we have it.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.410
OK.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.493
And this is kind of
interesting because maybe this

00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:03.370
is a little bit different than
what you have seen previously

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.860
in the way of saying this
is potentially improper.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.330
Because cosine x certainly
doesn't blow up anywhere.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.110
It's bounded between
minus 1 and 1.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.290
So the function itself
is not blowing up.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.520
But let's look at what we get
when we try and evaluate this.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.500
So if we take this
integral, we know

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
the antiderivative of cosine is
negative-- no it's just sine.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.150
Sorry, it's just sine x.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.650
Right?

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.680
The derivative of
sine is cosine.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.600
So we get sine x.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.920
And what we're
supposed to do, is

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.430
that we're supposed to
take-- let me rewrite that x.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.270
That's horrible.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.680
We're supposed to take the limit
as b goes to infinity of sine x

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.190
evaluated from 0 to b.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070
Right?

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.220
And so this is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.110
Again now it's the limit at
b goes to infinity of sine b,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.430
because sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.067
Now here's where we run into
trouble, because this limit

00:02:58.067 --> 00:02:58.650
doesn't exist.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.010
Right?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.070
because as b goes to infinity,
sine b, the function sine x--

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.210
so now it's really
the function sine b,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.130
b is now the variable, if
we think about it that way--

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.170
as b goes to infinity,
sine is going

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.210
to oscillate as it always
does between minus 1 and 1.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.820
And it's going to
continue to do that.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.320
It's not going to
approach a certain value

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.040
and stay arbitrarily close
to that value as be goes off

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.930
to infinity.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.600
So this limit does not exist.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.940
And maybe what's informative is
to think about how could this

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.934
happen as an integral?

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:36.850
If we know that the
integral we're looking for

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.810
is really the signed
area under the curve.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.190
So let me explain
briefly what's happening.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.420
Let me just draw a
quick picture of cosine

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.480
and explain briefly
what's happening.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.755
So cosine starts off like this.

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:52.510
Right?

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.770
So what happens if I wanted
to integrate cosine x from 0

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.680
to infinity.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.790
I first pick up this much area.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.780
Sorry this graph is a
little sloped, I realize.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.600
I pick up this much area
and that's all positive.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.790
And then as I keep
moving over here to here,

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.080
I pick up the same amount
of area, but it's negative.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.310
So once I get to here
my integral, it's 0.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.900
The area above and the
area below are equal.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.740
So then I start the process
again with the value 0.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.180
And so I accumulate
some negative area.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.290
Then over here it's the same
amount of positive area,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.620
and it kills it off.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.120
So I start off, I have
some positive value,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.210
and then it becomes less
positive and goes to 0.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.260
Then I get some negative
value accumulated.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.110
Then it comes up
and goes to 0 again.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.450
So the point is as I'm
moving off to infinity,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.730
the area is oscillating.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.470
And the area, remember, is
actually what the value of sine

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.570
is at that point.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.290
The area from under
the curve from 0

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.310
to any value for cosine x is
the value of sine at that point.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.710
That's what we're seeing here.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.620
So the point is that this
integral, even though cosine x

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.340
is a bounded function,
the area is accumulating,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.980
then disappearing, then becoming
negative, then disappearing,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.521
then accumulating,
then disappearing.

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.470
So there's no value
that it's approaching.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.490
It's varying between all these
values over and over again.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.260
So this is a weird
one, maybe, where

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.430
the integral doesn't exist.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.040
But it actually, it
doesn't exists there.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.550
So hopefully that
makes sense, and even

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.460
though it's a little different,
you understand the idea.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.470
So now I'm going to go to (b).

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.974
So what is (b)?

00:05:31.974 --> 00:05:41.501
It's the integral from 0 to
1 of ln x over x to 1/2 dx.

00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.000
OK.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.955
And what I want to point
is we probably want

00:05:43.955 --> 00:05:45.270
to see why is this improper.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.410
Well at 1, we don't of a problem
because natural log of 1 is 0.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.100
And we can put a 1 down here
and nothing bad happens.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.040
At 0 we have a problem.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.600
The natural log of 0
actually doesn't exist.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.860
The limit as x goes
to 0 of natural log

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.450
x is minus infinity.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.520
And then natural log--
or sorry, natural log?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.450
Zero, evaluating square
root x at 0, gives you 0.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.290
So we have something
going to minus infinity

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.129
in the numerator and
0 in the denominator.

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:14.920
And we're trying to
integrate that function

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.560
as it goes towards that value.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.130
So we have to figure out
kind of what's going on here.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.380
So let's not worry about
the bounds at the moment.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.870
Those are obviously going
to be important at the end.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.495
But let's figure out what we get
as an antiderivative for this.

00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:29.417
OK?

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:31.000
And we don't worry
about the constant,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.010
remember, in the
antiderivative because we're

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.680
going to evaluate.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.820
So what's the best way
to attack this one?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.980
Well probably you should see
that you got a natural log

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.830
and you've got a power of x.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.380
So this is really set up to
do an integration by parts.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.370
Because remember,
you like to take

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.100
derivatives of natural log.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.660
And powers of x are
happy to be integrated

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.330
or to take derivatives of them.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.910
The only power of x that's
maybe a little bit annoying

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.789
to integrate is x to the
minus 1, because its integral,

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.830
because its antiderivative
is natural log instead

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.700
of, like, another power of x.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.490
But, this one is not
that case so it's

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.070
looking good for an
integration by parts.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.710
So again we said
for an integration

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.710
by parts, natural log you
love to take its derivative.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.600
So we're going to let
u be natural log of x

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.150
and u prime be 1 over x.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.820
And then v prime is
x to the minus 1/2.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.460
Right?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.380
This is x to the 1/2
in the denominator,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.600
so v prime is actually
x to the minus 1/2.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.950
So v is going to be x to the
1/2 with a correction factor.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.480
So it's going to need a
2 in front, I believe.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.890
Let me double check.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.760
Derivative of this
is-- 1/2 times

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.390
2 is 1-- x to the minus 1/2.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.250
So I'm doing OK.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.990
So now what do I get when I
want to take the integral?

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:56.145
I take u*v. So it's going
to be 2 x to the 1/2 ln x--

00:07:56.145 --> 00:07:58.020
and then now I'm going
to put in the bounds--

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.680
evaluated from 0 to 1, minus
the integral of v u prime.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.460
So v is x to the 1/2, and u
prime is x to the minus 1,

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.200
really it's 1 over x.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.800
And so I'm going to keep the 2
in front, integral from 0 to 1,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.310
x to the 1/2 over x
is x to the minus 1/2.

00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:21.180
This will be nice because we've
already taken an antiderivative

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.390
once, so we know what we get.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.660
All right, now this one
we'll have to look at,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.640
because notice
that as x goes to 0

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.470
we have to figure out
if this has a limit, OK?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.680
We have to figure out
of this has a limit.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.130
And we'll probably need to use
L'Hopital's rule to do that.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.320
So let's finish
this part up first.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.633
So I'll just keep this here.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.710
0 to 1, that's a
0, and then minus.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.700
OK, x to the minus
1/2, its antiderivative

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.110
was 2 x to the 1/2.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.690
So I have another 2, so I get
a 4 c to the 1/2 evaluated

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.560
from 0 to 1.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.651
So this is easy because
here, I just get 4.

00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:02.150
Right?

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.147
This part right here,
when I evaluate it

00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:06.980
I'll just get 4 and the
minus sign in front.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.120
So this part is just negative
4, because at x equals 1 I get 1

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.300
and at x equals 0 I get 0.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.970
So that's fine.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.410
This part is fine.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.410
This part, when I put in 1
for x, notice what happens.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.220
I get a 1 here.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:24.102
Natural log of 1 is
0, and so I get 0.

00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:25.560
And so the question
really is, what

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.340
is the limit as x goes
to 0 of this quantity?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.650
I know right here-- again,
I have a minus 4 here.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.950
And then the question
is what do I have here?

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:33.450
it?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.408
It could blow up still.

00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:35.270
It could diverge.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.050
We're going to see what happens.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.040
So let me just put a line.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.300
It's the same problem, but I
want to distinguish for us.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.430
So we're actually
wanting to find the limit

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:53.077
as b goes to 0 of 2 b to
the 1/2 natural log b.

00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:53.780
Right?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.160
That's what we're interested in.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.850
That's the only part we
don't yet understand.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.090
So let's see what happens.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.590
Well, if I want to make this
into a L'Hopital's rule thing,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:07.390
right now I have 0
times negative infinity.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.350
So to put it into
a form I recognize,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.000
I'm going to rewrite this.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.760
This is actually
equal to the limit

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.170
as b goes to 0-- I'm going
to keep the natural log be

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.470
up here, and I'm going to write
this as b to the minus 1/2

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.650
in the denominator.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.910
Let's make sure we understand
what just happened.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.690
I had a b to the 1/2
in the numerator.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.390
If I put it to the minus
1/2 in the denominator,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.030
it's still equal
to the same thing.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.800
Right?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.720
b to the minus 1/2
in the denominator

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.080
is equal to b to the
1/2 in the numerator.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.820
OK?

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.730
Really I'm taking 1 over this,
and then I'm dividing by it.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.480
That's the way you
want to think about it.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.950
You want to think about
saying I'm taking 1 over this,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.241
and I'm taking it in the
numerator and the denominator.

00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:50.029
so I end up with it just here.

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:51.320
That might have been confusing.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.840
The real point is this
quantity, one over this quantity

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.980
is equal to that quality.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.290
And now what's the point?

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.870
Why did I bother to do that?

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.320
As b goes to 0, this
goes to negative infinity

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.080
and this goes to infinity.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.820
So now I have something where
I can apply L'Hopital's rule.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:14.110
So the limit as b goes to 0,
derivative of natural log of b

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.120
is 1 over b.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.995
So I get 2 over b
in the numerator.

00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:23.020
The derivative of b to the
minus 1/2 is negative 1/2 b

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.400
to the minus 3/2.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.250
There's a lot of denominators in
the numerator and denominator,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.580
so let's simplify this.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.270
That's the limit as b goes to 0.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.270
OK, what do we get here?

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.650
We have 2 times minus 1/2,
or 2 divided by minus 1/2.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.450
So I'm going to get a
negative 4 from this part,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.370
the coefficient.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.940
Then I have a b to the minus
1 up here divided by a b

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.890
to the minus 3/2.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.070
That's actually going to be
a b to the 3/2 divided by b.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.260
That's going to be b to the 1/2.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.970
That's algebra.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.640
You can check it if you need to.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.140
I mean, you should
have gotten this.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.420
But if you didn't get
this, check again.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.290
Let me make sure I get it again,
b to the 3/2 divided by b, b

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.690
to the 1/2.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.980
And that equals 0, because
it was a limit as b

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.770
goes to 0 of this quantity.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.700
Now I've just got a
continuous function.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.649
I am, notice, I I
didn't actually--

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:21.065
I kind of cheated a little
bit, because I just wrote limit

00:12:21.065 --> 00:12:21.950
as b goes to 0.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.760
But I'm always doing as b goes
to 0 from the right-hand side.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.210
I'm starting at 1.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.900
So you may have seen
this, this 0 plus

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.750
means I'm only interested
as b goes to 0 from above 0.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.250
OK?

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.890
I didn't write that in,
but notice our integral

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.895
was between 0 and 1.

00:12:37.895 --> 00:12:41.020
So it only mattered
values to the right of 0.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.730
So this function is
defined to the right of 0.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.195
So I can just evaluate there.

00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:48.220
I can just plug it in.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.450
It's continuous, and so I can
just say at 0 it equals 0.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.061
So now let's go back
to where we were.

00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:55.060
What were we doing here?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.210
We were taking this whole
piece, was to come back in here

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.840
and figure out what
this value was.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.940
We knew at 1, we got 0.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.480
And now we know at
0, we also get 0.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.650
So that question mark
I can replace by a 0,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.250
and I get 0 minus 4.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.030
So the actual answer
is negative 4.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.740
OK, we have one more.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.040
What's the last one?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.950
The last one-- let me write
it down over here again--

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.550
is the integral from minus 1
to 1 of x to the minus 2/3 dx.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.090
Now this is interesting,
because this,

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.030
you actually saw an example
kind of like this in the lecture

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.520
that at this
endpoint, it's fine.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.920
You can evaluate the
function at that endpoint.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.071
At this endpoint it's fine.

00:13:46.071 --> 00:13:47.570
You can evaluate
the function there.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.420
So it looks good
at the endpoints.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.950
But the point is
that at x equals

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.570
0, because this minus
power is putting

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.987
your x in the denominator,
you actually, your function

00:13:56.987 --> 00:13:57.570
is blowing up.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.360
It has a vertical
asymptote at x equals 0.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.280
So what we want to do
is we have this strategy

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.040
for these problems, is to
split it up into two parts,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:13.570
minus 1 to 0 of x to the
minus 2/3 dx plus the integral

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.960
from 0 to 1 of x to
the minus 2/3 dx.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.014
Now the point is that
now the only place

00:14:21.014 --> 00:14:22.430
where I have a
vertical asymptote,

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.010
I see it as an endpoint
on both of these.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.950
And this is again,
just this good thing

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.410
we have an additive property
for these integrals,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.690
that the sum of
these two integrals

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.250
is going to equal this one here.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.949
As long as, you know, as
long as these are converging,

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:38.490
then I can say that
if this converges

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.830
and this converges, then their
sum converges to this one here.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.160
OK, so that's really what
I'm trying to exploit here.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.340
Now what is the antiderivative
here for x to the minus 2/3?

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:53.820
This is going to be-- again, I'm
going to write something down

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.140
and then I'm going to check it.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.000
I think it should be
5/3, x to the 5/3.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.117
And then I have to
multiply by 3/5.

00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:04.200
Let's double check, because
this is where I always

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.630
might make mistakes.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.190
If I take the derivative of
5/3 times 3/5 it gives me a 1.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.537
5/3 minus 1 is 5/3 minus
3/3, and that's 2/3,

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:14.245
and that's wrong.

00:15:14.245 --> 00:15:14.745
Right?

00:15:16.812 --> 00:15:17.770
Because I went too big.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.810
It's supposed to be 1/3.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.351
I knew I was going
to make a mistake.

00:15:20.351 --> 00:15:21.610
Right?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.654
I'm supposed to
add 1 to minus 2/3.

00:15:23.654 --> 00:15:24.320
That's just 1/3.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.850
And so I should
have a 3 in front.

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.600
So for those of you who were
saying she's making a mistake,

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.510
I was.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.410
OK, x to the 1/3.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.035
So I take the derivative
times 3, I get a 1 there.

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.024
I subtract 1 and
I get minus 2/3.

00:15:37.024 --> 00:15:37.982
So now I'm in business.

00:15:37.982 --> 00:15:39.760
OK.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.230
And now I just need to evaluate
that here, here if I can,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.940
then another one
here from 0 to 1.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.460
And the good news
is x to the 1/3

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.470
is continuous at
all these points.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.660
It's continuous across
negative 1, 0, 0, and 1.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.530
So I can actually just evaluate.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.670
I don't have to worry.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.012
There is a value for
the function there.

00:16:02.012 --> 00:16:03.720
It's continuous through
all these points.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.340
So I can just evaluate them.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.700
So let's see what I get.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.540
I get 3 times 0.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.700
And then I get minus
3 times negative 1,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.200
so I get a negative
3 plus 3 times

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.540
1, and then minus 3 times 0.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.880
OK, so 3 times 0
minus negative 3.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.259
So that's a 3 plus
3, and I get 6.

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:30.550
And what's the picture of this?

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.660
Well you should think
about what the picture of x

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.050
to the minus 2/3 looks like.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.842
And you should notice
that across 0, it's even.

00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:38.660
Right?

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.217
So it's actually
going to have-- it's

00:16:41.217 --> 00:16:43.050
going to look the same
in the left-hand side

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.130
and the right-hand side.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.480
So if I had wanted to,
I could have just found

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.237
the value of say,
this integral-- I

00:16:49.237 --> 00:16:51.320
like positive numbers
better-- the integral from 0

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.220
to 1 of this function,
multiplied it by 2,

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.140
and it would have given
me the actual value.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.530
Because it's exactly the same
function to the right of 0

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.404
and to the left of 0.

00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:01.980
It's a reflection
across the y-axis,

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.080
so you get the same value there.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.690
So you actually would've gotten
3, for this, multiplied by 2

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.760
and you get the value.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.854
If this one had
diverged, that one also

00:17:09.854 --> 00:17:11.770
would have had to diverge,
and the whole thing

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.600
would have diverged.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.016
And that's because
of the symmetry

00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:15.900
of the function over 0.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.720
So I'm going to just
briefly review what we did.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.920
And then we'll be done.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.820
So we come back over here.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.230
I gave you three integrals.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.360
We wanted to see if they
converged or diverged, right,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.130
and if they converged
find what they were.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:33.500
So the first one was cosine x.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.020
And we found that diverged
for a different reason

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.590
than what we've seen before.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.540
Because as x goes to infinity,
the problem is the areas

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.180
are varying up and down
and they're bounded always.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.680
But the area under the
curve is constantly changing

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.560
and it's not converging
to a fixed value.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.260
It's varying between minus
1 and 1 over and over again.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.060
And then (b), we had
this integral from 0

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.440
to 1 natural log
x over root x dx.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.150
And the point here was a
little more complicated,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.690
so let me come to that one.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.130
We used an integration by parts.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.330
We had an integral
they converged easily,

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.350
because this was an easy
improper integral to determine.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.190
And then we had this
other thing that we now

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.519
have to evaluate it.

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:19.310
You wound up having to
use L'Hopital's rule

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.037
to evaluate it.

00:18:21.037 --> 00:18:23.370
But then you're able to show
that this using L'Hopital's

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.490
rule, this actually has
a value at each endpoint,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.210
a finite value at each endpoint.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:33.720
It converges then to 0 as you,
when you put in these bounds,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.484
and then you have a
fixed value for this one

00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:37.650
when you take that integral.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.983
So you ended up with another
integral that was improper.

00:18:39.983 --> 00:18:41.490
But you could show it converged.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.310
And then you could
use L'Hopital's rule

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.018
to find what happened
at these endpoints.

00:18:45.018 --> 00:18:46.940
And you get a value of minus 4.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.816
Then the third one was this
integral minus 1 to 1 x

00:18:50.816 --> 00:18:52.141
to the minus 2/3 x dx.

00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:53.640
And the point I
wanted to make there

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.340
is that just because
the function is

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.415
well-behaved near the endpoints
doesn't mean that it's still,

00:18:58.415 --> 00:19:00.212
you know, that
everything is hunky-dory.

00:19:00.212 --> 00:19:01.670
You have to be
careful and you have

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.640
to check at places where
the value of the function

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.160
is going off to infinity.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.640
So in the second case, the
left endpoint posed a problem,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.860
and everything else was fine.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.660
In this case, the left and
right endpoints are both fine,

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.600
but in the middle
there's a problem.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.740
And so you split it up
into it's two pieces

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.960
so that you have the endpoints.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.790
Now these two new
integrals represent

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.670
where the problem
might happen, and then

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.240
you do your, find
your antiderivative,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.270
and evaluate, and see if you can
get something that converges.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.740
So that's the idea of
these types of problems.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.900
So hopefully that
was helpful, and I

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.546
think that's where I'll stop.
