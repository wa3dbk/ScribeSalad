CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.320
In this segment, we're going
to talk about the product

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.010
rule for three
functions and then

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.710
we're going to do an example.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.407
And what I want to do first
is remind you the product rule

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:19.990
for two functions,
because we're going

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.610
to use that to figure
out the product

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.040
rule for three functions.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.330
So throughout this
segment, we are

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.430
going to assume that u and v
and w are all functions of x.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm going to drop
the of x just so it's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.180
a little easier to write.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.230
This notation should
be familiar with things

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.980
you saw in the lecture.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.230
So, for two functions,
let me remind you.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.180
If u*v, the product, and
you take its derivative,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.340
so prime will denote d/dx.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.340
Then we can take the
derivative of the first times

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
the second function left
alone, plus the derivative

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.920
of the second function
times the first left alone.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.770
So this should again
be familiar from class.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.150
And now what we want
to do is expand that

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.300
to the product of three
functions, u times v times w.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.870
And we're going to
explicitly use this rule.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.120
So, u*v*w prime is what
we want to look at.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.300
So we're just going
to take advantage

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.192
of what we know to figure out
what this expression will be.

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:25.900
What this product of
three functions when

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.920
I take its derivative will be.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.760
So in order to do this
easily, what we're going to do

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.770
is treat v times w
as a single function.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.280
OK?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.340
So v times w will be our second
function that essentially takes

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.370
the place of the V up here.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.880
So using the product
rule for two functions,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.640
what I get when I
take this derivative,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.550
is I get u prime times v*w plus,
I take the derivative of this

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.230
second thing,
which is v*w prime.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.405
And then I leave u alone.

00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:00.790
OK?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.830
We're not quite done,
but you can see now,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.150
again if we compare
to what's above,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.115
you take the derivative
of the first function,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:08.615
you leave the second
function alone.

00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:10.890
You take the derivative
of the second function,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890
you leave the first
function alone.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.540
But now again,
what do we do here?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.300
Well we have a product rule for
two functions, so let's use it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.080
So, I'll leave the first
thing alone, u prime-- oops,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.920
that does not look
like a v-- v*w plus,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.051
now let's expand this.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.050
Take the derivative of
the first function there.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.230
That's v prime.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.130
I leave the w alone.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.120
Plus the derivative of
the second function.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.135
That's w prime.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.297
I leave the v alone.

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:41.255
And I keep the u there.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:43.120
OK?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.740
I'm going to just
expand and write it

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.080
in a nice order, so we can see
sort of exactly what happens.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:03:01.460
So, u prime v*w plus v
prime u*w plus w prime u*v.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.744
So what you can see
here is, what happens?

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:05.660
You take the derivative
of the first function,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.524
you leave the second
and third alone.

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.690
Then you take the derivative
of the second function,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.191
you leave the first
and third alone.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.315
Then you take the derivative
of the third function,

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:15.000
you leave the first
and second alone.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.110
And you add up
those three terms.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.040
I would imagine that at this
point you anticipate a pattern.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.710
So if I had a fourth function.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.480
If I did u times v times
w times z, let's say.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.250
And I took that derivative
with respect to x.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.160
You could probably
anticipate, you

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.340
would have four terms
when you added them up.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.210
And that fourth term would
have to include a derivative

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.090
of the fourth function.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.140
So from here, actually
you can probably

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.790
tell me what the derivative of
the product of n functions is.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.062
And you can check it using
the same kind of rule.

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.770
But what we're going
to do at this point,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.936
is we're going to just make
sure we understand this.

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.360
We're going to
compute an example.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.330
So since we know products--
or we know derivatives

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.200
of powers of x, and we know
derivatives of the basic trig

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.590
functions, we'll do a product
rule using those functions.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.375
So, let me take an example.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.970
So we'll say, f of x equals
x squared sine x cosine x.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.530
OK?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.130
And I want you to
find f prime of x.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.480
OK, I'm going to give
you a moment to do it.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.410
You should probably
pause the video here,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.699
make sure you can do
it, and then you can,

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.240
you can restart the video when
you want to check your answer.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.850
OK, so we have a product
rule for three functions,

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.740
we have an example that
I asked you to determine

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.210
and gave you a moment to do it.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.350
So now I will actually work
out the example over here

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.960
to the right.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.876
So I will determine
f prime of x.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:10.250
Now what are our
three functions?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.410
Well we have x squared
is the first, sine x

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.000
is the second, cosine
x is the third.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.310
So we'll have three terms.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.270
The first term has to have the
derivative of the x squared.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.040
That's going to give me a 2x.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.190
And I leave the other
two terms alone.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.532
So I have 2x sine
x cosine x plus-- I

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:30.990
may want to just
write these below.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.152
OK.

00:05:32.152 --> 00:05:33.610
Now in the next
term, I should take

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.570
the derivative of the sine x.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.170
And leave the x squared
and the cosine x alone.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.819
The derivative of
sine x is cosine x.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.777
So I'm actually going to
write this underneath.

00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:46.700
So we'll have-- I'm going to put
the plus underneath also so we

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.080
remember it's a sum.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.240
Plus, so the derivative
of sine x is cosine x.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.875
And then we have a
times x squared times--

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:57.480
oops-- another cosine
x, the third function.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.980
OK?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.131
And then the third term,
I take the derivative

00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:05.380
of the third function and I
leave the first and second

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.070
alone.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.350
The derivative of cosine
x is negative sine x.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.930
So I actually have a
negative sine x times x

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.140
squared times the sine x here.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.970
I can do some
simplifying if I want.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.240
But maybe, if I were
trying to write this nicely

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.960
for someone who was
reading mathematics,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.730
I would put all of the
polynomials in front

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.780
and all of the
coefficients in front.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.460
So to be very kind to someone,
I might write it like this.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.660
And notice cosine x cosine
x is cosine squared x.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.840
And then minus x
squared sine squared x.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.300
And there are other
ways, I could rewrite

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.360
this and using trig identities.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.820
But this is a sufficient
answer at this point.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.260
So this is actually a good
way to write the derivative

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.800
of that function, f of x.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.927
And this is where we'll stop.
