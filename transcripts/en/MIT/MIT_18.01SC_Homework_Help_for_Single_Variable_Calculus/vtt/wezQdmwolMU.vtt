CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.410
We're going to practice
using some of the tools

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.550
you developed recently
on taking derivatives

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.390
of exponential functions
and taking derivatives

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.260
of logarithmic functions.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.477
So I have three
particular examples

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:23.560
that I want us to look at.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.820
And I'd like us to find
derivatives of the following

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.690
functions.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.703
The first one is f
of x is equal to x

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.730
to the pi plus pi to the x.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.255
The second function is g of x is
equal to natural log of cosine

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:36.290
of x.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.870
And the third one is-- that's
an h not a natural log--

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.580
h of x is equal to natural
log of e to the x squared.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.747
So you have three
functions you want

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.580
to take the derivative
of with respect to x.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.790
I'm going to give you a
moment to to work on those

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.555
and figure those out using
the the tools you now have.

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.020
And then we'll come back and
I will work them out for you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.520
as well.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.740
OK, so let's start off with the
derivative of the first one.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.660
OK, now, the reason
in particular

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.930
that I did this one-- it might
have seemed simple to you,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.580
but the reason I did this one
is because of a common mistake

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.150
that people make.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.010
So the derivative of x to
the pi is nice and simple

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.430
because that is our rule
we know for powers of x.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.920
So we can write this
as that derivative is,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.840
pi times x to the pi minus one.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.510
OK, but the whole point
of this problem for me,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.270
is to make sure that you
recognize that pi to the x

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.750
is not a power of x rule
that needs to be applied.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.070
It's actually an exponential
function right, with base pi.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.990
So if you wrote the derivative
of this term was x times pi

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.340
to the x minus one, you would
not be alone in the world.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910
But that is not the correct
answer, all the same.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.550
Because this is not a power
of x, this is x is the power.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.440
So this is an
exponential function.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.290
So the derivative of
this, we need the rule

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.030
that we have for derivatives
of exponential functions.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.070
So that's natural log
of pi times pi to the x.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.440
That's the derivative
of pi to the x.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.745
So that's the answer
to number one.

00:02:15.745 --> 00:02:16.245
OK.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:18.720
Number two, I did
for another reason.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.122
I think it's an interesting
function once you find out

00:02:23.122 --> 00:02:24.080
what the derivative is.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.040
So, this is going to require
us to do the chain rule.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.530
Because we have a
function of a function.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.090
But you have seen
many times now,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.950
when you have natural
log of a function,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.330
its derivative is going to
be 1 over the inside function

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.980
times then the derivative
of the inside function.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.380
So again, what we do is we take
the derivative of natural log.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.041
Which is 1 over cosine x.

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.290
So we take the derivative
of the natural log function,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.969
evaluate it at cosine x.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:58.510
And then we take the derivative
of the inside function, which

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.990
is the derivative of cosine x.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.860
So you get negative sine x.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.220
So you get this whole thing
is negative sine over cosine.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.850
So this is negative tangent x.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.820
So the reason I,
in particular, like

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.220
this one is that we
see, "Oh, if I wanted

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.310
to find a function whose
derivative was tangent x,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.580
a candidate would be the
negative of the natural log

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.410
of cosine of x."

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.930
That in fact gives us a function
whose derivative is tangent x.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.680
So it's interesting,
now we see that there

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.342
are trigonometric
functions that I

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:32.050
can take a derivative
of something that's

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.350
not just trigonometric and get
something that's trigonometric.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.530
So that's kind of
a nice thing there.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.360
And then the last
one, example three,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.430
I'll work out to the right.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.070
There's a fast way and
there's a slow way to do this.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.880
So I will do the slow way first.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.820
And then I'll show you why
it's good to kind of pull back

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.040
from a problem
sometimes, see how

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.230
you can make it a lot
simpler for yourself,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.050
and then solve the problem.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.808
So, I'll even write down
this is the slow way.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.370
OK, the slow way
would be, well I

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.020
have a composition
of functions here.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.180
I have natural log
of something and then

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.825
I have e to the something else.

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:17.860
Right?

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.910
And then that function actually,
is not just e to the x.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.326
So I have some
things I have to, I

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:24.920
have to use the chain rule here.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.650
OK, so let's use the chain rule.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.100
So I'll work from
the outside in.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.016
So the derivative of the
natural log function,

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:33.542
the derivative of the
natural log of x is 1 over x.

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:35.750
So I take the derivative of
the natural log function,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.320
I evaluate it here.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.170
So the first part gives me
1 over e to the x squared.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.000
And then I have to
take the derivative

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of the next inside
function, which

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.880
the next one inside
after natural log,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.500
is e to the x squared.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.600
And the derivative of that, I'm
going to do another chain rule.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.250
I get e to the x squared
times the derivative

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.120
of this x squared, which is 2x.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.980
OK, so again, this
part is the derivative

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.180
of natural log evaluated
at e to the x squared.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.690
This part is the derivative
of e the x squared.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.030
This one comes just
from the derivative of e

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.880
to the x is e to the x.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.900
And so I evaluate
it at x squared.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.200
And then this is the derivative
of the x squared part.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.580
So I end up with a product
of three functions,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.850
because I have a composition
of three functions.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.000
So I have to do the chain rule
with three different pieces

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.500
basically.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.490
So, but this simplifies, right?

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.022
e to the x squared divided
by e to the x squared is 1.

00:05:32.022 --> 00:05:32.522
So I get 2x.

00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:33.647
OK, so what's the fast way?

00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:37.030
That's our answer: 2x.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.400
But what's the fast way?

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.559
Well, the fast way
is to recognize

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:47.392
that the natural log
of e to the x squared--

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:51.520
let me erase the y
here-- e to the x squared

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.595
is equal to x squared.

00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:54.420
OK?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.910
Why is that?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.700
That's because
natural log function

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.110
is the inverse of the
exponential function with base

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.610
e.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.570
Right?

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.190
This is something you've
talked about before.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.270
So this means that if
I take natural log of e

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.250
to anything here, I'm going
to get that thing right there.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.590
Whatever that function is.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.215
So natural log of e the
x squared is x squared.

00:06:14.215 --> 00:06:15.447
OK?

00:06:15.447 --> 00:06:17.280
If you don't like to
talk about it that way,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.580
if you don't like
inverse functions,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.980
you can use one of the
rules of logarithms, which

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.530
says that this
expression is equal to x

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.322
squared times natural log of e.

00:06:28.322 --> 00:06:30.280
That's another way to
think about this problem.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.550
And then you should remember
that natural log of e

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.510
is equal to 1.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.110
So at some point you
have to know a little bit

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.840
about logs and exponentials.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.700
But the thing to
recognize is, that h of x

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.180
is just a fancy way
of writing x squared.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.200
And so the derivative
of x squared is 2x.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.170
So sometimes it's
better to see what

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.360
can be done to make the
problem a little easier.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.380
But that is where we
will stop with these.
