00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.690
Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.390
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.920
In lecture you talked
about computing derivatives

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.350
by definition.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.110
And one rule for
computing derivatives

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.630
that Professor Jerison
mentioned but didn't prove

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.190
was what's called the
constant multiple rule.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.840
So today I want to give
you a proof of that rule

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.500
and show you a little bit of
geometric intuition for why

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.550
it works.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.160
So the constant
multiple rule says

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.390
that if you have a constant c
in a differentiable function, f

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.230
of x, that the derivative of
the function c times f of x

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.540
is equal to c times the
derivative of f of x.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.530
Just to do a quick example,
suppose that c were 3

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.200
and f of x were the
function x squared,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.310
this says that the derivative
d by dx of 3 x squared

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.335
is equal to 3 times
the derivative of d

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.410
by dx of x squared.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.410
Now, this is good
because we already

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.270
have a rule for computing
derivatives of powers of x.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.530
So this says we don't
need a special rule

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.900
for computing multiples
of powers of x squared.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.900
We don't need to go back
to the limit definition

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.199
to compute the derivative
of 3 x squared.

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:28.740
We can just use the
fact that we know

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.390
the derivative of x
squared in order to compute

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.840
the derivative of 3 x squared.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.250
So in this case that
would work out to 6x.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.250
In this case.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.075
So it simplifies the number
of different computations

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:41.700
you have to do.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940
It reduces the number of
times we need to go back

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.939
to the limit definition.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.780
So that's the use of the rule.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.270
Let's quickly talk
about its proof.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.584
The idea behind the proof is
you have these two derivatives

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:57.250
and you want to show
that they're equal.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.700
Well, any time you have a
derivative, what it really

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.860
means is it's the value of
some limit of some difference

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.590
quotient.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:14.490
So in this case we have the
derivative d by dx of c times f

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.860
of x by definition is
the limit of a difference

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.880
quotient as delta x goes to 0
of-- so we take the function c

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.390
times f of x and we
plug in x plus delta x

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.280
and we plug in x and
we take the difference

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680
and we divide by delta x.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.250
So that's c times f of x
plus delta x minus c times

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.010
f of x divided by delta x.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.060
Now you'll notice that here
both terms in the numerator

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.000
have this constant
factor, c, in them.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.476
So we can factor that out.

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:53.850
And I'll just pull it out in
front of this whole fraction

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.070
so that this is
the limit as delta

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.220
x goes to 0 of c
times the ratio f of x

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:13.280
plus delta x minus f of x,
all quantity over delta x.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.470
Now, c is just some constant.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.390
This part depends on delta x.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.780
And on x, but on delta x.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.190
So as delta x goes
to zero, this changes

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.400
while this stays the same.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.802
What that means is, so
as delta x goes to 0,

00:03:28.802 --> 00:03:30.510
this gets closer and
closer to something,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.280
the value of its limit.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.350
And c, you're just
multiplying it in,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.320
so c times-- the limit of c
times this is equal to c times

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.607
whatever the limit of this is.

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:43.820
If this is getting closer
and closer to some value,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.400
c times it is getting closer and
closer to c times that value.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.620
So this is equal to
c-- in other words,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.620
we can pull constant
multiples outside of limits.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.570
So this limit as
delta x-- c times

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.156
the limit is delta x goes
to 0 of f of x plus delta x

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:08.810
minus f of x over delta x.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.200
And this limit here
is just the definition

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.020
of the derivative of f of x.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.620
So this is equal
to, by definition,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.850
c times d by dx of f of x.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.370
So we started with
the derivative

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.710
of c times f of x and we
showed this is equal to c

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.910
times the derivative of f of x.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.160
That's exactly what we wanted.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.310
So that proves the
constant multiple rule.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.520
We've now proved the
constant multiple rule--

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.740
let me talk a little bit
about some geometric intuition

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.820
for why this works.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.530
So I've got here, well so, you
know, let's take c equals 2,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.920
just for simplicity.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.660
So here I have a
graph y equals f of x,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.690
and I have also drawn the
graph, y equals 2f of x.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.510
The relationship
between these graphs

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.110
is that y equals 2f of x is
what you get when you stretch

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.930
the graph for y equals f of x
vertically by a factor of 2.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.910
So, you know, if it
passed through 0 before,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.100
it still passes through 0.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.780
But everywhere else,
if it was above 0,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.180
it's now twice as high.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.560
If it was below 0,
it's now twice as low.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.740
So if you think about what the
definition, what the derivative

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.300
means in terms of this
graph geometrically,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.045
it's telling you
the limit-- sorry,

00:05:29.045 --> 00:05:30.780
the slope of a tangent line.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.930
Or in other words, the limit
of the slopes of secant lines.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.670
So if you look at
these two curves,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.950
say-- let's pick a
couple values of x, say,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.610
and then maybe x
plus delta x-- so

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:57.370
if you look at the secant
lines for these two curves

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.980
through those
points, what you see

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.188
is that these two lines,
they have the same you know,

00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:06.420
so the slope of a line is
its rise over its run--

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.470
so they have the
same run, that we

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.030
are talking about the same
little interval, here.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.080
But this, in the function
that's scaled up,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.260
in the y equals
2f of x curve, we

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.350
have that that the rise
everything has been stretched

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.910
upwards by a factor of
two-- so the rise here is

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.750
exactly double the rise here.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.330
So the slope of the secant line
is exactly double the slope

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.510
of this secant line.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.590
And similarly,
the tangent line--

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.500
just a limit of secant
lines-- has been stretched

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.220
by that same factor of two.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.580
So the slope of the
tangent line is exactly

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.550
twice the slope of the tangent
line for the other function.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.065
So the tangent line here
is exactly twice as steep

00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:47.140
as the tangent line here.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.890
Or in other words, the
derivative of this function

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.410
is exactly twice the
derivative of that function.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.130
So that's just a
geometric statement

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.660
of this very same
constant multiple rule

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.490
that we stated algebraically
at the beginning

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.280
and that we just proved.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.940
So that's that.
