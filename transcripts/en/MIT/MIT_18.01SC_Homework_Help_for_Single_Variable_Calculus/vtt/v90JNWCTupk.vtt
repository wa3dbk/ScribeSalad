00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:07.450
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.050
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.710
We've been talking in lecture
about antiderivatives.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.850
So I have here a
problem for you.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.310
Just an exercise about
computing an antiderivative.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.710
So the question is to
compute an antiderivative

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.510
of this big fraction.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.180
So on top it's got x to
the eighth plus 2x cubed

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.330
minus x to the 2/3 minus 3,
that whole thing over x squared.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.760
So just a quick
linguistic note about why

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.430
I said an antiderivative
instead of the antiderivative,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.370
and then I'll let you
work on it a little.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.660
So an antiderivative.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.772
There are many functions whose
derivative is this function.

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:44.630
Right?

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.450
So they all differ from
each other by constants.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.230
So I would be happy with any one
as an answer to this question.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.350
That's why I chose the
word an antiderivative.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.810
So I'm looking for a
function whose derivative

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.600
is equal to this function.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.620
So why don't you take a
couple minutes, work this out,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.350
come back and you can check
your answer against my work.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.680
OK, welcome back.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.290
So we were just talking about
this antiderivative here.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.024
So one thing you'll
notice about this function

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:26.190
is that I've written this
in a sort of a silly form.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.120
And it's probably
a lot easier to get

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.060
a feel for what this
function is if you

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.790
break this fraction apart
into its several pieces.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.060
So for example, x to the
eighth over x squared

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.960
is just x-- So,
well OK, so let me,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.130
this antiderivative
that I'm interested in,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.340
antiderivative of x to the
eighth plus 2x cubed minus x

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.620
to the 2/3 minus 3,
over x squared dx.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.440
So I've written
this in a silly form

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.210
and you can get
it in a nicer form

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.170
if you just realize
that, you know,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.760
this is just a
sum of powers of x

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.740
that I've put over this
silly common denominator.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.560
So our life will be a little
simpler if we write this out

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.440
by splitting it up into
the separate fractions.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.460
So if I do that, this is just
equal to the antiderivative

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.000
of well, x to the
eighth over x squared.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.830
That's x to the sixth.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.320
And 2 x cubed over
x squared is just x.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.160
So I have x-- sorry,
it's 2x-- plus 2x.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.170
Now, OK so x to the
2/3 over x squared.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.610
So that's x to the 2/3 minus 2.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.150
Which is x to the minus 4/3.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.860
And minus 3 over
x squared, so OK,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.270
so we could write that as minus
3 over x squared, or maybe it's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.210
a little more convenient
to write it as minus 3

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.250
x to the minus 2, dx.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.580
So far I haven't really
done anything, you know.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.930
A little bit of algebra here.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.180
OK, but now we know
that we've seen

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.860
a formula for
antidifferentiating

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.980
a single power of x.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.950
I mean we know how
to differentiate

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.640
a single power of x, and
so to do an antiderivative

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.780
is just the inverse process.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.730
And we also know that when you
have the derivative of a sum,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.110
it's the sum of derivatives.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.420
And so consequently, if you have
the antiderivative of a sum,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.420
it's just the sum of
the antiderivatives.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.510
So we can write this out
into its constituent parts.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.110
So it's the antiderivative
of x to the sixth dx

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.890
plus-- now of course you
don't have to do this.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.030
You could probably proceed
just from this step onwards,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.390
or, but I don't see any harm
in actually splitting it

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.120
up myself.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.340
So antiderivative
of 2x*dx minus, OK,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:10.470
x to the minus 4/3 dx plus
minus 3 x to the minus 2 dx.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.470
So I've just split it up
into a bunch of pieces.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.034
I guess this one I sort of
pulled the minus sign out

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:15.950
and this one I didn't.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.090
But you know, whatever.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.020
Either way.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.980
OK so now we just
need to remember

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.740
our formulas for taking the
antiderivative of a power of x.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.140
So in order to that, so
when you take a derivative,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.510
the power goes down by one.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.760
So if you take an
antiderivative to the power

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.660
will always go up by one.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.290
So in this case
you get, so you're

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.880
going to get x to the seventh.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.410
And now when you differentiate
x to the seventh,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.170
a 7 comes down in front, right?

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.940
You get 7 x to the sixth.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.360
So in order to get
just x to the sixth,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.320
we have to also divide
by that 7 there.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.250
So x to the sixth,
the antiderivative

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.720
is x to the seventh over 7.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.560
2x, so that's going to give
us plus 2 x squared over 2.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.500
Or if you like, you could just
recognize right away that 2x

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.100
is the derivative of x squared.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.870
Minus-- OK now we've
got minus powers.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.600
Rather, negative powers, so
that always is a little trickier

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.094
to keep track of.

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:25.760
So again, the same
thing is true though.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.390
You have to, you add
one to the exponent.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.890
The exponent goes up by one
when you take an antiderivative.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.440
It goes down by one when
you take a derivative.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.270
So when you add 1 to minus
4/3 you get minus 1/3.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.240
So we have x to the minus 1/3.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.100
And now I have to
divide by minus 1/3.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.140
When I take a derivative here,
we get-- of x to the minus 1/3,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.990
I get minus 1/3 x
to the minus 4/3.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.580
So I need to divide
by that minus 1/3.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.040
OK.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.620
And finally here so
minus 3 x to the minus 2.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.100
So OK, so just like
this first one,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.250
you might recognize
that right off

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.962
as the derivative
of x to the minus 3.

00:06:09.962 --> 00:06:14.760
So this is plus-- Oh!

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.990
Ha ha!

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.180
You could do that if you were
completely confused like me.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.470
So right, so x to the minus
2, it increased by one.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.570
Increases by 1.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.876
So when it increases by 1,
you get minus 1 not minus 3.

00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:29.376
Oh!

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.810
OK, good.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:39.730
So this is minus 3 times x
to the minus 1 over minus 1.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:40.480
OK.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.271
That's much better.

00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.260
And if you like,
right, so, OK, so

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.380
we could-- any constant
we add to this,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.400
it'll still be an
antiderivative.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.320
And now we can do a
little bit of arithmetic

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.380
to arrange this into
nicer forms if you wanted.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.560
So you could
rewrite this as say,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.770
x to the seventh
over 7 plus x squared

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:14.540
plus 3 x to the minus 1/3
plus 3 x to the minus 1

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.370
plus a constant.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.350
Now, suppose you
got here and suppose

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.850
that you did the same
mistake that I just made.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.084
And you had accidentally
thought that this

00:07:24.084 --> 00:07:26.250
was going to be a minus 1/3
power instead of a minus

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.280
first power.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.120
So how would you,
is there any way

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.430
that you can prevent
yourself making that mistake?

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.730
Well there actually is.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.037
So one nice thing
about antiderivatives

00:07:36.037 --> 00:07:37.870
is that it's really
easy to check your work.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.530
After you've computed an
antiderivative, or something

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.072
that you think is
antiderivative,

00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:44.530
you can always go back and take
the derivative of the thing

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.200
that you've computed
and check that it's

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.630
equal to what you started with.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.240
So if you, if
you're ever worried

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.830
that you made a mistake
computing an antiderivative,

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.050
one thing you can always
do is take a derivative

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.300
of what you've got at the end.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.716
So if we take a
derivative here we

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:05.800
get x to the sixth plus 2x minus
x to the minus 4/3 minus 3 x

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.575
to the minus 2.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:08.240
OK?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.855
So that was just using our
rule for powers one by one.

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:14.960
And OK, so you say that
out loud or write it down

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.060
and then you just check.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.560
Right?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.526
So I said that, so that's
exactly the same thing

00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:20.400
we've got right here.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.310
Yeah?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.340
So x to the sixth plus 2x
minus x to the minus 4/3

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.490
minus 3x to the minus 2.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.620
So one of the nicest things
about antiderivatives,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.330
they can be difficult to
figure out in the first place,

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.220
but after you've got
something that you think

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.580
is antiderivative it's very
easy to go back and check

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.300
whether you did it correctly
by taking the derivative

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.250
and making sure that it
matches the thing that you

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.750
were trying to antidifferentiate
at the beginning.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.097
So that's that.
