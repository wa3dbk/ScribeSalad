00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:07.370
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.980
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.220
In lecture you've been
doing definite integration

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.730
for the last couple of lectures.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.420
And you've just started
with the fundamental theorem

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.800
of calculus.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.687
So, that gives us this
whole powerful tool

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.020
to compute a bunch of integrals.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.710
So, with that in mind, I've
got a couple questions for you.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.950
So compute the
definite integrals.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.100
The integral from pi over
6 to pi over 3 of tan x dx.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.820
And the integral of minus pi
over 3 to pi over 3 of tan x

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.430
dx.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.290
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.497
take a couple minutes to
work on those, come back

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:43.830
and we'll work on them together.

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:51.720
All right.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.490
Welcome back.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.390
So, as we were saying
we have a couple

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.770
of definite integrals here.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.280
So one tool for definite
integrals is Riemann sums.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.540
So, in principle, we could write
down a Riemann sum for, say,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.980
this first integral here.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.540
And then try and compute it
by trying to compute the sum

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.990
and taking a limit of it.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.210
But I think it's pretty clear
that, for a function like tan

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.560
x, that's going to be
really, really hard to do.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.380
So we want to not use
Riemann sums here.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.840
And the way we can
not use Riemann sums

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.636
is using this great
tool that we have,

00:01:25.636 --> 00:01:27.510
which is the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.343
So the fundamental
theorem of calculus says,

00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:32.020
when you have a definite
integral, instead of computing

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.040
Riemann sums, what you can do
is compute an antiderivative

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.640
and use the antiderivative to
find out what the integral is.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.830
Just compare two values
of the antiderivative

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.380
and that'll give you the value
of the definite integral.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.890
So, in particular, let's do
this first integral first.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.850
So we have the integral from
pi over 6 to pi over 3 of tan

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.380
x dx.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.240
Well, so, we know what the
antiderivative of tan x is.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.220
We did that in an
earlier recitation.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.770
So that's ln of cosine x.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.750
Or ln of the absolute
value of cosine x.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.900
So, the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.870
says that the value of
this definite integral,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.540
in order to compute
it, we just take

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.600
the difference of that
antiderivative at pi over 3

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.740
and at pi over 6.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.170
So, by the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.130
this is equal to ln of the
absolute value of cosine

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:41.530
x for x between pi
over 6 and pi over 3.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.760
So, OK, so this, you know,
this is this notation

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.490
that Professor
Jerison introduced.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.030
So what does this actually mean?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.000
It's just a shorthand for ln
of the absolute value of cosine

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.990
of pi over 3 minus ln
of the absolute value

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.224
of cosine of pi over 6.

00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:04.890
Now, we could leave
our answer like this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.090
but we can also
manipulate it and put it

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.090
in a little nicer form.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.070
So, cosine of pi over 3 is-- oh,
I'm sorry I've made a mistake.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.562
So it's not ln of
absolute value cosine x.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:19.160
It's minus ln of absolute
value of cosine x.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.460
Sorry about that.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.920
So this is minus ln cosine
pi over 3 plus-- OK, so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.320
minus and minus there is plus.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.050
All right.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.580
Sorry about that.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.243
OK, so, good.

00:03:32.243 --> 00:03:33.042
All right.

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.500
And we can pick up where I was
in the middle of my sentence

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.110
and OK, so we can just evaluate
this by just evaluating.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.640
So cosine of pi over 3,
that's going to be 1/2.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.500
So this is minus ln and absolute
value of 1/2 is just a 1/2.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.980
Plus cosine of pi over 6
is square root of 3 over 2.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.530
So plus ln square
root of 3 over 2.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.630
And now you can use
your logarithm rules

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.220
to combine those into
a single expression.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.440
So this is equal to ln
of square root of 3.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.540
Or you could even use one more
logarithm rule if you wanted.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.990
So this is equal to 1/2 ln of 3.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.090
So all of those are, you
know, equivalent expressions

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.240
for the same number,
which is the value

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.050
of this definite integral.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.060
OK, so, for the second
integral now, we

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.650
can do exactly the same
thing if we wanted to.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.560
And it'll be a very
similar process.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.540
You'll write down this
antiderivative here,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.380
you'll take the
difference in values.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.550
We can also do something a
little bit clever for this one.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.050
Which is, definite
integrals have

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.350
some geometric
interpretation, right?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.120
And if you think
about the function tan

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.020
x-- so we could put up
a little graph here--

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.110
so in between minus pi
over 3 and pi over 3,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.490
tan x maybe looks
something like this.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.400
Yeah, you know, give or take.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.080
OK, so what's
important about this?

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.450
Well tan x is an odd function.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.520
And this interval from-- this
is minus pi over 3 to pi over 3,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.380
and this is the
curve y equals tan x.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.850
So this is an odd function.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.630
So the integral in question
is this positive area

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.510
minus this negative area.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.970
But since it's an odd
function, it's symmetric.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.890
So those two cancel
out perfectly.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.070
So for the second one, you
could do the same process

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.570
that we did.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.090
But you can also use a little
bit of geometric reasoning

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.290
to realize that this second
one is just equal to 0.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.390
In either case, doing
either of these integral

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.330
with Riemann sums would
be really atrocious.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.300
So, in both cases, what
we're really happy about

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.370
is that we have these
other tools that

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.890
allow us to evaluate definite
integrals without going back

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.060
to the Riemann definition
of the integral.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.401
So, I'm going to stop there.
