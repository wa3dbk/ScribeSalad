JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.650
My name is Joel Lewis.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.080
At the time of this
recording in 2010

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm a graduate student in
the Math Department at MIT,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.594
and I'm also a TA for OCW
Scholar 18.01 and 18.02.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:18.510
CHRISTINE BREINER: Hi.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm Christine Breiner.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.290
I'm a Moore Instructor here
at MIT and for OCW Scholar,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.535
I'll be a teaching assistant
for 18.01 and for 18.02.

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:29.170
DAVID JORDAN: My
name is David Jordan

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.400
and I'm a graduate
student here at MIT.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.910
And I'm a TA for
OpenCourseWare Scholar 18.02.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.020
So I thought I would say a
little bit about what we do

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.814
with recitations here at MIT.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:44.230
So, the purpose
of the recitations

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.840
is for you to apply
what you've learned

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.680
in lecture towards solving
specific concrete problems

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.540
and then for you to compare
your solutions to those problems

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.699
with those of your TA.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.740
CHRISTINE BREINER: The
purpose of the recitations

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.660
on OCW Scholar is
really the same purpose

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.526
that David described for
recitations here at MIT.

00:01:03.526 --> 00:01:05.400
What we want you to do
is have an opportunity

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.410
to work varying
levels of problems

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.330
and then see us give detailed
solutions to those problems

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.725
so that you can see how we
think about mathematics.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.560
JOEL LEWIS: Almost
all of our videos

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.450
have a natural
moment where you can

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.530
pause after the
problem's been stated.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.330
And we really strongly
suggest you work out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.510
the problem on a piece of paper
before going back to the video

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.020
and seeing our solutions.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.850
This will help
you do mathematics

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
rather than be able
just to see mathematics.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.820
Hope you enjoy the course.
