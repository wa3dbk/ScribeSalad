00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.370
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.320
Today in this video,
what I'd like us to do

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.350
is work on some solid
of revolution problems.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.820
Well, one solid of
revolution problem.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.510
So what I want us to
do in this one is,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.320
find the volume of the
solid generated by rotating

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.450
the region bounded by these
three curves, x equals 0,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.410
y equals 5, and y
equals x squared

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.090
plus 1, about the y-axis.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.250
And I'm forcing you--
or I'm requesting--

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.950
that you use the disk method.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.770
So I want us to work on the
disk method in this case.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.960
So why don't you take
a crack at the problem?

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000
And then I'll be back.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.460
OK, welcome back.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.100
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.380
going to work on finding the
volume of a solid generated

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.880
by rotating this region
that's bounded by the three

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.310
curves mentioned
about the y-axis.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.537
And as I said before, we're
going to use the disk method.

00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:08.120
So when you're solving
these problems,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.800
the first thing you want
to do is give yourself

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.246
at least a rough sketch of
what this region looks like,

00:01:14.246 --> 00:01:16.620
of with the region bounded by
these three curves actually

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.209
looks like.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.750
So the first thing I'm going to
do before I do anything else,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.690
is at least get a rough sketch
of what that region looks like.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.010
And I'll do that over
here on the right.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.090
So, let's see.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450
We know we've got the region--
let me actually even use

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.480
some different colored chalk.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.130
We'll say the x equals 0
is actually the y-axis.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.900
That's x equals 0.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.100
And then y equals 5-- actually
we'll put that in last.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.040
But y equals x squared plus
1 is the parabola y equals

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.720
x squared shifted up by 1.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.730
So if this is y
equals 1, then it's

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.081
just roughly
something like this.

00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:57.830
That might not look
like the best parabola

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.650
I've ever seen, but well.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.869
Something roughly like that.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.160
Maybe, as I said, rough sketch.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.540
Maybe more like that.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.420
And then, we want to also put in
the y equals 5, which I'll say

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.690
is roughly about here.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.280
So I could-- notice I've
got these three curves.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.787
This curve, this
curve, this curve.

00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:24.620
So I'm interested in
this region right here.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.119
Right?

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.850
Notice that if I also
include this region, when

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.380
I rotated that around, I'd
actually get the same solid,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.490
whether I included
this region or not.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.007
But in terms of doing
the integration,

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.090
I want to make sure I don't
count anything doubly.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.710
So I'm just looking at what
happens when I take this piece

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.039
and I rotate it
around the y-axis.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.080
So what do we want to do?

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.750
We said we want to
use the disk method.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.060
Which means ultimately,
I'm looking for finding out

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.495
what the radius is.

00:02:54.495 --> 00:02:55.390
Right?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.570
I'm doing pi r squared
when I integrate.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.910
So I'm interested in
finding this length-- that's

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.130
going to be our
radius-- and then

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.150
we rotate-- you
probably can't see

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.840
that, so let me just say that's
going to represent our radius.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.484
And then when we rotate
that around the y-axis

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:15.150
we get our disk.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.504
Right?

00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:18.170
We've seen some
pictures of this before.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.305
So I'm interested
in this length here.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.440
And because I want to
use the disk method,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.990
I'm forcing us to
figure out what

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.040
is this value in terms of y?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220
So we know we have,
well we know that y

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.700
equals x squared plus 1 there.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.556
So in terms of y, this is
y minus 1 equals x squared.

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:45.920
So the square root of y
minus 1 is equal to x.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.669
So this is the expression I'm
interested in as our radius,

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:49.210
as my radius.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.260
Right?

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.110
And now, what I need
to do is figure out,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.780
I know if this is the
radius I need to figure out,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.680
since I'm doing
this in terms of y,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.600
what this lower bound is for
y and what the upper bound is

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.470
for y.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.350
And then I'm going
to be integrating

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.767
pi times the radius squared
over y, over the changes in y.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:13.350
Now let's see.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.240
This one's easy. y
equals 5 up here.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.570
And what is this value here?

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.410
Well, the function
that I had here was y

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.040
equals x squared plus 1.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.290
So when x is 0, y is 1.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.660
So this is the value
where y equals 1.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.590
So I know what I'm
interested in doing.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.125
Again, let me write it down.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:40.730
Is I'm integrating from 1
to 5 of pi r squared dy.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.440
And now, I need to write
r as a function of y.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.270
So r is square
root of y minus 1.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.190
When I square that,
I just get y minus 1.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.970
So what I'm really
interested in integrating is,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.346
the integral from
1 to 5 of-- let

00:04:56.346 --> 00:05:00.600
me put the pi outside, because
who cares-- pi times that

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.460
integral, y minus 1 dy.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.670
And if I actually
evaluate this, figure out,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.120
if I actually take the integral,
use my rules for polynomials,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.360
I can get a numerical value.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.290
I'm going to stop evaluating
here, because from here on I

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.800
know you guys can do it.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.767
But, the point of
this problem, what

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.600
I want to mention, the
point of this problem

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.730
is the main thing we had
to do is figure out what

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.057
is the radius in terms of y.

00:05:30.057 --> 00:05:31.890
That was the main thing
we had to figure out

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.120
in order to do this problem.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.890
I said you had to use disks.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.520
So we had to figure out what
the radius was in terms of y.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.340
And then we had
to figure out what

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.150
the bounds were in terms of y.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.930
And once we do that,
it's a simple matter

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.100
of evaluating this integral,
or finding the actual value

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.060
for what this integral is.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.654
So I think that is
where I'll stop.
