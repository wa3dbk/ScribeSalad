00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.110
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.010
In this video, what
I'd like us to do is,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.730
do a little bit of practice
with sigma notation.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.220
So this will be just
a few short problems

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.570
to make sure that you're
comfortable with what

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.760
all the pieces in the
sigma notation actually do.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.020
We're going to start
with two problems here.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.820
And the first one is going to
be a fill-in-the-blanks type

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.320
of problem.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.290
And the object
is, I've given you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.200
a sum on the left-hand
side, and then

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.150
I've given you two
other sums, but I've

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.440
left in each place two blanks,
and I've filled in the rest.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.911
You have enough information
to fill in the two blanks.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.660
So what I'd like you
to do in this problem

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.032
is fill in the two blanks
so that the sums are equal.

00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:47.740
And the object is
obviously is to do this

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.680
without writing
out all the terms

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.310
and adding up and
then going backwards.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.450
So you really want
to try and understand

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.870
what each part of the
sigma notation does.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.120
The second problem
I'd like you to do

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.980
is a simplification problem.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.700
There are three finite sums.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.860
And what I'd like you
to do is combine them

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.290
into a single sum or two sums.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.617
Do the best you can to get
it as simplified as you can

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:13.200
without actually
writing out a number,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.516
but keeping it in some
sort of notation form.

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:18.390
So the object is just
to combine what you can

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.400
and simplify where you can.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.530
And then we'll do another
one in a little bit.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870
But first let's do these two.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.370
I'll give you a while to work
on them and then I'll be back.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.517
OK, welcome back.

00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:38.350
We're going to start
with the first problem.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.700
So the idea is to
really understand

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.970
what each of these
pieces represents.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.430
And let's look at the
first sum and make

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.500
sure we understand
what's going on.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.570
So we have 2 raised to a power.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.430
And what we do is we
index over k from 1 to 5.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.970
So we're going to take 2 to the
first, plus 2 to the second,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.700
all the way up to
2 to the fifth.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.130
And that's where the sum stops.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.560
Now in this summation,
k is indexed

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.910
from some number I haven't
told you yet, up to 7.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.260
And I didn't specify
what power of k we want.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.030
So there are a couple ways
you can think about this.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.250
It's maybe easiest to work
from what we have up here.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.170
We know that the
exponent, last exponent

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.110
we would like on the power
of 2 is a 5 in the end.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.810
But right now, if we just put
a k here, the power would be 7.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.091
So what we'd like to do is
make whatever the power is

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:33.090
up here-- based on that
7-- we'd like that power

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.500
to be 2 less than the number
that we're putting in there.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.800
So probably we would like
this to be a k minus 2,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.900
because notice then, the last
number you put in, you get a 5.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.560
Which corresponds to the last
number you put in here, a 2

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.690
to the fifth.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.390
Now the last number
here is 2 to the fifth.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.280
And this now will dictate what
we put in the blank down here.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.290
Because the first
value of k we wanted

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.030
here, the first term
we wanted in this sum,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.590
was 2 to the first.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.460
So the first term
we want in this sum

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.490
is going to be 2 to the first.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.150
So that means that we
would like k to start at 3.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.270
Another way to
think about this is

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.030
that we know we want the
same number of values

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.480
that we're summing over.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.325
So notice that from
1 up to 5, there

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.660
are 5 values we're summing over.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.700
From 3 up to 7,
there are actually

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.400
5 values we're summing over.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.380
You might think there are
4, because 7 minus 3 is 4,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.400
but you actually have
to count: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.670
You see in fact there
are 5 values there.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.382
So don't get confused by that.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:36.590
The differences are the same.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.380
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.480
7 minus 3 is 4.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.300
So that's good.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.050
We have the same number of
things we're summing up over.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.790
And the first
terms are the same.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.040
And then you notice, because
of the way we've written,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.980
it actually is going
to be exactly equal.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.340
You could expand and check.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.310
but these are going
to be equal sums.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.820
Now the third one, I was
a little trickier, maybe.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.310
I pulled out a factor of 2.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.910
And so now what
we've done is we've

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.806
taken one of the 2's that
was in all of those terms

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:06.680
and we pulled it out.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.480
Right?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.680
So what do we have here?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.270
Well we still have 2 to the k.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.760
But what does this
actually equal?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.540
To make it easier
on myself, I'm going

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.730
to rewrite this in another way.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.290
If I pull the 2 back in,
I get a 2 to the k plus 1.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.260
So now what I've done is I've
given you this 2 pulled out.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.770
What it's actually doing is it's
changing the exponent value.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.090
But again, what do we want
the exponents to run over?

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.370
We want them to start,
this exponent to start at 1

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.940
and to end at 5.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.470
So to get it to start
at 1 and end at 5,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.950
I need k to be 0 to
start, and finish at 4.

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:49.270
And that will be sufficient.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.780
Now again, let's just make sure
that this makes sense to us.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.760
If k is 0, I get
2 to the 0 here.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.910
But when I multiply
by a 2 in front,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.260
the first term is
2 to the first.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.046
Which is the first term here.

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:04.420
Let's just check
one more to make

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.545
sure we feel good about it.

00:05:05.545 --> 00:05:08.690
When k equals 1, I get a 2
to the first here, times 2.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.360
So that's a 2 squared.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.830
That's the second term
in this sum is 2 squared.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.550
The second term in this sum
is when I put in k equals 2,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.320
I get a 2 squared.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.900
So we see in fact that I've
chosen these values in blue.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.020
Now these three sums
are actually equal.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.430
If you're still
nervous about it,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.550
maybe you can expand the
sums and look at them

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.950
and notice that they are
indeed going to work.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.460
Now what I'd like us to do is
work on simplifying a problem.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.120
And if you'll notice, I've put
in three sums, the values here,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.995
two of them are from 1 to 100,
one of them is from 45 to 100.

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:49.620
And the three different
things that I'm

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.250
summing: n cubed minus n
squared, n cubed minus n

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.300
squared minus n, and then n.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.200
And I wanted us to simplify
this as much as we could.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.610
Now because these
are finite sums

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.660
we can split up over
the terms, as long

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.330
as we keep the right index.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.670
So let me actually use the
regular chalk for this,

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.810
and I'm going to look at how
I can split up the second term

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.820
to help with the
first and the third.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.360
So in the second term, notice
I have an n squared and an n

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.610
cubed-- or n cubed
minus n squared here,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.090
and an n cubed minus
n squared here.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.140
So what I can do is, I'm
going to look at those terms

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.880
together.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.470
And then I'm going to look at
the n, the terms-- or summation

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.180
with n and the summation with n.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.760
And we'll compare them.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.622
So let me write out what we get.

00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:38.955
We're going to leave the first
one alone for the moment.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.380
And then I'm going
to subtract off

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.530
this part of that summation.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.050
And what's left
in that summation

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.200
is every term I
had a minus n also.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.320
So I'm going to pull that
minus out with this negative.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.010
And what I'm doing is I'm
taking 45-- n equals 45 to 100

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.510
of these added up.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.820
And then n equals 45 to
100 of this added up.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.510
So I end up with another term.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.600
n equals 45 to 100 of just n.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.190
So those two terms are
coming from the middle one

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.010
split into two pieces.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.060
And then the last term,
I just write down.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.480
So now, it's set up
to go nicely for this

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.170
into a single summation.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.670
And this into a
single summation.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.730
And then we'll see if we
can combine them further.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.210
So if you look here, I have
n equal 1 to a 100 of a sum.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.257
And then I have n equal 45
to a 100 of the same sum.

00:07:53.257 --> 00:07:54.340
What's that actually mean?

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.659
That means I'm seeing the 45
to 100 thing here, and here.

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:00.700
And there's a difference.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.020
Right?

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.170
So I plug in n equals 45 here.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.050
I get 45 to the third
minus 45 squared.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.160
I plug in n equals 45
here, I get the same thing.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.040
And I'm subtracting.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.250
So what's actually happening
is all the terms that have,

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.130
that show up in both
this sum and this sum

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.630
are being subtracted off.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.600
What are those terms?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.090
Those are all the terms
for n equal 45 up to 100.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.170
Because it's in this
summation and this one

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.570
goes all the way
from 1 to a 100.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.610
So it certainly
includes 45 to 100.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.080
So, in fact, you see that all
you wind up with in the end

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.690
is n equals 1 to 44 of
n cubed minus n squared.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.820
Again why is that?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:50.610
This has the 1 through 44 terms
and it has the 45 to 100 terms.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.770
This has the 45
through 100 terms only.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.640
So the 45 to 100
terms are in both

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.520
and they're subtracted off.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.290
So that's one way to think
about why we end up with n

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.079
equals 1 to 44 of this sum.

00:09:03.079 --> 00:09:04.620
And then let's look
what we get here.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.995
Well in fact, we see it's
exactly the same kind of thing.

00:09:06.995 --> 00:09:08.350
This is 45 to 100.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.670
This is 1 to 100.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.560
But notice now that the minus
is on the 1 to 100 part.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:21.420
So I'm actually going to get
negative of n equals 1 to 44

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.310
of n.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.370
Because the 45 terms here,
45 to 100, are in both.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.980
So the 45 to 100 here, subtract
off the 45 to 100 here.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.010
Those all go away.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.880
But I'm still left with
the minus n equals 1 to 44.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.500
And now I could
simplify this further,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.620
if I wanted, into a single sum.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:47.910
1 to 44 n cubed minus
n squared minus n.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.400
Why can I do that so easily?

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.337
They're indexing
over the same values.

00:09:53.337 --> 00:09:54.420
That's an important point.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.211
If this was indexing
over different values,

00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:58.830
I'd have to change this formula
in order to substitute it in.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.246
But because they're indexing
over exactly the same values,

00:10:01.246 --> 00:10:05.400
I can just take these two pieces
and put them into a single sum.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.050
So we're going to stop
those two problems now.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.383
We're going to do one more
summation notation problem.

00:10:10.383 --> 00:10:11.758
So we're going to
come over here.

00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:15.030
And I'm just going
to ask you to write,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.010
this is a sum of five terms.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.380
I'm going to ask you to
write this in sigma notation.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.360
And the main thing-- there will
be multiple ways to do this.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.040
So you might come up with a
different answer than I do.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.470
But I'd like you to work
on it for a few minutes.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.700
And then when you feel
confident, come back

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.680
and I will show you how
I solved the problem.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.210
OK, welcome back one more time.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.030
We're going to try and put
this in sigma notation.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.910
And I have to tell you that when
I look at this kind of problem,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.150
and I see the same kind of
factor in each of these things,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.420
I like to make it as simple
on myself as possible.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.760
I like to pull out
that factor just

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.400
to make sure that I
can simplify this as

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.930
much as possible before
I go into sigma notation.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.160
So the common factor
to all of these is 1/5.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.790
I'm going to pull
out a 1/5 before I

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.990
start doing anything else.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.220
There I get a 1.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:18.140
There I get a minus 1/2
plus 1/3 minus 1/4 plus 1/5.

00:11:21.054 --> 00:11:22.470
Now, if you couldn't
do it before,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.710
you can probably do it now.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.640
Because now it's
sort of very obvious

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.534
how these terms are changing.

00:11:28.534 --> 00:11:30.450
So we want to see how
these terms are changing

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.630
and how we could index
them in some variable.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.940
So let's start with the 1/5 and
I'll start with my summation

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.250
and then we'll figure out
what all the pieces are.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.390
Now obviously the numerator
in this case is fixed at 1--

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.150
and I've got a fraction here,
so the numerator's fixed at 1--

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.920
but the sign is alternating.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.380
So how do you alternate sign?

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.300
You're going to take negative
1 and raise it to a power.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.310
Now the power you raise
it to will depend on

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.010
if you want the first term
to be positive or negative,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.730
and where you start
your summation.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.880
So there's a lot of
choices you can make.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.302
But I'm going to start
my summation, we'll say,

00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:12.770
we'll do it in k and
we'll start at k equals 1.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.190
And then we'll have to figure
everything out from that.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.460
So I'm going to start my
summation at k equals 1.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.780
My first term, I want
to be positive 1.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.210
So I need my power
to be k plus 1.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.040
Because now my
power here is going

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.575
to be-- when I put in a 1,
I get a 1 plus 1, I get 2.

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:31.950
Negative one
squared is positive.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.230
That's that's what I want.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.940
You might have done k minus 1.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.760
If you did k minus 1, that's OK.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.000
Because k minus 1 is
also an even number.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.430
So when I take negative
1 and I square it,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.350
I still get a positive number.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.580
So there are a lot of choices
one can make and still

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.920
be correct on that power.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.730
And then, I'm counting up.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.950
Notice the denominator is
increasing just by 1 each time.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.040
And so it looks like, I could
do just something like over k.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.000
Now let's check if
that makes sense.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.350
Well when k is 1, I get
1 in the denominator.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.480
This is 1 over 1.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.394
When k is 2, I get 2
in the denominator.

00:13:06.394 --> 00:13:08.060
When k is 3, I get 3
in the denominator.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.020
So that looks good.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.360
And now the only question is,
where should I stop this thing?

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.040
So I have my alternating sign.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.630
My denominator looks right.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.650
For what value of k
do I want to stop?

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.740
I want to stop when the
denominator equals 5.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.580
And so I just need
to put a 5 up here.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.550
And then I'm done.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.656
Now, if you wanted to
move the 1/5 back in,

00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:29.780
you could actually do that.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:36.680
Maybe your solution
looked something--

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.160
I pull the 1/5 back in.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.450
And I have 5k in there instead.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.854
Maybe that was your solution.

00:13:46.854 --> 00:13:48.520
But these are ultimately
the same thing.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.637
Because really this
is just distributing.

00:13:50.637 --> 00:13:51.330
Right?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.290
This is a big sum.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.700
I have a 1/5 out in front.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.140
And so I multiply
every term by 1/5.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.342
So I just have to put
a 5 in the denominator.

00:13:58.342 --> 00:14:00.300
So you might have had
something more like this.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.340
That's still correct.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.730
So just to stress, that
really the sigma notation,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.572
it's a good tool to understand
how to manipulate easily.

00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:11.030
So there are probably
more problems

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.377
you can find to practice, if
you're nervous about this.

00:14:13.377 --> 00:14:15.960
But I just wanted to give you a
chance to see a couple of them

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.630
and how we work on them.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.893
That's where I'll stop.
