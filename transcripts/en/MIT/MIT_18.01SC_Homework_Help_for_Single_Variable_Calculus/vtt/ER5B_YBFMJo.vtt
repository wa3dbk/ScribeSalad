00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.222
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:10.680
In this video I
want us to practice

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.540
using Newton's Method to find
the solution to an equation.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.589
So what we're going
to do in particular

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.130
is we're going to
use Newton's Method

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.360
to approximate a solution
to the following equation,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.730
2 cosine x equals 3x.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970
And I'm going to tell
you where to start.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.770
We're going to the have
our initial value, x_0, be

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.980
pi over 6.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.150
And I want you to find x_2.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.500
So why don't you pause the
video, take a little time

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470
to work on that, and
then I'll come back

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.270
and I will show
you how I did it.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.920
OK.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.750
Welcome back.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.190
Again, what we're going to
do is use Newton's Method

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.900
to approximate a solution
to this equation.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.860
And so what I want to
point out first is,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.620
I want to point
out why pi over 6

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.680
is a reasonable first
value to choose,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.750
and I want to point out that
this, in fact, has only one

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.640
solution.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.290
So what I'm going to do, to
give us a reason for that,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.200
is I'm going to draw a
rough sketch of two curves

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990
and show where they intersect.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.440
And so I want us to notice that
if I were to look at the two

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.660
curves, y equals cosine
x and y equals 3/2 x

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.960
and I draw them on
the same xy-plane,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.630
that where they intersect
will be where I have solutions

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.870
to this equation.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.410
And that's because I just
divide both sides by 2.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.860
Whatever solves this equation
solves the equation, cosine x

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.300
equals 3/2 x.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.860
So let me give you a rough
sketch of those two curves

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.290
and we'll see what the
intersections look like.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.540
So I'm going to do
that right down here.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.870
OK.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.210
So let me, let me first
draw-- make this y equals 1.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.700
Make this y equals minus 1.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.301
And I'm going to draw cosine x
first, y equals cosine x first,

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:57.550
because I'm most likely to
have a hard time with that,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.070
and I'll do my x
scale once I'm done.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.740
And so cosine x, y equals cosine
x, looks something like this.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.480
Maybe not the most
perfect, but again,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.150
it's kind of a rough sketch.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.680
That's pretty good.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.860
Something like this.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.550
So this is y equals cosine x.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.970
And now I want to graph
y equals 3x over 2.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940
And that goes through
the point (0, 0).

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.130
It also goes through the
point one comma three halves.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.270
Well, this is pi
over 2 right here.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.730
So 1 is about here, we'll say.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.740
Because pi over 2 is a little
bigger than one and a half.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.410
So the 1 is about here, One
and a half is about here.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.480
Or 3/2, if you need
to remind yourself.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.658
So the line y equals 3/2 x
looks something like this.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.160
So it's fairly
straightforward to see

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.830
that these two curves
intersect at one spot, whatever

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.460
this spot is.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.350
OK?

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.850
And notice, to the left
they don't intersect.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.267
So we are just looking
for a single solution.

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.100
And then the other thing
I want to point out

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.100
is, why is pi over
six potentially

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.680
a good guess to start with?

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.530
Well, the value, this
is the x-value 1,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.040
and this is the x-value 0.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.050
We know for a fact
that we have to have

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.970
this x-value line
between 0 and 1

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.520
because of where my point is
at the time that x equal 1,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.960
I'm all the way up at
y equals 3/2 up here.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.664
So at least we know
we're between 0 and 1.

00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:39.080
And then from there
you could even

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.820
try some other values like
pi over 3 and pi over 4

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.890
and put those in and
see how they compared.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.240
But at least, we'll
just say, at least we

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.420
know x is between 0
and 1, and pi over 6

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.730
is certainly in that region.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.554
So that's a good
first starting point.

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:53.970
Now I'm going to come over
here and start to do some work.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.570
If we want to
solve the equation,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.540
2 cosine x equals 3x,
what we're really doing

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.480
is we're looking for
zeros of this function.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.590
So we find the zeros of
this function, which we

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.840
know there's only one of them.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.160
We find the zero
of this function,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.430
then we actually have
solved 2 cosine x equals 3x.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.030
So hopefully that
makes sense to you

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.113
that we're actually going
to apply Newton's Method

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:25.860
to this function.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.318
And so when we apply Newton's
Method, we need the function.

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:29.696
We also need to the derivative.

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:31.740
So let me remind
you, to derivative

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.790
of this is going to be
negative 2 sine x minus 3.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.290
Right?

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.430
The derivative of cosine
x is negative sine x.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.810
And so this is exactly
the derivative.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.870
And then let me remind you
what Newton's Method says.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.860
It says the next x-value is
equal to the previous x-value

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.770
minus the fraction of
the function evaluated

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.810
at the previous value divided
by the derivative evaluated

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.830
at the previous value.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.920
Right?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.200
So this is the formula you
have for Newton's Method.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.530
So let's see if we can get from
x_0 to x_1 and then x_1 to x_2.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.490
So in our case, we have x_1
equals, well, x_0 is pi over 6.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.690
And then we have
minus the function

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.770
evaluated at pi over 6,
and then the derivative

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.750
evaluated at pi over 6.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.000
So the function evaluated at
pi over 6-- cosine of pi over 6

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.660
is root 3 over 2.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.940
So root 3 over 2 times
2-- we get a root 3.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.570
Separate that out.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.470
And then here, pi over
6 times 3 is pi over 2.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.400
So we get a minus pi over 2.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.630
Sine pi over 6 is 1/2.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.510
So we get negative
2 times 1/2-- we

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:48.660
get negative 1 and
then a negative 3.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.660
And if you simplify
this, you get

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.080
that this is approximately
0.564, or around that.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.970
OK?

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.970
And now from here, you
would then, for x_2,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.990
you're going to take 0.564
minus these things evaluated

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.600
at 0.564.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.400
This ratio, f of 0.564
divided by f prime at 0.564.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.480
But I'm not going to do
that because you should

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.890
get somewhere around, depending
on how many decimal places

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.630
you kept, you
should get something

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.220
around one of these two values.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.300
So you actually get,
after x_0, by x_1,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.770
you have something that is at
least fixed to the first two

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.900
decimal places.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.980
And then this third
decimal place, maybe it's

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.929
going to be a 4
or a 3 in the end.

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.720
But depending on what
value we choose here,

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.850
we might get slightly
different values here based

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.830
on the rounding.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.750
So just suffice it
to say, I got x_1.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.320
Your x_2 should
be about the same.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.911
It should be one of these two.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.410
OK.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.749
So let me just remind you
what we were doing here.

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.290
We were trying to
use Newton's Method

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.830
to find a solution
to an equation

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.414
that I had written up here,
this 2 cosine x equals 3x,

00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:03.830
and I pointed out
a couple things.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.820
I pointed out that finding
a solution to this equation

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.140
is the same as finding a
solution to the equation

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.640
cosine x equals 3/2 x.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.780
And so I did that as
a graph to sort of see

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.510
if I could get an initial
idea of what kind of solution

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:20.410
I was looking for.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.380
And then we just started
using Newton's Method

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.580
on a particular function.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.500
And that function was
this side of the equation

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.290
minus this side.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.970
Because if 2 cosine
x minus 3x equals 0,

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.670
then 2 cosine x equals 3x.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.700
So we had this function over
here, 2 cosine x minus 3x,

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.220
and I said I was looking
for zeros of that function.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.500
And that's where
Newton's Method comes in.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.070
So I think that is
where I will stop.
