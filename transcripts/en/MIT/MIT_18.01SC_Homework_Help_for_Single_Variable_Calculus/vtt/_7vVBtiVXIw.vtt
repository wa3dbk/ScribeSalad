00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.790
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.740
In this video I'd like us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.630
We're going to let capital F
of x equal the integral from 0

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.520
to x of little f of t dt.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.510
And I want us to find the
quadratic approximation

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.380
for big F near x equals 0
in terms of the little f.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.400
And then I want us to
answer this question.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.890
What assumptions do we have
to make about little f?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.330
You'll see we're making some
assumptions about little f.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.746
I want to know what
those assumptions are.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.620
So I'm going to give
you a little bit of time

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.130
to work on this problem.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.480
And then I'll be back and
I will work on it with you.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.349
Welcome back.

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:55.390
Hopefully you were able
to make some good headway

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.670
with this problem.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.710
So again, what we're trying to
do, is we've defined capital F.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.630
And we want to find the
quadratic approximation for it

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.800
near x equals 0 in
terms of little f.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.930
Knowing that capital F of x is
equal to the integral from 0

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.450
to x of little f of t dt.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.350
And then at the end,
we'll talk about what

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.150
are the assumptions we've made.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.490
So to start off, what
I actually want to do

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.920
is remind us, what is the
quadratic approximation

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.740
for capital F, just
in terms of itself?

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.360
Of capital F?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.160
So let me come over
to the right and we'll

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.630
write down what the
quadratic approximation is,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.590
near x equals 0.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.395
So, this gives us that F
of x is approximately F

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:50.120
of 0 plus F prime of 0 times
x plus F double prime at 0

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.860
over 2 times x squared.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.200
This is just the
quadratic approximation

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.610
of capital F at x equals 0.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.034
That's what it is.

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.200
So now all we need to do,
I've asked you to write it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.850
in terms of little f.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480
So what we need to do is figure
out what each of these things

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.230
actually is.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.470
What capital F of 0 is, what
capital F prime of 0 is,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.620
and what capital F
double prime of 0 is,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.910
in terms of the
function little f.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.580
So let's see.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.942
Well first, let's figure
out what capital F of 0 is.

00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:21.325
Let's write down what it is.

00:02:21.325 --> 00:02:26.202
The integral from 0
to 0 of f of t dt.

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:28.160
Well we know, when you
take the integral from a

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.390
to a of a function,
you should get 0.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.840
So capital F at 0 is just 0.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.770
So we have one piece.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.740
Now, let's figure out
what capital F prime is.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.360
Well, capital F
prime of x, we know

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.130
using fundamental
theorem of calculus--

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.130
let's just write it down
so we can see it easily--

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.830
we know this is
just little f of x.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.970
So if I wanted capital F prime
at 0, I just come over here.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.111
That's just going
to be little f at 0.

00:03:09.111 --> 00:03:11.360
So now, if we look back up
at what we have at the top,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.350
we filled in this part--
or we know that part,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500
that's 0-- we know this part.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.550
So now all we need is capital
F double prime evaluated

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.892
at x equals 0.

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:21.850
And then we'll be done.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.224
Now, how are we
going to do this?

00:03:23.224 --> 00:03:25.700
Well we know what
capital F prime is.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.170
So let's come in, sort of
up here, and look again.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.990
We know what capital F prime is.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.300
We know it's little f.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.050
So if I want to take a second
derivative, of capital F--

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.820
let me write that down here--
that's going to be taking

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.065
a derivative of little f.

00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:45.650
Right?

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.500
That'll be, that's
d/dx of little f of x.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.350
So I can just write this
as little f prime of x.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.700
So again, let me show
you where that came from.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.770
We knew big F prime
was equal to little f.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.490
So when I take another
derivative of this,

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.150
I have to take a
derivative of this.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.600
So that's why capital
F double prime

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.630
is equal to little f prime.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.750
So we're almost there.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.060
I think I'm about to run out
of room down here, so let

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.840
me come over a
little bit further.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.590
So now, we just need
to evaluate this at 0.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.392
Well, that's just going to be
evaluating little f prime at 0.

00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.600
So now I have all the pieces.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400
Let's come back in and
fill it in one more time.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.270
So what do I get?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.533
I get-- let me, now I
have all the pieces.

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.657
Now to answer the question.

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:42.990
Little f-- or sorry-- big F of
x, its quadratic approximation

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.200
is going to be big F of
0, which we said was 0.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800
So let's come over and look.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.650
Here's big F of 0.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.600
I know that's 0.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.580
And then I'm going to add to
that big F prime at 0 times x.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.845
That's little f of 0 times x.

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:02.220
Let's come back
over and do that.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.977
So we add to that
little f at 0 times x.

00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:08.810
And let's come back.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.268
One more thing
we're going to need.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.330
We need one more term.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.030
That's big F double prime
at 0 over 2 times x squared.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.420
That I've left big
F double prime at 0

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.200
is little f prime at 0.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.530
So that's f prime at 0
over 2 times x squared.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.790
So we had all the pieces.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.670
We just had to put them in.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.350
This does not look like an
approximately by the way.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.850
Sorry.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.170
There we go.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.220
So what do we get?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.050
This expression above
is equal to-- well why

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.050
did I write the 0 again?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.810
Sorry I was trying to
avoid writing the 0.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.880
It's equal to f of 0 times x
plus f prime of 0 over 2 times

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.030
x squared.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.390
So the quadratic approximation
of capital F in terms

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.160
of little f is exactly this.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.437
Now what assumptions are
we making about little f?

00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:04.520
Well to apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.920
you need little f is continuous.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.767
But we actually
need more than that.

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:08.850
Because what have we done?

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.340
We've actually taken a
derivative of little f.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.430
So we need that this function,
little f, is actually

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.240
differentiable.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.280
So that is, that actually
includes, of course,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.330
that little f is continuous.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.440
So we don't even have to say
continuous in the assumptions.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.440
We just have to
say, we're assuming

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.190
little f is differentiable,
at least near 0.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.790
So let's go back and just
remind ourselves what we did.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.873
I'm going to go all the
way over, remind ourselves

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:38.130
of the problem and kind
of bring us back through.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.720
So we started off with
this definition of big F.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.140
And I wanted us to find a
quadratic approximation for it

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.870
near x equals 0.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.940
And then we just mentioned,
what are the assumptions?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.700
So I reminded you,
first, of what

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.620
is the quadratic approximation
of big F in terms of itself,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.090
in terms of big F. And
we just write it out.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.490
And then we had defined what
is this in terms of little f,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.740
what is this in
terms of little f,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.017
and what is this in
terms of little f?

00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:09.100
And so what do we look at?

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.690
Well, we evaluate f of 0.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.610
That's easy enough.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.660
We found big F prime
in terms of little f.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.850
That's fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.840
And then we evaluate
that at x equals 0.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.810
And then we know that
if we want to take

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.040
a second derivative
of this function,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.120
we need to take a
derivative of the little f.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.290
And so we get big F double prime
is actually little f prime.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.330
So we evaluate that at 0 to
get big F double prime at 0.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.750
And then we come in and we just
fill in everything we needed.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.200
And so ultimately, this
is the final answer

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.440
of the quadratic approximation
of big F in terms of little

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.420
f near x equals 0.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.309
So I think that's
where we'll stop.
