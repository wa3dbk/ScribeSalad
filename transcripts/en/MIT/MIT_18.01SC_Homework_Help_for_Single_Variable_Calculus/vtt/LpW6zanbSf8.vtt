PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.150
Today we are going to talk
about an infinite series

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.680
and discuss its convergence.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.060
So in particular I have
this infinite series.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240
The sum from n
equals 1 to infinity

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.000
of 1 divided by the
product n times n plus 1.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.250
So what I'd like you
to do is to compute

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.820
a few terms of the series,
compute a few partial sums,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.350
and use that to get
a sense for what

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.750
you think the series is doing.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.080
Is it converging?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.877
Is it diverging?

00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:38.460
If it's converging,
can you figure out

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.650
what value it's converging to?

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.250
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.007
take some time to try that out,
see what you get, come back

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:48.090
and we can do it together.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.720
So this is a nice series.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.732
It has terms that
are easy to compute.

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:01.940
And I've taken the liberty
of computing a few of them

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.731
in advance, and I've
put them up over here.

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:08.760
So for n from 1 to 5, the
terms that we're adding up

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.920
are 1 over n times n plus 1.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.680
So that's when n
equals 1, that's

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.620
1 over 1 times 2, which is 1/2.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
When it is 2, it's 1 over
2 times 3, which is 1/6.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.274
Then we've got 1/12,
1/20, 1/30, and so on.

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:21.940
So those are the
things we're adding up.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.240
And then the partial sums,
the nth partial sums.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.390
Well, the first one is just
the first term, which is 1/2.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.699
The second one, we take the
first term and the second term

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:31.740
and we add them together.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.510
So 1/2 plus 1/6 is 2/3.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.910
The third one, we take
the first three terms

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.450
and add them together
and that gives us 3/4.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.490
And OK, so I computed the first
five partial sums here as well.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.720
Now, if you look
at this column-- so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.440
remember that the limit, that
the value of an infinite series

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.070
is defined to be the
limit of its partial sums.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.956
So if we want to know,
what is the value

00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:55.830
of this infinite series
that we started with,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.509
does it converge,
does it diverge,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.050
what we have to do
to figure that out

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.800
is we have to take
its partial sums

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.640
and we have to
compute their limit.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.450
And if we-- if their
limit doesn't exist,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.510
then it diverges.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.860
If their limit does exist,
then the sum of the series

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.460
is equal to what that
value of that limit is.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.560
And if you look at
these terms here,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.550
you'll see that they, there's
a little bit of a pattern

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.870
here, right?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.440
So these, this is 1/2,
2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.480
That's a pretty nice
sequence of numbers.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.130
It's, you know, we could
probably guess at this point

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.690
that the next one is going
to be 6/7 then 7/8 and so on.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.425
So that would be a guess.

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:39.880
One way we can
actually prove this

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.050
is, so we have this guess
that-- let me write it down.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.600
Guess is that S_n is
equal to n over n plus 1.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.880
Now if you wanted to confirm
this guess, what you'd

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.700
have to do is you have
to just figure out

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.770
how could you prove that.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.145
Well, one thing
you can do is you

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.480
can say, well, S n
plus 1 is equal to S_n

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.140
plus the next term, right?

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.260
So in our case, S n
plus 1 is equal to S_n

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.330
plus the next term, the n plus
first term, which in our case

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.570
is 1 over n plus
1 times n plus 2.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.210
So, all right, so
that's not maybe obvious

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.180
what to do with this, but
you could split this up,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.780
really you can split it
up by partial fractions.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.590
And you can write this as say
S_n plus-- so if you split this

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.400
up by partial fractions,
what you'll get

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.170
is that it's exactly equal
to 1 over n plus 1 minus 1

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.350
over n plus 2.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.850
And from here it's
easy to see that, well,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.170
if S_n is equal to
n over n plus 1,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.140
then this will be
equal to 1 minus 1

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.450
over n plus 2, which is
n plus 1 over n plus 2.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.510
And so using the process known
as mathematical induction,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.390
you have that it follows
for all values of n.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.660
So because of this nice
expression for the term,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.550
it's easy to see that this
pattern will continue forever.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.970
OK, and so that, you
know, that's just

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.900
a sketch of how you
would prove this.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.450
Now once you've
proven this, it's

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.290
easy to see that the-- once
you know that this is true,

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.160
it's easy to see what
this limit is, right?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.330
As n goes to infinity,
this just approaches

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.740
1 and that means
the series converges

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.675
and the limit of
the series is 1.

00:04:30.675 --> 00:04:33.050
So here we have a nice example
of a series that converges

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.789
and where it actually
is possible to compute

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:36.830
the limit of this series.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.210
This isn't possible for
most, for all series

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.370
or even for most series.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.830
Even ones with
fairly nice terms,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.800
it's often very difficult to
figure out what their limit is,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.220
but in this case
it's not hard to do

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.130
and we have precisely that
the value of the series is 1.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.040
So I'll end there.
