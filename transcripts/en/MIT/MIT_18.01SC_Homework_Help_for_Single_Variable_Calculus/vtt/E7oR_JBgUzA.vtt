CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.010
In this video I'd like
us to do two things.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.710
The first thing
we're going to do

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.820
is we're going to
graph the curve

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.770
r equals 1 plus
cosine theta over 2,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.400
for theta between 0 and
4 pi, and we're going

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
to graph it in the xy-plane.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.470
And then after we've
done that, we're

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.750
going to take a look at some
components of that curve

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.190
and we're going to calculate
the area of some components that

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.310
close up.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.900
So what I'd like you to do
first is get a good picture

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.244
of this curve, in the xy-plane.

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:40.910
I'll give you a little
while to do that.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.284
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:44.387
get a good picture
of that curve,

00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:46.470
then come back when you're
ready and I'll show you

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.700
how I graph it, and then we'll
get into these area problems.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.760
OK.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.720
Welcome back.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.940
So the goal, again, was to graph
a certain curve described by r

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.340
and theta, but in the xy-plane.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.880
For theta between
0 and pi over 4.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.910
And when I do these
problems, we want

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.460
to make sure that we understand
how r depends on theta.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.700
That's sort of the main
goal to graph this curve.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.800
So what I do,
actually, is I look

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.440
at this not in the
xy-plane, which

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.540
was what I said to
do in the problem,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.070
but I first look at it in what
we see as the r, theta plane.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.940
And what we mean
by that is we're

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.150
going to graph this just like
we would if this variable was x

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.430
and this variable was y.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.680
So we move out of what we know
about how r relates to x and y,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.290
and how theta
relates to x and y,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.660
and we just look at
how r relates to theta.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.330
So let me draw that
first and we'll

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.160
see if we can sort of
understand what I mean by that,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.900
and then we'll put that
picture, use that curve

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.790
to put that into the xy-plane.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.290
OK.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.835
So, the first thing
we do is I'm going

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:06.195
to let this be the theta-axis
and this be the r-axis.

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.570
And let's look at--

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.226
I want to write down over here
what the equation is so I don't

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:12.520
have to keep turning around.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.055
So again, this is
not, I don't want

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:18.880
to think about this
as the xy-plane.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.890
Because in the
xy-plane, theta has

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.930
certain values at
each point that

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.680
are fixed based on the angle.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.120
But now I'm letting theta
vary in this direction,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.290
and r is varying
in this direction.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.695
And my theta, I said,
was between 0 and pi

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:37.350
over 4-- I'm sorry,
not pi over 4.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.350
4*pi.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.200
0 and 4*pi.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.550
pi over 4 would be a very
small component of this

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.920
that I'm interested in.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.910
And let's think
about what happens,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.720
what kind of transformations
have been done

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780
to the normal cosine function.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.570
So if I took the
normal cosine function

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930
and I take it-- instead
of cosine theta,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.890
I look it cosine theta
over 2, what that's doing

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.900
is that's stretching
it horizontally out.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.580
So think about the period of
the cosine function usually is

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.910
2*pi.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.480
But notice what happens when
I put in 2*pi for theta,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.700
I'm getting cosine of pi.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.080
If I want to get cosine of 2*pi,
I have to let theta go to 4*pi,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080
which is why I'm letting
theta be between 0 and 4*pi.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.870
So dividing the input value
by 2 doubles your period.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.280
So the period is now 4*pi.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.220
So to get all the way through,
I'm going to have to go up

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.900
to 4*pi.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.910
So let me just make a 2*pi here,
and this is about a 4*pi here.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.620
So here's around 3 pi,
and here's around pi.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.880
So that now, instead of
the usual cosine function,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.380
it's going to take twice as
long to get all the way through.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.564
That's one thing we know.

00:03:47.564 --> 00:03:49.730
What else have we done to
the usual cosine function?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.420
We've moved it up by 1.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.190
And so instead of starting
out when your input is 0,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.940
starting out at height 1,
when you're input is 0,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.920
you start out at
height 1 plus 1.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.180
You start out at height 2.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.410
So in fact, this function,
let me point out,

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.930
it's going to start at
2, which means it also

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.520
is going to end over here.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.680
Because it's periodic,
it's going to end at 2.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.870
And let's think about
what else we know.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.380
We know that the usual
cosine function goes down

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.800
to negative 1.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.257
But I've added 1 to it, so
now it only goes down to 0.

00:04:25.257 --> 00:04:26.666
OK?

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.790
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.010
Maybe I should even-- hmm.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.600
I don't want to draw
the actual cosine

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.100
function again right on here.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.080
But let me draw the regular
cosine function here.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.620
So we have it,
the regular cosine

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
function-- because I
keep talking about it--

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.720
does something like this.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.380
It goes at 1 here, and
it's at 1 again here.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.530
And so it's at minus 1 at pi.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.290
And so, very roughly, it
looks something like this.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.680
Right?

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.480
So I keep referencing
the cosine function,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.730
so this is the part
I'm referencing.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.620
So we have to stretch it by
2, and then shift it up by 1.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.100
And so we see what
was at pi, negative 1,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.084
I'm now going to be at 2*pi, 0.

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:14.500
And then where do
these points go?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.540
This was pi over 2.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.160
The x-value is
going to be doubled.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.420
I'm going to be at pi, and the
y-value is going to go up by 1.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.050
So I'm at (pi, 1) and (3*pi, 1).

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.410
And so the curve will
look something like this.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.930
I'm not an expert here,
but hopefully that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.780
looks something like
the cosine function.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.230
But with a stretch and a shift.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.500
So that is the curve r equals
1 plus cosine theta over 2

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.510
in what we consider
the r, theta plane.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.690
So theta is varying
in this direction

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.840
and r is varying
in this direction.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.790
But how do I transfer
that to the xy-plane?

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.475
That's the real
point that I want

00:06:00.475 --> 00:06:02.830
to make about this problem.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.980
So let's look at what's
happening in the xy-plane.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.160
So this will be x
and this will be y.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.120
Let's pick some points and try
to figure out what's happening.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.150
So where is this point?

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.360
This is the point
zero comma two.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.820
When theta is 0, r equals 2.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.350
Where is theta equal
to 0 in this picture?

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.525
It's in the x-direction.

00:06:24.525 --> 00:06:25.310
Right?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.270
That's theta equals 0,
and also 2*pi and 4*pi.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.360
Any multiple of 2*pi, theta
is pointing in this direction.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.470
And r equals 2 there.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.260
So in a strange twist,
this is the point (2, 0)

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.540
on the x, y plane.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.210
But that's no going to,
that's just a coincidence, OK?

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.020
Don't think, oh, I'm just going
to flip the values everywhere.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.145
That's not going to happen.

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.357
OK?

00:06:51.357 --> 00:06:53.190
Actually, and also,
before I make a mistake,

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.190
I'm going to make this
a little bit bigger.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.360
I want it to be bigger.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.020
So I don't want this to be 2.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.350
I want this to be 1.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.380
I'm going to make this (2, 0).

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.790
I want to have a
little bigger picture.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:07.290
OK.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:14.010
So it's going to be (2, 0) at
theta equals 0 and r equal 2.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.070
Is it ever hit this point again?

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.741
Well, it is.

00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:19.240
And it's going to hit that point
again because it's periodic

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.840
and I've gone out to 4*pi.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.870
If I rotate all the way
around, I'm at 2*pi for theta.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.330
If I rotate all the way around
again I'm at 4*pi for theta,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.740
and my radius there is 2, also.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.120
So this (2, 0) happens again
when I have this point.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.931
So it's going to close up.

00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:34.430
OK.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.555
And then what else happens?

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.820
Well, as theta is
rotating, let's

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.110
take theta between 0 and pi.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.560
theta rotates from 0
to pi going like this.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.270
Notice what's happening
to the r-value.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.910
The r-value is going
from 2 down to 1.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.630
Now, I'm not going
to be totally exact,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.450
but-- here's minus 1,
OK, in the xy-plane.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.240
I'm not going to
be totally exactly,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.520
but this curve is
going to look something

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:13.975
like-- there's 2-- it's going
to look something like-- oops,

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:16.970
I overshot, we'll make
that negative 1-- something

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.470
like this.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.710
And what's the point?

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.950
The point is that I start
at radius 2, and by the time

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.240
I get to theta equals
pi I've gone down.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.740
And so my radius is 1.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.850
This has radius 1 and angle pi.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.200
So that represents
this part of the curve.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.400
That's this part of the curve.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.560
Now, what's nice
about this drawing

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.930
is that we know this
part of the curve

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.310
and this part of the curve
should look exactly the same.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.110
So once I've drawn half of this,
I'm going to know everything.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.930
Once I've gone from 0 to 2*pi, I
can just reflect it, basically.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.290
We'll see what I mean
by reflect in this case,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.690
but the same radii are
happening again and some sort

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.420
of symmetric fashion.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:00.920
OK.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.240
So we've got 0 to pi.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.650
Now what happens
between pi and 2*pi?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.420
Notice pi to 2*pi in the theta
direction on the xy-plane is I

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:11.820
start in this direction-- I
don't know if you can see that,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.430
let me come over to this side--
I start in this direction

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.620
for pi, and I'm
going to rotate down.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.490
This is 3*pi over
2, and this is 2*pi.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.470
Those are my angles.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.310
So what are my radii?

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:30.740
Well, I start at radius 1
and I'm going to radius 0.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.470
And so what happens is I'm
coming through this negative 1

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.697
and I'm coming around, and
then by the time I get--

00:09:39.697 --> 00:09:41.280
it's going to be
something like this--

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.260
by the time I get to
2*pi, my radius is 0.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.170
Now just to make sure this
curve makes sense to you,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.082
you could pick a place, an
angle, maybe like right here.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:54.540
I don't know if
that's easy to see,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.210
but maybe that
angle right there.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.480
That angle is between
3*pi over 2 and 2*pi.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.280
Is there positive radius there?

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.900
Yeah, there is
positive radius there.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.540
So in fact, this curve does
come into this fourth quadrant

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.910
here and then curve back in.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.410
OK?

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.350
It does curve back in.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.850
All right.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.650
So then what happens
between 2*pi and 3*pi?

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.150
OK.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.310
Hopefully this picture
is clear so far.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.240
I'm going to come back
to the other side.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.740
OK.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.390
What happens between
2*pi and 3*pi?

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.020
2*pi, we're here.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.720
And 3*pi, we're back
over here again.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.690
And notice that the radius is
going to be doing the same kind

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.350
of growth that it did between
2*pi and 3*pi as it did decay

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.845
from pi to 2*pi.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.500
OK?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.910
Because the radii now,
there's a symmetry

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.490
with how the radii behave.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.600
So from 2*pi to 3*pi, I start
off with radius 0 and I have

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.120
a small radius.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.380
And then once I get
to 3*pi over here,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.756
I'm going to have
radius 1 again.

00:10:54.756 --> 00:10:56.546
I'm going to be at
radius 1, which is going

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:57.840
to correspond to this point.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.390
So I'm going to have exactly
the same picture, which

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.265
is dangerous because I
probably would do it wrong.

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:06.840
But I'll try and draw it this
way and then talk about it.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.480
Hopefully that looks
about the same.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.570
So this curve coming through
here was from pi to 2*pi.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.750
This curve coming through
here was from to 2*pi to 3*pi.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.470
And then to finish it off, 3*pi
to 4*pi is going to look like

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.310
this curve here.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.150
So I come through-- ooh, this
is where it starts to get really

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.980
dangerous, but let's say
that's pretty close--

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.160
so there's my 3*pi to 4*pi.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.660
It's again, the
same growth the way

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.260
it was decaying
between 0 and pi.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:44.360
So this is your picture in the
xy-plane of the curve r equals

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.150
1 plus cosine theta over 2.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.900
Now, we haven't calculated
any area problems, yet.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.470
So what I'd like us to do is
I'm going to shade two regions,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.430
and I want us to just write
down the integral form

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.070
to find the area for
each of these regions.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:09.600
So the first region of
interest is the pink region.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.750
I'm going to ask us to find
the area of the pink region,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.420
and then I'm going to ask us
to find the area of everything

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:17.435
else, the blue region.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.480
So let's think about
how to do that.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.980
And I think I'm going to have
to come over to the other side

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.440
to write down the integrals, but
I'll be coming back and forth.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.660
So just to remind
you, what you saw

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:40.550
in lecture was that dA is equal
to r squared over 2 d theta.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.740
That's what dA is.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.960
And so this is going to
be an integral in theta,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.650
and we know what r is
as a function of theta.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.150
And so if I want
to find-- actually,

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.330
I should even use my
colors appropriately.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:59.710
I should say, the
pink area is going

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.860
to be equal to an integral.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.780
And I'm going to
write the r squared.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.010
I know what r squared is.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:10.200
It's 1 plus cosine
theta over 2 squared,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.560
and then an over 2 d theta.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.810
And then what is
important about this?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.590
It's our bounds.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.090
Right?

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.800
Our bounds are what's important.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.760
And so let's go back and
let's look at our picture.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.680
What are the bounds on
theta for the pink region?

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.540
So where does that pink
region start and stop?

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.530
And maybe we even need to
look at this top graph, also.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.280
So if we think about
it, we went from 0 to pi

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.066
to get this outer curve.

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:39.440
So how do we get
the inner curve?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:44.070
The inner curve started at
theta equals pi, went to here,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.900
went to here-- that
was theta equals 3*pi.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.160
So it went all the
way from pi to 3*pi.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.780
Now, if you're paying
good attention,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.300
you can say, well, Christine,
we know that this region is

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.550
totally symmetric.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.730
So why don't I just take
the area from pi to 2*pi

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.470
and multiply it by 2?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.340
And you can.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.910
You can do it either way.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.900
So you can either take the
integral from all the way from

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.880
pi to 3*pi, which corresponds
to starting at this angle,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.324
going all the way around,
and coming back to there,

00:14:16.324 --> 00:14:18.240
which takes you all the
way around this curve.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.780
Or you can go from pi to
2*pi and multiply that by 2.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.470
So let me come back and
let me write that down.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:32.430
It's either pi to 3*pi, this,
or you just write it as integral

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.310
from pi to 2*pi.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.430
And if I multiply this
by 2, the 2 drops out.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.477
The 2 in the
denominator drops out.

00:14:44.407 --> 00:14:46.240
I'm not going to solve
this problem for you,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.781
but I do want to point out the
kinds of terms you would have.

00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:51.060
You would have a constant
term when you square this.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.150
You would have a term that
was 2 cosine theta over 2,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.980
which is easy to integrate
by a u-substitution.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.450
And then you would have
a cosine squared theta

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.460
over 2, which you'd want
to use the double angle

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.940
formula or the
half angle formula

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.060
that you've seen used to
manipulate these integrals that

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.680
involve just a cosine
squared or a sine squared.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.600
So that would be your strategy.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.175
OK, now let's look
at the blue area.

00:15:13.175 --> 00:15:13.675
OK.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.840
So to find the
blue area, again, I

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.307
know all that matters
is really the bounds.

00:15:24.307 --> 00:15:26.515
We're going to see we have
to do a little extra work.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.000
But this is our first setup.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.861
And now let's go
look at the bounds.

00:15:32.861 --> 00:15:33.360
OK.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.880
So we go back to the curve.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.020
All right.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.000
What is the blue area?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.730
Well, the blue area,
that's a little harder.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.680
So let's see what happens.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:49.490
If I were to take theta from
0 to pi, what would happen?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.460
I would not only pick
up the blue area,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.100
but I'd pick up this
pink stuff inside.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.640
But I don't want the pink stuff.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.290
I just want the blue stuff.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.020
So what am I going to have to
do to find the blue area just,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.980
say, from 0 up to pi?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.641
I'm going to have to find
the area from 0 to pi,

00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:06.390
and then I'm going to
have to subtract off

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.722
the area of this component.

00:16:07.722 --> 00:16:09.184
OK?

00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:10.600
But we know,
actually, how to find

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.290
the area of this component.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.790
OK.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.069
So hopefully this makes sense.

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.110
Because let's think about,
when I'm finding area,

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.050
I'm going from the
origin and I'm coming out

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.020
and I have the radius out there.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:24.770
So when I integrate this
dA from 0 to pi for theta,

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.630
I'm picking up
pieces that come out,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.500
little sectors that
come out like this

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.880
between pi over 2 and pi.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.310
So I'm getting more area
than I want if I just

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:36.740
let theta go between 0 and pi.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.900
So I have to
calculate all of it,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.751
and then I have to take
away the extra stuff.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:42.250
OK.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.820
So the blue area is
actually the bigger area

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.180
subtracting the smaller area.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.890
And so how am I
going to write this?

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.230
If we come back over, I'm
just going to take 2 times

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.440
this whole thing.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.220
So I'm going to
take 2 times this.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.580
And I know I have to
integrate it from 0 to pi.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.850
And I'm taking 2 times because
it's symmetric, remember.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.310
And then I'm going to subtract
track off this one that's 2

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.250
times the thing from pi to 2*pi.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.750
Now, you might say,
well, Christine,

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.190
the pink stuff I'm interested
in between 0 and pi is actually

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.714
theta between not pi and
2*pi, but 2*pi and 3*pi.

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:17.880
But again, there's all this
symmetry in the problem.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.270
So it doesn't really matter.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.310
But if you're a
stickler, I guess

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.790
I'll even write it this
way just to make sure.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.869
So I'll write it as 2*pi to 3*pi
so that everyone's very happy.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:28.369
OK?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.240
So again, what do we do?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.460
These 2's divide out.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.600
So from 0 to pi of
r squared d theta,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.890
that's going to give me the
area of the blue plus the pink.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.010
And then 2*pi to 3*pi of 1
plus cosine over theta over 2

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:54.510
squared d theta is going to
give me the area of the pink.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.920
So the blue plus the
pink is over here,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.320
and then the pink is over here.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.280
So when I subtract that
off I just get the blue.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.030
OK.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.562
Let me, again, just
go back one more time

00:18:05.562 --> 00:18:07.520
and point out what we
did at the very beginning

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.540
to remind us what was happening.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.540
And then I will finish.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.700
So let's come back over here.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.056
So the idea was to graph
this curve that was

00:18:17.056 --> 00:18:19.620
in r is a function of theta.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.410
And I was supposed to
understand what that

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.140
looked like in the xy-plane.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.280
And so my trick was to take
the relationship between r

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.020
and theta and graph
that explicitly in an r,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.996
theta plane-- so
I let theta vary

00:18:35.996 --> 00:18:37.370
in the horizontal
direction and r

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.160
vary in the vertical direction--
and I can do that very easily.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.830
And then translate
that into the xy-plane.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.730
So my curve, again,
went the big part,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.390
the little part here, little
part here, big part here.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.760
That was the order.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.045
So if you need arrows on
it, this was the order.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.890
And then once I had that,
the problem was about areas.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.200
And there was a lot of
symmetry in this problem,

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.260
but the main point
I wanted to show

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.640
was just knowing where your
theta starts and stops is not

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.940
enough to determine
an area of a region,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.430
if that region is excluding some
part that would be potentially

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.780
counted twice.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.940
So that was the reason I wanted
you to calculate not just

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.420
the pink area, but also see
that the blue is not from theta

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.250
from 0 to pi, but you have to
subtract off this extra stuff

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.230
that you counted.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.946
And I guess that is
where I will stop.
