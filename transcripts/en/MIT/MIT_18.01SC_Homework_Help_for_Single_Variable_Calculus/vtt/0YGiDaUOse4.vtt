00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.010
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.560
Today what I want to do is
something maybe a little bit

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.870
more theoretical,
but the goal is

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.440
to show that
something that you are

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.970
going to be
repeatedly doing when

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.260
you use quadratic approximations
is, in fact, true.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.270
So I'm going to
explain the situation,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.290
give a quick example,
and then show you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.980
what we're setting out to do.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.950
So the situation is
as follows: we're

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.750
going to-- any time you
see a Q of f, that's

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.550
going to represent the
quadratic approximation to f

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.900
at x equals 0.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.070
So what I've done
is say, Q of f I'm

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.412
going to define to be the thing
on the right, which is exactly

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.870
the formula you
were given in class

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.350
for the quadratic approximation
of a function f at x equals 0.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.350
So f is approximately the
thing on the right near 0.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.520
Our goal is to
show that if I want

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.980
to take the quadratic
approximation

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.290
of a product of two
functions, that I

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.530
can do it in a different way.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.030
I can do it in the way written
on the right hand side, which

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.680
actually looks more complicated
in this notation, but is,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.200
in fact, easier in reality.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.790
So let me explain
what's happening

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.772
and then I'll give
you an example.

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:13.730
If I wanted to take the
quadratic approximation

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.630
of a product of two
functions, what I want to show

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.180
is that instead, I could take
the quadratic approximation

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.159
of each individual function,
multiply those together,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.200
and then take the quadratic
approximation of what

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.460
I get as a result.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.870
So let me give you
an easy example.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.770
For instance, let's
let f of x equal

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.720
e to the x and let's
let g of x equal sine x.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.260
Then what is Q of f?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.065
Q of f is the quadratic
approximation to e to the x

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.150
at x equals 0.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.350
And that's going to be 1 plus
x plus x squared over 2--

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.640
your already knew this.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600
And g, the quadratic
approximation of sine x,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.160
is just x.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.660
So if I wanted to find the
quadratic approximation

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.970
to e to the x sine
x, what I could

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.600
do-- what this is
claiming I can do--

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.680
is instead I can take the
quadratic approximation

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.640
of this function
times this function.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.430
So instead I can take the
quadratic approximation

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.900
of-- f was the e to the
x-- 1 plus x plus x squared

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.470
over 2, times x.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.600
That's not a 4, sorry.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.340
That's a parentheses.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.320
1 plus x plus x squared
over 2, times x.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.040
And what is that?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.440
The quadratic
approximation to that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.230
is the quadratic
approximation to x plus x

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.860
squared plus x cubed over 2.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.230
And at x equals 0, if
I have a polynomial,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.060
the quadratic approximation
to a polynomial at x equals 0

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.830
is just all the terms up
to the quadratic term.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.710
So I drop off
higher-order terms.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.260
So I just get x plus x squared.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.260
So that's the idea.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.640
The idea is I have a
product of two functions,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.010
I know their individual
quadratic approximations,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.555
and so what I want
to do is I want

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:16.770
to find the quadratic
approximation of this product

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.410
by exploiting the
fact that I already

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.544
know their individual
ones, and explain

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:22.710
the fact that quadratic
approximation of polynomials

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.510
at x equals 0 is very easy.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.780
So that's the example,
that's the idea.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.111
So now let's see
if we can do it.

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:30.610
OK.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.370
So we have a cheat
sheet up here that I'm

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.670
going to refer back to.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.961
I didn't want to use it again
and I didn't want to have

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.250
to derive this for you, but
we have the product rule:

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.250
f*g prime is equal to
what's on the right,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.890
and f*g double prime is
equal to what's on the right.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.067
So my goal here is
to show, remember,

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:49.650
that the quadratic
approximation-- let

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.880
me point over here again.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.790
The goal is to show the
quadratic approximation of f*g

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.710
is equal to the quadratic
approximation of quadratic

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.364
approximation of f times the
quadratic approximation of g.

00:04:01.364 --> 00:04:03.530
So let's do, well let's do
the right-hand side first

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.865
because that's a little nicer.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.490
And then we'll show
the right-hand side

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.073
and then we'll show
the left-hand side

00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:09.400
and we'll show they're equal.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.470
So let me start here
with the right-hand side.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.970
OK?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.350
So, let's look at what's the
quadratic approximation of f

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.270
and what's the quadratic
approximation of g

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.560
and then we'll take their
final quadratic approximation.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.100
So Q of f, we have exactly
what we need there.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:39.580
f of 0 plus f prime of 0 times x
plus f double prime of 0 over 2

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.360
x squared.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.270
Q of g is equal to g of
0 plus g prime of 0 times

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.450
x plus g double prime
at 0 over 2 x squared.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.214
So now what I'm going to do is
multiply those two together.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.380
And I'm actually going to
swing this way a tiny bit,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.880
if that's OK, to write
Q of f times Q of g

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.594
because it's going
to be a little long.

00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:09.260
And I'm going to group
them carefully so

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.343
that I have all the
higher-order terms at the end.

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:12.990
OK?

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.550
So I'm going to
get f of 0 g of 0

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.720
by multiplying
these two together.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.080
And then I'm going to get
two terms involving an x.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.900
I'm going to get an f prime
times g and a g prime times f.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.460
Actually, if you'll
allow me, we'll

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.530
know that anywhere
we see an f or a g

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.120
or an f prime or a g
prime, or an f double prime

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.220
or g double prime, they're
all evaluated at 0.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.040
So I'm going to drop the
0's from here on out.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.200
Anywhere you see those,
I'm evaluating them at 0.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.480
Otherwise this will
be way too long.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.340
So let me write
this just as f*g.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.630
I can even write just a
single one evaluated at 0.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.640
It's the product evaluated at 0.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.140
And then I have f prime g--
so I'll just evaluate it

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:08.680
at 0 at the end of the product--
plus f g prime evaluated at 0.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.990
This whole thing is times x.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.920
I get an x here,
I get an x here.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.295
Now I need to figure out what
terms give me an x squared.

00:06:15.295 --> 00:06:17.010
OK?

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.690
So the terms that
give me an x squared

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.220
are f of 0 times g
double prime over 2.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.720
That gives me an x squared.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.380
f double prime times g
gives me an x squared.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.100
And f prime g prime
gives me an x squared.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.750
So let's write out those terms.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:43.900
I get f g double prime at 0 over
2-- from those two-- plus g f

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.890
double prime at 0 over
2-- from those two-- plus

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.610
f prime g prime at 0,
all times x squared.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.166
So there's an x times an x
there, gives you an x squared.

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:02.710
x squared there,
x squared there.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.140
Now I could keep
going, and I will

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.260
mention the higher-order
terms, but I'm not

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.385
going to write them all
the way out because of what

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:10.900
we're about to do.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.960
Let me show you
where they come from.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.240
You get an x cubed
term from here

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.280
and an x cubed term from here.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.500
Maybe I'll write the x cubes,
but I won't write the x

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.240
to the fourth.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:30.030
So the x cubed terms are f
prime g double prime 0 over 2

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.350
plus g prime f double
prime at 0 over 2.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.670
And those are my x cubed terms.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.540
And then I got some x
to the fourth terms.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.260
And where do the x to the
fourth terms come from?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.350
They come from this product.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.670
Right?

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.287
But I want to point
out something.

00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:54.370
What I'm going to do, I'm
going to work some magic

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.450
on the board.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.840
This is a quadratic
approximation

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.190
of f times a quadratic
approximation of g.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.250
Let me come over
here and remind you

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.690
that I want the quadratic
approximation of that product.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.280
So what I'm going
to do is go back

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.957
and look at what
I need from there,

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.040
to be the quadratic
approximation of that product.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.820
So we come back over here.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.880
If I apply the
quadratic approximation

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.930
to this thing,
which means then I'm

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:23.910
applying it to this whole giant
thing, what do I actually get?

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.160
This is actually a polynomial.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.390
I have something-- I have
a linear term, I have an x,

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.015
I have an x squared,
I have an x cubed,

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:33.330
I have an x to the fourth.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.850
So if I apply that
quadratic approximation,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.120
let's see what stays.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.240
This term stays.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.180
This term stays.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.099
This term stays.

00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:49.390
I'm going to erase what
disappears because I don't want

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.010
us to get confused by that.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.360
So these two terms disappear.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:52.860
Why?

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.630
Because again, this
is a polynomial.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.840
I have linear-- or I
have constant, I'm sorry,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.210
I think I called this maybe
linear earlier-- constant,

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.500
linear, quadratic term.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.760
And what I need is just
those if I'm looking

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.510
for a quadratic approximation.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.740
So constant, linear,
quadratic term.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.155
I immediately drop the
cubic and the quartic term

00:09:13.155 --> 00:09:15.030
when I'm looking at a
quadratic approximation

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.340
of a polynomial at 0.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.760
So if I want the
right-hand side,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.361
I just need what's
underlined in blue.

00:09:23.361 --> 00:09:25.860
So now I'm going to put a big
box around that because that's

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.270
going to be important.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.370
Whatever else happens,
we don't lose that.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.530
So now we've done
the right-hand side.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.110
And now let's write out
what is the left-hand side.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.117
And that's just going
to be plugging it

00:09:37.117 --> 00:09:38.200
straight into the formula.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.080
And using our cheat sheet.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.640
So Q of f*g, let me write
out the definition and then

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.590
we'll use the cheat sheet.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.960
It's f*g at 0-- again,
this is f at 0, g at 0,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.040
that's what this
notation means--

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:06.140
plus f*g quantity prime at
0 times x plus quantity f*g

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.890
double prime at 0 over
2 times x squared.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.670
And now what we're
hoping, remember,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.960
is that what's in the box
is what shows up over here.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.160
Because this is the long
way to do the problem.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.530
This would be if I took
either the x sine x

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.586
and I took all the derivatives.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:23.960
And this, in fact,
even though it

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.980
looks more confusing
in evaluating

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.890
such a quadratic
approximation, this way

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.890
would be the easier way.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.480
We just want to show we
don't lose anything by doing

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.280
what would be the easier way.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.484
So I get f*g at 0.

00:10:41.484 --> 00:10:43.900
And that's good-- we can see
we already have one of those,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.450
so that's nice.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.460
What do I get here?

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:55.240
I get f prime g at 0 plus
g prime f at 0 times x.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.740
That comes-- let
me remind you, I'll

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.420
walk over here-- comes
from the cheat sheet.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.510
The first thing.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.550
f*g prime is f prime
g plus g prime f.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.450
We know that one pretty
well, but just to remind you.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.570
So that's where this
term comes from.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.160
This looks promising
because if we come back

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.980
to our quadratic of quadratic
of f times quadratic of g,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.130
it looks exactly like
the second term here.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.090
So now we're hoping that the x
squared term looks like this.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.840
The only thing that
might make you nervous

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.904
is this doesn't have
an over 2, but if you

00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:25.570
were paying attention
to the cheat sheet

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.236
you'll probably see
where that's coming.

00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:29.060
And I'll point it
out in one moment.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.100
So f*g double prime,
using the cheat sheet,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:39.040
is f double prime g plus g
double prime f plus 2 g prime f

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.010
prime.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.450
I should have put 0's in there.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.000
Just to be consistent let
me put these 0's in there.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.890
2 f prime g prime at 0.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.540
And then I have to divide
the whole thing by 2

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.800
because there's a
divided by 2 there,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.332
and then times x squared.

00:11:59.332 --> 00:12:01.730
So let me move out of
the way for a moment.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:05.340
So this numerator came
from the cheat sheet

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.710
for the second derivative.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.280
And if you need, we can go back.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.260
Let me just remind
you, here it is.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.666
You can work it
out for yourself.

00:12:12.666 --> 00:12:15.040
You can just take the derivative
of the first derivative.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.835
But that's where
this comes from.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:19.210
So let me go back and we're
almost done with the problem.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.160
So what do we see?

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.630
Well, we see that
we get f*g at 0.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.810
We get the second term
we want, f prime g at 0

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.090
plus g prime f at 0 times x.

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.590
And then the third
term is, in fact,

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:45.080
exactly what we want because
we get f double prime g at 0

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:52.810
over 2 plus g double prime f at
0 over 2 plus-- the 2's divide

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:58.280
out-- and I get f prime g
prime at 0 time x squared.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.190
And if we look at
this last term and we

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.130
look at the squared term
in the box we see, in fact,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.250
they are exactly the same.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.850
So let me summarize because
this was kind of a long video.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.580
So I'm going to go
back to the beginning,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.829
give you the example, and
tell you what we were really

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:14.382
trying to do here.

00:13:14.382 --> 00:13:15.590
So let's come back over here.

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.000
And let me remind
you, the goal was

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.060
to show that if I wanted to
take a quadratic approximation

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.780
of a product of two
functions, if I already

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.890
knew their individual
quadratic approximations,

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.670
you were told that you
could take those two

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.020
quadratic approximations,
multiply them, and drop off

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.230
the higher-order terms.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.180
The higher order than 2.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.680
So we had an example.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.210
We knew these two
quadratic approximations.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.370
And you've been told that
quadratic approximation

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.300
of their product is just
the quadratic approximation

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.000
of the product of their
quadratic approximations.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.220
And so our goal
today was to show

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.000
that you don't drop
any of the terms

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.130
that you get if you do it by
this method or by this method.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.630
And we've done that.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.208
So I think I'll stop there.
