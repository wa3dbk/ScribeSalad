00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:07.690
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.480
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.380
Last time in lecture
you started learning

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.330
about implicit differentiation.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.450
And you saw some examples of
how implicit differentiation can

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.130
be used to compute
derivatives of functions

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.230
defined implicitly.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.390
So let's do another
example today.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.590
So here I have a curve that's
defined by the implicit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.220
equation y cubed plus
x cubed equals 3x*y.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.980
And I'd like to
know what the slope

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.370
of the tangent
line to that curve

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.800
is at the point (4/3, 2/3).

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.140
So before we start
doing anything,

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.450
let me just make a
couple of observations.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.290
If you don't believe me,
that the point (4/3, 2/3)

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.950
is on this curve, you can always
check by plugging the values in

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.680
and confirm that really, yes,
4/3 cubed plus 2/3 cubed is

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.470
equal to 3 times 2/3 times 4/3.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.080
So it's-- how I found this
point is maybe a little magical.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.320
Because as you can
see, this equation

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.420
is really a tough
one to solve for y.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.310
What you sort of--
natural thing to want

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.040
to do when asked this
question is to solve for y

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.950
and get an equation for
y in terms of x and then

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.411
take the derivative using the
various differentiation rules

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.244
that you've learned.

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:24.320
But here, this is-- I'll
let you in a secret.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.990
There is a way to do this.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.060
But it's really hard.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.075
It's really ugly and it's
beyond the scope of this course.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.770
So really we're much
better off treating

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.190
this as an implicit
differentiation problem

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.400
than as an explicit
differentiation problem.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.650
So having said that, why don't
you take a minute or two.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.000
Try and have a go
at this yourself.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.240
And then we'll come back and
work through it together.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.265
All right, so welcome back.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.890
We were in the middle-- we were
just about to start, actually--

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.990
solving this problem, computing
the slope of the tangent line

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.060
to the curve y cubed plus
x cubed equals 3x*y at this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.680
point, (4/3, 2/3).

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.610
So the slope of the tangent
line is the value y prime

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.290
of x at that point.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.940
So we need to answer
this question.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.460
What we need to do is we need
to find the derivative of y.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.560
But as I said earlier, this
is tough to do explicitly,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.760
to find y in terms of
x, so we're going to use

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.340
implicit differentiation.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.060
So, so we start
with this equation,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.330
y cubed plus x cubed equals 3x*y
and we can take a derivative

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.530
with respect to x.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.580
So some parts--
all right, so let's

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.990
start with it in the
order it's given.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.770
So you have y cubed.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.525
If you take a derivative of y
cubed with respect to x, what

00:02:42.525 --> 00:02:47.400
you need to use the chain
rule because y is implicitly

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.320
a function of x and so y
cubed is the chain rule.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.330
It's the cubed function
applied to the y function.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.410
And this is true of implicit
differentiation in general.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.920
That the reason
that we can do this,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.210
the really fundamental
reason this works

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.450
is that we have the chain rule
and that it lets us evaluate

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.310
derivatives of compositions.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.178
So in our case we have,
so we take a derivative

00:03:10.178 --> 00:03:12.386
of the whole thing, of this
whole I'm going to write,

00:03:12.386 --> 00:03:12.518
this is a little
sloppy notation,

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:13.851
but I hope you know what I mean.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.880
We have this
identity and so we're

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.480
going to take a derivative
of the whole thing.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.910
And so the first
part on the left, we

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.280
get the derivative of y cubed.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.520
So by the chain
rule, so we first

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.740
take the derivative of
the cube function at y

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.640
and then multiply by
the derivative of y.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.230
So this is the
derivative of y cubed.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.370
It just gives us 3 y squared.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.512
So that's what happens when you
just deal with the cubed part.

00:03:47.512 --> 00:03:49.720
But then we need to multiply
by-- in the chain rule--

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.570
by the derivative of the inside.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.405
Which in this
context is dy by dx.

00:03:56.405 --> 00:03:58.490
OK.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.960
Plus the derivative of x cubed.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.470
That's more straightforward.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.520
Nothing really
complicated going on here.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.310
We've seen this for
a little while now.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.765
It's just 3x squared equal--

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:11.265
OK.

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:14.420
So on the right now, we don't
actually have a chain rule,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.470
we have a product
rule situation here.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.220
We have 3 times x times y.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.410
So 3 is just a constant.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.230
And so we could just
pull it out in front.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.600
So we take the
derivative of x*y.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.420
So we take the derivative of
the first times the second

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.810
plus the derivative of the
second times the first.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.663
So the derivative of
the first is just--

00:04:30.663 --> 00:04:34.840
ah sorry, x is the first,
so its derivative is 1.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.720
So we got 3 times
the second is y.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.540
Plus-- OK, so we
take the first times

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.230
the derivative of the
second, which is dy by dx.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.160
So because this is
an identity it holds

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.690
for all values of x and y.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.900
This equality follows
just by taking

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.051
the derivative of both sides.

00:04:59.051 --> 00:04:59.550
Good.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.460
So now the thing
we want is that we

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.280
want the slope of the tangent
line at a particular point.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.190
So we want to isolate dy/dx.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.040
That's the thing
we're trying to find.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.530
So here, if you're only
interested in dy/dx,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.180
this is actually a linear
equation in some sense, right?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.470
We have dy/dx, a
constant, something--

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.100
or, it's not a constant--
something times dy/dx

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.860
plus something equals something
plus something times dy/dx.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.956
There are no squares of
dy/dx is what I really mean.

00:05:32.956 --> 00:05:33.456
So OK.

00:05:33.456 --> 00:05:34.430
So that that's nice.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.530
It makes it relatively
easier to solve,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.780
so we can just combine all
the terms with dy/dx in them.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.400
Let's say we'll combine maybe,
put them over here and put

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.700
everything else over there.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.110
So over here we
get, so dy/dx, so we

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.600
have a 3 y squared minus a 3x.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:06.580
And on the other side we have
a 3y minus a 3 x squared.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.590
And so this is times,
multiplication there.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.670
And so we want dy by
dx just by itself.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.370
So we can just divide through
by 3 y squared minus 3x.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:23.023
So then we have dy/dx
is equal to-- well,

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:24.864
all right, so there
are a lot of 3's here.

00:06:24.864 --> 00:06:26.780
There's a constant
multiple of 3 on this side,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.930
a constant multiple
of 3 on this side.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.013
Those are going to cancel.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:39.210
So this is y minus x squared
over y squared minus x.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.850
OK, so at any point
(x, y) on this curve,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.190
the slope of the tangent line is
given by this expression here.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.950
And we're interested
in a particular point

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:50.616
in this problem.

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:54.220
We're interested in the
point 4/3 comma 2/3.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:06.910
So at let me take that back up
here so at the point 4/3 comma

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.000
2/3 we have dy by dx.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.080
So OK, we just we just
plug that value of y

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.550
and that value of x into
this formula that we've got.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:27.860
So that's 2/3 minus 4/3
squared is 16/9 over-- well,

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:36.670
let's see, 2/3 squared
is 4/9 minus 4/3.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.600
All right, so we have a
little bit of rational number

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.030
arithmetic here.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.380
Maybe I'll multiply top
and bottom through by 9

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.860
to get 6 minus 16
over 4 minus 12.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.912
So this is negative 10 over
negative 8, which is 5 over 4.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.000
And if we go back to
the picture that I drew,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.640
it actually looks pretty
reasonable over here, right?

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.930
This slope of this
tangent line is actually

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.150
a little bit bigger than 1.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:13.220
Great.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.790
So that's that.
