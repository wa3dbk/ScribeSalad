00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.362
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:09.820
In this video I
want to talk to you

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.160
about another test
for convergence

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.174
we have for series,
that you haven't really

00:00:14.174 --> 00:00:16.090
spent any time looking
at this particular one.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.410
And it's pretty
helpful, and also will

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.710
help us understand something
about Taylor series, which

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.200
I'll do in another video.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.090
So this is the ratio test.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.280
And you'll understand the name
of this test, momentarily.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.522
So we're going to start
with a series-- sorry--

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:36.210
we're going to start with a
series that we'll just say,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.380
we'll call each term a sub n.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.010
And I'm not going to
tell you where n starts,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.120
because it doesn't matter.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.744
It's really going to
only matter what's

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:46.725
happening out at infinity.

00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.100
And to make things
simpler, we're

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.250
going to let all the
terms be positive.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.726
OK?

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:55.100
You, if they're
not positive, you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.080
can take the absolute
value of all the terms

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.440
and still make some
conclusions in terms

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.270
of absolute convergence.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.670
So that's just a little sidebar.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.260
But let's just deal with
all the terms positive,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.390
so we don't have to
worry about anything.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.310
And now, what does
the ratio test say?

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.090
Well, the ratio test
says that first, we

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.510
consider a certain ratio.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.450
The limit as n goes to infinity
of a sub n plus 1 over a sub n.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.950
OK?

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.380
So we consider this limit.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.719
Well, that's your ratio.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.510
What is this doing?

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.780
This is taking a term, and it's
dividing by the previous term.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.000
You do that for all
of the values for n,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.450
as n goes to infinity,
and you look at the limit,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.621
if it exists.

00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:39.120
OK?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.230
If the limit doesn't exist,
then you can't use this test.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.780
So sometimes that will happen.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.510
But if the limit exists,
you can use this test,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.740
and you say it equals L.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.360
And then you have the following
conclusions you can make.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.840
So here are the conclusions.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.180
There's three of them.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.660
So if L is less than 1,
then the series converges.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.020
OK?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.040
That's nice.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.965
That's good.

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:09.084
If L is bigger than 1,
the series diverges.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.387
OK?

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:16.470
That's another good thing.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.584
And then the last one
is, if L equals 1,

00:02:20.584 --> 00:02:21.750
you can't conclude anything.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.090
So I will try and
convince you of that fact

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.070
with a few examples later.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.500
But let's look at this.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.760
So you look at the ratio, and if
the ratio is less than 1, then

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.924
you actually can conclude
the series converges.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.340
And if the ratio
is bigger than 1,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.180
you can conclude that
the series diverges.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.770
So let me just give you
a little understanding

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.180
of why this one
is true, and then

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.440
the same kind of logic can
be used for this second one.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.980
So we'll try and understand
just at least a little bit

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.250
why, when L is less than
1, the series converges.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.750
OK.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.850
So let me just
start writing here.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.950
So if L is less
than 1, then this

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.600
means that we have that a
sub n plus 1 over a sub n

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.180
as n goes to infinity is equal
to L, which is less than 1.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.170
Right?

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.429
So we can pick something
between L and 1.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.970
We can pick a number
between 1 and 1,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.690
because L is
strictly less than 1.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.030
And so what I'm going to
do, is I'm going to say,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.610
I'm going to call this thing r.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.100
Some number between L and 1.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.002
OK?

00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:28.960
So what does that mean?

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.200
That means that for large
n, we have a sub n plus 1

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.820
over a sub n-- sorry, that
looks like I'm adding 1

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.650
to the a sub n-- that's
a subscript-- a sub

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.870
n plus 1 over a sub n is
less than some fixed r.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.720
So I'm picking a value
r between L and 1.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.187
And then this is
true for all large N.

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:52.020
And when you're doing
math, sometimes people

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.790
say, for n, you
know, bigger than

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.500
or equal to some fixed value.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.390
Basically, if you go far
enough out in the sequence,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.910
then all the values bigger than
some fixed 1 have this ratio.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.410
OK?

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.970
But let's get fancy with this.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.600
This we can rewrite as r to
the n plus 1 over r to the n.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.010
Right?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.930
This is just r.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.420
And now if I do a little
moving around, what do I see?

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.150
I see that a sub n plus
1 over r to the n plus 1

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.529
is less than a sub
n over r to the n.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:26.570
Now, this might be weird.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.970
What did I do?

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.678
I just multiplied
through by the a sub n,

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:30.610
and I divided by
the r sub n plus 1.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.210
I get this thing, and then
I see that this ratio,

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.490
as n goes to infinity, the ratio
between a sub n and r to the n

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.470
is decreasing.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.050
It's a decreasing, because
the next term, it's smaller.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.610
Right?

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.640
And so the point is
that if I go far enough

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.240
out, if I start, say,
past this n naught,

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.130
if I go far enough
out, then I always have

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.800
that a sub n is less than some
constant times r to the n.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.300
OK?

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.670
So this means-- this
implies-- a sub n is always

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.370
less than some constant
times r to the n.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.960
Right?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.220
And now, what do we do?

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.546
We do our comparison test.

00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:10.045
OK?

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:12.440
We do our comparison test.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.920
This is what's going to tell
us that the series converges.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.606
Now, again, this
isn't necessarily true

00:05:16.606 --> 00:05:18.480
all the way through the
series, but it's true

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.520
when you're far enough
out, after this n naught.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.800
And if a series
converges at the end,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.520
the beginning is
just a finite sum.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.103
So we don't have to
worry about what's

00:05:28.103 --> 00:05:29.520
going on at the beginning.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.250
So again, we're at this place.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.130
We want to know what happens
to the sum of a sub n,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.060
of all the terms a sub n.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.880
Well, we know that's going to
be less than k times the sum

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.210
r to the n.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.710
Right?

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.290
Because each a sub n is less
than some constant times r

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.690
to the n.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.710
Now why does this converge
What do we know about r?

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.540
r we chose, we said
it's between L and 1.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.750
In particular, it's less than 1.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.660
This is a geometric series.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.430
Geometric series, when r is less
than 1, we know it converges.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.470
And so this one converges,
so then this one converges.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.400
So that's the logic behind it.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.060
We're going to now-- you know,
we're going to now use it.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.630
But I want to point
out that if you

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.210
liked that, you can
come back over here,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.990
and you can do the same
kind of reasoning for why,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.820
if L is bigger than 1, a
sub n, the series, the sum

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.816
of the a sub n's diverges.

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.190
And that's going
to come down to,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.750
now you choose an r
that's between L and 1,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.820
but it has to be bigger than 1.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.100
OK?

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.750
And then you can you
can look at that.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.170
Or maybe r has to be bigger
than L. I didn't even

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.420
work that one out all the way.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.650
But you can do it.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.260
You put an r in there somewhere.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.740
And the same kind of logic,
because the r will be bigger

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.990
than one, you're going
to get to a place

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.200
where probably the
inequality sign is going

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.890
to go the opposite way, right?

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.970
And then you'll have a
series that diverges,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.120
and the other one will
be bigger than that one.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.500
And so that's how the
logic is going to work.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.000
So you have to figure
out where the r goes,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.300
but I guarantee you'll
want the r bigger than 1.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.109
And then you can, you'll have
to have the inequality signs

00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:04.400
be opposite what they are here.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.330
OK?

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.410
You'll see, they're going
to be opposite there.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.950
OK.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.440
Now let's get some examples.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.610
Example 1.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.760
Let's look at some
that we know, and then

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.480
let's look at some
that we don't know.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.980
OK?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.915
So let's look for example
first at 1 over n.

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:28.000
Alright?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.230
Let's use the ratio
test on 1 over n.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.840
Maybe this seems funny, 'cause
what do we know about it?

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.390
We know it diverges, right?

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.160
But let's check,
if this tells us.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.870
The limit of n goes
to infinity of-- well,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.150
what's the n plus
first term of this?

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.000
It's going to be
1 over n plus 1.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.550
And what's the nth term of this?

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.480
It's going to be 1 over n.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.650
And so we get,
it's the limit as n

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:03.070
goes to infinity of n over
n plus 1, and that equals 1.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.430
Hmm.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.800
So this one didn't work.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.475
This one didn't
tell us anything.

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:09.560
And, OK.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.650
But we know this one diverges.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.150
So we know that-- this makes us
think, well, maybe when l is 1,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.280
then we know it diverges.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.470
But just to make sure we
don't make that conclusion,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.580
we don't draw that conclusion,
let's look at 1 over n squared.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.610
And what are the terms there?
a sub n plus 1 and a sub n.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.280
The limit as n goes to infinity.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.590
Well, the n plus first term
is going to be 1 over n

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.370
plus 1 quantity squared,
and the nth term

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.930
is going to be 1
over n squared, which

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:44.530
is going to be the limit as n
goes to infinity of n squared

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.040
over n plus 1 quantity squared,
which is also equal to 1.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.900
And what do we know
about this one?

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.380
This one converges.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.510
So this one gave us
the L is equal to 1,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.810
but we know this one diverges.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.020
And this one gave us L is equal
to 1, and we know it converges.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.090
So we know that when L equals
1, we really cannot conclude

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.565
convergence or divergence.

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:05.065
OK?

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:08.000
L equals 1 doesn't let
us draw any conclusions.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.300
But now let's see
something where, you know,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.800
we can draw a
conclusion, because it

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.470
would be no fun if this
test never told us anything.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.140
It probably wouldn't
be a test, then.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.520
So let's try this one.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:26.130
Let's try 4 to the n
over n times 3 to n.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.080
Let's see what that one does.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.580
All right?

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.580
So let's see.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.480
What is, we need the limit
as n goes to infinity.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.600
We need the n plus first term,
so let's plug in n plus 1

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.250
for all of these.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.170
And I'm actually going to
do a little trick here,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.970
and I'll explain it as I go.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:49.310
4 to the n plus 1 over n
plus 1 3 to the n plus 1.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.697
I'm going to multiply
by 1 over a sub n.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:54.530
Because sometimes that's
a lot easier to do.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.530
I could have done it on
these other ones, maybe,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.420
but now I'm going to
do it on this one.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.940
So this is actually
what the a sub

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.350
n is going to look like, right?

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.240
I had to put in n plus
1 to get a sub n plus 1.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.640
This is a sub n.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.020
I'm going to write
down 1 over a sub n,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.770
and that's going to give me
n times 3 to the n over 4

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.250
to the n.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.580
And now let's start simplifying.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:20.030
I have 3 to the n over
3 to the n plus 1.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.270
I'm left with just a 3 there.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.580
4 to the n and 4
to the n plus 1.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.311
I'm left with just a 4 there.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:29.810
And now the limit as n goes to
infinity-- let's just rewrite

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.910
it so I know what it is.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.350
Let's see.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:41.170
I have 4n over 3 times n plus 1.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.570
Well, the 4 and the 3 I
can actually just pull out.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.470
But what did I have
here? n over n plus 1?

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.550
The limit of n goes to infinity
of that, that equals to 4/3.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.130
That's bigger than 1.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.955
So that actually diverges, OK?

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:02.960
And I have one more example,
and I'm almost out of space.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.190
And let me actually come
over here and figure out

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.430
what example I wanted.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.330
Ah.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.140
Sorry about that.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.770
I knew I had one more.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.450
OK.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.423
n to the tenth over 10 to the n.

00:11:15.423 --> 00:11:17.506
So it's kind of interesting
one, because you have,

00:11:17.506 --> 00:11:21.450
you have an exponential and
then you have a power of n.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.990
So let's look at this one.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.790
So we need to consider
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.520
So I put in n plus 1 first.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.420
n plus 1 to the tenth
over 10 to the n plus 1.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.260
And then I'm going to
just, remember, do times

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.750
1 over a sub n.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.450
So I'm going to have 10 to
the n over n to the tenth.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.530
So again, I took
a sub n, I did 1

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.770
over that, that's
just the reciprocal.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.680
And now let's start dividing,
if I'm allowed to divide.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.090
Yeah, I've got 10
to the n there,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.420
and 10 to the n plus 1
there, so that gives me

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.690
a single 10 in the denominator.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.640
And so now I really
have the limit

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:07.200
as n goes to infinity of
1 over 10 times n plus 1

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.734
to the tenth over
n to the tenth.

00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:13.900
Well, that's equal to-- n
plus 1 to the tenth over n

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.441
to the tenth,

00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.060
you might start to get nervous
and think, "Oh my gosh!

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.560
These powers are
getting really big!

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.790
It might make a difference
that that 1 is there."

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.570
It doesn't make a difference
that that 1 is there,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.236
because if you actually
expand this out,

00:12:24.236 --> 00:12:26.340
the leading term is
just n to the tenth.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.975
And we know that the highest
order, or the highest degree

00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:32.470
is going to win
out, so it's going

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.636
to be n to the tenth over
n to the tenth is how it's

00:12:34.636 --> 00:12:35.920
going to behave in the limit.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.000
So this part's just going
to go to 1, so I get 1/10.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.321
Oh, that's less than 1!

00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:40.820
Yay!

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.350
So this series converges.

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:48.120
OK?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.170
So we had one that diverges,
one that converges,

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.620
and a few where we couldn't
get conclusions by this test.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.800
And one point I want
to make about this,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.440
is that in some cases, you
have the integral test already,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.920
and sometimes that's
easy and that helps you.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.580
In the case of
these examples where

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.390
we couldn't tell where
l was equal to 1,

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.630
the integral test is going
to tell you something.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.470
But in this case, it's
a little bit harder

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.540
to deal with this,
as an integral test.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.190
You can still do it, but
it's a little bit harder.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.870
And so this, maybe,
is a little bit

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.020
quicker way to deal with these
types of, types of problems.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.880
And the big thing
we're going to do,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.505
is in the next video
on the ratio test,

00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:25.880
I'm going to show
you how you can

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.050
use this to determine
the radius of convergence

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.480
for these Taylor series.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.830
So that's actually going
to be kind of exciting,

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.048
and that'll be in
our next video.
