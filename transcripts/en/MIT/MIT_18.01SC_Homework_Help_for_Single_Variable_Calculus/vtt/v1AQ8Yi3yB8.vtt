00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.420
Hi.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.900
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.700
We've been talking
in class a little bit

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.210
about parametric
equations and arc length.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.540
So let's do an example
of a problem where

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.920
you compute an arc
length of a curve given

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.690
by some parametric equations.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.760
So in particular, I have here
the parametric equations y

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.880
equals t minus 1 over t, and
x equals t plus 1 over t,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.620
for 1 less than or equal to
t, less than or equal to 2.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.720
So those parametric equations
trace out some piece

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.110
of a curve in the plane.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.980
And what I'd like you
to do is write down

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.320
an integral whose value
is equal to the arc

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.920
length of that curve.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.125
So the integral
you're going to get

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.320
is going to be pretty
hard to evaluate.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.610
So I wouldn't recommend
you spend a whole lot

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.350
of time trying to evaluate it.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.460
But just so we see that we,
you know, we can do this,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.300
and so we have the integral
whose value is the arc length.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.662
So take a few
minutes, work on that,

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.120
pause the video, come back,
and we can work on it together.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.320
All right.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.230
So I hope you've had some
luck working this problem.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.870
Let's get started
on it together.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.010
So in order to compute the
arc length by an integral,

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.660
we need to figure out what
the element of arc length

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.590
is, that little piece ds.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.500
So this was true when
we had our curve given

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.460
in rectangular coordinates,
and it's also true

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.750
when our curve is given
in parametric coordinates.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.210
So in general, the little
element of arc length

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.280
is given as ds equals the
square root of dx squared

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.320
plus dy squared.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.690
Now, when our curve is given
in rectangular coordinates,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.520
usually what we do here is
we factor out a dx squared,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.540
and then we have dx by
dy, the derivative of y

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.510
with respect to x.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.740
But here, we don't
have x or y given

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.040
in terms of the other one.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.240
We have them both given in
terms of this parameter, t.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.390
So the parameter t is
the thing, is our sort

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.640
of independent variable.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.810
It's the thing we're
going to want to end up

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.040
integrating with respect to.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.470
So what we actually
want to do in this case,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.520
is we want to factor out
a dt from everywhere.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.760
So if you factor out a dt, what
this becomes-- or dt squared,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.450
I guess I should
say-- is that you

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:47.470
get dx/dt squared plus dy/dt
squared, the whole thing square

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.700
root, dt.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.200
OK.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.520
So this is just a little
algebraic manipulation

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.820
involving differentials.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.940
And what this gives me is an
expression that will-- you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.490
know, x is a function of t. x
is given as a function of t,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.450
right here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.070
So dx/dt is a function of t.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.770
And similarly, y is
given as a function of t,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.560
so dy/dt is a function of t.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.750
So this whole expression
is a function of t,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.760
so we have a function of t dt.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.580
So it's all set up
to be integrated.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.010
So in order to actually,
you know, compute

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.500
with this formula, well, we just
take our y, and we take our x,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.660
and we take their derivatives.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.500
So from-- well, I guess
we could start with a y,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.050
since it's on top over there.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.160
So dy/dt.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.860
Well, you know.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.520
You just take a derivative.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.020
Right?

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.714
So you have y is equal
to t minus 1 over t.

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:41.130
And you take a
derivative of that.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.110
Derivative of t is just
1, derivative of 1 over t

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.870
is minus 1 over t
squared, so this

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.100
becomes-- but there's an
extra minus sign there,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.620
so this becomes 1
plus 1 over t squared.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:03.520
And similarly, dx by dt is equal
to 1 minus 1 over t squared.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.660
So you have these
two derivatives.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.170
So to compute arc
length, you plug them

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.950
into this formula for the
element of arc length,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.820
and then you'll integrate.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.670
So OK.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.760
So we have to put them
into that formula.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.420
So what do we get?

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.500
We have ds is equal to
the square root of, well,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.490
so dx/dt squared
plus dy/dt squared.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.200
So that's 1 minus 1
over t squared squared,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.365
plus 1 plus 1 over
t squared squared.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.050
dt outside.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.550
OK.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.040
And so now we, you know, maybe
we can simplify this a little.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.100
I would probably expand
out, at this point.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.860
So if you expand this out,
this is-- well, let's see.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.070
The first one is
just is 1 minus 2

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.300
over t squared plus 1
over t to the fourth,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.040
plus-- that's the first
one we expanded out,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.810
and the second one,
we get 1 plus 2

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.865
over t squared plus 1
over t to the fourth.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.170
All right.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.920
And if we put all this together,
say, over a common denominator,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.260
and simplify it a
little bit, we can

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.240
see that this is equal to--
over t squared terms cancel out,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.155
and we end up with something
like square root of t

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:35.280
to the fourth plus 1
over t squared, dt.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.780
OK.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.020
So this is all this ds that
we've been playing with.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.690
So the actual arc length is what
we get when we integrate ds.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.287
So we need appropriate bounds.

00:05:44.287 --> 00:05:45.620
So where do we get those bounds?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.420
Well, we go back
to the question,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.321
and here, the question
had to have told us.

00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:49.820
Right?

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.111
If the question didn't tell
us, then it didn't actually

00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:56.070
describe a piece of curve,
or a finite piece of curve,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.880
really, is the point.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.550
So the question tells us that we
want this from t equals 1 to 2.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:13.407
So the arc length, we just
integrate our little element

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.240
of arc length over the
appropriate interval.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.810
So that's t from 1 to 2
of the square root of t

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.970
to the fourth plus
1 over t squared dt.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.470
All right.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.070
So as I said at
the beginning, this

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.810
is not an integral
that's readily

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.675
susceptible to the techniques
that we've learned.

00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:33.050
You know, if you
were interested,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.530
you could try some
numerical methods on it.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.580
I'm sure, you know, computer
algebra software can spit out,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.740
at worst, a good
numerical approximation,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.840
if you're curious.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.190
One more thing I want to
say about this question,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.670
is that we did all this without
ever trying to draw the curve,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.630
or think about what
the curve looks like.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.370
So it's not that hard to
get some sort of basic sense

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.320
of the behavior of this curve.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.980
For example, when t
gets very, very large,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.330
we see that what happens is
that x and y, well, the 1 over t

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.050
gets small, so x and y
get close to each other.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.300
But x is just a tiny,
tiny bit bigger.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.730
So for, as t gets
very, very big,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.550
you see that the
point on the curve

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.060
is getting very close
to the line y equals x,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.940
but not actually touching it.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.010
And you can, you know,
you can try other things,

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.080
as t gets close to 0
from the positive side,

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.360
as t gets close to 0
from the negative side.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.920
So this has some sort of
asymptote, it seems like.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.670
There's some other
things you could check.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.260
You could try to show
that the x-value is always

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.290
either-- well,
when t is positive,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.357
it's always at least 2,
or when t is negative,

00:07:41.357 --> 00:07:43.190
it's always at least
negative 2, and there's

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.120
a sort of gap in between.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.780
You could analyze
its properties there.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.113
The other thing you could do,
is you could try and solve

00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:51.960
these equations to
eliminate t, and get

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.580
just rectangular equations
in terms of x and y.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.056
So I'm not going
to do that for you.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:00.340
I'll give you a hint about
how I would go about it.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.350
Which is, you could start off--
so you want to eliminate t.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.270
So I think the nicest
way to do that is

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.640
if you add these two equations.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.890
You'll get that the 1
over t's cancel out,

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:17.379
and you get 2t equals x plus
y, or t equals x plus y over 2.

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.670
And then you can take, and
you could substitute it back

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.650
into one of these equations.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.200
And when you substitute
it back, then you'll

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.510
have an equation that just
involves x and y, which,

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.830
with a little more
simplification,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.060
takes a form that you should
already be familiar with.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.920
OK.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.070
And yes.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.410
Arc length.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:40.810
This is how we do arc
length in parametric form.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:43.880
Works out pretty nice,
except in this case,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.560
we get an integral we can't
evaluate at the very end.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.090
Too bad.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.590
All right.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.897
I'll leave it with that.
