00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:07.390
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.870
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.580
We've been talking about
applications of integration,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.080
including finding the
areas between curves.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.530
So I have here a nice
little region that I like.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.670
I think it's kind of cute.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.010
So it's the region
between y equals

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.720
sine x and y equals cosine x.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.350
And, you know, those two curves
cross each other over and over

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.850
again.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.016
They wrap around each other.

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.990
So I'm just interested
in the region

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.980
between the two consecutive
points where they cross.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.040
So here, you know,
so at pi over 4

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.790
we have sine x equals-- sine pi
over 4 equals cosine pi over 4.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.780
And at 5 pi over 4
they're also equal again,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.030
down in the third
quadrant there.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.320
So, the question is to compute
the area of this region

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.400
that they bound between
those two points.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.300
So why don't you take a couple
of minutes, work through that,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.216
come back and we can
work through it together.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.130
All right, welcome back.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.210
So, from this picture
it's pretty easy

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.130
to see what the region
of integration is.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380
I mean what the
bounds on x will be.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.980
As we said, x has
to go the left,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.640
I mean, you could--
sorry, let me start over.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.580
You could do any two consecutive
intersection points you want,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.080
right?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.480
The area is the same in any
case because of the symmetry

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.953
of these two functions.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:27.850
So, OK.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.500
But the first two that are
easiest for me to find are this

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.442
pi over 4 and this 5*pi over 4.

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:34.650
So I'm going to do those two.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.191
If you wanted, you
could have done it

00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:39.580
with a different pair
of consecutive points.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.380
But, once we've agreed that
sort of these first two

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.330
are the ones I'm going
to do, then it's easy.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.730
I know that they're pi
over 4 and 5*pi over 4.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.620
So that's the
interval over which

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.800
I'm going to be integrating.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.530
And then, what I
want to do is just

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.220
view this region as cut into
a lot of little rectangles.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.730
And I want to integrate the
height of those rectangles

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.610
in order to get the area
of the whole region.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.630
So in this case,
the upper curve is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.560
y equals sine x and the lower
curve is y equals cosine of x.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.700
So the height of a
little-- you know

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.390
if I draw in a little
rectangle here--

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.390
the height of that rectangle
is going to be sine

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.200
x minus cosine x.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.540
Its width is dx.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.350
And then I add them
all up by integrating.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:35.510
So the area is just the integral
from pi over 4 to 5*pi over 4

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.590
of sine x minus cosine x dx.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.437
Top minus bottom
to get the height.

00:02:44.437 --> 00:02:46.270
If you did it backwards;
if you wrote cosine

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.530
minus sine, what you would
get is exactly the negative

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.040
of the area.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.720
So it's, all right, from
pi over 4 to 5, pi over 4.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.890
So now, we just have
to integrate this.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.650
So integral of sine, the
function whose derivative

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.050
is sine is minus cosine x.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.030
And the function whose
derivative is cosine is sine.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:17.630
So it's minus sine x between
pi over 4, 5*pi over 4.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.030
And OK, so now, we just
have to plug in the values.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:30.570
So this is equal to minus cosine
5*pi over 4 minus sine 5*pi

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:43.910
over 4 minus minus cosine pi
over 4 minus sine pi over 4.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.330
And I'm sure you can work
out for yourself that this

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.220
is equal to 2 times
the square root of 2

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.790
if I haven't botched
anything terribly.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.739
So I'll end there.
