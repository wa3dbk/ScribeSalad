PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.450
This'll be the last video where
we do an optimization problem.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.620
And this one's a little bit
different than the other two.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.328
So I'm going to give
you the problem now.

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:19.620
The problem is the following--
a cylinder has a fixed volume.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.730
What ratio between radius and
height minimizes surface area?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.880
Before I give you time
to think about that,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.060
I'm going to remind you of
the two formulas for volume

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.370
and surface area of a cylinder.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.920
So volume of a cylinder
is pi r squared h.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.470
And surface area is 2*pi
r squared plus 2*pi*r*h.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.780
So with that information,
I'll give you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170
some time to work on this
problem and then I'll be back.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.739
Welcome back.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.280
OK, what we're doing,
again, is we're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910
trying to solve an
optimization problem.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.259
And so we know now the
constraint equation,

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.300
it's a little different
than the other situations

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.716
because the
constraint equation is

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.720
just we're told that
there's a fixed volume

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.430
but we're not told what it is.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.830
That actually will not change
how we work on this problem,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.370
but it does change the kind
of answer I can ask of you.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.800
And notice the
answer I ask is not

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.940
about exact values
for radius and height,

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.804
but what ratio between them
will minimize surface area.

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:31.220
So this is, you'll
see at the end,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.440
things will look a
little different.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.720
But ultimately we still have
our optimizing equation,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.930
which is surface area.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.724
And we still have our constraint
equation, which is volume.

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:42.640
So again, we're going
to do what we always do.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.970
We're going to take our
optimization equation

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.640
and use our constraint equation
to get rid of a variable

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.420
so that we can write
the right-hand side here

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.140
in terms of one variable.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.610
Let me point out V is
not a variable here.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.170
V is a constant because
the volume is fixed.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.950
So when you see V,
it's not a variable.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.940
It's a constant.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.830
So what do I do?

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.270
Let me write-- first, let me
write surface area in terms

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.529
of just a function of r.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.070
And I'm going to do something
a little tricky which maybe you

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.778
didn't think of doing,
but ultimately you

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:23.210
should end up with the same
answer once you've simplified.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.420
Notice that this
term has a pi*r*h.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.690
This term also has a pi*r*h.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.440
In fact, I can rewrite the
volume equation as V over r is

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.860
equal to pi*r*h.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.680
So what I'm going to do is take
that pi*r*h here and replace it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.390
by a V over r.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.080
Now again, you might
not have done this.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.820
You should ultimately
get the same answer

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.890
that I do when we're finished.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.250
And even sooner, probably
some simplification

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.290
would be the same.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.450
The only thing I've done here
is I've simplified right away.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.752
So by looking at the problem
and kind of pulling back

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:57.210
from the problem
I see, oh, there's

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.584
something here
that looks exactly

00:02:58.584 --> 00:03:00.810
like something over here.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.450
So I just want to
point that out.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.510
That it's not wrong to
just substitute for h,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.680
but it's maybe a little faster.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.550
So now the new surface area
equation becomes 2*pi r squared

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.010
plus 2V over r.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.010
So now we have everything in
terms of r, because again, V

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.550
is a constant.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.390
Now let me point
out what happens.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.220
When r goes to infinity
this term goes to 0,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.000
but this term goes to infinity.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.010
So as r gets very large surface
area is getting very large.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.230
As r goes to 0 this
term goes to 0,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.110
but this term goes to infinity.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.160
V is fixed, and when r goes
to 0 this term blows up.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
So when r gets as small as we
allow or as large as we allow,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.220
either way, surface area
is going to be getting big.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.280
So where this-- where
surface area has

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.890
a derivative with
respect to radius

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.350
it's going to have
to be a minimum.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.266
So we don't have to check
any more-- now we've

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:02.340
checked sort of the what's
happening towards the boundary

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.450
at the extreme values of r.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.270
So now we can, now we can
actually solve the problem.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.120
Well, what do we do?

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.890
We're using our
optimization equation.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.560
We want to take a derivative
and set it equal to 0

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.480
and find what value
for r gives that.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.430
But again, let me point out
one more time that in the end

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.947
I'm asking for a ratio
between radius and height.

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:23.780
So I'm not going to get
all the way to where

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.130
I have r equals something.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.220
You'll see I'm going
to do another trick.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.180
But let me first take
the derivative I need.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.700
Surface area prime, this is
derivative with respect to r.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.550
I have 2*pi r squared.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.730
That derivative with
respect to r is 4*pi*r.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.430
And this derivative with respect
to r, I'm going to keep the 2V,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.430
and the denominator 1 over r,
its derivative is negative 1

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.930
over r squared.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.780
So I'm going to have 4*pi*r for
the first term and then minus

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.160
2V over r squared.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.640
If I set this equal to 0,
the derivative equal to 0,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.890
and solve, I get to 2V over
r squared is equal to 4*pi*r,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.760
which is the same as-- going
to put it on this side--

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.080
r cubed is equal to 2*pi
over V. Let's just check.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.590
If I multiply both sides by
r squared, divide by 4*pi--

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.860
oh, I did it backwards.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.880
I think it should
actually be pi over 2V.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.700
Let me double check that
all my signs are correct.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.990
That's r cubed, divide by
4*pi, I should get pi over 2V.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.860
I should not.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.460
I've been told from the
audience I made a mistake.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.990
Sometimes you'll see when you're
at the board and on video,

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.130
scary things can happen.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.695
2V-- oh.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.210
Multiply through by
r, I get r cubed.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.960
Oh, I have the 2V
in the numerator.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.050
I apologize.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.590
The 2V is in the numerator,
the 4*pi is in the denominator.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.380
So I get V over 2*pi.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.060
Does that look better, audience?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.820
The audience tells
me that looks better.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.690
OK.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.520
So here I am.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.790
I have r cubed is
equal to V over 2*pi.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.080
Now, if I wanted to I could
take the cube root of both sides

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.470
and get r explicitly
in terms of V and 2*pi.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.140
V is a constant, pi is a
constant, I would be done.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.190
But I didn't ask for
what r actually is.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.400
I asked for a ratio.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.020
So let's make this
problem simpler.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.860
All I need in the end
is r divided by h.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.340
Let's go back to
a formula we have

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.460
and see if we can figure out
a way to get r divided by h.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.480
Look at this formula for
V. It has an r squared

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.340
and it has an h.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.130
So if I divide by r
squared h on this side,

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.390
I'll end up with an r over h.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.350
Hopefully you buy that.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.641
I'm going to even write it out.

00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:03.350
I'm going to take r cubed
and divide it by r squared h.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.850
That in the end, is r over h.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.990
Let's go back here look
at what that equals.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.895
r squared h is
equal to V over pi.

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:12.200
Right?

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.300
r squared h is
equal to V over pi.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.810
So I can divide this side
by r squared h and divide

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.221
this side by V over pi
and it's the same thing.

00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:21.720
Which is, by the
way, the same thing

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.790
as multiplying by
pi over V. Right?

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:32.860
So I can multiply this side by
pi over V, and what do I get?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.260
I get the V's divide out, the
pi's divided by-- divide out,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.430
and I get 1/2.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.460
So the result is that the
ratio between radius and height

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.860
should be 1 to 2.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.910
Let me one more time explain
what we were doing here.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.020
In the end, the
answer, the question

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.900
just asks, what is the ratio
between radius and height

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.400
that minimizes surface area?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.050
And I had an r cubed, I
wanted to get r divided by h.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.320
So I divided by two r's--
I divided by r squared--

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.360
and then h again.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.160
But r squared h is V over pi,
so if I divide by r squared h

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.180
I'm dividing by V over pi.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.610
So I can do on the
right-hand side

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.290
the same thing that I do on the
left-- I divided by V over pi,

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.220
which is multiplying by pi
over V. The pi's divide out,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.750
the V's divide out,
and I'm left with 1/2.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.340
And so this was an optimization
problem where the constraint

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.775
equation did not have a
number in it, but it did have,

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.280
it did have a fixed constant.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.210
So I couldn't ask you for an
exact value for the radius

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.780
and an exact value
for the height,

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.650
but I could ask you
for how they relate.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.610
And that's ultimately
what I did.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.700
And I think that's
where we'll stop.
