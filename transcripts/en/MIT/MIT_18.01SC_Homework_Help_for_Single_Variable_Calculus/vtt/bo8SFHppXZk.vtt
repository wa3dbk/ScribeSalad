00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.750
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.320
In this video I want us to
look at the following problem.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.010
We're going to let f
of x equal 1 over x.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.290
And I want to consider
the solid generated

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.860
by rotating f of x about
the x-axis between x

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.090
equal 1 and x equal infinity.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.840
I want you to find the area
of a cross-sectional slice,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.889
and then I want you to find
the volume of the solid.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:31.180
In the cross-sectional slice,
the one I'm interested in

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.570
is the one that you
see in the xy-plane.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.170
So my suggestion to you is
that right away draw yourself

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.090
a picture, just at least a
rough sketch of the curve y

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.770
equals f of x, and then what
that cross-sectional slice

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.144
will look like and
start off from there.

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:48.060
And take a while to work
on that and then I'll

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.510
be back and show you what I did.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.600
OK welcome back.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.290
Well, hopefully you were
able to make some headway

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.090
on this problem, and maybe you
found some interesting things.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.150
Hopefully you did.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.370
And we will see what I find
and if they are interesting,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.930
which I think they are.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.004
So let's start off.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.670
I told you the first
thing you should do

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.710
is get a rough picture.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.280
So I'm going to
draw a rough picture

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.590
and make sure that
those match up well,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.170
that my picture
matches up with yours.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.600
So let me give you the xy-plane.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.530
And then y equals 1 over x is
a curve that at x equal 1--

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.110
I'm going to make
y equal 1 up here.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510
y equal 1 up there. x equal 1.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.590
So when x is 1, y is 1.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.400
And then it's going
to decay down.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.740
As x goes to infinity it decays

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.190
So it looks something like that.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.260
And then I actually
should have moved this 1

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.820
because I'm going to
need that side to get

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.370
my cross-sectional slice.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.610
So my cross sectional
slice is going

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.060
to come down here and
look something like this.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.160
Oops, that's supposed
to be symmetric.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.290
That's still supposed to
be something like this.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.030
It's supposed to be
symmetric about the x-axis.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.250
And the cross-sectional
slice is the area of that.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.950
Now, if you remember
what you saw in lecture.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.750
You saw, I believe,
that the integral from 1

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.270
to infinity of 1
over x dx diverges,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.150
because you end up with
log evaluated at infinity

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.420
and that is infinite and
so you wind up with this.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.960
This actually diverges.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.570
That was the area of the
top part from 0 to f of x.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.620
So of course if I
double that, I'm still

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.950
going to get that it diverges.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.570
So in fact the cross sectional
slice area, CSS area,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.393
is infinite.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.400
OK, so that's one part.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.330
The other part is
to find the volume

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.360
of the solid of revolution.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.370
So the second part was take
this piece from 0 up to f of x,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.280
rotate it around the x-axis
and compute the volume.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.380
Now we know how to
compute the volume.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.090
This is the disc method
that I'm going to use here.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.880
And I will write out
what we need to do

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.310
and then we'll look at
what the integral gives us.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.300
So for the disc method, so let's
say this is the volume part.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.300
So the volume, it's going
to be the disc method.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.460
So I need to do pi r squared.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.680
And in this case I'm
integrating from 1 to infinity,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.439
so I need pi r squared dx.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:32.980
I'm going to be
integrating something

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.894
that's pi r squared dx.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:37.560
And I know the bounds
are 1 to infinity,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.100
and so I need r in terms
of, as a function of x.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.730
That's fairly easy. r is
just the measure from 0 up

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.870
to f of x.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.814
So that's just 1 over x.

00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:48.230
So this is actually
the integral--

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.830
I'm going to pull
the pi out-- of 1

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.040
over x squared from
1 to infinity dx.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.100
OK so how do I do this integral?

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.420
Well you were shown in
class that in actuality this

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.270
is the limit, as some value
up here goes to infinity,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.574
of this integral,
but we're just going

00:04:10.574 --> 00:04:12.990
to do it the shorthand way
that he also mentioned in class

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.650
and keep the infinity around.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.180
So we can keep
that as our bounds,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.120
knowing we're taking limits as
this thing goes to infinity.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.550
So the integral of 1 over x
squared is negative 1 over x.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.612
So I get minus pi times 1 over
x, evaluated at 1 in infinity.

00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:34.070
I can just check
that if I need to,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.460
but this is x to the minus
1 and its derivative is

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.950
negative x to the minus 2.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.959
So I needed that negative there.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:41.000
And then I evaluate this.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.900
Well at infinity, 1 over
x-- as x goes to infinity,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.620
this first part goes to 0.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.700
So this is 0 minus
negative pi times 1 over 1.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.830
So negative pi times 1.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.960
So this is just pi.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.440
OK, so hopefully that kind of
blows your mind a little bit,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.200
that you could have
something where

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.360
this cross-sectional slice
is infinite, but in fact

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.710
if you look at it the way
we computed the volume,

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.260
we have in fact a finite volume.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.719
So I don't know
what else I'm going

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.801
to say about that except
I think it's really cool.

00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.410
And you can think
about why that is.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.455
And in fact you
might want to notice

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:21.140
that we had to--
we computed things

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.670
in terms of
cross-sectional slices

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.003
coming from the other direction.

00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:28.080
So we looked at these
cross-sectional slices

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.860
and we got our-- we showed
our volume was finite there.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.030
So we had a sum of a
bunch of finite things

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.072
and so it made sense that
you were going to get--

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:38.280
and the finite things were
getting small fast enough.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.200
That's the point.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800
That when you add up
these finite things that

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.633
are getting small fast
enough, you can still

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:44.810
end up with a finite number.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.560
But I guess, yeah,
that's where I'll stop.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.232
So just to say that we were
looking at this sort of solid

00:05:49.232 --> 00:05:50.690
of revolution
problem again, but we

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.460
were dealing with
improper integrals,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.260
and we were showing how you
can do these kinds of problems

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:57.950
with improper integrals.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.861
So now I really will stop there.
