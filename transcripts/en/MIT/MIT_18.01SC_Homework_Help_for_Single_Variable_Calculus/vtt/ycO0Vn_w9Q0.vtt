00:00:06.827 --> 00:00:07.410
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.150
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.420
In lecture, you learned
about some new tools

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.650
for computing certain limits.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.720
In particular, you learned
about l'Hopital's rule.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.940
So now you have the
ability to compute easily

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.410
some limits that before might
have been difficult to do.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.420
So I have here four examples
of limits, some of which--

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.920
or maybe all of
which, or maybe none

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.170
of which or, well definitely
some of which-- will be,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110
you could use
l'Hopital's rule on.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.440
So here they are.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.750
Why do you pause the video and
take a few minutes to work them

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.000
all out, come back, and we
can work them out together.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.640
Welcome back.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420
So we have these
four limits here.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.660
And let's start
solving them, shall we?

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.320
So I'll just go from the first
one, and then I'll, you know,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.500
go through them in order.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.520
So limit (a) is the limit as x
goes to 1 of x to the a minus 1

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.590
over x to the b minus 1.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.240
If we want to use
l'Hopital's rule,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.160
we have to first
check that this is

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.880
a limit of an appropriate
kind of expression.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.630
So that's, in particular,
a limit that is a 0 over 0

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.500
or infinity over infinity form,
so an indeterminate quotient.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.220
And as x goes to 1, we see
that x to the a goes to 1.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.300
So x to the a minus 1 goes to 0.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.780
And similarly x to the b goes
to 1, so x to the b minus 1

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.360
goes to 0.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.630
So indeed, this is a 0 over
0 indeterminate form, so we

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.230
can apply l'Hopital's rule.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.590
So we apply l'Hopital's rule.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:52.090
And it says that the limit as x
goes to 1 of x to the a minus 1

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.970
over x to the b minus 1.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.700
OK, so what do we do?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.330
What l'Hopital's
rule says is we can

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.680
take the derivative of
the top and the derivative

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.070
of the bottom, and then
the limit of the left side

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.230
will be equal to the
limit of the result

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.150
provided the result actually
has an existing limit, either

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.230
a real number or infinity
or minus infinity.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.980
So in this case, this
says that this expression

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.952
is equal to the limit-- so
it's the same limit-- as x goes

00:02:20.952 --> 00:02:23.820
1 of-- OK, so the
derivative of the top

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.255
is a x to the a minus 1, and
the derivative of the bottom

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:33.680
is b x to the b minus 1.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.260
So l'Hopital's rule says
that these two limits

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.550
are equal provided that
the second limit exists.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.566
So what is the second limit?

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.690
Well, we-- OK, we can do
some simplifications here.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.640
Here there wasn't,
you know, a lot

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.220
of obvious simplifying
to be done.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.640
But here there's an obvious
simplification step.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.970
So this is equal to the limit
as x goes to 1-- so a over b

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.990
is just a constant, and
now the powers of x, this

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.380
is x to the a minus b.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.290
But as x goes to 1,
x to the a minus b

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.410
goes to 1 no matter
what a and b are.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.980
So at this point, this isn't
an indeterminate form anymore.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.200
This is nice simple limit
we can just plug in.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.520
So this is just
equal to a over b.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.220
OK so that's part a,
straightforward application

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.260
of l'Hopital's rule.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.000
Let's go look it part b.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.335
So part b asks us
for the limit as x

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:29.890
goes to 0 of sine 5x over x.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.150
So I'll put that
right here, maybe

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.660
I'll draw a little border.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:47.550
So the limit as x goes to 0
of sine of 5x divided by x.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.170
So again there's a question
of, you know, is this limit,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.560
do we know what it is already?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.143
And the answer is, maybe we do
and maybe we don't, but suppose

00:03:57.143 --> 00:03:58.210
we don't.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.500
So in that case, can we
apply l'Hopital's rule?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.520
Well we check, and as x
goes to 0, sine of 5x.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.690
So as x goes to 0, 5x goes to
0, so sine of 5x goes to 0,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.480
and x goes to 0.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.250
So this is another
0 over 0 form.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.980
So we can apply
l'Hopital's rule.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.720
So l'Hopital's rule says that
this is equal to the limit

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.580
as x goes to 0 of-- we take
the derivative of the top

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.640
and divide by the
derivative of the bottom.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.060
So the derivative of the
top is just 5 cosine 5x.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.866
And the derivative
of the bottom is 1.

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:37.490
So l'Hopital's rule
says the limit here

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.000
is equal to the limit here
provided this limit exists.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.300
And now as x goes to 0,
well, OK, 5, 1 is constant.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.840
So we're just looking at
the limit of cosine 5x here.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.400
As x goes to 0, that just
approaches 5 times cosine of 0,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.975
which is 1.

00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:56.735
So this is equal to-- sorry,
the cosine of the 0 part is 1.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:05:01.130
So it's 5 times 1, which is 5.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.360
Now I should note that we
didn't actually really need

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.810
l'Hopital's rule for this one.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.430
One thing you can remember is
that this limit is actually

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.390
the definition of the derivative
of sine of 5x at x equals 0.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.760
So what we just did
with l'Hopital's rule

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.210
was use the derivative to
compute the derivative,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.040
if you like.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.780
So we used the fact that we
already knew the derivative

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.200
in order to compute it.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.380
We could also just
say by definition,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.160
this is the derivative
of sine 5x at 0,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.820
which is 5 cosine of 0, which
is 1, which is 5, rather.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.940
OK so that's part (b).

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:46.410
Now part (c) asks
for the limit as x

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.420
goes to 0 of x squared
minus 6x plus 2-- did

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.130
I do that right,
yes-- over x plus 1.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.969
So this limit, you can't
apply l'Hopital's rule?

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.510
Why can't you apply
l'Hopital's rule?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.290
Well, because it's not
an indeterminate form.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.290
This limit is really
easy to compute.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.460
You can just plug
in x equals 0 here.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.560
The top is going to 2, and
the bottom is going to 1.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.860
So the whole limit is going
to 2 divided by 1, which is 2.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.080
So there's no-- not only, you
don't need l'Hopital's rule,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.350
and also you can't
apply l'Hopital's rule.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.380
This is not a form in which
l'Hopital's rule applies.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.828
It's not an indeterminate
form, OK, so,

00:06:32.828 --> 00:06:35.730
but OK, but the result
is very easy to compute.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.740
So that's 2.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.760
And we've got our
last one now which

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:53.540
is (d), the limit as x goes
to infinity of ln of 1 plus e

00:06:53.540 --> 00:07:01.690
to the 3x quantity
divided by 2x plus 5.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.620
OK, well is it obvious
what this limit is?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.090
Not to me.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.560
So OK, so then we can check.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.810
It's a quotient.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.290
So can we apply
l'Hopital's rule?

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.706
Well we can apply
l'Hopital's rule

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:17.640
if it's an
indeterminate quotient.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.572
So what's happening
is x goes to infinity?

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.780
Well, let's do the bottom
first, because that's easy.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.720
As x goes to infinity, 2x
plus 5 goes to infinity.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.830
And, OK, as x goes to infinity,
e to the 3x goes to infinity.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.480
So 1 plus e to the
3x goes to infinity.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.390
So log of 1 plus 3 to
the 3x goes to infinity.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.980
So this is an infinity
over infinity form.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.530
That's an indeterminate form,
an indeterminate quotient.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.390
So we can apply
l'Hopital's rule.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.490
So l'Hopital's
rule says that this

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.640
is equal to the
limit of the quotient

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.490
of the ratio of the
derivatives, provided

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.590
that that limit exists.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:03.010
So this is equal to the limit
as x goes to infinity of--

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.470
OK, so we need to look at
the ratio of the derivatives.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.620
So the bottom one is easy.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.560
That's 2.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.272
For the top one, to
compute this derivative,

00:08:11.272 --> 00:08:12.730
we need to use the
chain rule here.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.270
So you take the derivative of
this, and you get, well, a log.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:23.240
So on the bottom we
get 1 plus e to the 3x.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.050
And then by the chain rule,
up top you get 3 e to the 3x.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.980
Or, just rewriting this a
little bit in a nicer form,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.580
this is the limit as
x goes to infinity

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:49.774
of 3 over 2 times e to the
3x over 1 plus e to the 3x.

00:08:49.774 --> 00:08:52.190
All right, so now the question
is what do we do from here?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.560
Well is this limit obvious?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.470
Well, OK, so there are
two situations here.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.040
One is, you might look at
this and you might already

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.450
know what this limit is.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.440
The reason you might know that,
is that x goes to infinity,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.350
e to the 3x is
going to infinity,

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.610
and 1 plus e to the 3x
is going to infinity.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.109
So this is an infinity over
infinity indeterminate form.

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:17.275
And so you could apply
l'Hopital's rule to it again.

00:09:17.275 --> 00:09:19.280
OK?

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.820
That's one thing you could do.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.510
You might also look
at and say well,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.190
these two things are
going to infinity

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.375
at exactly the same rate.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:26.380
Right?

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.630
This plus 1 is almost
totally irrelevant.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.790
Actually for purposes
of estimating

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.500
the magnitude of this fraction,
it is totally irrelevant.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.610
When you take-- you
know, when 3x is big,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.900
then e to the 3x is like
a billion or something.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.320
So e to 3x is a billion.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.760
So you have a billion
over a billion and 1.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.640
So it's very, very close to 1.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.640
It's going to get
closer and closer to 1.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.680
So, OK, so if you didn't
trust that analysis

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.750
based on magnitudes,
I mean the idea here

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.150
is just that the most
significant term in the top

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.300
is the e to the 3x.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.734
The most significant term on
the bottom is e to the 3x.

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:04.525
They dominate everything
else that appears,

00:10:04.525 --> 00:10:06.282
which is just this little 1.

00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:07.990
So that's going to
give you a ratio of 1.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.500
If you don't trust
that analysis,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.130
you can apply
l'Hopital's rule again,

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.620
and l'Hopital's rule will tell
you exactly the equivalent

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.120
thing.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.536
When you take a
derivative, you'll

00:10:15.536 --> 00:10:19.980
be left with 3 e to the 3x over
3 e to the 3x, which is just 1.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.980
So in either case,
this part goes to 1.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.430
So 3/2 times it
goes right to 3/2.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.360
All right, so there you have it.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.160
Four limits computed
with l'Hopital's rule.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.050
Well one of them was computed
without l'Hopital's rule.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.730
Remember, you always have
to check that you actually

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.630
have an indeterminate
form before you

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.194
apply l'Hopital's rule.

00:10:43.194 --> 00:10:44.860
And that's all I have
to say about that.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.280
So I'll end there.
