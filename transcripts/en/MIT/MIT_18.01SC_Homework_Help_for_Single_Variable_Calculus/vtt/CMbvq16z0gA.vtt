00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.380
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.460
In this video, I'd
like us to find

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.270
an antiderivative
of the function 1

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.884
over x squared minus 8x plus 1.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:18.550
So I'll give you a while to work
on it, and then I'll come back,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.883
and I'll show you how I started.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.890
So welcome back.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.570
Well, what we'd like to do is,
find an antiderivative to 1

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.814
over x squared minus 8x plus 1.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.230
And how we're going
to do that, is

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.700
we're going to use the
technique completing the square.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.200
And I'm going to
set up the problem,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.350
I'm going to get it
to a certain place,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.017
and then I'm going
to let you finish it.

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:45.016
And how do you know if
you got the right answer?

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:47.200
Well, you actually take a
derivative of your answer,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.180
and see if it gives you back 1
over x squared minus 8x plus 1.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430
That's how you can check.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.420
So let's start off.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.080
If I want to
complete the square,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.230
let's just remind
ourselves how to complete

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.660
the square on this quadratic.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.490
So I'd like something
right here that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.251
makes this a perfect square.

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:15.750
Right?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.570
Well, the 8 here in the middle,
if I want a perfect square,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.020
if you think about
this, I'm going

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.020
to have an x minus--
I need a number here

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.845
that when I multiply it by 2,
that's where this 8 comes from,

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.210
it gives me 8.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.871
So obviously I need
this number to be a 4.

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:29.370
Right?

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.460
Which puts what here?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.450
Puts a 16 here, right?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.750
So just to double check, what
I'm looking for is a number

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.110
here-- I need a number right
here that when I multiply by 2,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.740
gives me negative 8, and
then I need to figure out

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.090
what it squares to.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630
So that number is negative
4, and it squares to 16.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.660
But obviously this isn't
what I have, right?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.020
I have plus 1.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.090
So what have I had to do
to get from here to here?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.710
Well, I had plus 1 and
now I have plus 16,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.460
so obviously I've added 15.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.874
So I have to subtract
15 to keep this,

00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:05.560
to keep these three lines
all equal to each other.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.840
So to understand
where that comes from,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.090
let me just remind
you, my denominator

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.040
was looking like this.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.540
I'd like it to have
a perfect square,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.170
and then subtract a
constant, or add a constant.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.131
Right now I have
something that-- I don't

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:21.380
have a perfect square in here.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.330
I can't make this
into a perfect square

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.480
unless I add a certain amount
to the constant right here.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.840
So I had to add a 15
to the constant here.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.560
Notice 16 minus 15 is 1.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.500
That's my check, also,
that the lines are equal.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.430
And so what I've done, is I've
added 15 and subtracted 15,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.870
and then I put this
plus 16 into here. x

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.750
minus 4 quantity squared is
exactly these first three

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.050
terms.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.950
And then I keep the minus 15.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.450
Now, you might say,
why did you do this?

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.870
So let's make sure we
understand why we're

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.345
completing the square on this.

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:58.442
If we come back, I'm going
to put this line in place

00:02:58.442 --> 00:02:59.900
of what's in the
denominator there,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.090
because these three
things are all equal.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.780
So this is actually
the integral of dx

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.970
over x minus 4 quantity
squared minus 15.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.230
Now you might say, Christine,
this looks no easier.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.250
I don't know why you did this.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.100
But it actually is one of our
favorite, or least favorite,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.230
depending on how you feel about
it, types of tricks we use now,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.980
which is the trig substitution.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.730
So some people love
this because they just

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.090
have to memorize
a little formula,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.423
and some people love it because
they can draw a triangle

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:34.780
and understand what they choose.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.140
I'm going to show you, remind
you what the formula was

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.310
you saw in class.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.930
I believe Professor Jerison
said something like this.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.900
If the denominator is in the
form u squared minus a squared,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.570
this implies that you make
u equal to a secant theta.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.080
Now, he probably wrote it
as x, but I wrote it as u

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.300
for a very specific reason.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.690
Because here I have x minus 4.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.150
I have x minus 4
quantity squared.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.400
Now, this is where it gets
a little rough, right?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.560
This is not a perfect
square, but it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.475
is the perfect square--
it is the square

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:16.800
of the square root of 15.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.810
So I can write the denominator
in the form, something squared

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.069
minus something else squared.

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.860
And again, you might
say, why is this good?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.600
Well, what we're going
to be able to do,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.880
is we're going to be able
to rewrite this in terms

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.540
of trigonometric
functions, which will

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.660
make it much simpler to solve.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.870
So let's use what
Professor Jerison gave us.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.030
And so what we see, is that
this is u and this is a.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.530
Right?

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.782
So I get x minus 4 is equal to
square root of 15 secant theta.

00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:52.740
Now, you might not like
this square root of 15,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.750
but it's just hanging out.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.970
It's not causing any problems.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.090
It's just a number
there, so we'll

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.390
keep it a square root of 15.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.426
So you don't have
to worry about it.

00:04:59.426 --> 00:05:00.550
Now what's the point again?

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.966
Let me just remind
you, the object

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:05.250
is to get this in terms
of the trig functions.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.850
So we should anticipate
that probably we'll

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.090
have some tangent
functions to go with this.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.520
And there are two
reasons to think that.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.590
The first reason to think
that is at some point,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.550
I have to find dx.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.891
Well, the derivative of secant
involves secant and tangent,

00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:21.390
right?

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.910
So that's going to pull in a
tangent function somewhere.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.951
I'm also going to have a
tangent function show up

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:26.725
somewhere else.

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.350
And where that's
going to be, is coming

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.680
from this denominator, this
expression in the denominator.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.240
Because there's a certain
trig identity that we should

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.980
have memorized, but
I'll just remind you.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.490
I'll write it here and
put a star next to it.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.045
It's 1 plus tangent
squared theta is

00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:46.096
equal to secant squared theta.

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:48.345
So this is a-- I'll even put
a star on the other side.

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:49.870
So we should really
remember this.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.115
Now, where does it come from?

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:54.120
It comes from the cosine squared
theta plus sine squared theta

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.010
equals 1 identity.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.850
You can divide everything
by cosine squared theta

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.640
and get this one.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.630
So we have this identity,
and so if you notice,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.200
we're going to be able to
manipulate the expression right

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.706
here, and get the
denominator to look

00:06:10.706 --> 00:06:11.830
like tangent squared theta.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.494
So let's do some of that
work off to the right here.

00:06:16.494 --> 00:06:17.660
So what did I say we needed?

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.660
We have this expression.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.310
We need dx, so let's
find-- actually, no.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.770
Let's find the
denominator first,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.940
because I was just
talking about it.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.640
So if I look at what
x minus 4 squared is,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.190
I'm going to substitute
in this expression.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.850
So x minus 4 squared
minus 15 is the same

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:42.670
as, based on this substitution,
square root 15 secant theta

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.020
squared minus 15, which
is 15 secant squared

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.970
theta minus 15, which, just
to hammer home the point,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.530
is 15 times the quantity
secant squared theta minus 1.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.030
OK?

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.480
Everybody follows, hopefully.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.110
All I've done is the
substitution I made,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.880
and then I started expanding,
or I squared this term,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.050
and I factored out the 15.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.460
And now let's go back
to my start expression.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.290
What is secant
squared theta minus 1?

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.170
It's tangent squared theta.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.200
So we get 15 tangent
squared theta.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.940
So that is actually what the
denominator of our integral

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.480
is going to be over there.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.610
So I'm going to come in and
put that part-- actually,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.990
let me even put this here, too.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:46.170
So right now, our denominator
is 15 tangent squared theta.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.920
So far, so good.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.610
But of course, if I put a
dx up here, I'm in trouble.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.270
Because I have, it's a
function of theta now.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.470
So I need to write this-- I
shouldn't write in terms of x.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.870
I need to figure out what
it is in terms of theta.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.310
And to do that, we again use
the substitution that we made.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.620
Which is just above
the starred expression.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.650
It was that x minus 4 equals
square root 15 secant theta.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.670
This is going to
allow us to find

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.950
what d theta is in terms of dx.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.750
OK?

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.506
So let's do that.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.130
So I'm not done, by
the way, over here.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.160
I'm not done I've
got a little gap I've

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.270
got to fill in the numerator.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.480
So let's come back over here.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.549
So now we have x
minus 4-- let me just

00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:31.590
write that one more time.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.979
So we get dx is equal to
the square root of 15.

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:42.630
Well, what's the
derivative of secant theta?

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:49.120
It's secant theta
tangent theta d theta.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.480
So now I have all
the pieces I need.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.870
And I'm actually
going to rewrite

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.640
the whole thing over
here underneath,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.990
so that I can work with
it a little bit more.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.000
So the dx is in the numerator.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:11.720
Square root 15 secant theta tan
theta d theta, all over 15 tan

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.550
squared theta.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.300
Now, this might still
look a little messy,

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.590
but we can simplify
it some more.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.920
We divide out by one tangent,
we'll pull this out in front.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.620
And notice, what's secant?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.060
Secant theta is 1
over cosine theta,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.620
and tangent theta is sine
theta over cosine theta.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.460
So let's write that down.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.510
So this becomes square
root 15 over 15.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.790
We'll just leave it out there.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.130
It's not hurting anyone.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.630
So we get a 1 over cosine theta
times-- well, tangent theta,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.090
1 over tangent theta is
cotangent theta also.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.680
There's another way
to think about it.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:56.820
So it's cosine theta
over sine theta d theta.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.200
So these divide out.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.170
And I'm left with, I'm taking
now an antiderivative of 1

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.000
over sine theta, which
is cosecant theta.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.550
So I have to find
an antiderivative

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.980
of cosecant theta.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.620
Well, you can find that
with the exact same strategy

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.140
you found, or I should say,
that Professor Jerison used

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.080
in class-- or maybe
it was actually

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.130
Professor Miller
in that lecture--

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.840
to find an antiderivative
of secant theta.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.250
So you can do the same kind
of thing with cosecant theta,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.208
because they have the
same kind of derivatives.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:29.610
Cosecant and cotangent have
very similar-looking derivatives

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.090
to tangent and secant.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.090
Same kinds of relationships.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.190
So you can actually find
that antiderivative.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.190
So this is some constant
we don't care about.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.810
And once you find that, this
will be in terms of theta.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:49.400
Your final answer needs
to be in terms of x,

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.760
but you saw how to
do that, actually.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.040
You just need to
make a triangle that

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.690
represents the relationship
between x and theta.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.832
So I'll draw a picture
of that triangle,

00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:02.790
then I'll give a little
summary of what we did,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.975
and then we'll stop.

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:06.087
So let me draw a picture
of that triangle.

00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:08.045
So from here, all you
would do is actually find

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:09.959
this antiderivative,
and then you

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:12.000
would have to make the
right kind of substitution

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.850
in terms of theta.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.330
We want to know, how do we find
that, do that substitution.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.690
So the triangle is going to
come from the following thing.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:26.630
We know x minus 4, again, is
square root of 15 secant theta.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.840
So I'm going to make this theta.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.700
Secant theta, well, it's
1 over cosine theta,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.930
cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse,

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.430
so secant is hypotenuse
over adjacent.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.010
Right?

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.700
That's the relationship.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.740
So x minus 4 over 15 is
equal to the hypotenuse

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.030
over the adjacent.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.130
Did I square root?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.230
Sorry.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.450
Square root.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.510
So the hypotenuse is x
minus 4, the adjacent

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.050
is square root of 15, and then
now I can fill in the opposite

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.270
by Pythagorean theorem.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:58.770
Right?

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.830
I just take this squared,
and I subtract this squared,

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.440
and then I take the square root.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:11.870
So I get the square root of
x minus 4 squared minus 15.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.660
So whatever I have
in terms of theta,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.460
I just look at this triangle.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.910
If I had in my
answer sine theta,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:23.250
I would replace sine theta
by this square root divided

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.300
by x minus 4.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.799
Because that's
what sine theta is.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:28.090
And so from-- that's how I
finish this type of problem,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:28.589
always.

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:31.590
I want to have a picture of
this triangle, label a theta,

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.800
use my substitution to give
me what two of the sides are,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.200
use the Pythagorean theorem
to get the third side.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.237
So that's the strategy.

00:12:38.237 --> 00:12:40.820
So let's go back and just remind
ourselves where we came from.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.819
We're going to go all the
way to the other side.

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:45.480
This was a long, long problem.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.260
So what did we do
in this problem?

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.420
I wanted us to find an
antiderivative of something.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.720
And right away, we can't
use partial fractions,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.110
because we can't
factor out an x here.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.540
So I'm forced to use
completing the square.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.560
So I completed the square first.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.660
That was the little algebra
that I had to do first.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.500
Then once I have that
little bit of algebra,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.910
I get into a situation where I'm
set up for a trig substitution.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.070
So then I had to start off
and do some trig substituting.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.200
And the things you have to do
to make a trig substitution work

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.442
are, pick the right substitution
that makes sense, which

00:13:21.442 --> 00:13:22.650
you were given that in class.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.210
You can also figure it out
from a triangle picture,

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.530
if you wanted to.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.780
And then you have to make
sure you substitute not just

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.130
for the expression, the
function of x, but also the dx.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.690
So we did all that, and then
we came over, further, further,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.350
further, further, further, here.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.920
And we had everything
in terms of theta.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.080
So then we had to
look at-- we had

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.320
all these trigonometric
functions of theta.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.730
We simplified that
as far as we could.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.520
We got one we could find.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.864
Then we finally, we take
the antiderivative there,

00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:52.405
and then in the very
end, we're going

00:13:52.405 --> 00:13:55.500
to substitute in for theta,
using the triangle we've

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.810
drawn up here.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.800
So!

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.950
I think that's where I'm
going to stop this one.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.811
Also, I ran out of board
space, so I have to stop.
