JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.080
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.570
In lecture you discussed some
of the inverse trigonometric

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.170
functions as part
of your discussion

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.350
of inverse functions in general
and implicit differentiation.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.710
And I just wanted to
talk about one, briefly,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.250
that you didn't mention in
lecture, as far as I recall,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.620
which is the inverse cosine.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.890
So what I'm going to call
the arccosine function.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.090
So I just wanted to go
briefly through its graph

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.300
and its derivative.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.110
So here I have the graph of
the curve y equals cosine x.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.640
So this is a-- you
know, you should

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.890
have seen this before, I hope.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.100
So it has-- at x equals 0
it has its maximum value 1.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.820
And then to the
right it goes down.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.160
Its first zero is at pi over 2.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.860
And then it has its
trough at x equals pi.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.934
And then it goes back up again.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.350
And, OK, and it's
an even function

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.010
that looks the same to the right
and the left of the y-axis.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.970
And it's periodic
with period 2 pi.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.400
And it's also,
you know, what you

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.890
get by shifting
the sine function,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.840
the graph of the sine function,
to the left by pi over 2.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.100
So, OK, so this is
y equals cosine x.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.470
So in order to graph
y equals arccosine

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.900
of x, we do what we do for
every inverse function,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.360
which is we just take the
graph and we reflect it

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.230
across the line y equals x.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.630
So I've done that over here.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.560
So this is what we
get when we reflect

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.880
this curve-- the y equals cosine
x curve-- when we reflect it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.170
through that diagonal
line, y equals x.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.890
So one thing you'll
notice about this

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.310
is that it's not a function.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.690
Right?

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.980
This curve is not the graph
of a function because every,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.355
all these humps on
cosine x-- there

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:57.580
are more humps out here--
those horizontal lines cut

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.920
the humps in many points.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
And when you reflect
you get vertical lines

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.400
that cut this curve
in many points.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.550
So it doesn't pass the
vertical line test.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.570
So in order to get a function
out of this, what we have to do

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.430
is we just have to take a
chunk of this curve that does

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.710
pass the vertical line test.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.820
And so there are many,
many ways we could do this.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.380
And we choose one
basically arbitrarily,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.900
meaning we could make
a different choice,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.060
and we could do all
of our trigonometry

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.710
around some other choice, but
it's convenient to just choose

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.720
one and if everyone agrees that
that's what that one is then we

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.280
can use it and it's nice.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.640
We have a function and
we can-- the other ones

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.030
are all closely related to this
one choice that we can make.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.440
So in particular
here, I think there's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.380
an easiest choice,
which is we take

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:59.190
the curve y equals arccosine
x to be just this one

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.800
piece of the arc here.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.350
So this has maximum-- so it
goes from x equals minus 1 to x

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.920
equals 1.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.090
And when x is minus
1 we have y is pi,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.050
and then when x equals 1 y is 0.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:25.550
So this is the-- this curve
is the graph of the function y

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.030
equals arccosine of x.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.870
And if you want-- so there's
a notation that mathematicians

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.000
use sometimes to show
that we're talking

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.420
about the particular
arccosine function that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.860
has this as its domain
and this as its range.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.180
So we sometimes write
arccosine and it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.090
takes this domain-- the
values between 1 and 1--

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.530
and it spits out values
between 0 and pi.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.830
So this is a sort
of fancy notation

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.550
that mathematicians use to say
the arc cosine function takes

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.400
values in the
interval minus 1, 1--

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.240
so it takes values
between negative 1 and 1--

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.650
and it spits out values
in the interval 0, pi.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.830
So every value that it spits
out is between 0 and pi.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.220
OK, so if you
graph the function,

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.110
so now this is a
proper function, right?

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.318
It's single-valued, it passes
the vertical line test.

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:26.080
So, OK.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.970
And so that's the graph of
y equals arccosine of x.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.230
So the other thing
that we did in lecture,

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.885
I think we talked about
arcsine and we graphed it.

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.760
And we talked about
arctan and we graphed it.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.384
And we also computed
their derivatives.

00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:42.950
So let's do that for
the arccosine, as well.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.470
So, what have we got?

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.150
Well so, in order to
compute the derivative--

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.030
this function is defined
as an inverse function--

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.785
so we do the same
thing that we did

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:54.510
in lecture, which
is we use this trick

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.340
from implicit differentiation.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.900
So in particular,
we have that if y

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.100
is equal to arccosine
of x then we can

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.160
take the cosine of both sides.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.200
And cosine of
arccosine, since we've

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.810
chosen it as an inverse
function, that just gives us

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.420
back x.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.830
So we get cosine
of y is equal to x.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.150
And now we can differentiate.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.720
So what we're after is the
derivative of arccosine

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.980
of x, so we're after dy/dx.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.940
So we differentiate this
through with respect to x.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.900
So on the right-hand
side we just get 1.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.600
And on the left-hand
side, well, we

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.100
have a chain rule here, right?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.150
Because we have cosine of
y, and y is a function of x.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:51.830
So this is, so the derivative
of cosine is minus sine y,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.800
and then we have to multiply
by the derivative of y,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.910
which is dy/dx.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.330
Now, dy/dx is the
thing we're after,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.030
so we solve this
equation for dy/dx

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:16.170
and we get dy/dx is equal to
minus 1 divided by sine y.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.130
OK, which is fine.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.360
This is a nice formula,
but what we'd really like,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.410
ideally, is to express
this back in terms of x.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.820
And so we can, well we
can substitute, right?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.810
We have an expression
for y in terms of x.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.420
So that's y is equal
to arccosine of x.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.930
So this is equal
to minus 1 divided

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:46.600
by sine of arccosine of x.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.760
Now, this looks really ugly.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.860
And here this is another
place where we could stop,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.010
but actually it turns out that
because trigonometric functions

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.980
are nicely behaved we
can make this nicer.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.330
So I'm going to appeal
here to the case

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.150
where x is between 0 and 1.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.160
So then x, so then we
have a right triangle

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.975
that we can draw.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.975
And the other case you
can do a similar argument

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:22.462
with a unit circle, but
I'll just do this one case.

00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:24.930
So, if--

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.357
OK, so arccosine of x.

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:27.190
What does that mean?

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.870
That is the angle
whose cosine is x.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.220
Right?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:42.980
So if you draw a right triangle
and you make this angle arc--

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.210
two c's-- arccosine of x.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.820
Well, that angle has
cosine equal to x so--

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.510
and this is a right triangle--
so it's adjacent side

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.450
over the hypotenuse
is equal to x,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.360
and one easy way to get that
arrangement of things is

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.690
say this side is x
and the side is 1.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.580
So OK.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.590
So what?

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.590
Why do I care?

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.030
Because I need
sine of that angle.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.660
So this is the angle arccosine
of x, so sine of that angle

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.582
is the opposite side
over the hypotenuse.

00:08:17.582 --> 00:08:18.790
And what's the opposite side?

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.700
Well I can use the
Pythagorean theorem here,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.266
and the opposite side is square
root of 1 minus x squared.

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:27.890
That's the length of
the opposite side.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:34.230
So the sine of arccosine
of x is square root of 1

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.870
minus x squared divided by 1.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.670
So sine of arccosine of x
is just square root of 1

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.660
minus x squared.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.930
So we can write this in the
somewhat nicer form, minus 1

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.280
over the square root
of one minus x squared.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.202
So if you remember what the
derivative of arcsine of x was,

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.660
you'll notice that this is a
very similar looking function.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.220
And this is just because
cosine and sine are

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.030
very similar looking functions.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.440
So in fact, the
graph of arccosine

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.740
is just a reflection of
the graph of arcsine,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.780
and that's why the derivatives
are so closely related

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.032
to each other.

00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:17.990
So OK, so there you go.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.140
You've got the graph
of arccosine up there

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.900
and you've got the formula
for its derivative,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.170
so that sort of
completes the tour

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.060
of the most important inverse
trigonometric functions.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.739
So I think I'll end there.
