00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:07.540
Hi.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.730
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.280
I, today I wanted to teach you a
variation on trig substitution.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.984
So this is called hyperbolic
trigonometric substitution.

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.400
And I'm going to
teach you it just

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.820
by going through a nice
example of a question

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.510
where it turns out to be useful.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.360
So the question
is the following.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.960
Compute the area of
the region below.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.000
So what's the region?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.730
Well, I have here the hyperbola
x squared minus y squared

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.880
equals 1.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.670
And I've chosen a point on the
hyperbola whose coordinates are

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.215
(cosh t, sinh t).

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:43.490
So remember that cosh t
is a hyperbolic cosine,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.430
and sinh t is the
hyperbolic sine.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.570
And they're given by the
formulas cosh t equals

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.620
e to the t plus e to
the minus t over 2,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:08.120
and sinh t equals e to the t
minus e to the minus t over 2.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.140
So and we saw in an
earlier recitation video

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620
that this point,
(cosh t, sinh t),

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.855
is a point on the right
branch of this hyperbola.

00:01:15.855 --> 00:01:16.730
So I've got a region.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.180
So I've got the hyperbola,
I've got that point.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.480
I've drawn a straight
line between the origin

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.040
and that point.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.270
So the region that I want
you to find the area of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.360
is this region here.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.680
So it's the region below that
line segment, above the x-axis,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.956
and to the left of this
branch of the hyperbola.

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:41.455
Now, I'm not going
to, I'm not going

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:43.980
to just ask you
to do that alone,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.640
because there's this technique
that I want you to use.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.740
So let's start setting
up the integral together,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.470
and then I'll
describe the technique

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.765
and give you a chance to work
it out yourself, to work out

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:55.640
the problem yourself.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.900
So from looking at
this region-- so let's

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.930
think about computing
the area of this region.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.460
There are two ways we
could split it up, right?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.530
We could cut it up into
vertical rectangles

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.330
and integrate with
respect to x, or we

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.390
could cut it up into
horizontal rectangles

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.040
and integrate with respect to y.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.120
Now, if we cut it up
into vertical rectangles,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.020
our life is a
little complicated,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.850
because we have to cut the
region into 2 pieces here.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.350
Right?

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.340
There's the-- so this
is the point (1, 0),

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.120
where the hyperbola
crosses x-axis.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.464
So over here, you know, the
top part is the line segment

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:35.880
and the bottom
part is the x-axis,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.046
and then over here, the top
part is the line segment

00:02:38.046 --> 00:02:39.610
and the bottom part
is the hyperbola.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.940
So life is complicated if
we use vertical rectangles.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.440
It's a little bit simpler if
we use horizontal rectangles,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.510
so let's go with that.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.810
You know, the
amount of work will

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.040
be similar either way,
but I like this way,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.810
lets you right down
in one integral.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.790
So the area-- OK.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.462
So if we use horizontal
rectangles to compute

00:02:58.462 --> 00:02:59.920
the area of a
region, then the area

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.190
is, we need to integrate
from the bottom to the top,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.056
whatever the, you know,
the bounds on y are.

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:08.680
And then the thing
we have to integrate

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.620
has to be the area of one
of those little rectangles.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.130
So the area of the little
rectangle, its height is dy,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.970
and its length,
or width, I guess,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.950
is the x-coordinate of
its rightmost point,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.291
minus the x coordinate
of its leftmost point.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:28.790
So OK.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.032
So we need to integrate
from the lowest value of y

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:33.910
to the highest value.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.619
So we start at the
bottom at y equals 0,

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.410
and we need to go all
the way up to the top

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.440
here, which is y equals sinh t.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.100
So it's an integral
from 0 to sinh t.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.600
OK.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.750
And so we need the
x-coordinate on the right here,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.240
minus the x-coordinate
on the left.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.370
So what's the
x-coordinate on the right?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.540
Well, we need to solve this
equation for x in terms of y.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.040
Right?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.123
This is going to be an
integral with respect to y.

00:04:02.123 --> 00:04:04.280
So that if we solve
for this point,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.940
we get x is equal to the square
root of y squared plus 1.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.130
So the right coordinate
is the square root

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.840
of y squared plus 1.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.410
And the left
coordinate, this is just

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.650
a straight line passing
through the origin,

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.260
so its equation is y equals
sinh t over cosh t times x,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.290
or x equals cosh t
over sinh t times y.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:40.270
So this is minus cosh
t over sinh t times y.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.400
And we're integrating
with respect to y.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.900
OK.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.200
So this is the integral
that we're interested in.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.830
This integral gives us the area.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.720
And just a couple of
things to notice about it.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.900
So t is a constant.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.970
It's just fixed.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.130
So cosh t over sinh t, which
we could also, if we wanted to,

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.490
this is the
hyperbolic cotangent.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.589
But that's really
not important at all.

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:05.380
But we could call it
that, if we wanted to.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.970
So this is just a constant.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.170
So we have minus a
constant times y dy.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.430
So this part's
easy to integrate.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.500
So the hard part is
going to be integrating

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.800
this y squared plus 1.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.697
Now, one thing you've seen is
that when you have a y squared,

00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:22.530
a square root of-- when
you have y y squared

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.700
plus 1, one substitution
that sometimes works

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.910
is a tangent substitution.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.180
And the reason a tangent
substitution works,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.510
is that you have a trig
identity, tan squared

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.150
plus 1 equals secant squared.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.260
In this case, I'd
like to suggest

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.810
a different substitution.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.310
All right?

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.900
So this integral is the
integral that you want.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.400
And I'd like to suggest
a substitution, which

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.277
is that you use a hyperbolic
trig function as the thing

00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:52.110
that you substitute.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.150
So in particular, instead
of using, instead of

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.610
relying on the trig
identity tan squared

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.250
plus 1 equals
secant squared, you

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.390
can use the hyperbolic
trig identity,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:12.720
which is that sinh squared u
plus 1 equals cosh squared u.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.720
So this identity-- so
here we have a something

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.230
squared plus 1 equals
something squared.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.720
So the identity this suggests
is to try the substitution y

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.671
equals sinh u.

00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:28.170
All right?

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.330
So this is a hyperbolic
trig substitution.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.070
So why don't you take that hint,
try it out on this integral,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.250
see how it goes.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.987
Take some time, pause the
video, work it out, come back

00:06:40.987 --> 00:06:42.320
and we can work it out together.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.450
Welcome back.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.165
Hopefully you had some luck
solving this integral using

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.200
a hyperbolic trig substitution.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.640
Let's work it out together,
see if my answer matches

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.720
the one that you came up with.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.400
So as I said before, this
integral comes in two parts.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.450
There's the hard
part, the square root

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.320
of y squared plus
1 part, and there's

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.620
the easy part, this y part.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.550
So before I make
the substitution,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.680
let me just deal
with the easy part.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.290
So I'll do that over here.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.320
So we have the one
part of the area,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.280
or one part of the
integral, really,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:39.970
is the integral from 0 to sinh
t of minus cosh t over sinh t

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.131
times y dy.

00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:42.630
OK.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.510
So this is just a constant,
so it's a constant times y.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:52.540
So this is equal to-- well, it's
the same constant comes along,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:08:00.160
minus cosh t over sinh t,
times y squared over 2,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:06.170
for y between 0 and this
upper bound, sinh t.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.070
So that's equal-- OK.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.760
So when y is 0, this is just 0.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:18.020
So this equals minus
cosh t sinh t over 2.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.780
So that's the easy
part of integral.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.500
So in order to compute
the total area,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.800
we need to add this
expression that we just

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.240
computed to the integral
of this first part.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.070
So that's what we
need to compute next.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.319
And that's what we're going
to use the hyperbolic trig

00:08:33.319 --> 00:08:34.160
substitution on.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.770
So we're going to compute
the integral from 0

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:46.190
to sinh t of the square
root of y squared plus 1 dy.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.245
And we're going to use
the substitution sinh

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:57.740
u equals y, or y equals sinh u.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.260
OK.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.520
So we need, what do I need?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.070
I need what dy is, and I
need to change the bounds.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.210
So dy-- I'm sorry,
I'm going to flip

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.940
this around to take
the-- so dy is,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.630
I need the differential of
sine u-- sorry, of sinh u.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.540
And so we saw in the earlier
hyperbolic trig function

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.300
recitation that that's
cosh u du, or if you like,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.160
you could just differentiate
using the formulas

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.500
that we know for sinh and cosh.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.200
And we need bounds.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.350
So when y is 0, we need
sinh of something is 0.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.220
And so it happens
that that value is 0.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.213
So if you remember the
graph of the function,

00:09:42.213 --> 00:09:43.962
or you can just check
in the formula, when

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:48.750
sinh is 0, when t is 0,
that's when you get sinh is 0.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.780
It's the only time e to the
t equals e to the minus t.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.280
OK.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:59.870
So when y is 0, then u is 0, and
when y is sinh t, then u is t.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.370
Right?

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.040
Because sinh u is sinh t.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.270
So under the substitution, this
becomes the integral from 0

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.010
to t now, from u equals
0 to t, of-- well, OK.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:21.210
So this becomes the square
root of sinh squared u plus 1,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:30.161
and then dy is times cosh u du.

00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:30.660
OK.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.690
Now the reason we made this
substitution in the first place

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.920
is that this, we can use a
hyperbolic trig identity here.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.990
So sinh squared u plus 1
is just cosh squared u,

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.200
and square root of cosh
squared u is cosh u.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.640
Remember that cosh
u is positive,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.931
so we don't have to worry
about an absolute value here.

00:10:50.931 --> 00:11:02.980
So this is the integral from
0 to t of cosh squared u du.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.480
OK.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.920
So at this point, there are
a couple of different things

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.380
you can do.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.980
One is that you can, just
like when we have certain trig

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.280
identities, we have
corresponding hyperbolic trig

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.030
identities that we
could try out here.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.140
So we could try
something like that.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.911
Another thing you can
do, is you can just

00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:24.160
go back to the formula, right?

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.740
Cosh t has a simple formula
in terms of exponentials,

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.520
so you can go back to this
formula and you can plug in.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.860
So let's just try that
quickly, because that's

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.090
a sort of easy way
to handle this.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.470
So this is cosh squared u du.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.670
So I'm going to write-- OK.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.230
Carry that all the way up here.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.720
So this is the
integral from 0 to t.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.200
Well, if you take the
formula for hyperbolic cosine

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.475
and square it, what
you get, I'm going

00:11:54.475 --> 00:12:03.090
to do this all in one step,
is you e to the 2u plus 2 plus

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:14.070
e to the minus 2u over 4 du.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:14.570
OK.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.250
And so now this is, once
you've replaced everything

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.000
with exponentials, this
is easy to integrate.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.340
This is-- so e to the 2u, the
integral is e to the 2u over 2,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.410
so that comes over 8.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.770
2 over 4, you integrate
that, and that's

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.100
just 2u over 4,
which is u over 2.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.410
And now the last one
is minus e to the minus

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:47.270
2u over 8 between 0 and t.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.490
OK.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.860
So now we take the
difference here.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:13:01.420
At t, we get e to the 2t
over 8 plus t over 2 minus

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.910
e to the minus 2t over 8.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.450
Minus-- OK.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:13.150
And when u is equal-- so
that was at u equals t.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:18.360
At u equals 0, we get
1/8 plus 0 minus 1/8.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.310
So that's just 0.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.560
OK.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.230
So this is what we got for
that part of the integral.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.010
So OK, so we've now split
the integral into two pieces.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.020
We computed one piece,
because it was just easy,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.250
we're integrating a polynomial.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.110
We computed the other piece,
which was more complicated,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.651
using a hyperbolic
trig substitution.

00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:38.760
The whole integral is the
sum of those two pieces.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.310
So now the whole integral,
I have to take this piece,

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:42.800
and I have to add
it to the thing

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.540
that I computed
for the other piece

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.990
before, which was
somewhere-- where did it go?

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.530
Here it is, right here.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.530
Which was minus cosh
t sinh t over 2.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.660
OK.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.560
So I'm going to save
you a little arithmetic,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.080
and I'm going to observe that
minus cosh t sinh t over 2

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:08.050
is exactly equal to the
minus e to the 2t over 8,

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.310
plus e to the minus 2t over 8.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:18.340
So adding these two
expressions together gives us--

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.020
so the first expression,
minus cosh t sinh t over 2,

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.805
is minus e to the
2t over 8 plus e

00:14:26.805 --> 00:14:31.540
to the minus 2t
over 8, plus-- OK.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.960
Plus what we've got
right here, which

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:41.320
is e to the 2t over 8 minus
e to the minus 2t over 8

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.170
plus t over 2.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.120
And that's exactly
equal to t over 2.

00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:50.210
OK.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.910
So this is the area of that sort
of hyperbolic triangle thing

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.660
that we started out
with at the beginning.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.250
So let me just walk back
over there for a second.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.630
So we used this hyperbolic
trig substitution

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.800
in order to compute that
the area of this triangle

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.855
is t over 2.

00:15:05.855 --> 00:15:07.616
And I just want
to-- first of all,

00:15:07.616 --> 00:15:09.740
I want to observe that
that's a really nice answer.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.080
So that's kind of cool.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.663
The other thing that
I want to observe

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:15.220
is that this is a very close
analogy with something that

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:20.460
happens in the case of regular
circle trigonometric functions.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:24.840
Which is, if you look
at a regular circle,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:31.340
and you take the point cosine
theta comma sine theta,

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:38.360
then the area of this little
triangle here is theta over 2.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.390
So in this case, u
doesn't measure an angle,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.200
but it does measure an area
in exactly the same way

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.420
that theta measures an area.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.980
So there's a really
cool relationship

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.010
there between the
hyperbolic trig function

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.710
and the regular trig function.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.460
So that's just a
kind of cool fact.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.150
The useful piece of
knowledge that you

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.270
can extract from
what we've just done,

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.020
though, is that you can use this
hyperbolic trig substitution

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.040
in integrals of certain forms.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.800
So in the same way that trig
substitutions are suggested

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.340
by certain forms
of the integrand,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.530
hyperbolic trig
substitutions are also

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.380
suggested by certain
forms of the integrand,

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.505
and often you have a choice
about which one to use.

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:16.640
And in this particular instance,
a hyperbolic trig substitution

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.600
worked out quite nicely.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.580
Much more nicely than
a trig substitution

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.240
would have worked out.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.380
So it's just another
tool for your toolbox.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.620
I'll end with that.
