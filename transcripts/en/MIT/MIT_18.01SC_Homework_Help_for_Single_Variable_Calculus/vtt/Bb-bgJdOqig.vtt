00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:07.720
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.600
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.060
In last lecture we talked
about finding the derivatives

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.580
of trigonometric functions.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.470
In particular, the sine function
and the cosine function.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.270
So today let's do an example
of putting that into practice.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.510
So here's a function:
h of x equal to sine

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.680
of x plus square root
of 3 times cosine of x.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.620
And I'm asking you to
find which values of x

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.772
have the property that
the derivative of h of x

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:38.210
is equal to 0.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.050
So why don't you take
a minute to think

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.695
about that, work it out on
your own, pause the video,

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.820
and we'll come back and
we'll work it out together.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.130
All right.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.120
So you've hopefully had a chance
to look over this problem,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.190
try it out for yourself.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.100
Now let's see how
to go about it.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.080
So we have the
function h of x-- it's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.250
equal to sine x plus
square root of 3 cosine x--

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.870
and we want to know when its
derivative is equal to 0.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.149
So in order to
answer that question

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.190
we should figure out what
its derivative actually

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.880
is and try and write down a
formula for its derivative.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.440
So in this case
that's not that bad.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.360
If we take a
derivative of h, well h

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.100
is a sum of two
functions-- sine x

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.020
and square root of 3 cosine x.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.340
And we know that the
derivative of a sum

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.660
is just the sum of
the derivatives.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.670
So we have the h prime
of x is equal to d

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:42.750
over dx of sine x plus d
over dx of square root of 3

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010
times cosine x.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.400
Now we learned last
time in lecture

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.260
that the derivative of
sine x is cosine of x,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.125
and we learned the derivative
of cosine of x is minus sine x.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.740
So here we have a
constant multiple,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.720
but by the constant multiple
rule that just gets pulled out.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.780
So this is equal to cosine
x minus square root of 3

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.120
times sine x.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.220
So this is h prime of x and now
we want to solve the equation h

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.080
prime of x equals 0.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.650
So we want to find
those values of x

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:33.569
such that cosine x minus square
root of 3 sine x is equal to 0.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.860
Now there are a couple
different ways to go about this.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.550
I think my preferred way is I
would add the square root of 3

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.490
sine x to one side, and then
I want to get my x's together,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.390
so I would divide by cosine x.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.550
So that gives me--
so on the left side

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.850
I'll be left with cosine
x divided by cosine x,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.340
so that's just 1.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.550
And on the right side I'll
have square root of 3 times

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.660
sine x over cosine x.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.870
So that's just square
root of 3 times tan x.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.650
Or, and I can rewrite
this as tan of x

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.140
is equal to 1 divided
by square root of 3.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.510
Now to find x here, either you
can remember your special trig

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.160
angles and know which
values of x make this work.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.520
Or you could apply the
arc tangent function here.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.210
So in either case,
the simplest solution

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.440
here is x equals pi over 6.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.090
So if you like, you can draw
a little right triangle.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.750
You know, if this is x, if tan
x is 1 over square root of 3,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.140
we should have this side
being 1 and this side

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.539
being square root of 3.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.580
And in-- OK, in that case,
in this right triangle

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.240
the hypotenuse would be 2.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.250
And so then you, you
know, would recognize

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.760
this is a 30 degree angle,
or pi over 6 radian angle.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.810
But one thing to
remember is that tangent

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.720
of x is a periodic
function with period pi,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.530
so not only is pi
over 6 a solution,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.900
but pi over 6 plus
pi is a solution.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.350
So that's 7*pi over 6,
or pi over 6 plus 2*pi,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.830
which is 13*pi over 6,
or pi over 6 minus pi,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.880
which is minus 5*pi
over 6, et cetera.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.670
So there are actually
infinitely many solutions.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.670
They're given by pi over 6 plus
an arbitrary multiple of pi.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.126
So then we're done.

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:45.000
So I do want to mention,
though, that there's

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.160
another approach to
this question, which

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.120
is, we can start by multiplying
this expression for h of x.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.770
So if you look at
h of x-- that's

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.490
sine of x plus square
root of 3 times cosine x--

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.010
it resembles closely one of
your trigonometric identities

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.350
that you know about.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.130
So in particular, to make
it resemble it even more

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.260
I can multiply and divide by 2.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.170
So I can rewrite h
of x equals 2 times

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:21.840
1/2 sine x plus square root
of 3 over 2 times cosine x.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.970
And now 1/2 is equal
to cosine of pi over 3.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.530
And square root of 3 over 2
is equal to sine of pi over 3.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.770
So I can rewrite
this as 2 times--

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.530
what did I say-- I said
cosine pi over 3 sine x

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.620
plus sine pi over 3 cosine x.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.570
And this is exactly what you get
when you do the angle addition

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.424
formula for sine.

00:05:56.424 --> 00:05:58.090
This is the expanded
out form, and so we

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.390
can apply it in reverse
and get that this

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:09.774
is equal to 2 times sine
of x plus pi over 3.

00:06:09.774 --> 00:06:11.440
So, so far we haven't
done any calculus.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.660
We've just done-- so in this
solution, our first solution

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.830
we did some calculus
first and then

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.980
some algebra and trigonometry.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.430
So, so far we've just done
some algebra and trigonometry.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.230
Now the points where h
prime of x is equal to 0

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.990
are the points where the
graph of this function

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.580
has a horizontal tangent line.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.330
So either you can compute its
derivative using your rules

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.360
or by the definition.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.930
Or you can just say, oh, we
know what this graph looks like.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.750
So I've sort of drawn
a schematic up here.

00:06:45.222 --> 00:06:47.680
So this is a graph, this graph
is OK, so this is the graph,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.090
y equals 2 sine of
x plus pi over 3.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.500
It's what you get if you take
the graph y equals sine x,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.550
and you shift it
left by pi over 3

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.200
and you scale it up
by a factor of 2.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.480
So this here is at x
equals minus pi over 3.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.300
This root is x
equals 2*pi over 3.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.819
And the points
we're interested in

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:18.360
are the points where there's a
horizontal tangent line, where

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.580
the derivative is 0.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.690
And so there's one of these
right at this value, which

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.420
is pi over 6.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.420
And then the second one is
this, is that minimum there.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.650
So that happens at x
equals 7*pi over 6.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.740
pi over 6 because
for the usual sine

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.530
function it happens
at pi over 2,

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.140
but we shifted everything
left by pi over 3.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.850
And so pi over 2 minus
pi over 3 is pi over 6.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.110
And here for this, for
just y equals sine x,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.200
this minimum would
happen at 3*pi over 2,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.100
but we've shifted it
left by pi over 3.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.310
And so on. you
know, every, there's

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.970
another trough over here,
and another peak over there,

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.110
and so on.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.990
So that's the second way you
can do this question using

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.290
this cute trig identity here.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.257
And that's that.
