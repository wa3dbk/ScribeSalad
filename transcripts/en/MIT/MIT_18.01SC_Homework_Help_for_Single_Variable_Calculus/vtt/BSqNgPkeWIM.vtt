00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:07.390
Hi.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.850
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.450
In class, Professor Jerison
and Professor Miller

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.510
have taught you a little
bit about Taylor series

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.390
and some of the manipulations
you can do with them,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.434
and have computed a bunch
of examples for you.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.850
So I have three
more examples here

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.150
of functions whose Taylor
series are nice to compute.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.460
So the first one is cosh x.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.050
That's the hyperbolic cosine.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.220
So just to remind
you, this can be

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.345
written in terms of the
exponential function as e

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:35.940
to the x plus e to
the minus x over 2.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.600
The second one is
the function 2 times

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.525
sine of x times cosine of
x, just your regular sine

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:41.720
and cosine here.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.240
And the third one is x times
the logarithm of the quantity 1

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.620
minus x cubed.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.070
So why don't you pause
the video, take some time

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.815
to work out the Taylor series
for these three functions,

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:54.690
come back, and we can
work them out together.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.961
So here we have three
functions whose Taylor series

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.960
we're trying to compute.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.150
Let's start with the first
one and go from there.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.940
So this first one is
the hyperbolic cosine

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.525
that's given by the formula e
to the x plus e to the minus

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:14.351
x over 2.

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:15.850
So there are a
couple different ways

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.030
you could go about this one.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.020
This is actually,
the hyperbolic cosine

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.420
is very susceptible to
the method of just using

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.440
the formula that you have.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.520
So if you remember,
the derivative

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.660
of the hyperbolic cosine
is the hyperbolic sine.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.290
The derivative of
the hyperbolic sine

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.720
is the hyperbolic cosine again.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.750
So this function has very
easy-to-understand derivatives,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.390
which you can see, you know,
just by looking at its formula.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.130
It's easy to understand, because
the exponential function has

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.390
very simple derivatives,
and e to the the minus

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.440
x also has very
simple derivatives.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.180
So you could do it like that.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.221
The other thing you could
do, is that you already

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:50.250
know the Taylor
series for e to the x.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.500
And I believe you've also
seen the Taylor series for e

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.530
to the minus x, and even if you
haven't, you can figure it out

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.800
just by substitution.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.560
So if you remember, so e to the
x is given by the sum from n

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.940
equals 0 to infinity of x
to the n over n factorial.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.410
I'm going to pull
the 1/2 out in front.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.230
And e to the minus x is
given by the same thing,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.250
if you put in minus x for x.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.740
So it's n equals 0 to infinity,
so that works out to minus 1

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.580
to the n x to the
n or n factorial.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.560
Now, when you add these
two series together,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.110
what you see is that when
n is even, over here,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.830
you have x to the n over n
factorial, and over here,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.700
you have x to the
n over n factorial.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.690
So what you get is,
well, you get 2 x

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.200
to the n over n factorial, and
then you multiply by a half,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.900
so you just get x to
the n over n factorial.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.920
When n is odd, here you have
x to the n over n factorial,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.730
and here you have minus 1 x
to the n over n factorial.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.630
So you add them and you get 0.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.820
So what happens is that
this series looks just

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.970
like the series for e to the
x, except the odd terms have

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:56.850
died off.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.530
So we're left with just 1 plus x
squared over 2 factorial plus x

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.050
to the fourth over 4 factorial
plus x to the sixth over 6

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.810
factorial, and so on.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.100
And if you wanted to write
this in summation notation,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.710
you could write it
as the sum from n

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:24.870
equals 0 to infinity of x
to the 2n over 2n factorial.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.880
So this is the Taylor series for
the hyperbolic cosine function.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.891
Also, if you wanted, say,
the hyperbolic sine function,

00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:34.390
you could do something
very similar,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.120
or you could remember that
the hyperbolic sine is

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.890
the derivative of the
hyperbolic cosine,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.870
and just take a derivative
right from this expression.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.965
One other thing that
you should notice

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:46.830
is that this looks very similar
to the expression of the Taylor

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.010
series for cosine of x.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.730
So more of our sort
of funny coincidences

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.220
between regular trig functions
and hyperbolic trig functions.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.720
All right.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.560
That's the first one.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.450
How about the second one?

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.620
So here we have just some
regular trig functions.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.460
We have 2 sine x cosine x.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.660
Let me see where
I've got some space.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.390
I can do it right here.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.820
Let me box off a little
space for myself.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.890
So 2 sine x cosine x-- there
are a couple different ways

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.430
you could proceed
with this function.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.080
So one is, you know the Taylor
series for sine x and cosine x

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.880
already.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.670
So if all you wanted was a few
terms of this Taylor series,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.800
one natural thing to do would be
to take the series for sine x,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.970
take the series for cosine
x, multiply them together

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.470
like you would
multiply polynomials,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.300
and what you would get
is the Taylor series

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.467
for this expression,
for this function.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:38.550
That's one way to proceed.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.740
That works perfectly well.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.790
Another thing you
could do, is you

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.080
could try taking derivatives.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.040
You could have a situation
where every time you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.980
take a derivative, you
apply product rule.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.813
It's going to get more
and more complicated.

00:04:47.813 --> 00:04:48.780
It still works.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.950
It's a little complicated
to do it that way,

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.719
if you wanted more
than just a few terms.

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.260
The other thing you could do,
is you could remember your trig

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.400
identities.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.960
So if you look at
this expression,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.210
this should be familiar to you,
because it's just sine of 2x.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.740
So once you realize
that this is sine of 2x,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.152
there's a much,
much shorter path

00:05:10.152 --> 00:05:12.610
available to you, which is that
you already know the Taylor

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.710
series for sine of x,
so what you can do,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.290
is you can just plug in 2x
into that Taylor series.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.550
So sine of x is-- well, so OK.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.560
So sine of x is x--
so in this case,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.850
that's going to be 2x--
then minus, so in sine of x,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.050
we have x cubed
over 3 factorial.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:37.350
So here we're going to have 2x
cubed over 3 factorial plus--

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.850
OK.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.730
So then, you know, and so on.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.560
So here we'll have 2x to
the fifth over 5 factorial

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.527
minus-- so on.

00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:48.610
If you wanted to write
this in summation notation,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.570
you could write it as the sum
from n equals 0 to infinity.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.500
Well, the denominator has got
to be 2n plus 1 factorial,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.310
because we want it to
go through the odds.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:10.140
And then we've got minus 1 to
the n times 2 to the 2n plus 1

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.360
times x to the 2n plus 1.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.625
So this is 2x.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:17.340
What we've got here, if you
didn't have the 2's there,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.371
that would just be the
series for the regular sine.

00:06:20.371 --> 00:06:20.870
OK.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.570
So this is the series for this
function, 2 sine x cosine x.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.039
And I'll go over here
to do the third one.

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.080
So what is the third one?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.880
It's x ln 1 minus x cubed.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.400
Well, what can we
do with this series?

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.780
The x out front is just
multiplying this logarithm

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.290
part.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.190
That's something we
can save until the end.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.820
If we can figure out what the
Taylor series for the ln of 1

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.382
minus x cubed part is, then
we just multiply x into it,

00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:54.840
and that'll give us the Taylor
series for this whole thing.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.010
So the x out front
is pretty simple.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.460
So now what about this ln
of 1 minus x cubed stuff?

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.251
Well, a thing to remember
is, does it remind you

00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:05.500
of anything we've done before?

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.821
Well, we have a Taylor series
for a logarithm function,

00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:08.320
right?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.820
We've already seen in
lecture, I believe,

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.240
we've seen that
ln of 1 plus x is

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:26.610
equal to x minus x squared
over 2 plus x cubed over 3,

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.810
minus x to the fourth over four,
and so on, alternating signs.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.070
Notice that the denominators,
when you have a logarithm,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.330
these are not factorials.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.240
These are just the integer 2,
the integer 3, the integer 4,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.100
unlike for exponentials
and trig functions.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.990
So this is what
log of 1 plus x--

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.454
this is the Taylor series
for log of 1 plus x.

00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:50.620
Well, how does that help us?

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.100
Well, log of 1 minus x cubed we
can get from log of 1 plus x,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.780
with the appropriate
substitution.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.550
So in particular,
we just have to put

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.430
minus x cubed in for x here.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.130
So what does that give us?

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:12.090
It gives us the ln of 1 minus
x cubed is equal to-- well,

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:20.510
minus x cubed minus, so we
put minus x cubed in here,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.870
we square it, and we
just get x to the sixth.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.214
x to the sixth over 2.

00:08:25.214 --> 00:08:25.880
Then, all right.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.660
So minus x cubed quantity
cubed is minus x to the ninth.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:37.690
So minus x to the ninth over 3,
minus x to the twelfth over 4,

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.710
and so on.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:48.840
And so finally, x ln
of 1 minus x cubed,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.660
we just get by multiplying this
whole expression through by x.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.592
So this is equal to minus
x to the fourth minus x

00:08:56.592 --> 00:09:02.203
to the seventh over 2 minus
x-- whoops, not ten-- minus

00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:09.504
x to the tenth over 3, minus
x to the 13 over 4, and so on.

00:09:09.504 --> 00:09:11.170
And I'll leave it as
an exercise for you

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.850
to figure out how to write
this in summation notation,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:14.497
if you wanted.

00:09:14.497 --> 00:09:17.080
So just quickly to summarize,
we had these three power series,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.029
these three functions
that we started out with,

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:22.820
and we used a bunch of
different techniques

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.236
that we've learned in order
to compute their power series.

00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:29.520
So over here, we took the
function that we'd seen,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.010
and we knew a formula for it
in terms of other functions

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.760
that we already knew, and so we
plugged in those power series,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.447
and used our addition
rule for power series.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:41.030
We could have also done this one
directly from the definition,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.130
if we had wanted to.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.670
For the second one, for
the 2 sine x cosine x,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.965
we recognized that
as something that

00:09:46.965 --> 00:09:50.750
is susceptible to a
substitution, although also,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.290
with a little more,
work, we could

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.220
have done it by a couple
of different methods.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.810
For example, by multiplying
two power series together.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.420
And finally, for this
third one, for the x ln

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.586
of 1 minus x cubed, we first
saw the substitution here

00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:04.960
that we could make, and then
we just did a multiplication

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.050
by a polynomial, which is
a relatively easy thing

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.970
to do for power series.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.980
So that's what we did
in this recitation,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.114
and I'll leave it at that.
