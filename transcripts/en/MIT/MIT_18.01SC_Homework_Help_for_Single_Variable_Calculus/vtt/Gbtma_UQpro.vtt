00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.850
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to recitation.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.660
Today in this video
what we're going to do

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.250
is look at how we can
determine the graph

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.930
of a derivative of a
function from the graph

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.310
of the function itself.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.950
So I've given a function here.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.330
We're calling it just y equals
f of x-- or this is the curve,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.260
y equals f of x.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.860
So we're thinking about
a function f of x.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm not giving you the
equation for the function.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.090
I'm just giving you the graph.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.780
And what I'd like
you to do, what

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.490
I'd like us to do
in this time, is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.820
to figure out what
the curve y equals

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.570
f prime of x will look like.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.500
So that's our objective.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.940
So what we'll do first is
try and figure out the things

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.030
that we know about f prime of x.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.600
So what I want to
remind you is that when

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.250
you think about a
function's derivative,

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.350
remember its
derivative's output is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.870
measuring the slope of the
tangent line at each point.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.810
So that's what we're
interested in finding,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.310
is understanding the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.970
of this curve at each x-value.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.890
So it's always
easiest when you're

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.160
thinking about a derivative
to find the places where

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.196
the slope of the
tangent line is 0.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.570
Because those are
the only places

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.990
where you can hope to change
the sign on the derivative.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130
So what we'd like to do is
first identify, on this curve,

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.260
where the tangent line
has slope equal to 0.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.390
And I think there are two places
we can find it fairly easily.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.080
That would be at whatever this
x value is, that slope there

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.580
is 0.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.640
It's going to be a
horizontal tangent line.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.700
And then whatever
this x value is.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.410
The slope there is also 0.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.779
Horizontal tangent line.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:40.320
But there's a third place where
the slope of the tangent line

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.510
is 0, and that's kind
of hidden right in here.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.650
And actually, I've
drawn in-- maybe you

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.900
think there are a
few more-- but we're

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.430
going to assume that this
function is always continuing

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.050
down through this region.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.590
So there are three places where
the tangent line is horizontal.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.384
So I can even sort of draw
them lightly through here.

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:03.050
You have three
horizontal tangent lines.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.230
So at those points, we know
that the derivative's value is

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.860
equal to 0, the
output is equal to 0.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.630
And now what we can determine
is, between those regions,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.590
where are the values of
the derivative positive and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.560
negative?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.426
So what I'm going
to do is below here,

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:20.050
I'm just going to
make a line and we're

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.210
going to sort of
keep track of what

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.000
the signs of the derivative are.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.770
So let me just draw.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.691
This would be sort of
our sign on f prime.

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:35.190
OK.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.210
So that's going to tell
us what our signs are.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.100
So right below,
we'll keep track.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.980
So here, this, I'll
just come straight down.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.938
Here we know the sign of
f prime is equal to 0.

00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:46.100
OK?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.480
We know it's equal to 0 there.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.002
We know it's also
equal to 0 here,

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:52.585
and we know it's
also equal to 0 here.

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:54.510
OK?

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.060
And now the question
is, what is the sign

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.890
of f prime in this region?

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.950
So to the left of
whatever that x value is.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.990
What is the sign of f prime in
this region, in this region,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.190
and then to the right?

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.650
So there are really-- we
can divide up the x-values

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.460
as left of whatever that
x-value is, in between these two

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.750
values, in between
these two values,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.184
and to the right
of this x-value.

00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:16.600
That's really,
really what we need

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.080
to do to determine what
the signs of f prime are.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.350
So again, what we want
to do to understand

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.490
f prime is we look at the
slope of the tangent line

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.670
of the curve y equals f of x.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.030
So let's pick a place in this
region left of where it's 0,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.500
say right here, and let's
look at the tangent line.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.060
The tangent line has
what kind of slope?

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.870
Well, it has a positive slope.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.560
And in fact, if you look along
here, you see all of the slopes

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.100
are positive.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.507
So f prime is
bigger than 0 here.

00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:51.090
And now I'm just
going to record that.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.798
I'm going to keep that
in mind as a plus.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.010
The sign is positive there.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.550
Now, if I look right of
where f prime equals 0,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.190
if I look for
x-values to the right,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.660
I see that as I
move to the right,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.369
the tangent line
is curving down.

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.660
So let me do it with the chalk.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.100
You see the tangent line looks,
has a slope negative slope.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.020
If I draw one point in, it
looks something like that.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.650
So the slope is negative there.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.940
So here I can record that.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.400
The sign of f prime
is a minus sign there.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.540
Now, if I look between
these two x-values, which

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.810
I'm saying here it's 0 and
here it's 0 for the x values,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.080
and I take a take a point, we
notice the sign is negative

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.900
there, also.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.290
So in fact, the sign
of f prime changed

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.380
at this zero of f prime,
but it stays the same

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.970
around this zero of f prime.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.400
So it's negative and then
it goes to negative again.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.620
It's negative, then
0, then negative.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.890
And then if I look to
the right of this x-value

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.790
and I take a point, I see that
the slope of the tangent line

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.689
is positive.

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:55.105
And so the sign
there is positive.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.370
So we have the derivative is
positive, and then 0, and then

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.230
negative, and then 0, and then
negative, and then 0, and then

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.070
positive.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.640
So there's a lot going on.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.000
But I, if I want to plot,
now, y equals f prime of x, I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.600
have some sort of launching
point by which to do that.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.060
So what I can do is, I know
that the derivative 0--

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.360
I'm going to draw the
derivative in blue,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.380
here-- the derivative is 0, its
output is 0 at these places.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.724
So I'm going to put
those points on.

00:05:26.724 --> 00:05:29.140
And then if I were just trying
to get a rough idea of what

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.910
happens, the derivative is
positive left of this x value.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.376
So it's certainly coming down.

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:36.413
It's coming down.

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:41.130
Oops, let me make
these a little darker.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.190
It's coming down
because it's positive.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.610
It's coming down to 0-- it
has to stay above the x-axis,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.185
but it has to head towards 0.

00:05:48.185 --> 00:05:49.677
Right?

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:51.260
What does that
actually correspond to?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.000
Well, look at what
the slopes are doing.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.070
The slopes of these
tangent lines,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.250
as I move in the x-direction,
the slope-- let me just

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.630
keep my hand, watch what my hand
is doing-- the slope is always

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.960
positive, but it's becoming
less and less vertical, right?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.710
It's headed towards horizontal.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.470
So the slope that
was steeper over here

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.610
is becoming less steep.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.120
The steepness is really the
magnitude of the derivative.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.370
That's really measuring how far
it is, the output is, from 0.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.610
So as the derivative
becomes less steep,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.780
the derivative's values have
to be headed closer to 0.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.649
Now, what happens when the
derivative is equal to 0 here?

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:28.940
Well, all of a sudden the
slopes are becoming negative.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.735
So the outputs of the
derivative are negative.

00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:34.150
It's going down.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.140
But then once it hits here,
again, notice what happens.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.780
The derivative is 0 again,
and notice how I get there.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.494
The derivative's
negative, and then it

00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:44.757
starts to-- the slopes of
these tangent lines start

00:06:44.757 --> 00:06:45.465
to get shallower.

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:47.350
Right?

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.062
They were steep and
then somewhere they

00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:50.020
start to get shallower.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.270
So there's someplace sort of
in the x-values between here

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.100
and here where the
derivative is as

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.750
steep as it gets in this region,
and then gets less steep.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.800
The steepest point
is that point where

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.020
you have the biggest magnitude
in that region for f prime.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.650
So that's where it's going
to be furthest from 0.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.020
So if I'm guessing,
it looks like right

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.720
around here the tangent
line is as steep as it ever

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.480
gets in that region,
between these two zeros,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.980
and then it gets less steep.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.110
So I'd say, right
around there we

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.094
should say, OK, that's
as low as it goes

00:07:21.094 --> 00:07:22.552
and now it's going
to come back up.

00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:24.390
OK?

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.850
So hopefully that makes sense.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.640
We'll get to see it again, here.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.430
Between these two zeros the
same kind of thing happens.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.350
But notice-- this is, we have
to be careful-- we shouldn't

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.306
go through 0 here because
the derivative's output,

00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:37.180
the sign is negative.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.092
Right?

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:40.550
Notice, so the
tangent line, it was

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.380
negative, negative, negative,
0, oh, it's still negative.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.260
So the outputs are
still negative,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.870
and they're going to be negative
all the way to this zero.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.530
And what we need to see again
is the same kind of thing

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.040
happens as happened
in this region

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.240
will happen in this region.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.450
The point being that,
again, we're 0 here.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.920
We're 0 here.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.650
So somewhere in the
middle, we start at 0,

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.260
the tangent lines start to get
steeper, then at some point

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.090
they stop getting steeper,
they start getting shallower.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.370
That place looks maybe
right around here.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.770
That's the sort of
steepest tangent line,

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.180
then it gets less steep.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.480
So that's the place where
the derivative's magnitude

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.621
is going to be the
biggest in this region.

00:08:22.621 --> 00:08:24.120
And actually, I've
sort of drawn it,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.620
they look like they're about
the same steepness at those two

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.370
places, so I should probably
put the outputs about the same

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:30.870
down here.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.150
Their magnitudes
are about the same.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.686
So this has to bounce
off, come up here.

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:38.560
I made that a little
sharper than I meant to.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.720
OK?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.710
So that's the place.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.100
That's the output here--
or the tangent line, sorry.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.690
The tangent line at this
x value is the steepest

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:52.210
that we get in this region,
so the output at that x-value

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.830
is the lowest we get.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.370
And then, when
we're to the right

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.680
of this zero for
the derivative, we

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.610
start seeing the
tangent lines positive--

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.706
we pointed that out already--
and it gets more positive.

00:09:02.706 --> 00:09:04.580
So it starts at 0, it
starts to get positive,

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.220
and then it gets more positive.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.730
It's going to do something
like that, roughly.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.580
So let me fill in the dotted
lines so we can see it clearly.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.430
Well, this is not
exact, but this

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.130
is a fairly good drawing,
I think we can say,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:30.260
of f prime of x.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.740
y equals f prime of x.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.670
And now I'm going to
ask you a question.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.444
I'm going to write
it on the board,

00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:38.860
and then I'm going to give you
a moment to think about it.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.068
So let me write the question.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:54.085
It's, find a function
y equals-- or sorry--

00:09:54.085 --> 00:10:06.200
find a function g of x so that
y equals g prime of x looks

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.566
like y equals f prime of x.

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:13.440
OK, let me be clear
about that, and then I'll

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.010
give you a moment
to think about it.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.525
So I want you to
find a function g

00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:20.910
of x so that its derivative's
graph, y equals g prime of x,

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.500
looks exactly like the graph
we've drawn in blue here,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.230
y equals f prime of x.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.470
Now, I don't want you to
find something in terms

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.460
of x squareds and x cubes.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:34.620
I don't want you to find an
actual g of x equals something

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.390
in terms of x.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.260
I want you to just try
and find a relationship

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.770
that it must have with f.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.929
So I'm going to give me a
moment to think about it

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.220
and work out your answer,
and I'll be back to tell you.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.280
OK.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.170
Welcome back.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.160
So what we're looking
for is a function

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.840
g of x so that its
derivative, when I graph it,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.330
y equals g prime of x, I
get exactly the same curve

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.500
as the blue one.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.970
The blue one.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.780
And the point is
that if you thought

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.840
about it for a little
bit, what you really

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.670
need is a function that looks
exactly like this function,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.510
y equals f of x, at all
the x-values in terms

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.230
of its slopes, but
those slopes can happen

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.190
shifted up or down anywhere.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.650
So the point is that if I
take the function y equals

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.920
f of x and I add a constant
to it, which shifts

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.500
the whole graph up or
down, the tangent lines

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.570
are unaffected by that shift.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.400
And so I get exactly
the same picture

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.070
when I take the
derivative of that graph.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.070
When I look at that the tangent
line slopes of that graph.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.010
So you could draw
another picture

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.790
and check it for yourself if
you didn't feel convinced,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.390
shift this, shift this
curve up, and then look

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.400
at what the tangent
lines do on that curve.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.590
But then you'll see its
derivative's outputs

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.350
are exactly the same.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.819
So we'll stop there.
