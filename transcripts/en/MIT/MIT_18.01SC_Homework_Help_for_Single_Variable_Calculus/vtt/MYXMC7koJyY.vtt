PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.520
In this video we're going to
do another solid of revolution

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.250
problem.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.440
So what I'd like to
do in this problem is

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.890
to find the volume of the
solid generated by rotating

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.530
the region bounded by the
following curves: y equals 0,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.685
x equal 4, and y equals square
root of x, around the line x

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:26.010
equals 6.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.360
And you can choose your
favorite method to do this.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.040
What I would like
first, when you're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.860
doing this kind
of problem, is get

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.900
a rough sketch of the region.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.440
So you have some
picture of what's

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.229
actually going to happen.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.520
You don't necessarily need
a three-dimensional picture.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.530
But at least have the
two-dimensional region

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.990
and understand the where the
rotation line is, with respect

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.340
to that region.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.140
So I will give you
a little bit of time

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.410
to work on that problem.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.640
And when I come back I'll
show you how I do it.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.800
OK, welcome back.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.115
So again, what we're
doing in this video is

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:07.990
we're going to be looking,
finding the volume

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.337
of a solid of revolution.

00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:11.420
And as I mentioned, the
first thing you want to do

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.650
is get a rough picture
of what the region looks

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.020
like that's being rotated.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.870
So I'm going to draw a
rough sketch of that.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.480
Right here.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.840
So my axes, here's my x-axis
and my y-axis, and I will draw,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.690
first the curve y equals 0.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.120
That's y equals 0.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.830
And I'm next going to draw the
curve y equals square root of x

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.520
to make this a little easier for
myself, to do that one first.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.490
So y equals square root of
x looks something like this,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.720
roughly.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.400
And then, x equal 4, because
it's a very rough sketch,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.900
I can just draw
this line right here

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.870
and say that line's x equal 4.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.770
And I want the region bounded
by those three curves.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.760
So, this region right here.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.632
And my rotating line, in
this case, is x equals 6.

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:07.090
So to give myself
some perspective,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.310
I remember this is x equals
4, here's x equals 0.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.150
So x equals 6, which
may be right about here,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.030
I'll draw a dotted line.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
And I'm going to draw a
little arrow around there

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.340
so I know that's the
line I'm rotating about.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300
Now we notice there's a
little bit of a gap here.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.880
But you can actually work on
this problem quite simply.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.640
If we use the shell
method, we won't have

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.770
to worry about the gap at all.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.490
We will have to be careful in
how we determine our radius.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.630
That's actually where you'll
see this sort of gap coming up.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.249
So when I rotate
this around, I'm

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:44.790
going to get some
object that's going

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.873
to have a nice curve here.

00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:48.540
And there's going to be a little
cut-out, a cylinder missing

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020
in the middle when I rotate it.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.310
So I'm going to use
the shell method.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.560
I like the shell method
for this problem.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.720
You could use the washer
method for this problem,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.740
but I like the shells and
that's what I'm going to use.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.210
So to do the shell method,
remember we are going to be

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.130
interested in 2*pi*r*h.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.560
That's really what we need.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.140
And now what we
want to figure out

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.473
is, do I want to do this in
terms of x or in terms of y?

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:17.550
All right?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.442
When I talk about
these shells is

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:21.650
it better to think about
them as functions of x or y?

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.600
And it will, you'll
see we sort of

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.570
have to think about
them in a certain way.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.200
So if I draw, let's think about
if I draw a straight line down

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.740
and I rotate it
around the line x

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.720
equals 6, which I should
have labeled here,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.210
then I get my shell.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.300
So I need these lines
to go from 0 to 4.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.210
I need to have those
lines go from 0 to 4.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.200
And so I see that it's the
x-value I'm varying over.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.550
So I know this is all going to
be an integral in terms of x.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.560
So let's keep that in mind.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.400
So r I should write as a
function of x, and h I should

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.180
write as a function of x.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.770
So if I examined this
segment again here,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.120
the height is fairly simple.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.290
Because what is this curve?

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.750
This is the curve y
equals square root of x.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.890
So the height is just
square root of x.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.750
So h is equal to
square root of x.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.850
And so now I just
need r in terms of x.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.970
Well let's look at
this segment again.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.160
It's just a generic position.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.750
How would I find that radius?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.940
What is the radius?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.300
Well I'm going to draw the
three-dimensional picture over

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.550
here.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.950
That that's this
curve, this segment,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.155
rotated about the
line x equals 6.

00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:38.870
Right?

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.710
And the radius is not x.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.612
It's the distance from x
equals 6 to my segment.

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:47.820
That's an important distinction
we should understand.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.700
If we come back and
look at this picture,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.778
this is not the radius.

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:51.980
Right?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.730
The radius is the distance from
this value to this value in x.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.850
And how do I measure that?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.570
Well that's fairly
straightforward.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.020
That's the difference in x
values between these two.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.890
The x value here is 6.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.090
And the x value here,
this is a generic x.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.570
So the difference, the
distance, is just 6 minus x.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.070
Right?

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.040
This is just a simple case
of the distance formula.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.730
Because I'm not interested
in the changes in y, at all.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.570
I'm just interested in the
difference between these two

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.770
x values.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.210
So it's simply 6 minus x.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.960
That's our radius.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.800
So now I have the
radius in terms of x.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.080
And I have the
height in terms of x.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.710
So I can completely
set up my integral.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.300
So let me come a
little bit further over

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.300
and set up the integral.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.380
So I know I'm
integrating-- we even

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.560
said what we were integrating
from and to already.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.280
I'm starting x at 0.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.280
And I'm stopping
it at x equal 4.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.820
And then I want to
integrate 2*pi*r*h.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.280
So I'll put the
2*pi out in front.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.300
The radius is 6 minus x.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.750
And the height is
square root of x.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.010
And then I'm integrating
it all in dx.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.750
And at this point,
solving the problem

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.130
is fairly straightforward.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.880
I can write square root
of x as x to the 1/2

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.420
to make myself feel a
little better about it.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.280
I can then distribute.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.870
And then I just use the power
rule to do the integration

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.039
and evaluate to get an actual
number, to get that volume.

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.580
So I'm going to go
back and just make

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.815
sure we remember what
all the pieces are

00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:35.440
and that we feel
comfortable with doing

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.560
this type of problem.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.410
And I'll let you
finish and evaluate

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.560
that if you would like
to know an actual number.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.790
So let's come back over.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.840
We were finding the volume
of a solid generated

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.980
by rotating a certain region
around the line x equals 6.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.992
The way this might be
different from some

00:06:52.992 --> 00:06:54.450
of the problems
you've seen before,

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.840
is it's not the x or y axis.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.330
And the region has a gap.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.790
The region is not connected
to the line of rotation.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.170
So if we come to
see our picture,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.810
we can see that clearly.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.240
The rotating region
is the blue region.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.960
The line of rotation
is the dotted line.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.770
So there's a little
bit of a gap there.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.680
I let you pick your
favorite method.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.530
I chose shells,
because I didn't have

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.640
to worry about subtracting off
pieces, this little piece here.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.150
It was inherent in
the radius, the way

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.280
I determined the radius and
the x values that I chose.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.090
So I used shell method.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.880
And so how did I, I had to
figure out a couple things.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.030
I had to figure out
first, what variable

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.737
I was doing this in, x or y.

00:07:35.737 --> 00:07:37.820
And then I had to figure
out the radius and height

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.500
in terms of that variable.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.040
You figure out what variable
you need by saying, OK

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.010
if I'm doing shells, I'm looking
at these kinds of segments.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.980
And I'm varying
the x-values, then,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:50.610
as I move and look at
those different segments.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.660
So I know that this is
a dx type of problem.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.810
I know I'm integrating
something in x.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.799
So then I have to find radius
and height in terms of x.

00:07:58.799 --> 00:07:59.840
The height's the freebie.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.210
It's just from 0
up to the function.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.460
The radius is maybe
a little harder.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.010
But that's still
just the distance

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.470
between the line of rotation
and the point where you are.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.880
And so that's 6 minus x.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.790
And then I just set up
the integral from there.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.515
So that's really
what the idea is

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:21.160
in doing these
types of problems.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.120
And because we get to pick
our simplest way, for me

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.720
it was shells.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.850
Maybe you picked washers.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.270
But for me, this problem,
the simplest way is shells.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.946
So I guess that's
where I'll stop.
