00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.740
In this video, I'd like us
to do the following problem.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.560
I want us to show that the
function, if I integrate

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.075
x to the n, e to the minus
x from 1 to infinity,

00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:22.890
that that actually converges
for any value of n.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.540
And I want us to show this
without using integration

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.980
by parts n times.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.370
So I'd like you to
figure out a way

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.320
to show that this
integral converges.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.920
And again, what we mean by
converges, is for a fixed value

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.985
here, say, some b,
if I let-- the limit

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:43.660
as b goes to infinity, that
that sequence of values

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.150
converges to a finite number.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.910
That's what we mean, again, when
we say an integral converges.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.830
Ultimately, we want to
show this is finite.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.860
So show this is finite,
without using integration

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.060
by parts n times.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.250
So I'll give you a little
while to work on it,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.660
and then I'll be back, and I
will show you how I did it.

00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:08.820
OK.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.570
Welcome back.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.880
Well, I want to
show you how we can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.174
show that this integral
actually convergences for any n.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:17.340
And I don't want to have
to use integration by parts

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.070
and kill off powers of
x in order to do that.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.840
So again, the integral is from
1 to infinity of x to the n, e

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.540
to the minus x dx.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.450
And if you recall,
Professor Jerison

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.590
was showing, in
the lecture video,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.510
that if you can show even
from, not 1 to infinity,

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.030
but from very far
out to infinity,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.190
that that integral
converges, from 1

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.120
to whatever the far-out value
is, this integral is finite.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.620
OK?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.270
Doesn't blow up.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.080
It's going to be potentially
a very big number,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.600
but it is going to
be a finite number.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.475
There are no places
where we run into trouble

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.370
with this function.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.290
It's a continuous function
from 1 to infinity.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.150
So we can go very
far out and say, OK,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.080
from very far out to infinity,
the integral converges.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.250
And then that's
going to be enough.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.470
So we did see that kind
of technique earlier.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.364
But I just want to remind you,
that's what we're going to do.

00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:09.280
Now, you might have
thought about this problem

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.990
and said, well, I
know that x to the n

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.450
is much smaller than e to the
x for values of x very large.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.810
So you might have said-- I think
you used this notation also

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.560
in the lecture. x to
the n is much smaller

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.750
than e to the x for large x.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.810
So what if we tried to do
a comparison with those two

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.340
functions?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.700
We're going to see,
that's not quite enough.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.960
But let's say x is very large,
and let's look at a comparison.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.990
If I say, the
integral from, say,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.620
some very large R to infinity of
x to the n e to the minus x dx,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.960
it's certainly going to be
much smaller than the integral

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.560
from big R to infinity of e
to the x times e to the minus

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.339
x dx.

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:59.880
And you think, well,
you know, that's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.690
a pretty good first step.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.660
I'm doing all right.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.710
But what happens here?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.050
What's e to the x
times e to the minus x?

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.290
It's e to the x plus negative x,
so it's e to the 0, so it's 1.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.880
So this is integrating
the constant 1.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.230
Well, the constant 1 from R
to infinity, think of that.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.720
It's the line y equals
1 from R to infinity.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.190
It's an arbitrarily
long rectangle.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.760
That's got a lot of area.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.200
It's got infinite area.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.379
So this integral diverges.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.170
That doesn't mean this
one diverges, right?

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.920
Because this one is
smaller than that one.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.950
So this one here
could still converge,

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.659
even though this
integral diverged.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.700
Again, let me remind you.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.991
Why does this integral diverge?

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:38.760
Because this is
actually equal to 1.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.610
If I integrate 1
from R to infinity,

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.450
I get something infinite.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.990
So you might have
started with that,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.600
but that's not
quite good enough.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.700
Right?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.480
What is going to
be good enough, is

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.560
if I pick any constant
in front of this n--

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.850
I can put any constant in
front of this n I want,

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.010
bigger than 1.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.590
And that's going to help us out.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.300
So I'm going to
pick the constant 2,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.071
because it's going to be easy,
and it's a nice fixed number.

00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:08.430
If I-- so this is how you do
it correctly, or one strategy

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.020
to do it correctly.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.940
If I take x to the 2n, instead
of just x to the n, for any n,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.640
there's some R big enough
so that x to the 2n

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.820
is much less than e
to the x for all x

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.950
bigger than or equal to some R.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.090
So if I go far enough out
in x-values, x to the 2n

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.060
is much smaller than e to the x.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.520
So let's say that that
value is capital R,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.600
and then we're much smaller.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.690
This is not very formal,
but it's getting closer

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.590
to a formal kind of thing.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.520
Then that means x to
the n is much smaller

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.661
than e to the x over 2.

00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:49.160
Right?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.960
And that's going to be the key.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.430
Let's anticipate why that is.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.080
The problem with the
substitution of e to the x

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.380
was that e to the x times e
to the minus x gave you 1.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.170
But if I use e to
the x over 2, I'm

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.870
going to end up
with some function,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.380
e to the minus
something, and that's

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.040
going to be good, because
that's going to converge.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.110
So if you tried
e to the x first,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.620
and you saw you didn't
get a good function,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.190
you didn't have to stop there.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.790
You could say,
well, I was close.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.020
The problem is, I cancelled off
all the e to the minus power,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.960
which is what I
want to keep around.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.770
If I want to keep
some of that around,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.554
then I have to have a little
less power of e to the x there.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:27.470
I have to have-- I can't
just have e to the x.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.790
I should have something like
square root of e to the x.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.570
So e to the x over 2.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.340
That's going to help us out.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.440
So this is, this is
kind of, as you're

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.180
working on this type
of problem, this

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.260
is some of the thought process
you want to go through.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.480
So what do we see here?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.490
We have x to the n is much
less than e to the x over 2

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.580
for x bigger than or equal to r.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.200
So now let's do
a comparison with

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.960
our new comparative function.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.829
So I'm going to come over,
and this will be our last line

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:55.620
to finish this off.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.860
So now we're integrating from
R to infinity x to the n,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.520
e to the minus x dx.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.010
And we know that's going to
be much less than integral

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:15.460
from R to infinity, e to the
x over 2, e to the minus x dx.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.960
And now let's figure
out what this is.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.930
e to the minus x plus x over
2 is e to the minus x over 2.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.510
And the good news is, this
is, we know this converges.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.010
I'll check, and I'll show you,
remind you that it converges.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.134
But we know this converges.

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:38.210
And the reason is, because e to
the minus x is a function that

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.030
decays so fast as it goes to 0.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.090
That's really why you
get the convergence.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.250
Actually, you could even
compare this to x to the minus 2

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.949
right away.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.490
And you could get
something like, you

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.460
know this decays faster
than x to the minus 2,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.100
and we know x to the
minus 2 converges.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.230
So you could even
compare it to that.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.256
You could do a second
comparison in here.

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:00.630
But I'll actually
calculate this,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.460
just to remind us
how we do this.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.400
So e to the minus x over 2.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.750
If I want to find
an antiderivative,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.590
I'm going to guess and check.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.370
I know I'm going to have an e
to the minus x over 2 again,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.270
and then I need to be able
to kill off a negative 1/2.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.300
So I should put a
negative 2 in front.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.080
Let's double check.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.330
This is basically a
substitution problem.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.120
An easy substitution.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.340
So e to the minus x over 2.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.230
Its derivative is negative
1/2 x, and then itself again.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.750
The negative 1/2 times
negative 2 gives me a 1.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.640
So again, I'm just, it's an
easy substitution problem,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.340
but I always want to check.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.280
So I evaluate that
from R to infinity.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.160
Well, the point is, e to the
minus infinity-- this is 0.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.010
As x goes to infinity,
this quantity goes to 0.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.820
So I get 0 minus a
negative 2, so plus 2, e

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.460
to the minus R over 2.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.780
For some fixed, big R.
Well, that's finite.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.460
That's a finite number.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.360
So we come back here.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.210
This integral converges.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.260
That integral was this integral.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.580
And this integral, then,
is bigger than this one.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.550
So this one converges.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.050
Now, this had a lot
of pieces to it,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.280
so I'm going to remind us
sort of what was happening.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.030
So let's go back to
the original function,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.410
and I'll just take us back
through one more time.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:15.910
OK.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.350
So the original
problem was, show

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.445
that this integral from 1
to infinity of x to the n e

00:08:21.445 --> 00:08:24.310
to the minus x dx converges.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.210
And I reminded you that
you knew from lecture

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.300
that if I could show
that it converged

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.940
for some very large number
down here to infinity,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.570
that was sufficient,
because this function is

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.334
continuous from 1 to infinity.

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:37.750
I don't have to
worry about places

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.564
where I might get infinite
area in a finite interval.

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:43.980
I'm always going to have finite
area in a finite interval.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.470
So if I start at some big R to
infinity and that converges,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.230
then I'm good.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.330
Because from 1 to R,
that'll be finite.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.180
So then the point is,
you want to compare.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.660
And I mentioned a comparison
that doesn't quite work,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.510
but is a good first test.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.360
Because you know
x to the n is much

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.050
less than e to the x for
a sufficiently large x.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.440
You might think to
compare it to that,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.430
but the problem again was when
we do that substitution, we

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.920
actually get an
integral that diverges.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.410
But a divergent integral
bigger than something

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.270
doesn't mean this one diverges.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.510
If the divergence
was-- the inequality

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.340
was the other way, then you
could show this one diverged.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.810
But we actually show
convergence this way.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.150
Or we're trying to show
convergence in this direction,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.200
so we need to say, if
this one converges, then

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.540
that one converges.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.080
This diverging doesn't tell
us anything about this.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.090
So then we say, OK.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.400
This one didn't work,
but it almost worked.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.260
So what if I figure out a
way to compare x to the n

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.690
to a slightly smaller
thing than e to the x?

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.015
And that slightly smaller
thing is e to the x over 2.

00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:47.390
It's not really
slightly smaller.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:51.430
But the smaller function
is e to the x over 2.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.930
OK?

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.180
And this is a way to think
about how that works.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.458
Is that for any
power of x to the 2n,

00:09:56.458 --> 00:09:57.833
I can still get
it smaller than e

00:09:57.833 --> 00:09:59.666
to the x for some
sufficiently large number.

00:09:59.666 --> 00:10:01.911
OK?

00:10:01.911 --> 00:10:03.910
And you don't even have
to think about these R's

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.660
as being the same.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.270
I can change them, I
can make this bigger.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.320
This doesn't compare
to this problem, also.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.760
So don't be confused
by those two R's.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.260
OK.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.890
So then we found something we
wanted to compare x to the n

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.170
with.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.290
Then we come back over
here, and we actually

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.290
see that we get a good
comparison, because we're

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.010
able to see that the integral on
the right-hand side converges.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.166
This integral is bigger
than this integral.

00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:28.540
So this integral
converges, so we

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.260
know this integral converges.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.160
And then, the integral
from 1 to R of this

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.900
is finite, so the
integral from 1

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.580
to infinity of this converges.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.990
And that's sort of
the strategy for doing

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.260
these types of problems.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:41.760
OK.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.400
That's where I'll stop.
