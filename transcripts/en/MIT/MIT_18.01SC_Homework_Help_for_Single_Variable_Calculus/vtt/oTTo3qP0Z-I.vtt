PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.780
In this video I want to finish
up our work with the ratio

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.790
test, and in particular
in this video,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.660
I'd like to address something
that Professor Jerison talked

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.944
about.

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:19.860
When he was talking about
these Taylor series,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.880
he was talking about the radius
of convergence at some point.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.260
And he didn't go into
it very specifically,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.310
but he was essentially
saying, for some values of x--

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.474
you'll have a series that
has x to the n in it--

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:33.890
for some values of x it will
converge, and for some values

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.780
it will diverge.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.400
So let me just remind you of
something you already know.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.353
So, if we consider
the series x to the n.

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:48.620
Right?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.340
This is the geometric
series and we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.640
know that this is
equal to 1 over 1 minus

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.085
x if the absolute value
of x is less than 1.

00:00:58.085 --> 00:00:59.230
Right?

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.310
And so we know that
this series is finite.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.660
This sum converges.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.400
To whatever value.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.620
If I plug in x
here, it converges

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.660
when absolute value
of x is less than 1.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.220
And it diverges when absolute
value of x is bigger than 1.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.540
And we're not going to address
when the absolute value of x

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.250
equals 1.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.550
We won't address that case.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.240
But, the point I want to make
it is that for some values

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.220
this series converges, and
for some values this series

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.500
diverges.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.680
And those values can give us
the radius of convergence.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.060
So the radius of
convergence of this series

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.790
is actually 1, because x goes
from 0 up to 1, and then from 0

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.530
down to 1.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.790
If you think about it, radius
might be a confusing term,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.120
but can think about it as a
circle in one dimension less

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.615
than maybe you usually
think about it as a circle.

00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:47.990
If this is the
number line, we're

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.840
going from 0 up to 1
and down to minus 1.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.830
So you're going in
one direction up to 1

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.640
and one direction
down to minus 1.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.740
So this is radius 1.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.390
r is equal to 1.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.360
So what I want to
do is figure out

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.600
how I can use the
ratio test to tell me

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.870
the radius of convergence
of other series, other power

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.255
series, besides this one.

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:10.320
OK?

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.550
So we're really interested
in for what values of x

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
do these power series converge.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.050
OK?

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.466
And how we're going
to do that, is

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.039
we're going to directly
use the ratio test.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.080
And one thing that I
mentioned in the other case,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.400
in the other ratio
test video, is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.460
I said you want to have
your terms be positive.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.291
And so just to make this easy on
ourselves, when we do the ratio

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.290
test we're just going to
take the absolute value

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.065
of the ratio.

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:36.940
And that will be sufficient
for our purposes,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.290
to determine the
radius of convergence.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.160
I don't want to go into anything
more complicated than that.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.234
So we'll see, as we
do these examples,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:46.650
we're just gonna,
we're just gonna

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.191
take the absolute
value of the ratio.

00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:50.110
So let's actually
start off right away

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.784
with doing some examples.

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:54.200
And each time I
do an example, I'm

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.450
asking the following question.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.960
Actually, I was going to say
for what values of x, but that's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.050
not quite true.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:12.910
I just want to know what is
the radius of convergence

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.880
for each power series?

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.890
So I'm not going to
write it up every time,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.560
but this is the question we
want to be thinking about.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.590
So I'm going to write
down some power series

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.923
and we're going to see what
is the radius of convergence

00:03:25.923 --> 00:03:26.680
for each of those.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.070
I was going to write, find the
values of x for which the power

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.800
series converge, but
that's not quite true

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.060
because sometimes
it will actually

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.067
converge on one or
both of the endpoints.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:39.650
We're not going to
deal with that one.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.490
But sometimes it
will converge on one

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.985
or the other of the endpoints.

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:45.610
So I'm going to be
asking the question,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.820
find the radius of convergence.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.850
So let's do an example,
and I'll show you how

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.380
it applies to the ratio test.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.460
Then we'll go from there
and do some other examples.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.840
So let's consider the
series x over 2 to the n.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.870
This will be an easy one.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.900
Now the ratio test told us that
we examine a certain limit.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.620
We examine the limit
as n goes to infinity.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.800
It said a sub n
plus 1 over a sub n.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.900
Well, if we think of this
whole thing as a sub n,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.050
then a sub n plus 1 is x
over 2 to the n plus 1.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.910
And then we have to divide
by x over 2 to the n.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.620
So let me just make
sure we understand that.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.450
The way we, the way we
want to think about this

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.430
is as if the a sub n is
actually a function of x

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520
that also depends on n.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.640
OK, so a sub n, we think of it
as x over 2 raised to the n.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.090
So a sub n plus 1 is x over
2 raised to the n plus 1.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.770
a sub n is x over
2 raised to the n.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.990
OK, and so this looks
exactly like the ratio

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.995
test we had before,
I told you I'm going

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.870
to put absolute values on it.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.100
And so let me simplify this.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.960
I put the division sign
maybe kind of funny

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.520
'cause I wanted to
have it in a row there.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.830
I apologize if that
made it more confusing.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.140
So this equals, well
I have x to the n

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.680
plus 1 over x to the
n times 2 to the n--

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.370
this comes to the
numerator because it's

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.070
in the denominator of
the denominator-- over--

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.760
and this goes to
the denominator-- 2

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.270
to the n plus 1.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.570
Now what is this?

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.680
This whole thing
converges to what?

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.760
2 to the n over 2 to
the n plus 1 simplifies

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.020
to 1/2, and x to the n plus 1
over x the n simplifies to x.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.790
So this is equal to
absolute value of x over 2.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.560
Now we haven't
shown how the ratio

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.580
test is going to help us find
the radius of convergence.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.160
And here's where we're
going to see it working.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.530
If we want to know that, we
want to draw a conclusion

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.150
about the convergence
of this series.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.010
We know that if this
limit is less than 1,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.830
that the series
definitely converges.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.130
So if I take my limit
when I'm all done,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.960
and I set it less
than 1, and I solve

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.030
for absolute value
of x, then that

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.640
will tell me exactly what
the radius of convergence is.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.070
Let me go through
that one more time.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.560
We knew that if we had this
series in terms of a sub n,

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560
and we looked at
the ratio and we

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.910
took the limit of these
ratios, and in the limit

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.460
the value was
strictly less than 1,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.937
we know the series converges.

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:31.020
So now we have this thing.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.800
It's in terms of x,
but ultimately it's

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.450
the same process.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.890
And we get to a place
where we know the limit.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.140
It depends on x.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.100
And so the limit
will be less than 1

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.540
exactly where this
thing is less than 1.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.930
Right?

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.827
So it's now in terms of x.

00:06:47.827 --> 00:06:49.660
This less than 1, I'm
putting in at the end.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.070
This is where the ratio
test is happening.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.620
So what does this tell us?

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.980
Where does this converge?

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.290
It converges when absolute value
of x over 2 is less than 1,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.280
which means absolute
value of x is less than 2.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.780
Right?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.640
I just multiply by 2 'cause
absolute value of 2 is 2.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.950
I don't have to worry
about if 2 is negative.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.860
So the absolute value
of x is less than 2.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.820
That tells me the radius of
convergence is actually 2.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.610
Now this shouldn't
surprise us really.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.310
Because this is, in fact,
a geometric series, and we

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.130
know that the usual
geometric series

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.050
converges when the absolute
value of x is less than 1.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.220
So it's not surprising,
and actually fits

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.510
in with what we already
know, that if this thing

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.130
on the inside, if its
absolute value is less than 1,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.510
that the thing will converge.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.230
So that that means
absolute value of x

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.660
has to be less than 2.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.484
So again, hopefully this
fits in with the knowledge

00:07:43.484 --> 00:07:44.150
we already have.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.960
Hopefully it makes sense to
you, what we're trying to do.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.479
And so let's do another couple
of examples to make this,

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:51.270
make this solidify.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.780
All right, what were
my other examples?

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.250
OK, let's do this one.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.360
x to the n over n factorial.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.111
All right, so now our
a sub n, when we look

00:08:05.111 --> 00:08:06.360
at this geometric-- geometric?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.800
This is not geometric--
when we look at the series,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.940
our a sub n is going to be
x to the n over n factorial.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.152
And so when we take
our whole limit,

00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:18.610
the thing that's
going to happen is

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.950
we're going to have something
in terms of x at the end.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.350
Our goal is to find
for what values of x

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.310
is that thing we
have less than 1?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.770
Again this is where we're
using the ratio test.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.340
So let's look at this thing.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.650
We want to look at the
limit as n goes to infinity.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.880
Well, a sub n plus 1 is
going to be x to the n

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.897
plus 1 over the quantity
n plus 1 factorial.

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.855
I'm going to put the
absolute value over there.

00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:48.360
Now I'm going to multiply
it by 1 over a sub n.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.890
So this is actually a
sub n, so 1 over that

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.650
is n factorial over x to the n.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.960
Now we have to be a
little careful here.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.820
I want to make sure everybody
understands something.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:06.060
n factorial is n times n minus 1
times n minus 2 times n minus 3

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.830
all the way down.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.320
n plus 1 factorial
is n plus 1 times

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.440
n times n minus 1 times n
minus 2 all the way down.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.990
So n plus 1
factorial-- I'll just

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.890
write this here--
n plus 1 factorial

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.390
equals n plus 1
times n factorial.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.470
That's very important that
you recognize that, OK?

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.450
Because the division
of factorials

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.470
is a little more complicated
than the division

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.650
of straight polynomials
or something like this.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.410
All right?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.710
Because when I take this
limit, what am I going to get?

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.350
I'm going to get x to the
n plus 1 over x to the n.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.530
That's going to give me one x.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.100
And then n factorial divided by
n plus 1 factorial, well based

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.440
on the fact that this is equal
to n plus 1 times n factorial,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.940
the n factorials divide, and
I'm left with x over n plus 1.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.480
That's actually what
this limit equals.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.260
Let me go through
that one more time.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.050
This part is easy,
x to the n plus 1

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.390
over x to the n gives me the x.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:14.520
And then n factorial over n
plus 1 factorial is just 1

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.395
over n plus 1.

00:10:15.395 --> 00:10:17.270
And I have be careful
because I wrote equals,

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.475
but there's still an n here.

00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:19.350
So let me erase that.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.662
I'm not gonna, I don't think--
my studio audience didn't

00:10:22.662 --> 00:10:24.120
say anything yet,
but I don't think

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.994
they were going to let
me get away with that.

00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:30.690
This is the limit as n goes to
infinity of x over n plus 1.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.090
Now what is that?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.620
Well as n goes to
infinity, for any fixed x

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.740
I pick-- we have to be careful
here-- for any fixed x I pick,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.960
as n goes to infinity, this
quantity is equal to 0.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.140
OK?

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.020
If I were moving x around,
if I were moving x with n,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.020
this will be a problem,
but x is fixed.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.580
When I do this sum, I fix
my x at the beginning.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:58.080
So for any fixed x, n plus 1
is getting arbitrarily large.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.820
So x over n plus 1 is
getting arbitrarily small.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.110
So this limit is 0.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.360
This is strictly less than 1.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.560
What does this mean?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.587
For any x I pick, this
whole thing is less than 1.

00:11:08.587 --> 00:11:09.500
Right?

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.267
Any fixed x, this ratio
is always less than 1.

00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:13.100
What does that mean?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.660
That means the radius of
convergence is infinite.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.860
So the radius is infinity.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.230
OK.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.070
The radius of convergence
is actually infinite.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.530
What series is this?

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.150
This is actually the Taylor
series for e to the x.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.440
So we know that the Taylor
series for e to the x,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.926
that this converges for any x.

00:11:36.926 --> 00:11:38.220
That's a nice thing.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.690
So now we've used the
ratio test to tell us

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.590
how the Taylor series behaves
for a function that we know.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.680
OK, we know its radius of
convergence is infinite.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.210
So that's pretty nice.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.240
All right, let's do maybe
one or two more examples,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.010
depending on how
much room I have.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.760
OK, let's try this one.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.430
x to the n over n
times 2 to the n.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.850
All right, so this is
another power series we have.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.310
And we want to know, if I want
to plug in some value of x

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.400
and I want to take
the sum, will that

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.790
converge for that
particular value of x?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.586
We want to know what
values of x can I plug in.

00:12:18.586 --> 00:12:20.210
All right so again,
we're going to look

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.020
at the radius of-- find
the radius of convergence

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.860
based on the ratio test.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:35.220
So the n plus first term is x
to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 2

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.580
to the n plus 1.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.930
And then I have to
multiply by the a sub n's,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.650
the a sub n term, or multiply
by 1 over that, sorry.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.980
I'm dividing by a sub
n, so I get n times 2

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.410
to the n over x to the n.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.551
All right, this gives me an x.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.510
n plus 1 over n, let me
just write out actually

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.310
what we get here, 2 to the
n over 2 to the n plus 1

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.340
gives me an over 2.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.710
And then n over n plus 1.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.240
This is positive,
so I don't have

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.700
to worry about anything there.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.520
The limit as n goes to
infinity absolute value of x

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.680
over 2 times n over n plus
1, what's that equal to?

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.920
Well this, as n goes to
infinity, is equal to 1,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.760
so it's absolute
value of x over 2.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.510
Let me again remind
you what we are doing.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.610
We're saying I want to know
the radius of convergence

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.530
for this series.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.690
So I want to know
what radius, so what

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.270
values of x can I put in to
make this series converge?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.830
I might miss the
endpoints, but beyond that,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.980
what values of x make
this series converge?

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.950
So I'm looking at
the ratio test.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.750
I took the ratio test, I got
it all the way to a place

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.890
where I have something
in terms of x.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.580
As long as that thing is
less than 1, I'm golden.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.060
As long as that thing is less
than 1, the series converges.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.643
So again, I actually
get another thing

00:13:55.643 --> 00:13:58.102
where the absolute value
of x is less than 2.

00:13:58.102 --> 00:13:58.839
All right?

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:01.130
I probably should have picked
a different number there.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.390
What do you think would
happen if this was a 7?

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.980
Well everything
would've been the same

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.740
except this would have been a
7, and the radius of convergence

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.130
would have been 7.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.193
So I should have picked
a different number there,

00:14:12.193 --> 00:14:14.026
so we had a different
radius of convergence,

00:14:14.026 --> 00:14:16.780
but you can see how that works.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.230
And then, I'm gonna do just--

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.262
I have room, I'm going
to do one more example.

00:14:20.262 --> 00:14:21.970
'Cause this one's a
good one to do, also.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.630
OK, I'm actually going to do
another series that we know,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.450
x to the 2n over 2n factorial.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.550
I'm doing this one for
a particular reason,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.900
to help us deal with
when some things, when

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:47.390
the exponents and the factorials
get a little more complicated.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.600
I want to also point
out what series is this.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.685
You should know
what series this is.

00:14:52.685 --> 00:14:54.310
And I know, without
thinking, that it's

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.484
either sine or cosine.

00:14:56.484 --> 00:14:57.900
I guess I should
say it's starting

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.002
at n equals 0 to infinity.

00:15:00.002 --> 00:15:02.460
And then I might get nervous
and say well, which one is it?

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.390
Well what's the first term?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.460
x to the 0 is 1 over
0 factorial is 1.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.354
So it looks like
the first term is 1,

00:15:10.354 --> 00:15:11.770
so that makes me
know it's cosine.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.950
Right?

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.987
If the first term were
x, I'd know it was sine.

00:15:15.987 --> 00:15:16.820
So if I get nervous.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.682
So this, where it converges,
is equal to cosine x.

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:20.640
Let's look at this one.

00:15:23.906 --> 00:15:25.405
All right, we got,
now this you have

00:15:25.405 --> 00:15:27.405
to be a little more careful
because it's 2 times

00:15:27.405 --> 00:15:32.640
the quantity n plus 1
over 2n plus 2 factorial.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.940
So that's n plus 1 times
2 is 2n plus 2 times 2n

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.342
factorial over x to the 2n.

00:15:44.342 --> 00:15:46.550
All right this is where it
might get a little tricky.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.669
This is 2n plus 2 divided by 2n.

00:15:49.669 --> 00:15:51.210
So this is going to
be the limit as n

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:56.920
goes to infinity of x squared,
the absolute value of x squared

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.050
which is just x squared
again, times this thing.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.100
So let's figure out
what this thing is.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.560
OK?

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.790
What is 2n factorial?

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.180
I'm going to write out
the first couple terms.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:12.490
OK, that's going to be 2n
times 2n minus 1 times, that's

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.276
all the way down to 1.

00:16:14.276 --> 00:16:15.150
And then what's this?

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:23.030
This is 2n plus 2 times
2n plus 1 times 2n times,

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.330
all the way down to 1.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.910
So we see, this is what I was
talking about earlier actually,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.630
also.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.820
was that I've added 2 to this.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.360
So it's not surprising
I get 2 more terms,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.330
and then I'm down to
2n factorial again.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:35.830
Right?

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.520
So this 2n factorial.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.260
This is 2n factorial.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.110
So the 2n factorial here divides
with the 2n factorial here,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.060
and I'm left with these here.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.370
I get 1 over 2n plus
2 times 2n plus 1.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.860
Now what happens as
n goes to infinity?

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.410
Obviously this ratio goes to 0.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.670
So I'm actually in another
case similar to the one

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.910
I saw with e to the x.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:58.890
Is that this goes to 0.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.560
So the limit is
actually equal to 0,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.210
which is always less than 1.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.670
Any value of x I
pick is less than 1.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.195
And so this series
actually converges for any

00:17:07.195 --> 00:17:09.850
x that I pick.

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:12.510
So this is another case where I
have the radius of convergence

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.142
is actually infinite.

00:17:14.142 --> 00:17:16.600
OK, so we'll probably give you
some problems where you have

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.840
some other things happening.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.382
'Cause you can actually get
the radius convergence is 0.

00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:22.590
You can actually get that
the only place it converges

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.850
is at x equals 0.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.540
So you might actually
get the limit

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.349
as n goes to
infinity is infinity.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.890
I didn't give you
an example of that,

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.700
but that's a case where
whatever x value you put in,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.930
your limit is still
bigger than 1.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.390
Then you would always get a
diverges, except when x is 0.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.850
OK, so that's another thing
that you can run into.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.600
But, the point I want
to make is that this

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.975
is going to let
us determine, you

00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:47.810
know, at least the radius over
which these x values converge.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.920
And it also helps us if
we know certain things

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.080
about a function, to tell us
where this function is actually

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.470
equal to the series
that we're dealing with.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.650
So I think that's
where I'll stop,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.514
and I hope this was informative.
