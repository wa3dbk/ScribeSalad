00:00:06.977 --> 00:00:07.560
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.140
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.210
Today we're going to do another
example of a definite integral.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.220
This time, it's going
to be one that you're

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.329
going to need to do
some substitution for.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.370
You're not going to know
the antiderivative right

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.820
off the top of
your head, I think.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.710
So, I've got it on
the board behind me.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.760
So it's compute the
integral from minus 2 to 2

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.500
of the function x squared
cosine of the quantity

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.570
x cubed over 8 dx.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.430
So, this is a kind
of a weird integrand.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.380
Roughly, you know,
very, very rough graph

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.740
of kind of what it looks like.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.600
So this is sort of the
area of this region.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.870
It's a positive function
over this interval.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.700
So it's the area of this region
that I'm asking you to compute.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.690
So, all right, so
definite integral.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.950
Why don't you pause the
video, take a couple minutes,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.689
work this out
yourself, come back, we

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:56.730
can work it out together.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.890
All right, welcome back.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.750
So, from looking at
this integrand here,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.610
it seems to me that I
don't know immediately

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.620
off the top of my head
what its antiderivative is.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.760
So, I can't just sort of
apply the fundamental theorem

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.437
of calculus directly without
a little bit of work.

00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:22.020
So there are two
different ways that I

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.188
can go about computing
this then, about computing

00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:26.250
this definite integral.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.770
One is, that I can
forget for the minute

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760
that it's a definite integral
and compute the antiderivative

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.180
and then use the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.270
So, let's try that way first and
then we'll do it a second way

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.930
as well.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:56.620
So, method one is to
compute the antiderivative.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.600
So we compute the
antiderivative of x squared

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.404
cosine of x cubed over 8 dx.

00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:08.320
So here, it's not a
definite integral anymore.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.410
Now I'm just looking
at the antiderivative.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.660
And so, OK, so
either by intelligent

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.544
guessing or that--
I forget if that's

00:02:17.544 --> 00:02:18.960
what Professor
Jerison called it--

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.580
or by just a
substitution method.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.860
So, a good thing
to substitute here,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.200
is we see inside this function
we have this x cubed part

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.670
and then outside we
have an x squared part.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.360
So x squared dx,
that's closely related

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.120
to the differential of x cubed.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.940
So we might try
the substitution--

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.184
we might try the substitution
u equals-- well we can maybe

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:45.850
get rid of all of
that at once-- so make

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.970
u equals x cubed over 8.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.550
So in that case, du is
equal to 3/8 x squared dx.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.820
And so this integral is equal
to the integral of-- well so,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.130
x squared dx, we have that.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.730
So we need to multiply
and divide by 3/8.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.470
So this is, 8/3 cosine of u du.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.132
All right, and so
now, OK, so the 8/3,

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:20.090
that's just a constant.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.089
That pulls out in front.

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.140
That's not hard.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.540
So then the
antiderivative of cosine

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.820
u du, that's something we know.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:37.246
So this is 8/3 of minus
sine-- sorry not minus;

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:39.620
I was doing the derivative
instead of the antiderivative.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.280
Just 8/3 sine u.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.780
OK.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.215
And good.

00:03:44.215 --> 00:03:46.090
So that's the anti--
plus the constant, which

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.355
we don't need
because we're going

00:03:47.355 --> 00:03:49.479
to plug this in the
fundamental theorem of calculus

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.100
in a minute.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.640
So it's 8/3 sine u.

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:55.290
And, OK, so, but
that's not good.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.706
I need it back in
terms of my x's.

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:58.410
And so I have to
back-substitute.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:08.930
So this is 8/3 sine
of x cubed over 8.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.540
All right, now I've
got an antiderivative

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.560
of this expression.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.410
So now I can take
this antiderivative

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.270
and apply fundamental
theorem of calculus, Right?

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.192
So, the integral
from minus 2 to 2

00:04:22.192 --> 00:04:31.915
of x squared cosine of x cubed
over 8 dx is equal to-- well

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:38.312
it's equal to this
antiderivative-- 8/3 sine x

00:04:38.312 --> 00:04:48.480
cubed over 8 taken between x
equals minus 2 and x equals 2.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:05:00.670
So this is equal to 8/3 times
sine of 1 minus 8/3 times

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.720
sine of minus 1.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.230
OK, and sine of minus x
is equal to minus sine x.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:14.396
So we could rewrite this
as 16/3 times sine of 1.

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:15.270
So that's the answer.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.490
That's the value
of this integral.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.520
And we did this first
method by first computing

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.740
the antiderivative
and then using it

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.530
with the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.570
The second way we
can do it is the one

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.570
that we just learned
more recently in lecture.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.540
Which is to use
substitution directly

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.010
in the definite integral.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.640
So let me come over
here and do that.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.690
So, method two.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.150
So now, when we do it this way,
mostly this looks the same.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.670
So we start off, we don't
go back to antiderivative.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.514
We start off with the
definite integral.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:05.555
So that's one difference.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.780
We can use the exact
same substitution.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.000
So we can use exactly
the substitution

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.740
that we used before, which
was u equals x cubed over 8.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.880
That doesn't change.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.950
And we still have the same du
is equal to 3 x squared over 8,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.345
but what does
change-- sorry, dx.

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:37.190
Good.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.830
You need a differential always
to be equal to a differential.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.767
So what does change
is that this-- I need

00:06:46.767 --> 00:06:47.642
to change the bounds.

00:06:47.642 --> 00:06:48.290
Right?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.498
If I'm keeping it as definite
integrals all the time,

00:06:50.498 --> 00:06:54.330
so I'm changing here from
an integral with respect

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.060
to x to an integral
with respect to u.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.780
And so that means
that when I write down

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.810
the second integral
with respect to u,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.410
the bounds that I write down
have to be the bounds for u.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.430
Not for x.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.610
So when x is equal
to minus 2, I need

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.220
to know what the
corresponding value of u is.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.620
So in this case, when
x is equal to minus 2,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.820
we see that the
lower bound here--

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.970
when x is equal to minus
2-- the lower bound on u

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.220
becomes u equals, well,
minus 2 cubed over 8.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.650
That's minus 1.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.140
And when x is equal
to 2, the upper bound,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.030
u becomes 2 cubed over 8.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.170
So u becomes 1.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.530
So we have this extra step
when we do it this way,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.990
of changing the bounds.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.310
OK, so I do that.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.850
So now I get the integral.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.780
So I'm going to write
u equals minus 1

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.070
here just to remind myself
that I made this change to 1.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.000
OK, and now the inside
transforms exactly the same.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.340
So it's 8/3 times cosine u du.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.650
OK, and now again, this is
something for which I already

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.910
know the antiderivative.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:05.880
So I apply the fundamental
theorem of calculus here.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:13.600
So I get the integral is
equal to 8/3 sine of u,

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.210
where u goes between
minus 1 and 1.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.120
So the other thing that's
changed here is that now I

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.800
don't have to change this
back in terms of x's.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.050
I have the values that I'm
going to plug in here already

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.250
in terms of u.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.410
So I don't have to switch
back in terms of x's.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.870
And so I just plug these values
in and take the difference.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:42.770
So this is equal to 8/3 sine
of 1 minus 8/3 sine of minus 1,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:49.119
which as we said before
is 16/3 times sine of 1.

00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:50.910
OK, so we have these
two different methods.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.980
They're very, very, very,
similar in how you apply them.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.590
The key differences
are, that when

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.140
you do it, the substitution in
terms of definite integrals,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.400
you have to change your
bounds of integration.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.680
And what you get for changing
your bounds of integration is

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.960
at the end you don't have to
switch back from u's into x's.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.820
Whereas, if you do it by first
computing the antiderivative,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.090
well, you don't have any
bounds of integration

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.840
when you compute the
antiderivative so you

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.090
don't have to change them.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.390
But once you computed
the antiderivative,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.490
then you have to go and
make your back substitution.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.340
Put everything back in
terms of x's before going on

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.450
to compute the definite
integral that you started with.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.380
So the those are the
two different ways

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.140
you can do substitution
in definite integrals

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.678
and I'll end with that.
