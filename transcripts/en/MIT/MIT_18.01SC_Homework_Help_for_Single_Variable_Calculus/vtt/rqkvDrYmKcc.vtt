00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.910
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.460
In this video I want us to
work on the following problem.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.770
A very shallow circular
reflecting pool

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.660
has uniform depth D and radius
R. And this is in meters.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.940
And a disinfecting chemical
is released at its center.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.140
After a few hours of
symmetrical diffusion outward,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.950
the concentration at a point
little r meters from the center

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.870
is k over 1 plus r squared
grams per cubic meter.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.720
The k here is a constant.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.750
So we drop some chemical
into the middle of the pool.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.510
And then it diffuses outward.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.120
That's the idea there.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.020
Now the question
is the following.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.720
What amount of chemical
was released into the pool?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.750
And obviously the
amount will be in grams.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.430
Now to give you a
hint, probably you

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.700
want to draw a picture of this.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.930
And then maybe
get some estimates

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.570
or some approximations
using shells.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.360
Or you might just say,
you know, some strips,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.800
some shells probably is
a better word for it.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.860
And then you should
think about the fact

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.010
that, as you get better
and better estimates,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.060
your approximation should
tend toward an integral.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.419
So with that hint, I'll give you
a little time to work on this.

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:17.460
And when we come back,
I'll show you how I do it.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.506
OK, welcome back.

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:29.380
Hopefully you were able
to make some headway.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.471
And so let me start off by
doing what I asked you to do,

00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:33.470
which is draw a picture.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.990
Now the first picture
is fairly simple.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.997
The first picture is my pool.

00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:43.790
Right?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.150
But that's not quite enough
to tell me some estimates.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.400
But what do we have?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.940
So the pool has radius
capital R and depth D.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.720
And when I said we want to
do some approximation, what

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.890
I really meant is we
want to-- let me actually

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.080
get another color here-- we want
to say, take some fixed radius

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.640
out and assume that--
let me actually

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.540
draw this behind--
some fixed radius out,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.360
and assume that the diffusion
is constant for some small bit.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.070
Some small strip like this.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.670
Which, actually, you notice
it's going to be rotated around.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.210
Because all of this is relative
to distance from the center.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.510
So, I'm hoping that
you can see kind

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300
of what this drawing is doing.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.580
Essentially what we
have here is if we

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.070
open that up, this blue
cylindrical shell is

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:49.950
approximately a piece-- oh it
doesn't quite look flat-- but,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.190
a piece that looks
like-- oh well

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.690
we'll just stick with
that-- a little prism here.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.670
So that's
approximately, if I were

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.900
to cut this blue cylindrical
shell here open and lay it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.830
down flat, it would be
approximately a piece

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.580
kind of like this.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.810
Right?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
And so, what we're going
to do is estimate first

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.490
what amount of chemical
is released based

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.380
on pieces that look like this.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.790
And then we're going to let
those pieces get very, very

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.590
narrow and get more
and more of them.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.480
And this should remind
you of Riemann sums.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.490
And how Riemann sums, as
you let the number of things

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.728
you're summing over
tend to 0-- sorry--

00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:39.970
tend to infinity, so that
the little pieces are getting

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.250
narrower and narrower,
you're actually

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.730
going to end up
with an integral.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.700
So this is where we're headed.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.990
So let's just make sure
we understand kind of all

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.510
the pieces that are happening.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.051
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.220
to take a bunch of
these cylinders,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.979
and let's just determine
that we'll take n of them.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.020
I shouldn't say cylinder.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.144
Sorry, I should say shells.

00:03:59.144 --> 00:04:01.490
We're going to take n of
these shell-type things.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.340
So I'm going to say
the radii-- I'm going

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.620
to start with r_0 equals 0.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.850
And I'm going to take
n different radii.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.480
So r_0, r_1, up to--
sorry this is 0--

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.100
so r_n is equal to capital R.
So I guess I'm taking n plus 1,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.850
but 0 is not really a radius.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.390
But I have n
different partitions.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.301
For each partition
of this big cylinder,

00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:32.300
I get a piece like this.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.590
Right?

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.800
I get a piece that,
when I open it up,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.070
looks approximately like this.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.596
Now, what I want
is a total amount.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:41.137
I want grams.

00:04:41.137 --> 00:04:42.700
Right?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.920
And what I'm given-- if we come
back over here-- what I'm given

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.170
is the concentration
at a certain radius.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.170
It's k over 1 plus r squared
grams per cubic meter.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.450
Now, if nothing else, you should
have looked at this problem

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.710
and seen, well if I want
grams and I have something

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.940
in grams per cubic
meter, somewhere I'm

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.140
going to need something
with cubic meters

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.500
to cancel this unit,
so I end up with grams.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.260
So if nothing else, then
maybe you can you can think,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.430
oh I need to understand
volume of something

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.350
in order to solve this problem.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.760
Right?

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.800
Now if we have n different
partitions-- so n shells--

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.990
that all started off as
this sort of blue-type thing

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.870
and I open up and
look like this.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.250
Then I want to figure out what
is the volume of these shells.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.130
Once I know the
volume of that shell,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.050
I can figure out
the amount, roughly,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.040
of chemical in that
piece by multiplying

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.300
by the concentration.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.410
So let's figure out
what this volume is

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.640
in terms of these little
radii I'm looking at.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.850
Well, when I open it
up, what do I get?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.600
We're assuming this here is
this little segment here,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.272
and so that's our delta r,
that's our change in radius.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:05:59.480
That's how much I'm changing.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.610
So this would be some r
subscript i and this would

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.930
be some r subscript i plus 1.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.880
And let's assume that
we're taking everything

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.840
from the smaller radius.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.220
We're going to do everything
from the smaller radius.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.900
So then, when I open
this up, this circle

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.840
is going to be my length.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.140
So my length is 2 pi r sub i.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.350
And then the height is easy.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.340
The height is constant.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.840
The height is just
capital D. Right?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:40.980
So the volume of each shell--
let me come over here--

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:48.900
the volume of a shell is
something like 2 pi r sub i

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.640
times D times delta r.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:04.720
And so then, the amount
of chemical in the shell

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.560
is going to be the volume
times the concentration.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.060
Right?

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.310
The volume times
the concentration.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.492
So the volume is, again, this.

00:07:18.492 --> 00:07:20.450
I'm going to put the D
in front of the r sub i.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.320
2 pi D r sub i delta r times
the concentration, which

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.220
if we come back over
here, the concentration is

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.810
k divided by 1 plus r squared
grams per cubic meter.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.890
The r in this case
is the r sub i.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.200
I'm assuming, because
I'm approximating

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.419
this, that everywhere
in the shell

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:42.460
has the same concentration,
has the concentration

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.550
of the interior radius.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.270
So if we come back over here,
we're going to write k over 1

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.620
plus r sub i squared.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.540
And now what do I do to estimate
the amount in the entire pool?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.870
Well I add all of these up.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.360
So let me come over
here and write down

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.800
what the sum will look like.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.640
So I'm going to
be summing from i

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.470
equals-- I said I was
taking the interior radius,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:16.080
I think-- i equals 0 to n
minus 1 of this quantity.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.250
2*pi*D-- let me put the
k in there as well-- k.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:31.640
And then r sub i over 1 plus
r sub i squared delta r.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.000
So this is our
approximation of the amount

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.509
of chemical in the pool.

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:40.550
And again, we always want
to check and make sure.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.350
I didn't write in any units,
but do the units make sense?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.900
Well we know the
units make sense

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.200
because when I did the
amounts in the shell,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.170
I did volume times
concentration.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.030
And volume times concentration
is going to be in grams.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.540
This is in cubic meters.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.100
This is in grams
per cubic meter.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.890
So I know I have the right unit.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.964
So that's a good way to check.

00:08:58.964 --> 00:09:00.880
It doesn't guarantee
you've done it correctly.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.296
But at least you can check and
make sure you didn't do it,

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:06.810
you know that-- how
would I say this?

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.970
I would say that if the
units are not in grams,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.410
you know you did
something wrong.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.150
So at least now we know, OK,
it passes the first smell test.

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.260
Now what do I do to
find the exact value?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.745
Well what I want
to do is, I want

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:23.490
to come back over to
the picture I have here

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.240
and I want to let these shells
get smaller and smaller.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.100
And how do I let those shells
get smaller and smaller?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.250
Narrower and narrower,
I should say.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.220
I let them get
narrower by increasing

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:38.140
the number of radii on which
I do this kind of operation.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.930
So I'm coming over
here and now I'm

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.780
letting the n get
bigger and bigger.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.440
And as n gets bigger
and bigger, these values

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.890
are still determined
the same way.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.310
But over here this n is
getting larger and larger.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.170
So I can take the limit,
as n goes to infinity,

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.660
of this quantity to
get the exact amount.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.630
What is the limit as n
goes to infinity of this?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.290
This is actually an integral.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.520
It's the integral
from 0 to capital R--

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.950
because my radius
is ranging from 0

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.320
to that big R-- of this
exact function of R. Right?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.410
So I'm going to put
the 2*pi*D*k out here.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.940
And then I get little
r over 1 plus r squared

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.730
and the delta r becomes our
dr. So this is, in fact,

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.980
going to be the amount, in
grams, of the chemical that

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.090
was released into the pool.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.340
So we've set up our integral.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.900
I think I'll stop here.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.130
If you want to go further
and determine it, you can.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.909
And you may want to think
about what strategy,

00:10:39.909 --> 00:10:41.950
obviously, what strategy
you want to use in order

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.890
to solve this problem.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.150
I'll give you a hint.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.360
Maybe the best way
to solve this problem

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.510
is the fact that when you
take the derivative of 1

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.180
plus r squared, you
actually get 2r.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.330
And so that derivative
is almost up here.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.220
So maybe this is a good
hint to give you how you

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.640
would continue this problem.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.490
But I'll stop there.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.355
So let me just go
back one more time

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:03.890
and remind you
what we were doing.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.500
What we were doing, if
we come back over here,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.590
is we were given
a situation where

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.860
we knew a certain function
of the radius, the distance

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.230
from the center.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.360
And we wanted to determine the
total amount of chemical that

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.920
was released into the pool.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.130
And so we estimated.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.110
We figured out a
way to estimate it

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.190
in terms of splitting
up the radii.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.884
We had the radius
from 0 to big R.

00:11:29.884 --> 00:11:32.550
And we just divided up the radii
and assumed certain things were

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.390
constant in these regions.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.110
And we determined
the right function

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.370
to find-- if we move over here,
over here-- we would determine

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.730
the right function to find
the amount of chemical

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.810
in a certain shell, assuming
that the concentration was

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.250
constant throughout that shell.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.940
And then, what we do is we know
that if we let those shells get

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.437
arbitrarily narrow,
that means that we're

00:11:55.437 --> 00:11:57.270
letting the number of
radii over which we're

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.000
doing this go to infinity.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.050
And we know that this
summation that we have here,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.540
as n goes to infinity,
becomes an integral.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.690
So that's really, we exploited
what we know about this sum

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:11.830
and letting this partition,
letting the delta

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.270
r get arbitrarily small.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.160
That that, in the limit,
goes to an integral.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.090
And then that's something we
can definitively calculate.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.308
So I think I will stop there.
