00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.310
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.970
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.970
Today we're going to do
a couple of exercises

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.040
on computing average values
and probabilities using

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.669
integration.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.210
So for this problem,
I'm going to let

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.800
R be the name of
the region that's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.330
bounded above by the
curve, by the line I guess,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.090
y equals x and below by
the curve y equals x cubed.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.770
So I have a little
picture of R here.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.790
It, you know, lives all in
the first quadrant there.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.296
It's just this little sliver.

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:39.670
So the first part
of the question

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.270
is, if I look at
all the points in R,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.530
what's that average
x-coordinate of those points?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.220
What's the average value
of the x-coordinate?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.860
And the second problem is,
if I choose a point at random

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.310
somewhere in R,
what's the probability

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.050
that its x-coordinate
is larger than 1/2?

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.850
So what's the
probability that it lies

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.225
on the right-hand side of R?

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:03.600
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960
take a couple minutes to
work through these problems,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.793
come back, and we can
work on them together.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.520
Alright, welcome back.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.400
So hopefully you've had a chance
to get some good work done

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.630
on these questions.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.800
So let's start to
work through them.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.290
So remember, to compute the
average value of a function

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.420
over some region
what you need to do

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.430
is you need to compute
a weighted average.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.910
And the weighting here is that
you have to consider the fact

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.300
that, you know, for
x very near zero,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.520
there aren't very many points
in R in this little corner.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.020
Right?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.180
And for x very near
1, there aren't

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.480
very many points there either.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.730
In the middle, this
region is a little higher,

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.960
so there are more points there.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.910
So those points
will sort of weigh

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.700
more when you take the
average of all points,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.110
than the points near the edges.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.040
So the way we account for
that is we have this weight

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.450
function that is
the, in our case,

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.960
since we're interested in
the x-coordinate, the weight

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.310
at a given x-coordinate
is the slice

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.770
of the-- how much of the region
lies above that x-coordinate.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.250
What, you know, the area of
a little rectangle above that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640
x-coordinate says, tells
you how many of the points

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.350
have that x-coordinate.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.135
So then we want to average
the function x, right?

00:02:27.135 --> 00:02:29.010
Because we're interested
in the x-coordinate,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.330
so the function
we're averaging is x.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.640
Over this region,
with that weighting.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.100
So, all right, so let's
write down what that means.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:52.150
So we have-- want average
of the function f of x,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.620
and f of x, the thing we're
computing the average of

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.580
is, just the x-coordinate, so
it's just the function value x.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.476
Over R. So we want the
average of this function, f

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:06.730
of x, over R. So what
we need to compute

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.980
is the-- so we have two
integrals we need to compute.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.260
We need one integral
that is the numerator,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.682
and so that numerator--
so I'm going

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:20.180
to just write average for
the average that we want.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.400
So the numerator is
the integral-- OK,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.900
and so we have to
integrate, we have

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.370
to take all possible
x-values into consideration.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.660
So x going, in this case
that's x going from 0 to 1

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.640
and now we want to multiply the
function that we're averaging,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.779
which in this case is x, by the
appropriate weight function.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.820
And the weight function
is how much of the region

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.060
is associated with that x-value.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.200
And that's the height of
this little rectangle,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.730
which in this case is
x minus x cubed dx.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.480
OK.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.460
But then, this is
an average, we have

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.130
to divide by the total
weight of the region.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.190
The weight, in this
case, is just the area.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.390
So we have to divide
by the integral

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.912
from 0 to 1 of just
this x minus x cubed dx.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.670
OK, so we have to compute
these two integrals

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.740
and then we have to
take their ratio.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.240
So let's do them separately.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.562
So the first one is--
well, the second one

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:20.770
is actually a little simpler.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.190
The one in the denominator,
so let's handle that first.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.049
The integral from 0 to
1 of x minus x cubed dx.

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:32.590
Well, this is a
pretty easy integral.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.380
It's x squared over 2 minus
x to the fourth over 4

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.910
between 0 and 1.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.600
So that's 1/2 minus 1/4
minus, well when you put in 0

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.630
you just get 0.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.870
So that's 1/4.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.300
And the first one,
the top, the numerator

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.767
is the integral from 0 to 1.

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:57.290
OK, we can multiply
through, so that's

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.180
x squared minus x
to the fourth dx.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.030
So that integral
from 0 to 1 again

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:14.980
is x cubed over 3 minus x to the
fifth over 5 between 0 and 1.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.270
When we put in 0 we get 0,
put in 1 we get 1/3 minus 1/5.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.220
So that's common denominator 15.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.360
2/15.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.040
So the numerator of our
average value is 2/15,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.610
the denominator is 1/4.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.680
So the average value
we're interested in

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.770
is 2/15 divided by
1/4, which is 8/15.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.830
So the average
x-coordinate is just,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.290
so 8/15 is just a tiny
bit larger than 1/2.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.760
So this is saying somehow the
average x-coordinate is just

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.840
slightly shifted to
the right of 1/2.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.630
So this, I may have drawn this
region sort of symmetrically,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.530
but in fact it's a little bit
shifted to the right there.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.500
So that's the the first
part of the problem.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.146
For the second part, we want
to compute the probability-- so

00:06:11.146 --> 00:06:14.420
OK, so we choose a point
at random in this set R

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.510
and we want to know
what's the probability

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.530
that its x-coordinate
is larger than 1/2.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.940
Well, since all points are,
you know, equally likely,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.197
all regions, the
probability just

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:27.780
has to do with the
area of the region.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.760
What we really want to know
is, what's is area of R

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.960
to the right of the
line x equals 1/2.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.650
So that's the good
region, and then we

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.330
want to know how much of
the entire region is that.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.300
So we want to know the
area of the good region

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.014
to the right of 1/2
divided by the total area.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:48.430
Now luckily we've
already computed

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.590
the total area, right here.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.610
This was this denominator
that we had over here.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.890
So we just need the
numerator of that fraction.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.000
So let's go over here,
let me write that down.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:12.260
So the probability
equals-- I'm going

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:22.710
to put good area in
quotation marks--

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.330
so what I mean by good area is
the area of the set of points

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.450
that satisfies our condition.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:35.240
And in our case, the
good area is just-- so

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.380
a point we're interested in,
if its x-coordinate is bigger

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.800
than 1/2, so we just want to
take the part of this region

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.150
to the right of 1/2.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.410
So in order to
compute that, we just

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.999
take this integral from 1/2
to 1 instead of from 0 to 1.

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:54.290
So we're only counting those
points to the right of 1/2

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.870
and then we want the,
you know, the area

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.600
between these two
curves on that region.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.300
OK, so, and again this
is a fairly simple

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.230
integral to compute.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:13.780
So this gives me x squared over
2 minus x to the fourth over 4

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.390
between 1/2 and 1.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.850
All right, so this is
maybe a tiny bit hairy,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:26.560
so this gives me 1/2 minus 1/4
minus-- well we put in 1/2 here

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:35.260
we get 1/8 minus-- 1/2 to the
fourth is 1/16, divided by 4

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.100
is 1/64.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.861
So this is all going
to be in sixty-fourths.

00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:43.360
So OK.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:51.700
So let's see, 32/64 minus
16/64 minus 8/64 plus 1.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.075
If I just put it all over
that common denominator.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:03.022
All right, so I think that looks
like 9/64, if I did that right.

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:03.522
So, OK.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:04.920
So that's the good area.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.540
And then the
probability that I want,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.670
I have to divide the good
area by the total area.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.540
And we saw before that
the total area was 1/4.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.870
And that was what
this computation was.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.990
So the total area's 1/4,
so the probability--

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.840
I'm just going to write pr
for probability-- that we're

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:34.190
interested in is 9/64
divided by 1/4 which is 9/16.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.020
OK, so this says-- also 9/16
is also a little bit bigger

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:41.600
than a half.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.810
So this is a different way of
saying, our region, there's

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.410
a little bit more
of it to the right

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.987
then there is to the left.

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.570
You know, so it's
slightly more likely

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.130
that a random point is
to the right of the line

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.940
y equals 1/2 than it is
to the left of that line.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.560
So just to sum up, we had
these two different problems

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.520
that we did concerning
this region R.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.490
So first we computed the average
value of the x-coordinate

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.850
of a point in this region.

00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:10.330
So that was part a.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.592
We computed the average
value of the x-coordinate,

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.550
and that was over here.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.230
So we had to, you know, do
this, the weighted average

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.240
of the x-coordinate
divided by the total area.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.750
And then second, we
computed the probability

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.760
that a randomly chosen point has
x-coordinate larger than 1/2.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.300
And we did that over here.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.930
And for that we
needed to compute

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.290
the area of the
good region, which

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.090
was the part to the right
of the line y equals 1/2

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.820
and then we needed to
divide it by the total area.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.139
So I'll end there.
