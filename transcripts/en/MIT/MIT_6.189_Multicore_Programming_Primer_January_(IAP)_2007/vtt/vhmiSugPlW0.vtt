00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.780
So today is the final lecture,
and I'm going to talk to about

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.220
the future.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.240
If I can figure out how to
get the slides going.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.170
Predicting the Future is always
not a simple thing.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
And especially this day and
age we are -- things are

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.960
appearing on the internet, so
this is getting recorded and

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.740
on the internet.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.790
And I'm going to make a few
comments that in five years

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.220
time, I'm going to regret.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.010
What I'll try to do is try to
have a systematic process

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.160
through that.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.110
Because I know you guys
are great hackers.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.200
You guys are great programers.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.300
You and any problem,
you can solve it.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.250
But as researchers, what's
hard, and what's very

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.350
difficult, is to figure out
which problem to solve.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.100
Because as Roderick pointed out,
when we started on Raw in

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.040
about '97, there was a raging
debate what to build.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550
And there's group of people who
say we can build bigger

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.730
and bigger superscalars.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.540
In fact, there was this
article, very seminal

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.170
proceedings that came out,
that basically asked many

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.880
people to contribute, saying
what do they think will a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.810
billion transistor processor
look like?

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.410
And about 2/3 of them said, we
would have this gigantic,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.900
fabulous superscalar.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.470
And about three out of about
ten, I think about three

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.600
groups said that, OK, it would
be more like tiled

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.340
architecture.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.530
The Stanford people and
us are the main

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.880
people who look at that.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.640
So even that short time, 10
years ago, it was not sure

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.950
what's going to happen.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.740
And so we took a stance
and spent 10

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.490
years working on that.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.800
We were lucky, more than
anything else, that ITV had a

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.350
little bit better insight,
hopefully, but also mostly a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.760
larger dose of luck
we get here.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.280
So part of that is how do
you go about doing this?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.410
So future ia a combination of
evolution and revolutions.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.210
Evolution is somewhat
easy to predict.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.510
Basically, what you can look
at is, you can look at the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.860
trends going on and you can
extrapolate that trend.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220
And you can say, if this trend
continue, what will happen?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190
If this trend continue
what will happen?

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.320
It's very interesting in
computer science because one

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.100
thing I do in 6033 is look at
the rate of evolution that

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.600
happens in computer science, and
trying to predict it with

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.490
things like the rate
of [OBSCURED]

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.420
and stuff like that and you
get ridiculous numbers.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.330
So even if it is evolution, in
computer science it's very

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.230
close to revolution.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.590
Because every 18 months
things double.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.520
That's almost unheard of.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.230
In a lot of areas, every 18
months you get 1% improvement

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.160
and people are very happy.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.200
This is doubling.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.930
We have that.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.050
THe other part is revolutions.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.710
If some completely new
technological solution just

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.120
come about and completely
change the world.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.810
Change how things happen.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.460
These are a lot harder
to predict.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.730
But still it's critically
important because some of

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.520
these things can have
huge impact.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.630
And so we will more focus on
evolution and if we have at

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.700
the end we can see if we
have some interesting

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.310
revolutionary ideas.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.220
Paradigm shifts occur in both.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.930
You don't have to wait
for a revolution to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.100
have something different.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.150
Because things like 2x
improvement type things that

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.120
happens, actually brings
paradigm shifts on a very

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.070
regular basis.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.210
So it's not 1% we
are a getting.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.150
We are getting huge
evolution changes.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.710
And that can keep
changing things.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.620
So what I'm going to talk
to you about, a

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.510
little bit of trends.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.700
Some of it is repetitive.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.480
I spent sometime in
the first lecture

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.640
talking about these trends.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.420
And then we'll look at
two different parts.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.450
One is architecture side,
what can happen next.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.000
And languages, compilers
and tools side.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.620
We'll spend a little bit of time
on revolution, and just

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.750
see that we have group
brainstorming.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.190
And then I have this little bit
of a my preview of what

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.150
people should be doing, very
broad level, and I'll finish

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.400
off with that.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.870
So look at trend.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.500
I think there are a lot
of interesting trends

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.290
that we can look at.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.980
Moore's law, which is a very
trusting trend that keep going

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.000
for a very long time.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.330
Power consumption, wire delay,
hardware complexity,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.770
parallelizing compilers, program
design methodologies.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.940
So you have all these trends
her to look at.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.300
I have this picture, the graph
on the right, which shows what

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.870
happened at every generation,
assume this is a generation.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.640
You concentrate on the hardest
problem, what's the most

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.190
taxing thing?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.160
And what happens is as you go,
at this time, something like

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.310
this might be the taxing, and
then that generation, that's

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.190
where all the design going on.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.620
Then some slowly growing things
start catching up, and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.160
then, after some time, that
becomes the most important

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.330
thing in the design.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.430
So it's a paradigm shift,
because you move that focus on

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.020
that, that becomes the
important thing.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.040
And then some fast moving things
start catching up and

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.280
accelerate, and that becomes
our most taxing thing.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.140
And then this thing, again, and
the different curves start

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.810
catching up again.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.680
So what happens is you have this
cyclic phenomenon, too.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.360
But also you have the discrete
So you might get into a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.330
revolutionary thing, and really
bring something down.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.680
For example, we went from
very power-hungry,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.350
bipolar devices to SEMOS.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.890
And suddenly everything
shifted down a lot.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.240
And then we are back
again, we are those

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.440
power-hungry days again.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.780
So that was kind of
a revolutionary

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.410
change and get evolution.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.060
If you want to do work on
something, it's no fun working

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.650
on something that's very
important, hot today.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.780
The people who are making the
biggest breakthroughs on the

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.380
things that are hot today,
started 10 years ago.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.880
So your finally figure out
that this is the most

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.760
important technology today, I'm
going to start working on

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.730
doing my Ph.D. By the time you
are done, it'll be passe, most

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.030
of these cyclic things.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.550
So the key thing is, what is
going to be hot in 10 years?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.410
That's a hard problem.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.550
So this is the thing you can
look at these trends, and say,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.020
look, these are the
kind of trends.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.650
This can give you some idea
where what might be

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.590
interesting.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.660
So are you going to become
a low power person?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.795
For example, six, seven years
ago, people who studied low

00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:45.080
power, they made a lot of
significant contributions.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.420
People now still
can contribute.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.520
But people who got in early had
an easier time, and they

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.410
had a lot more impact then
people who got in late.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.960
So we look at some of these
trends, and see what we can

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.660
come up with.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.730
The first trend, this is a very
trust trend so far, is

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.950
Moore's Law.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.070
Basically, most of our basis for
things happening is part

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.560
of Moore's Law.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.675
Basically it says, you get
twice the number of

00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:14.570
transistors every 18 months.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.080
We have had that trend
for a very long time.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.440
What's the impact of function?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.390
Nobody cares about processors
who can't use transistors,

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.410
it's some kind of closed,
you don't even know many

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.780
transistors are in
the processor.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.570
What matters is what
it can deliver.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.560
So performance is what?

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.350
Delivery.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.840
So what people have realized
is if you are in the

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.860
superscalar world, this has been
flattening out recently.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.260
If you look at it, this is kind
of getting flat and that

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.310
was a big problem.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:50.580
So that's kind of the reason for
crossover for superscalar,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.700
I mean multicore.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.130
So we are trying to get back
into again a higher growth

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.820
curve in here.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.220
And then another
trend is power.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.700
Power had been going in the
wrong direction and also power

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.990
density has been going in
the wrong direction.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.720
This current keep growing more
than this and then people have

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.300
problems in that.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.490
Something that is really
revealing is what's per spec

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.390
performance.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.970
That means how much power you
are consuming to do something.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.960
And what you see is, we are
just starting to --

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.770
these days we use very little
power to get work done, and

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.210
now we, what superscalars
did was be more and more

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.110
[OBSCURED].

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:41.520
And this is what, I think, led
to a big reason for going into

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:41.750
multicores.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.900
Because we realized, look, we
keep wasting and now the power

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.740
consumption of computers
are non-trivial.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.680
You could talk to Google.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.120
Their power costs, power
budgets, is non-trivial.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.440
We can't just keep wasting
that resource.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.370
You can keep wasting things when
it is not that important,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.860
smaller factor, but power
becomes a big factor.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.040
So how do we get out of
the wasteful mode?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.480
And I think that -- a
lot of people are

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.110
I'm looking at that.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.650
If you talk to people five
years ago, people

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:05.910
say, this is free.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.060
Transistors are free.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.440
You can just keep
doing things.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.380
Just keep them available,
[OBSCURED]

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.800
makes it free.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.830
But what people realize is,
wire transistors are free,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.120
switching them is not free.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.880
And switching the request
file, so power become an

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.130
important issue.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.760
At that point I want to point
out was this wire delay.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.710
As we keep switching them faster
and faster, the world

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.590
looks smaller and smaller
and smaller, you

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.180
can make global decisions.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.780
What the implication of that?

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.650
And we're facing that, I
think it's going to get

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.240
a little bit worse.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.490
One saving grace for that is
people realize they can keep

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.730
scaling the clock speeds
that much.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.390
This chart I did a few years
ago, still is a road map,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.000
that's made the silicon
people think where

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.360
the silicon is going.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.082
Thought they can get to
10 gigs, then 15 gigs,

00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:58.240
and stuff like that.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.970
And now they [OBSCURED],

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.440
and go to all of these
power requirements.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.050
They might not be able to switch
that fast. So there are

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.390
changes to road map
because of that.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.700
Another interesting
thing is --

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:19.290
AUDIENCE: RC line type wire
delay, as opposed to --

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.910
that's not speed of light
delay, that's including

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.190
scaling of the wires
themselves?

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.420
PROFESSOR: This is mainly
speed of light delay.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.030
Because what you do is you just
look at clock speeds.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.620
I haven't done too much
of dialectrical

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.090
and stuff like that.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.750
That's the thing, you can get
closer to the speed of light

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.440
but right now we are
only about --

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.420
I mean we are not even a factor
of, I don't know, 80%,

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.910
90% speed of light.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.560
So best case we can
get 10% better.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.140
It doesn't give you
that much of room.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.103
And this is a continuous thing,
because microprocessors

00:11:00.103 --> 00:11:03.890
are going much faster
than d-RAM.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.150
And this is having a problem.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.660
There are people says there
might be revolutionary things

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.210
happening here.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:17.500
Things like non-volatile RAM,
might come and kind of take

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.980
over this area.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.650
What happening today is d-RAM
now looks a lot more like a

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.410
disc looked like 10 years ago.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.030
In may ways.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.610
We have to treat a d-RAM
like a disc.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.360
That's kind of the way we have
of looking at the world.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.470
Here where I look at compilers
and parallelizing.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.990
There's no nice number here.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.750
So in somewhere around the
1970s, people did things like

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.790
vectorization --

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.080
question?

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:48.460
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the last slide.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.960
When people do this plot which
is performance, it's not

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.130
exactly performance that or
throughput that matters

00:11:54.130 --> 00:12:00.680
relative to d-RAM, it is the
computation lengths that is

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.393
how fast from when I know I want
something from memory to

00:12:02.393 --> 00:12:05.630
when I really, really need
it that matters.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:12.550
Is this going to change as we
move to a wider architecture,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.550
with more parallelism, in the
sense that it will no longer

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.776
be, the lazy gap won't be
increasing anymore and we'll

00:12:18.776 --> 00:12:20.810
start to hear more
about bandwidth?

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.230
PROFESSOR: I don't
know, because

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.390
bandwidth is also power.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.553
These are a lot of interesting
arguments, this is what you

00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:25.870
don't know.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.750
Because the thing is, what
superscalar people did was, we

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.230
reduced the problem with
latency by predicting.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.420
And doing extra work.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.990
We will try as much as possible
to predict what you

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.170
need and do things in advance.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.430
What happens is as you keep
predicting more and more,

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.730
you're actually doing,
your accuracy of

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.080
predictions go low.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.420
But you still keep
increasing --

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:53.350
the more data you at least get a
small percentage increase in

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.810
useful data.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.150
Effecting latency.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.130
But accuracy start pretty
low and it start

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.440
becoming not useful.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.910
So bandwidth problem
has an impact, too.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.210
So unless you're using inside
the entire thing, you're

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.910
predicting a huge amount of
things, predicting that you

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.130
might use it.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.580
So if the prediction is wrong,
it's a lot of wasteful work.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.360
And the key thing is can
you pay by power?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.920
I think latency, at some point,
if you can really

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.530
predict, it becomes hard.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.420
Unless you have very regular
patterns that the predictions

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.890
working there.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.040
If you look at what happened in
compiling and programming

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.850
technology.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.620
In the '70s, you gets
vectorization technology.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.500
It did well.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.050
And then some time in 80's we
did things that compile for

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.450
instruction level parallelism.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.340
That got a lot of parallelism
in there, very low, low

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.110
parallelism in there.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.550
And somewhere in 90's we did
automatic parellelization

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.050
compilers for FORTRAN.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.170
I think that was today almost
the highlight of that.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.020
Because what happened was we
figured out how to get the

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.710
program language in FORTRAN
and do pretty well

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.200
automatically extract
patterns.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.710
Then things were kind of down in
front there because people

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.180
say FORTRAN is interesting,
but we don't program in

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.020
FORTRAN anymore.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.650
We are going to program
in things like C, C .

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.810
That did two things.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.350
First of all, one is a language
problem, which is C,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.920
C was unfortunately was not
a typesafe language.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.270
It was not be given up the right
scientific application.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.030
More like operating system
hacking, that required looking

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.860
at the entire address space.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.810
That really hindered
the compiler.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.590
Second, programmers start
falling in love with complex

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.590
data structures.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.930
The world is not fixed
size arrays any more.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.150
They want to develop
things, have

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.360
different structures, trees.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.580
These things are much
harder to analyze.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.050
So suddenly you can do it nicer,
they said, look, people

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.650
are doing recursions and these
very complex structures and

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.890
suddenly, the more of the things
you can go went down

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.300
pretty drastically.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.880
And you're back to a
pretty bad state.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.820
And then we're slowly recovering
a little bit

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.860
because things like JAVA and
C Sharp gave a typesafe

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.240
language, became a little
more analyzable.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.810
I think automatically what you
can do kind of improves.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:06.250
And the hope here is a demand
driven by multicores There's

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.110
no supply technology but
there's the demand.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.410
You need to do something.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.280
And hopefully there'll be
interesting things that come

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.040
about because of the demand.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.990
So this is my prediction,
where things are.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.710
What happened then and what's
going to happen next.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.900
Of course, multicores
are here.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.660
There's no question
about that.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.440
But I don't think programmers
are ready for that.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.190
I mean we have established a
very nice, solid boundary

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:36.260
between hardware and software.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.070
Nice abstraction layer.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.180
Most programmers don't have
to worry about hardware.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.140
Programmers didn't have any

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.210
knowledgeable about the process.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.920
In fact, we are moving
in that direction.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.060
JAVA said you don't even
have to know about the

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.780
class of the program.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.580
We are running this thing in a
nice high-level byte code.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.670
Write once, run everywhere.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.070
That's a very nice
abstraction.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.480
For most types, more slow
actually gave you enough

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.950
performance, that that
was good enough.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.200
We can deal with that.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.350
The nice artifact of that is
programmers were oblivious to

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.110
what happened in processors.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.940
A program written in
1970 still works.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.680
Still will run 10
times faster.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.620
That is really great.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.700
If you look at Windows Office
that probably [OBSCURED].

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.390
We still have code written
in 1970, but in 1980.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.630
There's still code in there.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.550
Every time they tout they have
this completely new program.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.560
Only probably 10% of
new code is there.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.030
But that's not true for
the cell phone.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.510
Every time they say I have a
new cell phone, most of the

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.190
time actually rewritten
completely.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.410
So that's why in an industry
like that it's very hard to

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.660
evolve like that because we are
just churning too much.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.100
And in soft ware we got really
enamored by this ability to

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.050
reuse stuff.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.620
Ability to have this nice
abstraction in there.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.630
And the problem is there's
probably a lot of freedom for

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.490
programmers, so they push
on complex issues.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.630
So your question about how large
companies want complex

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.400
things, they way people get
their computer advantage is

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.730
pushing the complexity.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.680
So what they did was, instead
of pushing the complexity in

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.670
the processor, they push the
complexity in software,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.750
features and stuff like that.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.250
So we are still on the
brink of complexity.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.910
But now we are adding another
complexity that's very

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.160
hard to deal with.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.830
So this is where things came
about, how things move.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.490
Where can we go?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.850
I want to talk about two
different parts.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.620
Architecture, and languages,
compilers and tools.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.130
Most of the things I talk about,
That's no solution.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.440
This is what I think that will
happen, should happen.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.840
I think that can hopefully
really inspire

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.570
people to go do that.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:47.850
And hopefully I don't have to
eat what I say in 10 years.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.970
One thing now about novel
opportunities in multicores is

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.050
you don't have to contend
with uniprocessors.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.560
Most of the time they are a
source of big pain when you

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.980
are doing research in here.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.130
Everybody says, yeah, that is
very nice, but I just wait two

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.680
years and this will happen
for me automatically.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.020
Why do I have to worry about
your complex whatever you are

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.270
suggesting in there.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.600
The other thing is, in the good
old days, the people who

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.970
really wanted performance
were these

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.530
really performance weenies.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.880
In fact, you probably got a good
talk from a performance

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:21.970
weenie last time, who's
[OBSCURED].

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.425
And we want just performance
at all cost. There

00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:26.910
are people like that.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.020
For them, producing anything
it's not easy.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.590
They say, I don't want tools.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.840
They just suck my
performance out.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.280
And it was very hard to
help them, because

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.490
they don't want help.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.980
But right now what's
happening this is

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.100
becoming everybody's problem.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.750
I think that will lead people
to want the things to take

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.760
advantage of parallelism.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.140
The other thing is, the
problem can change.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.420
Because people worked for 20
years or 40 years on this

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.250
parallel problem, but that's
for multiprocessors.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.830
So how does this problem
has changed?

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.230
What's the impact from going
from a multiprocessor, which

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.950
is multiple chips, sitting on
a board, with some kind of

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:15.820
interconnecting to multiple
cores on the same die.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:15.980
OK.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.070
I think there are some very
substantial things that

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.770
happen, that can have
big impact.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:21.950
Let's look at two of them.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.290
Which is communication
bandwidth and

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.550
communication latency.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.670
I think this is where you can
have revolutionary kind of

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.300
things happening.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.850
If you look at communication
bandwidth, the best you could

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:39.880
get, if you put two chips on
any kind of a board, it's

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.560
about 32 gigabits per second.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.060
Because you had to go through
pins and pins

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.970
had a lot of issues.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:54.190
Today if you try to put two
different cores next to each

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.100
other in the same die, the
bisection bandwidth is huge.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.950
It's four orders of magnitude
huge, that's what you can get.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.680
That's a huge change.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.650
Even for the lowest 2x
improvement, this is four

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.870
orders of magnitude difference
you can do.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.770
So why is that?

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.460
Because what changes number
of wires in the die.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.860
Because, if you think about
it, one name type of

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.500
architectures is to just just
build, to deal with this

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.580
reduction of communication
bandwidth.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.450
The closed resistors
communicates the most, the

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.040
local memory next, and
then remote memory.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.390
And then if you had
to go remote to

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.970
the next guy, network.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.100
These things basically
reduce the amount of

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.050
things you can do.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.010
That was really true.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.040
Because if you you're
inside the chip, you

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.140
can do a lot more.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.380
The minute you go to the
board, you can do less.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.170
Minute you go to multiple
boxes, less.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.970
Stuff like that.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.330
That is the way the processor
would decide.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.920
And also the clocks.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.660
Being a processor you can do
much faster to go pins, not

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.580
that fast. People are trying
to change that, but still

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:57.840
that's an issue.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.820
And multiplexing, because pins
were inherently limited.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:08.090
If you have thousand pins
that's a big processor

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.540
basically in there.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.920
And within a die, a thousand
wires is basically nothing.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.570
So we have four orders of
magnitude improvement in here.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.250
And that's amazing.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.790
That can have a huge
impact in here.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.060
So you can do massive
data exchange.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.210
On big issue right now in
parallelism is the minute you

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.280
parallelize something, you
might slow it down.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.900
Because the thing is, you might
not get data locality.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.580
Because that pipe is going to
get clogged up because you've

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.080
been trying to take too
much data in there.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.020
So if you put wrong things,
you're going to get clogged by

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.250
the communication panel.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.200
This thing says, I might not
have to deal with that.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.420
For example, I don't know why
you want to do that, but if

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.390
you want to move your entire
cache from one core to

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.270
another, you can probably do
it in a few clock cycles.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.310
That is bandwidth.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.640
I don't know why you want to
do that, because that's

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.450
probably not memory efficient,
power efficient.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:05.780
But you can do it.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:07.120
We have wireless.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.720
So the key thing is
how can you take

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.090
advantage of these wires.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.740
And how can you make it in a
way you can really use the

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.540
difficulty in programming,
because, as you've figured

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.410
out, parallel programming
is hard.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.775
If you make a wrong decision,
you're going

00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:23.470
to pay a huge price.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.350
How can you make that in a way
that you can make a few wrong

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.730
decisions and get everything by
taking advantage of that.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.400
I think that will be a big
opportunity in here.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.890
Another opportunity
is latency.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.255
This is not as big as bandwidth
because latency has

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:42.610
the inherent speed
of light issue.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.680
Again, what happens
is now length of

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.560
wires are a lot shorter.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.940
And no multiplexing,
so you can get a

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.370
direct wire from there.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.190
And on-chip can be
much closer.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.570
And the other interesting
things you

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:57.340
can also think about.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.280
Right now, why is register
to register

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.660
communication just very fast?

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.760
In a processor if you send
something one way this can use

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.720
it almost instantaneously
is much faster.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.310
Of course, wires are not
that, it's very close.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.190
Also there are a lot of
other things we do.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.140
We need more register, register
before we even come

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:17.630
to the data.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.740
In a normal pipeline
machine you have

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.080
a pretty long pipeline.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.160
The data is externally
receivable at the end of the

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.300
pipeline, but I can speculate
the same to the next one when

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.010
you start working on it if
you're wrong, I would yank it

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.660
out and you have give
[OBSCURED].

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.770
But right now if you actually
go across processors, we can

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.600
use speculation.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.370
You have to wait until the
things are committed to

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.620
memory, and then you
can start using it.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.000
That's even longer than ideally,
because that's like

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.410
10, 15 cycles I have to wait.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.190
Why can't I send something
speculative to my neighbor?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:53.740
I have enough bandwidth
to deal with it.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:57.650
If I do something wrong,
can I speculate

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.350
across multiple cores.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:03.140
So I can get my data
much faster.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.580
I save probably an order of
magnitude beyond my wire delay

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.170
because I have no pipeline
stages made until [OBSCURED]

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.320
happens, very long later.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.620
Things like that, can I
do in modern process?

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.160
Because no, I'm putting these
darn things next to each

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.580
other, what can I
do with that?

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.980
And you can do ultrafast
[OBSCURED]

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.470
real time and they can use
-- can I do things a lot

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.600
fine-grain across and take
advantage of that?

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.330
So the way to look at that a
traditional microprocessor

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.060
basically had this structure.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.840
Cache memory and processor
cache memory.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.020
And this is there because to
deal with a small amount of

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.450
wireless power and
stuff like that.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.830
Today what we have done is
basically taken this

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.890
structure, and kind of put
it in the same die.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:51.260
OK.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.810
We haven't thought
beyond that.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:59.770
And we get a few order,
a few factors better.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.870
Because, no, I don't have to go
through the pin because now

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.900
I can have instead of say 128
pins, I can have 512 going in,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.820
or 1,024 going in there.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.720
But still, I have 4 orders of
magnitude freedom in here.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.180
I am not using any of those.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.960
So one thing Raw tried to do
is have a much more tightly

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.810
coupled, a lot more
communication going on there.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.390
So a lot of people
say that today.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.720
The biggest problem in
multicores is the network.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.990
Because how will I build that
scale of a network?

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.030
My feeling is that's baloney.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.410
Network is not an issue.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.290
In fact, in Raw, a lot of our
experiments we could never

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:41.500
saturate a very, very
well done network.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.210
Because in a network I have so
many pins, I can keep adding

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.620
bandwidth like crazy.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.310
The problem the way people
design processor code today is

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.240
to minimize communication
going out of it.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.990
It has a very thin memory bus
going in and out of it.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.290
That memory bus can never
saturate any kind of network

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:00.880
you can build on a
microprocessor.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.010
It matches well if you have to
go through the pins, because

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.700
it partially measures that.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.060
But within the die you have
so much more bandwidth.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.740
So I think something interesting
would be a

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.420
fundamental sign of what the
microprocessor looks like.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.670
The core looks like.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.313
It's not taking a Pentium and
kind of plopping it once, or

00:26:20.313 --> 00:26:22.170
plumping it four times.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.100
A Pentium is not any kind of a
nice processor, it evolved

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.325
over the years to basically
deal with this very thin

00:26:30.325 --> 00:26:31.575
memory bandwidth.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.880
And suddenly you've got
four [OBSCURED]

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.920
and that problem goes away.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.590
And we're still saying, OK yeah,
I have this entire thing

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:45.140
in there, but I only want four
wires out of you, or 1,024

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:49.890
wires when you can give me
a hundred million wires.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.190
That is the question.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.990
So I think they'll be some
interesting things that the

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.525
people can make a big impact
trying to figure out how to

00:26:56.525 --> 00:26:58.590
take advantage of that.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.530
And by doing that, really
reducing the burden for the

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:01.670
programmer.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.750
Right now, you say, ok look, I
am taking advantage of that,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.820
but I'm passing on the buck
to the programmers.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.910
They're dealing with all the
small interconnectary.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.770
Then we say, you can't
just that because

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.210
programming is hard.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.080
How can I reduce the programmer
burden by taking

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.656
advantage of that.

00:27:16.656 --> 00:27:18.480
I think this is a very
interesting to

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.490
looked at this problem.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.140
If you're doing any architecture
kind of research

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.890
or are interested in that,
here is an open problem.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.700
I have this huge bandwidth out
there, and I have evolved

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.780
something that is completely in
the way dealing with very

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.390
limited amount of bandwidth,
but that's why they

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.700
live for this long.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.760
And the minute you open it up,
how can I do with that?

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.310
I don't think we have a model.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:43.620
And I think a lot
of interesting

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.680
can come out there.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:48.970
OK.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.410
Let's switch to language,
compilers and tools.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.700
The way you look at it, what's
the last big thing that

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.880
happened in languages?

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.520
I think one that happens is
object oriented revolution.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.840
The interesting thing about
object oriented revolution is

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.150
it didn't happen in a vacuum.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.230
It happened because a lot of
interesting research in

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.810
academia and outside
went into it.

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.400
People didn't come up
and say, wow, it's a

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.120
great I'm writing Java.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.700
There were hundreds of languages
that developed and

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.290
explored these concepts.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.320
And the interesting thing about
programming is, a lot of

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.455
things that looks very neat and
interesting, when you look

00:28:26.455 --> 00:28:30.180
at it first time when you start
using it in a media-line

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.950
program, that has been evolve
over 10 years, you realize

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.290
that's a pretty bad concept.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.530
Can anybody think about a
concept that looks very

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.310
interesting at the beginning,
but actually very

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.670
hard to deal with.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:46.930
AUDIENCE: My last program.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.040
PROFESSOR: I haven't
heard that analogy

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.210
before but what else?

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.790
AUDIENCE: Exceptions.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.400
PROFESSOR: Exceptions,
I think people still

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.930
haven't figured out.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.750
I think one thing people have
made assumptions think of

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.530
multiple integrators.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.810
With multiple integrators, the
first step, wow this is the

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.910
best thing since sliced bread,
because the thing object

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.060
oriented programming does is it
forces this one hierarchy,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.010
and the world is objects,
but there's no one

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.550
hierarchy in the world.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.790
World has these multiple
interconnections in there and

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:18.730
so people say, this is great.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.090
This basically now give you
objects and you can get a lot

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.680
of different relationships.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.170
But, after people trying to deal
with multiple integrators

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.840
they realize this is a pain.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.760
It's very hard to understand
it, it's very hard to right

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.100
compilers, there's so many
ambiguities around it.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.770
And then at some point you just
say, this is too much.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.335
And that's why you went to,
like Java went multiple

00:29:40.335 --> 00:29:43.720
interfaces light by having,
you can have multiple

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.390
interfaces.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.180
Here's a concept that looks very
nice, but you had to work

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.810
-- it took five, 10 years
to realize that it's

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.530
actually not usable.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.580
So if you to look at object
oriented languages, there have

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.260
been many languages.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:00.150
This is an interesting thing,
because in parallel community

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.680
we haven't had this kind
of explosion out there.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.500
Another interesting thing about
languages is language

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.400
has lot of relationship
and evolving.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.330
So if you loot at from FORTRAN
that's started.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.290
You can see the FORTRAN, so
this is FORTRAN in here.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.770
To figure out what's happening
here, you can kind of trace

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.360
over the years how new languages
academically and

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.340
industrially came about.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.770
Got influence from others, and
at then end up with things

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.400
like at the end of the graph
there's something you can

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.970
never read it.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.380
But the key thing is, there's
all these influences going

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.660
across in there.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.740
And cross fertilization.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.460
At the end, you end up with
some TCL TK, Python --

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.510
I can't even read
it carefully.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:42.180
Java, C sharp, PHP, and
stuff like that.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:43.710
There are a lot of different
languages trying to get

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.440
influence in there.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.840
The key thing is you need to
feed this beast. If you want

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.500
to have a lot of evolution or
even evolutionary changes.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.680
What that means is, people say,
yeah, we have Java, C and

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.600
C , C sharp, we are happy
with languages.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.730
No.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.290
I think in the future to deal
with that you need to have

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.010
kind of revolution in there.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:12.870
So if you look at something like
C , almost every language

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.190
started with FORTRAN.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.920
And then there had been lot of
different influences that

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.970
happened to that.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.460
And I'm going to just go, that's
for example, Java, it's

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.660
acknowledge that a lot of these
different languages

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.010
influenced ideas in there.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.010
So why do we need new
languages in there?

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.590
I think we have paradigm
shifting architecture.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.050
Because sequential to multicore
will require a new

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.360
way of thinking, and we kind of
need a new common machine

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.340
language for these
kind of machines.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.450
And the new application
domains.

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.090
Because streaming is becoming
very interesting.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.650
Scripting.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.930
People are using things like
Python and PEARL and stuff

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.675
like that in a much
regular basis to

00:31:52.675 --> 00:31:54.670
do much bigger things.

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.110
So those are cobbled
together languages.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.300
But can you do better
in those things?

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.900
Real time.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.230
Things like cell phones and
stuff become more important

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.470
how we deal with those issues.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.530
And also new hardware
features.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.750
Right now good language is tied
very well with the one

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.870
[OBSCURED]

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.980
hardware features in there.

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.880
So things like, for example,
black when I tell you that we

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.080
have all this wires available,
if you figure out some new way

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.780
of taking advantage
of those wires.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.590
That hardware feature.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.270
What's the software that can
really utilize that?

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.310
So you can just build a hardware
feature, but it's not

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.670
sufficient.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.490
You have to have a software
that do that, too.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.970
So what's the coupling?

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.730
A lot of things that
has to be that nice

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.430
interconnection there.

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.730
And I think there
are new people

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.090
who want mobile devices.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.130
A great program.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:49.590
If we would look at
parallelizing compilers or

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:52.580
parallelization as I said
before, was always geared to

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.200
this high performance weenies,
who just wanted to get their

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.030
global simulation going
as fast as possible.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.290
Who has a multi-million dollar
supercomputer waiting.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.000
It's very different having
things like great programmers

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.080
who want these things.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.790
How do you cater to them?

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.120
They are very different.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.400
The key thing is how can we
achieve parallelism without

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.820
burdening the programmer?

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.540
Because we don't, in this class
we barely burden you

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.800
guys and then you realize
how hard it is.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.940
And how much complexity it adds
on top of the algorithm,

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.900
just to get it working
parallel.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.170
So how do you reduce
some of the burden?

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.690
Perhaps not completely, but
reduce that burden.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:35.840
I'm going to skip
some of this.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.270
I'll make it available
on the site.

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.020
I want to have some time
for discussion.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.420
In streaming, we talked
about it, we tried

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.750
to do some of that.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.440
Tried to come up with the
programming model where it

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.535
will give you some additional
benefits for the program, at

00:33:48.535 --> 00:33:51.810
the same time you can actually
get multicore performers.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:54.450
And, of course, we saw that in
compilers we can actually get

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.420
good performance in then.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.380
One thing that I did a long
time ago, is this SUIF

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.970
parallelizing compiler.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.880
What we did was we can
automatically parallelize

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.940
FORTRAN programs all the way.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.300
This kind of almost worked
in the 90's.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.967
We, at some point, spec bench
marks were the way to measure

00:34:15.967 --> 00:34:19.730
how good your world is, and
every company had 20 engineers

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.550
trying to get 5% of spec.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:27.240
At the time our spec performance
was about 200.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.020
Wire registered, we did this
compiler, that we could expect

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.390
bench mark performance at 800,
by just parallelizing.

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:36.960
And in fact we made this t-shirt
that said, spec red

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.730
and the number.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.910
That's all the t-shirt said.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:44.530
And, in fact, I was working in
a few places, including the

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.810
grocery store at Palo Alto,
and people stopped me and

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.320
said, how did you do that?

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.970
It's only on this kind
of weenie things.

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:54.200
And I had in the grocery story,
I had half an hour

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.090
conversation with [OBSCURED]

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:56.880
of how --

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.130
he was, like, hmm.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.700
The only thing, spec 823.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.530
That's the only two things
the t-shirt said, people

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.780
knew what it is.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.990
But, there's problems. The
compiler was not robust. The

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.670
compiler can be used by the
people who wrote the compiler,

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:19.330
because we knew all the
things in there.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.040
The thing about that is it
worked in a way that if

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.560
program worked, you get
8x improvement.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.570
You change one line of
a code somewhere, you

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.900
went from 8x to 1x.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.870
That, I think, stopped
parallelizing around the slow

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.930
[OBSCURED].

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.900
So now, normal programmer can
now understand what happens.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.665
We go and analyze it and
afterward say aha, this is how

00:35:39.665 --> 00:35:41.910
to change the program, how
to change the compiler.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.210
So we just kind of developing
program and compiler at the

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:46.940
same time, and we could
use this thing.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:49.690
You cannot ignore the fact
that this is happening.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.040
Because there's so much of a
difference in performance.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.540
That makes it even a curse.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.090
I mean, if you only get 4x
improvement probably things

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:57.610
would have been better.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:00.660
We should have probably capped
the performance or something.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.990
And clients, in those days,
were impossible to with.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:06.160
You saw a very good example
in last lecture.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:06.490
OK.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.130
Performance at any cost. I don't
want any of these tools

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.220
if it slows down at any time.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.680
So how we deal with those
kind of people.

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.920
It's hard.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.670
In multiprocessor, communication
was expensive.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.670
If you make a wrong decision,
you pay a huge price.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.350
Basically slow the
program down.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.370
You go from being 1x, you
actually go from 0.5x.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:27.030
And worse.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.750
And you had to always deal
with Moore's law.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.540
Why do I need to go all these
complicated compiling?

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.690
Can I just wait six months
and won't I get it?

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.910
They're probably right
at that time.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.660
And another problem, what you
call a dogfooding problem.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.630
The reason that object oriented
languages is very

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.090
successful is everybody who
did the object oriented

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.420
language, in order to get
accepted as a reasonable

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.780
language, had to write their own
compiler in that language.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.710
And the compiler is a very good
way of really pushing

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.800
object oriented concepts.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.530
And so almost every object
orientated language wrote

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:58.980
their compiler.

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.850
That's a really big thing
you have to write.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.950
And by the time you write the
compiler you realize all the

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.220
problems of the language, and
you feel equal, because you

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.600
write a few hundred thousand
line programming of language.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.440
Except all the people who were
doing high performance, we

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.600
were catering for
somebody else.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.860
What that means is we can deal
with this weirdness, and say,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.280
yeah it's no problem,
nobody --

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.530
but those are the things
that really kill

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.140
the users in there.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.870
We didn't have the users
perspective.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.530
And another thing that
today is these

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:30.830
things are really different.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.220
Because you have complex data
structures, complex control

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.590
flow, complex build processes,

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.030
aliasing type unsafe languages.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.760
All this cool things we used to
do, just became a hundred

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.430
times harder, because
of all those.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.470
People fell in love with
data structures.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.270
And they say, oh, they
were so nice.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.310
We knew exactly the same size
thing, it doesn't change, I

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.130
could analyze it.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:55.150
But malloc data structures,
it's just and very complex

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:59.620
trees and doubly linked
lists was just

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.600
impossible to deal with.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.490
We want to go in the days where
everything is a nice

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:08.800
simple array But I guess the
paths for the compiler became

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.010
much harder in those days.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.520
So I think compilers are a
critical thing to deal with.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.006
I think if you have to improve
in multicores we had to deal

00:38:18.006 --> 00:38:20.780
with compilers.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:23.560
And the sad thing is some of
those things people are trying

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:26.940
to do it today by hand, we could
do it with the compilers

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.970
15 years ago.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:29.280
We kind of lost that
technology.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.170
And people are doing this
by hand again today.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.290
And go back and dust off
this technology and

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.640
bring it back in there.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.790
Best case, we might automate
everything.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.810
And say, don't worry, do what
you are doing today and just

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.960
keep doing it and we'll get
multicore performance.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.560
I don't think that's going
to be that realistic.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.600
But in worse case, at least we
can help the darn programmers.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.010
Tell them what's good,
what to do when they

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.050
do something wrong.

00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.420
How can you build those
kinds of things.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.670
I think that's very important.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.890
I think in tool side,
we need tools.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:06.400
I mean you realize after
programming on [OBSCURED]

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.560
that was really nice
to have your tools.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.990
Everybody can probably come up
with some tools additions.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.430
And I think tools, on this,
is pretty ancient.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.970
How do you come up with really
good tools that the normal

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.120
programmer can use them?

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.990
Figure out problems, figure out
debugging issues and stuff

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.610
like that, and get
through together.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.400
We need Eclipse type thing for
platform for multicores.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.500
We have a lot of nice plug-ins
come about that actually help

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.840
you to do that.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.660
Another interesting thing,
this is about

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.750
this dogfooding problem.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.100
Normally what you come up with
language compiler tool, you do

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:44.650
implementation, you do
evaluation of that and you

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.930
cycle through that.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:51.040
And evaluation says, ok, you
develop a program, you debug

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.870
the program for functionality.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.260
Performance debugging, evaluate,
and everything kind

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:56.030
of go around that.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.210
I mean there's a process here.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.140
And you'd rather realize
somethings are very hard to

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.370
do, somethings are easy.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.030
And you need that to basically
evolve that.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.110
And the problem is --

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.330
I'm contrasting two things.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.840
If you look at something
like CAD tools.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.830
CAD tools were developed by
a bunch of guys sitting in

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.130
places, used by some very
different group of people.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.090
Because of that, today's CAD
tools are horrendous to use.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.200
Everyone hates them.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.990
Because the people who developed
CAD tools never

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.400
thought about users.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.170
They were indifferent.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.990
And they just have to get the
functionality out and they

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:25.520
were happy after that.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:28.180
Whereas, object oriented
languages were more thought

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.130
about as the how the
best way to use it.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:33.130
Very much of a
programmer-centric phase.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.600
And in that end, you develop a
system that's a lot easier to

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.500
use, a lot of people use it,
more acceptance in there.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.680
The problem with high
performance languages is they

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.300
really sit in the
CAD tool way.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.480
Because the people who write
high performance languages

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.890
never really use it.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.880
People who write the compilers
and languages are not the ones

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.430
who are developing the high
performance programs. No high

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:54.560
performance language
ever wrote the

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.520
compiler in that language.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:58.230
They say, oh, that's different
domain, we don't

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.460
know how to do that.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.850
By doing that, you really never
expose the problems in

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:05.160
there, and I think the key thing
is how do you go about

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.550
doing that?

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.530
This is a hard problem.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.300
Because how do get two different
groups together?

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.710
Perhaps multicores, what you
to do is you probably

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.710
everybody who write the
compiling tool, actually have

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.440
to write it in the thing that
you are doing, because you

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.540
need the parallelism.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.430
At that point you realize all
the problems with the tool.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.800
So I'm going to the
skip on this side.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.210
Another interesting, very
interesting problem, that

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.290
people don't pay attention
is the migration

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.480
of the dusty deck.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.350
Millions if not billions of
lines of code out there,

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.130
written in old styles way.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.190
You've can't just say, look,
Microsoft, just go rewrite

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.310
everything new with my
spiffy new system.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:42.930
That doesn't work.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:44.990
How to get these people
to migrate out?

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:49.590
That might not mean doing
everything automatically, but

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.295
how can you even help -- the
people who wrote the code is

00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:55.310
probably gone, left the company,
probably dead.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.810
How do you help somebody move
some of these things to you.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.750
That is the rate of evolution.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.230
You don't have to rewrite
everything from scratch.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.960
What kind of tools
that you can use?

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.690
And these applications
are still in use.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.270
Sometimes source code is
even available, but

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.780
programs are gone.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.450
But the interesting thing is,
some of those things,

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:23.540
applications have bugs that
have become features.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.190
So I'll give you a very
good example.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.330
And this happened
to Microsoft.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.390
So at Microsoft at some point --
if you know Word, Word does

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:31.340
algorithmic pagination.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.040
That means how to lay out the
pages, and how to break pages

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.680
and stuff like that.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.343
So they had the algorithm
in there.

00:42:36.343 --> 00:42:38.750
And they were switching
versions, and they said look,

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.440
this algorithm is now too old.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.420
It's been there for
five, six years.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:42.490
Rewrite it.

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:44.700
And of course you can assume
what the spec is.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.450
There's a nice spec to
that, a few pages.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.550
They said, go rewrite that.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.510
And someone wrote a very nice
pagination algorithm.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:55.325
But the problem is, when they
use that algorithm, a lot of

00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:56.310
old documents broke.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.490
That means they didn't
paginate right.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.760
So the old document, when you
open it, looks very different.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.170
And they said, darn,
what's going on?

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.080
What they realized is, the
old implementation

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.500
had a lot of bugs.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.110
Subtle things.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.640
The guide didn't really conform
to the standard.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.350
So it didn't break the word
exactly right, if at some

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.860
point it has a break and space,
it would probably put

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:17.980
it on the next line.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.370
A few things that
didn't really --

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.830
And what they had to do is,
they had to spend a lot of

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:26.070
time discovering bugs and
adding them to the spec.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.010
So they did that.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.800
Because otherwise, all the
previous program doesn't work,

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.050
the previous files will
not look right.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.920
And they went through this
entire process of trying to

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.660
discover and trying to figure
out what [OBSCURED]

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.080
instead of what the text
of the specs said.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.000
They're out of sync.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.900
And so a lot of times,
there's that problem.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:44.466
So you see we have something
old, and we

00:43:44.466 --> 00:43:45.050
want to get it new.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.150
It doesn't mean that you
know the functionality.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.660
The functionality that was
implemented is the spec, or

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.950
the functionality that
you wrote about.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.740
Because that's a little
bit subtly different.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.330
So how do you go and
discover that.

00:43:55.330 --> 00:43:56.470
I think that's a very
interesting

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:58.560
and important problem.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.850
And I think there are many
reasons that run such things

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:04.230
like creating test cases,
extracting invariants, things

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.000
like failure oblivious computing
type, if you had

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.600
listened to professor
Rabbah's talk .

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.150
Things like that can help take
these old things and migrate.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.380
Can use tools to do that.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.850
I did a lot of interesting
research on that.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:21.890
OK, so that's my take on
languages and compilers, where

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.620
interesting things
have happened.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.490
I want to talk about revolution,
but I want to skip

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.290
that first and go into this
crossing the abstraction

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.450
boundaries part, and then
come back to revolution.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:39.780
So the way the world works is,
you have some kind of class of

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.780
computing you want to do, and
you have some atoms that need

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.100
to run that computation.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:49.460
That's basically the end
to end of any process.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:56.130
But if I said, here's some
silicon, and here's my

00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:58.980
algorithm, go do that, no single
person can basically

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:00.410
build that.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.660
OK?

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.650
You can't take silicon, and
go through a semiconductor

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.740
process, build a process,
design all those things,

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.890
language -- it doesn't happen.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.950
Someday probably it was possible
to have one person

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.390
know everything,
but you can't.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.210
So what we have done deal with
build abstraction boundaries.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:21.090
We have compilers, languages,
instruction,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.870
microarchitecture, layout,
design rules, process,

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:26.250
materials science --

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.190
basically, everything
is separated out.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:30.220
Every time one gets too
complicated, we kind of divide

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.400
it in half, and keep
adding and adding.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.580
And we have this big
stack of things.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.660
So at the beginning, then you
break up, people kind of knew

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.690
both sides, and they went
into one side and kind

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.970
of broke that up.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.960
And so people knew
a lot of things.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.420
But the next generation comes,
they only know that.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.480
The guy, someone who's
going to be expert in

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.460
microarchitecture.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:52.380
You only know microarchitecture.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.120
He has no idea what the
languages are, because that

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.830
world of his is complicated.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:59.250
What we have is a
compartmentalized world that

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:04.090
was broken up as we went in the
last 40 years, as things

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.220
progressed, the right thing at
that time, they figure out

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.890
what layers to do.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.150
What we have done is create
the domain expert.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.050
There's one guy who probably
knows about two things.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:15.130
He might know a little bit of
design rules, and probably

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.300
process a little bit.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.590
Another person will know a
little bit of design rules,

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:19.420
layout, and microarchitecture.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.920
And there's someone who'll do
microarchitecture and ISA.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.400
And somebody knows compilers
and ISA, but has no clue

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.780
what's happening.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:30.430
So what this has done is kind
of entrenched some layering

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:34.060
that really made sense
about 30 years ago.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.310
The problem now is, this
is creating a lot

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.060
of issues in here.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.910
So what you kind of really need
is a way to break some of

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.140
this layering.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.070
How do you do that?

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:49.330
You need people who can cross
multiple of these disciplines.

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:51.650
So this is a thing for you.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.830
I mean, you might think
you are an architect.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:55.460
But hey, you're in this class,
you're learning a little bit

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.500
of programming.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.700
Go learn a little bit of
physics, what's in there.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.590
Just have a little bit of
broadening in there.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.380
Then a lot of people, there are
some people who are a lot

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:05.440
more in the process side, but
know a little bit about

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.450
microarchitecture
and compilers,

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:07.740
somewhere in the middle.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.920
They are expert in the middle,
but they are not just sitting

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.850
happily in their own domain.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:16.380
Just trying to look at
cross-cutting there.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:19.690
And keep going up,
in some sense.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.450
I kind of put myself in there,
saying OK, I am in compilers,

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.830
but I know a little bit
of language, and I

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:24.170
know a little --

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:26.650
I try to go down and down
as much as possible.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.800
What you actually need is
someone who knows everything

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.640
really well.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.560
That is hard, but at least
someone who can know the top

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.870
and the bottom to
redo the middle.

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.490
Because my feeling is the way
the middle is done is probably

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.850
now too old.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.470
So I don't know that
this is possible.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.250
It's not me.

00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:46.690
But if someone really
understands the top and the

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.225
bottom, and say OK, I can
probably throw the middle out

00:47:49.225 --> 00:47:50.650
and redo the middle.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:53.680
And I think that might be an
interesting revolution that

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.000
might happen.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.880
It's hard.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.790
There's so much information
there.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.670
Some of the information, there
are the layers out there, it

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:02.340
doesn't make sense, today,
the way things are.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:06.910
I mean for example, a lot of
these layers had issues with

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:07.950
wire delay.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.920
Because when wire delay was
not an issue, these layers

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.100
made perfect sense.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:14.250
But as wire delay came about,
a lot of changes had to

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.430
propagate across layers, and
it was very hard, because

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:18.420
people were domain experts.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.540
So I think this is where the
revolution is going to come.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.860
Somebody's going to [OBSCURED]

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.815
the way you do compilers, the
way you do architecture, the

00:48:25.815 --> 00:48:28.360
way you decide everything
is wrong.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.470
I know the algorithms
you want to run.

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.340
I know what's available in
very low [OBSCURED].

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.160
Let me see you put
that together.

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.940
A person, a group, whatever.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.190
Might have a beginning.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:46.750
And so with that, I will go
to the revolution side.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.800
So the way you look at
revolutions, what are the

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.320
far-out technologies?

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.720
And sometimes revolutions just
come from wishful thinking.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.380
I wish we can do this, and then
if you can push hard, you

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.150
might be able to get there.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:01.560
Anybody wants to -- so in this
talk I talk way too much.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.700
How about, come in?

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.920
What do you think is
going to happen?

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.580
What do you want to work on?

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.460
You guys are the ones who have
to make this decision.

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:08.860
Not me.

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.750
I've already made a lot of
decisions myself, 10, 15 years

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.170
ago, what I'm going to do.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.570
You are in the process,
you have a lot

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.440
more choices to make.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.460
You haven't narrowed
your horizon yet.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.487
So this affects a lot more on
you than me at this point.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.350
What do you think is going
to change the world?

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:38.990
What do you want to work on?

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:41.740
I mean, you should work on
something, I guess, that you

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:44.240
think is going to have
a huge impact.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.490
Have you thought about that?

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:50.180
A lot of silence.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:50:04.890
AUDIENCE: [OBSCURED]

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:10.590
PROFESSOR: So faster means
very little latency.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.335
Latency is a hard problem.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.440
A lot of people who are trying
to do latency [OBSCURED]

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.225
And the revolution side people
are looking at quantum can

00:50:22.225 --> 00:50:27.660
kind of do deal with latency.

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.030
PROFESSOR: Yes, I think there
are a lot of revolutionary

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.050
things you can do there.

00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.570
Especially taking advantage of
the fact that you have a lot

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:39.220
of wires in there.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.760
And I think people haven't
really pursued that yet.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.270
And this is where the complexity
will come in.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.770
Trying to basically deal with
these, take advantage of these

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:49.800
kind of things.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.400
I think there are a lot of
opportunities there.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.620
And then that's the kind
of evolutionary part.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.580
And then some people
are looking at

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.110
revolution, with quantum.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:00.980
What else?

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.300
I expected people to have a lot
more interesting insights.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:17.710
AUDIENCE: [OBSCURED]

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:20.940
PROFESSOR: I think the world
is almost bifurcated.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.200
There are things that you can
have with power plugs, and

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.770
things that don't have
power plugs.

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.690
And I think people who have
power plugs still have some

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:32.740
power issues, like what
Google is finding out.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.970
You can't just keep
wasting power.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:39.690
But as things start becoming
more mobile, going into

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.450
smaller and smaller devices,
power and size becomes a much

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.200
bigger thing than what
more you can do.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.570
You don't become performance, I
mean, you want some level of

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.550
performance; you need
to get a video.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.750
But the minute you get the
video, you don't want to have

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.680
HD TV. You just say, OK,
get the media onto

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.590
my cellphone screen.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.900
I'll be happy with that speed.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.970
Just do it.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:03.800
As low power as possible,
as [OBSCURED]

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.160
possible.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.980
So I think that's
pushing there.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.450
So for example, in for a long
time what has happened is

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.780
there's a trickle
down economy.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.120
Things that start happening in
a very high end system and

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.500
kind of trickle down
to the low end.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.310
But there might be
a diversion here.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.810
There might be a different
part coming.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.710
Because that technology might
be fundamentally different.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:27.122
AUDIENCE: So [OBSCURED]

00:52:27.122 --> 00:52:33.170
also changing from the software
side is this notion

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:34.565
of perpetual data.

00:52:34.565 --> 00:52:38.630
I've been using this mash-up
code, you put it up on the

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.670
web, lots of people use it.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:42.640
So it's pushing toward
scripting light

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:44.500
languages or whatever.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.430
PROFESSOR: So this is an
interesting obsession I have.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:54.290
So [OBSCURED]

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:58.020
And then a few years ago I had
a start up, and I just again

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.390
had the time to try it,
not large , some

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.160
large piece of code.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.820
What I realized was, what
programming had become, is the

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.580
biggest, best tool for
programming at

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.010
that time was Google.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.420
Because I was trying a bunch
of things with Windows.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.490
And everything I want,
there was a function.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:17.446
And if I can find that function,
my work is a factor

00:53:17.446 --> 00:53:19.140
of 100 smaller.

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.370
So I spend more time than
actually thinking about

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:23.650
algorithms, how the lists should
be, or how my data

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.290
structures should be,
trying to Google it.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.530
I said, darn, I want
to do this.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:27.460
Where's that function?

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.410
Where can I find that function
in this entire big library.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:31.990
So what that means is
there's kind of this

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:34.290
missing layer in there.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:38.110
Because what has happened is,
our language is a level of

00:53:38.110 --> 00:53:38.960
abstraction.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.650
And then we have built these
libraries with no kind of

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:42.520
support at all.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.680
I mean, the compilers' languages
don't really support

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.350
the libraries.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.090
Because it's just built
out of basic blocks.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.660
And keeping it, can you have
better basic blocks, can you

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.650
have more nice abstraction?

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:58.170
Instead of saying, OK, here's
5,000 libraries with 250,000

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:00.420
different functions that you
can use for compiling.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:01.860
Can you build it
in a nicer way?

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:06.718
AUDIENCE: [OBSCURED]

00:54:06.718 --> 00:54:09.310
interface, your input,
your output.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.258
And then you publish your
code and then Google

00:54:11.258 --> 00:54:11.450
indexes it for you.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:14.410
And then your program is just
of Google searches.

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:19.670
PROFESSOR: I think, if you
think about what all the

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:22.560
Windows source base is,
it's like that.

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:28.360
I mean, in the company we were
doing, during the [OBSCURED],

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.870
there was this group of people
who understood every line of

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.270
code they wrote, because they
were writing a virtualization

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:37.220
system that runs
on the Windows.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.420
So for them, every line
was probably --

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:43.150
Interesting thing is, when
that group started, that

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.090
entire piece of code was
about 50,000 lines.

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:47.910
Now it's about 65,000 lines.

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:50.780
But we had about 10 people
working on that.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.920
That means these things
get revised.

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.950
You don't keep at it.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:57.150
There's another group of
people who's doing user

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:58.770
interface and stuff like that.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.510
they have alphabet soup of
different libraries.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:03.332
They're using Ajax,
this, that --

00:55:03.332 --> 00:55:05.920
I don't even know what
they are using.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.650
The amount of code they
write is immense.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.590
The amount of things they
have to know is immense.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:13.060
Each of them are not
that completed.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:18.080
But if you use a bad thing,
you have a bad looking

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:21.270
interface, clunky, slow,
whatever, if you figure out

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:24.060
the right three function calls,

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.310
things look much better.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:27.490
That's a very different type
of programming in there.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.460
So for them, it's basically
knowledge.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.530
How much do you know.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:37.280
Just like, it's almost like I
remember my college days,

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.990
friends who were doing things
like that in medical school.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:42.940
So you need to know this entire
thing about all the

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.100
different muscles in the body.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.470
And there's this big thick
book you just study.

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.270
It's almost like that.

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.690
You just take this big Windows
manual that are a few hundred

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:53.330
pounds heavy, and you look at
every page, and figure out

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:54.630
what you know.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.750
That's a really strange
way of coding.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:01.050
But, I mean, algorithmically,
I think what they were doing

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:02.100
is pretty simple.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.180
I don't think they every
designed a data structure.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.520
Every data structure they used
came from something.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.967
But they had to figure out
the right data structure.

00:56:11.967 --> 00:56:12.463
AUDIENCE:

00:56:12.463 --> 00:56:16.551
This is going in a totally
different direction, but in

00:56:16.551 --> 00:56:19.550
terms of graphics in video
games, perhaps getting artists

00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:22.212
who are aware of both the
hardware and the software, and

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:25.550
so can design more for the
capabilities of the machine,

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:29.840
and can make more visually
appealing --

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.640
PROFESSOR: I think that's the
are that has a very different

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.130
set of communities.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.490
Artists [OBSCURED].

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:38.870
Not even trained engineers.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:40.250
And they're sitting in one,
and they have this neat

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:41.940
feature, they want fire
to look natural,

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:42.950
or whatever it is.

00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:44.670
And then there's the programmers
and hardware

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:48.070
people, that who knows what
the capability is.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:50.290
I think that's what we're
trying to push in Mike

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:52.510
Eckham's talk, and say how
do you go about it?

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:55.390
How do you know when a new thing
comes, what is doable?

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:59.950
Like for example, what ATI does,
ATI has a group called

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.060
the research group.

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.310
What they do is, every time a
new chip comes, they actually

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:06.700
go and figure out all the things
you can do with that.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.650
OK, how can you do
rain in this one?

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.340
So they write a lot of --

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.830
those of a little bit of an
artistic bent, but very

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.570
hard-core programmer who kind
of figure out what's doable.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:19.330
And they make that available
and say here, this is

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:19.870
what you can do.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:21.650
And a lot of people kind
of emulate that.

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:23.410
They say, wait a minute,
how did they do that?

00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:25.900
Then kind of figure out, OK, now
I have this new hardware,

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:28.010
and I'm able to do something
completely new.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.160
I think that's, pushing there.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.020
I mean, I think this is
where interesting

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.470
revolutions come about.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.850
One of my firm beliefs is that
a lot of good research is not

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:40.030
in one area, as I pointed out.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.500
It's kind of looking at two
distinct things and kind of

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:43.410
bringing them together.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.490
Bringing knowledge from
one to another

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.570
and mixing them together.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:48.440
I think that can have
huge impact.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.070
And that's a place that I think
can have huge impact.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:54.910
What other things that will
have big visual impact?

00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:58.290
That the next hardware
can enable?

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.450
You can keep adding more big
servers and stuff like that,

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:01.470
but it's another thing.

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:03.485
What other things can
can have big impact?

00:58:03.485 --> 00:58:04.001
AUDIENCE:

00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:07.612
[OBSCURED]

00:58:07.612 --> 00:58:10.703
The same is true for biologists,
physicists,

00:58:10.703 --> 00:58:12.160
chemists, end users.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.720
So maybe the thing to do is work
on language generators.

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:19.602
And easy way for me as an end
user to express language

00:58:19.602 --> 00:58:20.114
[OBSCURED]

00:58:20.114 --> 00:58:21.650
that I want and give me
a way to generate it

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:24.120
PROFESSOR: So that's
a lot of things.

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:26.380
For example, I was talking to
this computational biologist.

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.710
And what he said was, for
computer science, the best

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.750
thing that happened from a
biology point of view is Excel

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:35.050
only had 32,000 cells.

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.680
Because the biologists
keep using Excel, and

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.430
they say that --

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.660
AUDIENCE: [OBSCURED]

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.190
PROFESSOR: 65,000 cells.

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:43.050
And they ran into this and
said, jeez, I can't do

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:43.810
anything more in that.

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:44.740
Now what do I do?

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.180
And then suddenly they had to
start looking at programming

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:48.710
and stuff like that, because
they can't have an Excel

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:49.440
spreadsheet doing that.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.310
So that's a lot of biologists
actually had to switch.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:59.200
So I think, interesting thing
about computer sciences, there

00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.880
are a lot of fundamental
sciences still.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.550
But I think we have grown and
ran so fast developing that,

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:09.450
what's lagging behind that
is applications.

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:12.960
How to apply that to biology,
gaming, stuff like that.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.630
And I think a lot of interesting
things, as

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.290
computer scientists, we can do
is to bring that knowledge in

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.350
an applied community.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:24.660
Really, you can have a huge
impact and fundamentally

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.180
change things if you apply
that knowledge.

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.170
Both theoretical things you have
to get out, as well as

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.810
using the powers of the
computers we've got

00:59:33.810 --> 00:59:34.960
in the right way.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:40.170
I think a lot of times, people
are taking a few days to do

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:42.670
two times better, five times
better than kind of seeing

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:47.760
fundamentals [OBSCURED].

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.150
I think this is an interesting
topic.

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:50.680
I think I'm going
to stop soon.

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:55.070
And I think it's interesting,
especially for you guys.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:58.590
Because you are probably going
into an area, looking at a

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:02.940
field, trying to get expert
at something.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.140
There's a lot of times you get
seduced to become an expert in

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.920
what's hot today.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.510
But the interesting thing is,
especially if you are doing a

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:14.300
PhD, or if you do something that
takes four or five years

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.100
for you to mature in that area,
is it going to be the

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.440
hardest thing in four
or five years?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.380
So multicores are hard today.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.070
So should I recommend that
everybody jump and become

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:26.670
expert and try to do a
PhD in multicores?

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.630
Probably not.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:30.040
Because five or six years down
the line, some of these things

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.347
might be solved. they'd better
get solved, or else we're in

01:00:33.347 --> 01:00:36.710
big trouble.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:39.970
But the thing is, what's going
to be the problem there?

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.150
I see one thing that's really
hard, it's almost art, is to

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.630
kind of picture your
[OBSCURED]

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.890
and then if your lucky And if
you're lucky and you do a good

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.930
job in that prediction, you've
come about, and by the time

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:54.960
you get to a point that you
become expert, you've become

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.220
expert in the thing that's
most important.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.500
It's not an easy thing to do.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.510
And a lot of times, nobody can
claim that they have a

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.530
technique to do that, too.

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.120
A lot of people who claim,
they discount

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.500
how lucky they were.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.200
There's a large amount of
luck associated with it.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.240
But a key thing is to kind of
follow that trend, identify,

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.350
and do that.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.810
That's the technique that I
think every one of us, every

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:17.720
one of you should do a lot.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.510
OK.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:22.110
With that, do you have something
about the --

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:23.500
SPEAKER: Yes.

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:26.240
A couple of things about --

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.104
Anybody here want direct access
to a Playstation 3?

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:32.077
Just one?

01:01:32.077 --> 01:01:32.563
Two?

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:37.520
So come by, actually if you
have time now, we'll talk

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.832
about that and figure
out a way of getting

01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:40.950
you access to it.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:45.500
The final competition's going
to be this Thursday.
