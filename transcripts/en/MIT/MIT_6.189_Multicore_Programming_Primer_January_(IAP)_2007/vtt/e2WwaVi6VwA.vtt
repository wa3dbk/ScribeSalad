00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.400
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: So,
I'm Eddie Scholtz

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.120
and this is Mike
Fitzgerald and we

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.100
worked on a backgammon tutor.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.310
And to start off, let's
see a show of hands.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.690
Who here knows how
to play backgammon?

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.830
OK, a few.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.830
So to give you an
idea of how it works,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.790
it involves both skill and luck.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400
And it's a two player game.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.930
And the object is to
move all your pieces

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680
past your opponent's
pieces and off the board.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.510
So white's trying to
move his pieces this way,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.080
down and across.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.960
And brown's trying to move
his pieces the other way.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.520
And you move by
rolling the dice.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.350
Some important rules
are that you can not

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.410
land on a point on
which your opponent has

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.940
two or more pieces.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.300
And if your opponent only
has a single piece there,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.705
you can land on it and send
it back to the beginning.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780
So the goals of this
project when we started off

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.071
were, first of all to implement
the rules of backgammon

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:23.200
and get the game going, and
that took a good amount of work.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.690
Next we wanted to create
or find the function that

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.890
evaluates or says how
good a given board is.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.390
And then we wanted to be
able to look into the future,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.540
in order to better determine
what move to choose now.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.650
And this is the part of the
program that we parallelized.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.650
And finally our
last goal was to try

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.370
to teach the player
how to improve

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.470
by suggesting why one move
might be better than another

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.980
in English.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.540
So to start with, the two
basic kinds of board evaluation

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.750
are just a static
evaluator and a neural net.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.449
And the static evaluator
works by looking

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:14.050
at features of the board
and creating a score based

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.520
on that feature, and
then multiplying it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.600
by weight based on how
important that feature is,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.970
and summing them up.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.790
So a program like this was
created by Hans Berliner at CMU

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.770
in 1979, and it was
actually the first program

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.710
to beat a ruling world champion.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.636
And they said the program got
a little lucky but it did win.

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:35.010
And one of the
important features

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.189
was it adjusted the weights
as the game went on,

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.105
because certain features
became less important

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:44.040
as the game progressed and other
features became more important.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.790
So the next approach
that people have used

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.810
is framing neural nets to
determine how good a board is.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.940
And these have been
really successful.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.050
They work by basically
playing hundreds of thousands,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.790
if not millions of
games against itself.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.080
And so it improves this way.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.930
And after about a
million and half games

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.430
it reaches its
maximum performance.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.990
And one such board
evaluator is Pubeval

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.680
which was released by
Gerry Tesauro in 1993.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.060
And this is the
evaluation function

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.677
that we used for our program.

00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:28.260
Looks like we lost
network connection.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.510
This is the evaluation function
that we used for our program.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.150
And he sort of released this
as a benchmark evaluator

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.870
so that other people in
the development community

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.130
could have something to compare
their evaluators against.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.994
And it plays an
intermediate level if not

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:42.910
a pretty strong level.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.900
So our next goal was
to implement the search

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.570
the looks into the
future in order

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.640
to help choose
the best move now.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.770
One of the challenges of this
is that the branching factor

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.550
is so large because you don't
know what the dice rolls are

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.350
going to be in the future.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.630
And like in checkers, the
branching factor is 10.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.290
In chess it's 35 to 40.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.540
But in backgammon, for
a turn it's around 400.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.140
Another challenge that we
faced in the search was

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.660
that the Pubeval function
that we used is not zero sum.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.990
So that produced some
challenges that you'll see.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.360
And also there's the question
of whether searching deeper

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.160
actually does
produce better play.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.220
And most papers say
that the board evaluator

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.790
is more important
than searching deeper.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.990
But they do say that
searching into the future

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.380
does improve play, and
especially when you're already

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.925
at a pretty high level of play
where everyone's near the same

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:50.499
and playing really well.

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.040
A slight increase in performance
could make a big difference.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.190
So here's an illustration
of the search tree

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.540
to give you a better
idea of how it works.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.480
So say it's X's turn.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.420
There might be 20 or so
moves that he can commit.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.710
Now these are a series of moves.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.520
So you roll the two
dice, and if they're

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.650
doubles you get four moves.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.150
Certain turns you may not be
able to move at all so you

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.570
might not have any moves.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.050
So that really varies.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.500
So after those 20
moves the other player,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.090
O is going to roll.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.480
And there's 21 different dice
combinations he can have.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.440
And then for each of those
there's about 20 moves.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.800
And then it's X's roll.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.050
And once again he has
21 dice combinations.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.910
And then X's move.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.580
So this is looking two
moves into the future.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.410
So the idea is to
build this search tree,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.810
and then at this
point we're already

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.275
up to 3.5 million boards.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.830
So you have all these leaf nodes
that represent your boards,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.260
and you're going
to evaluate them

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.160
with your evaluation function
to determine how good they are.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.290
Since it's not
zero sum, you have

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.970
to evaluate it for both player
and both of these values

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.380
need to get passed up as you're
going to move back up the tree

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.730
to determine the best move.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.130
So you start at
the bottom and you

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.630
say that since
it's X's move he's

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.300
going to choose the best
possible move given that roll.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.400
And then in order to move
up further and calculate

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.120
the value for the
parent node, you

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.800
say it's equal to the
probability of the dice

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.007
roll for the child node
times the value that's

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:44.090
stored in that child node.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.710
And then you keep doing
this and repeating this.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.850
O picks his best move and sort
of sums the expected value.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.214
And then get back up the top
and X picks his best move.

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:02.880
So now I'm going to
hand it over to Mike

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.920
who's going to talk about
the part of the code

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:05.794
that we parallelized.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.330
MIKE FITZGERALD:
There's a question.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.390
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.210
Can you use alpha beta pruning?

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.970
You know about
alpha beta pruning?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.803
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Yeah.

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:18.236
People have used that and
just like a [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:18.236 --> 00:07:20.060
search of narrowing it down.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.590
AUDIENCE: Typically by down
to the square root of n.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.904
So you would have a 20 branch
effect rather than a 400.

00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.362
It seems like a real payoff if
you could make it work here.

00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:30.653
I don't know if there's some
reason on the back end why

00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:31.784
it's hard.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.200
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Well, we actually
didn't get to that point.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.395
We just spent a lot of time just
implementing rules of the game.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.510
MIKE FITZGERALD: All
right, so the first thing

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.880
we looked at and said this would
be perfect for parallelizing

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.040
is just the brute force
evaluation of those million

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.570
boards that you get
down to at the end.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.530
Which if you run through on one
processor just takes a while.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.261
Generally an evaluation of a
board, regardless of its state

00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:09.510
takes the same amount of time.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:14.979
So we just had to split the
number evenly between SPUs.

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:16.770
We had to keep it around
a multiple of four

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.310
just to get the DMA calls to
line up nicely with the floats

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.070
that we were returning
and things like that.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.260
So if you're evaluating
a million boards which

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:31.680
was our number for our
benchmarks that we did,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.059
each SPU has about
170,000 to handle,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.730
and it clearly can't take
all those over at once.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.900
So each SPU knows where
it's supposed to start

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.280
and how many it's
supposed to do.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.905
And it knows how much
it can pull over.

00:08:44.905 --> 00:08:49.026
So it does a DMA call to pull
in as much as it can process.

00:08:49.026 --> 00:08:53.810
It processes those,
evaluates them, returns them,

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.050
and gets to the next bunch.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.600
So that is what we
were able to implement.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.990
There's also a good opportunity
for double buffering there

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.220
for pulling them
in as it's actually

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.520
evaluating the previous ones.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.930
So that would be actually a
pretty easy step to do next.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.310
But each of those
six are roughly

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.840
finished at the same time
and then get back to the PPU

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.430
to evaluate, to
run up that tree.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.750
And another opportunity
to make it a bit quicker,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.166
which we didn't
quite get to would

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:27.460
be SIMDizing the
evaluation function

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.950
so we could do
four boards at once

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.380
with vector engines
instead of just one.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.770
So the performance
that we got when

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.490
looking at the number
of SPUs we were using

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.070
was actually roughly
in proportional

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.880
to the number of
SPUs we were using.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.570
It's actually 18.18
at the top there.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.090
So when using two instead of
one we got just about half.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.240
When using three instead of
one we got just about a third.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.410
If you just look at this speedup
graph it's pretty much one

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.025
to one from the
number of SPUs we

00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:04.810
were using to the
amount of time it took.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.991
So it was a pretty
efficient algorithm

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:09.240
for splitting those up and
evaluating them and pulling

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.325
them back together.

00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:12.450
I'll give you a brief demo.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.400
I'll show you
quickly how it looks.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.023
We might have to fudge our
network connection a little bit

00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:18.523
here.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.070
So we used just an
[INAUDIBLE] Windows

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:55.430
setup to display our
[INAUDIBLE] we were using.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.190
So I'm just going play a
couple rounds of the display,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.191
let's say against the computer.

00:11:16.397 --> 00:11:18.980
So you can see the computer just
took a couple of moves there.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.130
But basically what
we get here is

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.340
a print out of a text
representation of the board.

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.030
And then it's my turn.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.195
I rolled a six and a two.

00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:33.390
It does its own
evaluation and says

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.090
this is what the best move combo
would be for me at this point.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.761
In the ideal
tutoring situation we

00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:43.010
don't let the user pick what
they thought was the best

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.380
and then tell them why
not, but right now,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.360
with the time we had
this is how we did it.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.060
And then it lists all the legal
possible moves you can make.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.770
Let's say I want to
move from 0.6 to 0.4.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.145
It moves my piece up there,
and from 8 to 2 for example.

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:02.180
And the computer makes
its couple of moves.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.400
That's the general idea.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.630
You can run the computer
against itself as many times,

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.150
just to test different
evaluation functions

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.950
against each other.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.410
You can also do it without
the animation on the GUI

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.310
so that it runs a lot quicker.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.725
But that's the general idea.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.241
Just to wrap up,
four more slides.

00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:27.740
The way we went
about this basically

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:32.370
was, we just got sequential code
working on just the PPU, got

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.500
the rules of the
game worked out,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.970
all the weird
conditionals and things

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.330
that can happen in backgammon
and we fixed out our bugs

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.640
and our memory leaks
and things like that.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.540
We just shelled out
the parallel code

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.310
and got that working on
the PPU, then on one SPU,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.630
and then on six.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.760
So it was a pretty clean
process of doing it.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.660
And we ran into a few walls.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.124
We aren't really
backgammon experts or even

00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:04.540
intermediate players, so it
was kind of a new thing for us

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.190
to make sure we had
the rules right,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.619
and we weren't doing stupid
things here and there.

00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:12.660
But also managing the
search tree was a big deal.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.730
And looking at what
the program has

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.890
to do in running
the game, that's

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:23.450
the next thing we want to tackle
as far as paralyzing goes.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.932
It takes a while, and
it's pretty tough.

00:13:27.932 --> 00:13:29.640
We ran into some memory
management issues

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.826
with how we were
representing our boards.

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:35.480
We were able to
pack them down into,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:41.410
I think 24 byte structure,
20 byte structure

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.750
to be able to pass more
to the SPUs at one time.

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.585
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
What's the general idea

00:13:53.585 --> 00:13:54.280
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.780
MIKE FITZGERALD:
I'm sorry, I missed

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.488
the beginning of your
question because it

00:13:57.488 --> 00:13:58.730
wasn't on speakerphone.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.688
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.060
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Are you talking
about moving into the future?

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.160
Are you talking about
looking into the future?

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:27.659
Yeah.

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.490
So we built the code
for creating that tree

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.620
and evaluating the leaf nodes.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.875
We didn't quite have
time to finish up--

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.500
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
I can't hear you

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.200
through this [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.950
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: OK.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.910
We created the code for
constructing the tree

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.650
and evaluating the leaf nodes.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.660
We haven't quite has
time to finish up

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.250
moving back up the tree.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.620
So at this point we're
now looking ahead more

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:56.457
than just the moves for
now, for like one move.

00:14:56.457 --> 00:14:57.040
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.034
OK.

00:14:58.034 --> 00:14:59.825
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: But we
got the parallel code

00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:01.616
working for actually
evaluating the boards.

00:15:01.616 --> 00:15:04.250
It shouldn't be too hard to--

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.450
MIKE FITZGERALD: Just
extend that tree.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.360
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: To
move back up the tree

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.776
and see what the
best move is now.

00:15:12.862 --> 00:15:14.820
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Yeah, so
that's basically as far

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.406
as the road blocks we hit were.

00:15:18.406 --> 00:15:19.894
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Any
other questions?

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.140
Yeah, just some future ideas.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.740
One of the big ones is for
training, the evaluation

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.540
functions using neural nets.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.270
That takes a lot of time to
play hundreds of thousands,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.680
millions of games.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.470
So one of the ideas
is to parallelize

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:48.240
that to help speed that up.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.911
And I think we're about out
of time, so that concludes it.

00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:51.910
Are there any questions?

00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:56.600
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious, you said

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.558
looking far into the
future doesn't necessarily

00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:00.510
help as much as the
evaluation function.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.110
Does that mean
that AI backgammon

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.820
is-- I mean how computationally
intensive is a good player?

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.927
I mean, is it a
computationally problem?

00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:12.510
Would you benefit
from the parallelism

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.770
in a practical setting?

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.300
MIKE FITZGERALD:
Well, just looking

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.762
at how long it takes to go
through those million boards,

00:16:17.762 --> 00:16:19.176
if you're playing a
computer you don't

00:16:19.176 --> 00:16:21.759
want to wait 18 seconds for them
to make their move as opposed

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:22.330
to--

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.000
AUDIENCE: Oh, so that's
time scale of the absolute?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.041
If you just ran on a
uni-processor for 20 seconds

00:16:26.041 --> 00:16:27.016
kind of a thing?

00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:29.944
MIKE FITZGERALD: Yeah, once
you're doing a million boards.

00:16:29.944 --> 00:16:33.263
And also, if you're on
the level of competing

00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:37.312
against really good competitors,
just having a deep search tree

00:16:37.312 --> 00:16:39.120
to get that much more
of an edge would make

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.260
a difference in that situation.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.760
Anyone else?

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.285
No?

00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:48.160
EDDIE SCHOLTZ: Great.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.660
Thanks.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.210
[APPLAUSE]
