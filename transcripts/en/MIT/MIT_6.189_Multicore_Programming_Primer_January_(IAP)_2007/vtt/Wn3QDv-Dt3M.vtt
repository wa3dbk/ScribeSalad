GUEST SPEAKER: That's it.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:23.148
SAMAN AMARASINGHE
(ON PHONE): I'm

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:24.645
sorry that I couldn't be there.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:25.643
Can you guys hear me?

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:26.513

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:28.138
SAMAN AMARASINGHE

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.633
sorry that I couldn't
be there in person.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:35.124
I'm in California
at this workshop,

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:37.619
and [INAUDIBLE] this panel.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:43.607
But you guys are doing a great
job, and I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:45.104
last meeting.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:50.094
I think this is important
to carry on [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:55.300
to as judges, and Steve,
and [? Ray ?] [? Fayan ?]

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.070
and everybody, thanks for
coming in and being judges.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.960
And I guess Roderick
will coordinate with them

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.690
to get the information, and
try to [INAUDIBLE] on there.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.587
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:07.962
SAMAN AMARASINGHE
(ON PHONE): OK.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:08.430
Good.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.370
GUEST SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.920
SAMAN AMARASINGHE (ON

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.740
and I have to run to
my conference now.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.490
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.418

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:14.834
SAMAN AMARASINGHE

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.952
GUEST SPEAKER: OK,
so tomorrow we'll

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.430
have class in the
regular classroom, 34301,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.870
same time, 10:00 to 12:00.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.530
There will be
course evaluations,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.734
so your change to tell
us how you actually

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:28.702
felt about the course,
and what you liked

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:30.178
and what you didn't like.

00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:33.622

ceremony for the winning team.

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:37.548
You will get some prizes,
and you'll get some cake.

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:40.536
And then that will take
us to around 11:00,

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:43.035
