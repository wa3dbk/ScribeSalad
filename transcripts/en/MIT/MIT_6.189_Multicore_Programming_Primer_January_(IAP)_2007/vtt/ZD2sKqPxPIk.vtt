00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.100
PROFESSOR: So, what I'll talk
about here is how to actually

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.120
understand the performance of
your application, and what are

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.860
some of the things you can do
to actually improve your

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.850
performance.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.690
You're going to hear more about
automated optimizations,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.810
compile the optimizations
on Monday.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.370
There will be two
talks on that.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.770
You'll get some cell-specific
optimizations that you can do,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.010
so some cell-specific tricks on
Tuesday in the recitation.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.460
So here, this is meant to be a
more general purpose talk on

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.810
how can you debug performance
anomalies and performance

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.920
problems. Then what are some
way that you can actually

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.840
improve the performance.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.410
Where do you look after you've
done your parallelization.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.680
So just to review the key
concepts to parallelism.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.285
Coverage -- how much parallelism
do you have in

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.000
your application.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.900
All of you know, because
you all had perfect

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.450
scores on the last quiz.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.550
So that means if you take a look
at your program, you find

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.200
the parallel parts and that
tells you how much parallelism

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.670
that you have. If you don't
have more than a certain

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760
fraction, there's really nothing
else you can do with

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.240
parallelism.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.420
So the rest of the talk will
help you address the question

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.980
of well, where do you go
for last frontier.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.260
The granularity.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.920
We talked about how the
granularity of your work and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.360
how much work are you doing on
each processor affects your

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.910
load balancing, and how it
actually affects your

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.580
communication costs.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.510
If you have a lot of things
colocate on a single

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.170
processor, then you don't have
to do a whole lot of

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.960
communication across processors,
but if you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.690
distribute things at a finer
level, then you're doing a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.980
whole lot of communication.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.990
So we'll look at the
communication costs again and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.450
some tricks that you can
apply to optimize that.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.360
Then the last thing that we had
talked about in one of the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.940
previous lectures is locality,
in locality of communication

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.570
versus computation, and both
of those are critical.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.720
So we'll have some
examples of that.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.292
So just to review the
communication cost model, so I

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:23.250
had flashed up on the screen a
while ago this equation that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.650
captures all the factors that
go into figuring out how

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.770
expensive is it to actually send
data from one processor

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.670
to the other.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.640
Or this could even apply on
a single machine where a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.760
processor is talking
to the memory --

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.330
you know, loads and stores.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.690
The same cost model really
applies there.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.490
If you look at how
processors --

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.580
a uniprocessor tries to improve
communication, and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.275
some of the things we've
mentioned really early on in

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:51.160
the course for improving
communication costs, what we

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.210
focused on is this overlap.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.010
There are things you can do,
for example, sending fewer

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.880
messages, optimizing how you're
packing data into your

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.450
messages, reducing the cost of
the network in terms of the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.710
latency, using architecture
support, increasing the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.620
bandwidth and so on.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.300
But really the biggest impact
that you can get is really

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.610
just from overlap because you
have direct control over that,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.490
especially in parallel
programming.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.690
So let's look at a small review
-- you know, what did

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.510
it mean to overlap.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.880
So we had some synchronization
point or some point in the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.300
execution and then
we get data.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.455
Then once the data's arrived,
we compute on that data.

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:33.710
So this could be
a uniprocessor.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.720
A CPU issues a load, it goes
out to memory, memory sends

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.100
back the data, and then the
CU can continue operating.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.160
But the uniprocessors
can pipeline.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.510
They allow you to have
multiple loads

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.180
going out to memory.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.330
So you can get the effect of
hiding over overlapping a lot

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.730
of that communication latency.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.800
But there are limits to the
communication, to the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.200
pipelining effects.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.435
If the work that you're doing is
really equal to the amount

00:04:03.435 --> 00:04:04.910
of data that you're
fetching, then you

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.930
have really good overlap.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.610
So we went over this in the
recitation and we showed you

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.720
an example of where pipelining
doesn't have any performance

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.560
effects and so you might not
want to do it because it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.730
doesn't give you the performance
bang for the

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.540
complexity you invest in it.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.830
So, if things are really nicely
matched you get good

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.630
overlap, here you only get god
overlap -- sorry, these, for

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.370
some reason, should be
shifted over one.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.010
So where else do you look
for performance?

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.350
So there are two kinds
of communication.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.280
There's inherent communication
and your algorithm, and this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.650
is a result of how you actually
partition your data

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.790
and how you partitioned
your computation.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.170
Then there's artifacts that come
up because of the way you

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.660
actually do the implementation
and how you map it to the

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.330
architecture.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.120
So, if you have poor
distribution of data across

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.150
memory, then you might
unnecessarily end up fetching

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.370
data that you don't need.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.370
So, you might also have
redundant data fetchers.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.100
So let's talk about that
in more detail.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.930
The way I'm going to do this
is to draw from wisdom in

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.340
uniprocessors.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.970
So in uniprocessors, CPUs
communicate with memory, and

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.290
really conceptually, I think
that's no different than

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.880
multiple processors talking
to multiple processors.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.190
It's really all about where the
data is flowing and how

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.710
the memories are structured.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.190
So, loads and stores are the
uniprocessor as what and what

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.500
are to distributed memory.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.080
So if you think of Cell, what
would go in those two blanks?

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.070
Can you get this?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.950
I heard the answer there.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.780
You get input.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.400
So, DMA get and DMA put.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.300
That's really just the
load and a store.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.960
It's just doing, instead of
loading one particular data

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.460
element, you're loading a
whole chunk of memory.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.950
So, on a uniprocessor, how do
you overlap communication?

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.210
Well, architecture, the memory
system is designed in a way to

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.630
exploit two properties that
have been observed in

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.600
computation.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.030
Spacial locality and temporal
locality, and I'll look at

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.640
each one separately.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.640
So in spacial locality,
CPU asks for a

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.840
data address of 1,000.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.650
What the memory does, it'll send
data address of 1,000,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.440
plus a whole bunch of other data
that's neighboring to it,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.290
so 1,000 to 1,064.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.010
Really, how much data you
actually send, you know, what

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:42.290
is the granularity of
communication depends on

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.430
architectural parameters.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.610
So in common architecture it's
really the block side.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.260
So if you have a cache where the
organization says you have

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.690
a block side to 32 words, 32
bytes, then this is how much

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.210
you transfer from main
memory to the caches.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.250
So this works well when the CPU
actually uses that data.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.530
If I send you 64 data bytes and
I only use one of them,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.490
then what have I done?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.880
I've wasted bandwidth.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.460
Plus, I need to store all that
extra data in the cache so

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.240
I've wasted my cache capacity.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.650
So that's bad and you
want to avoid it.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.290
Temporal locality is
a clustering of

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.650
references in time.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.470
So if you access some particular
data element, then

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.960
what the memory assumes is
you're going reuse that data

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.840
over and over and over again, so
it stores it in the cache.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.620
So your memory hierarchy has
the main memory at the top

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.780
level, and that's your
slowest memory

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.410
but the biggest capacity.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.790
Then as you get closer and
closer to the processor, you

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.460
end up with smaller caches --
these are local, smaller

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.380
storage, but they're faster.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.470
So, if you reuse a data element
then it gets cached at

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.770
the lowest data level, and so
the assumption there is that

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.580
you're gonna reuse it over
and over and over again.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.300
If you do that, then what
you've done is you've

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.210
amortized the cost of bringing
in that data over many, many

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.990
references.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.930
So that works out really well.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.160
But if you don't reuse that
particular data elements over

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.770
and over again, then you've
wasted cache capacity.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.280
You still need to fetch the data
because the CPU asks for

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.080
it, but you might not have had
the cache, so that would have

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.250
created more space in your cache
to have something else

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.350
in there that might have
been more useful.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.880
So in the multiprocessor case,
how do you reduce these

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.180
artifactual costs in
communication.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:32.750
So, DCMA gets inputs on the
cell, or just in just message

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.320
passing, you're exchanging
messages.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.460
Typically, you're communicating
over a course or

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.820
large blocks of data.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.490
What you're usually getting is
a continuous chunk of memory,

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.930
although you could do some
things in software or in

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.000
hardware to gather data from
different memory locations and

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.880
pack them into contiguous
locations.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.910
The reason you pack them into
contiguous locations again to

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.610
export spatial locality when
you store the data locally.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:03.440
So to exploit the spatial
locality characteristics, what

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.890
you want to make sure is that
you actually are going to have

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.320
good spatial locality in your
actual computation.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.130
So you want things that are
iterating over loops with

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.710
well-defined indices with
indices that go over very

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.010
short ranges, or they're very
sequential or have fixed

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.340
striped patterns where you're
not wasting a lot of the data

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.870
that you have brought in.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.730
Otherwise, you have to
essentially just increase your

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.540
communication because every
fetch is getting you only a

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.400
small fraction of what
you actually need.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.520
So, intuitively this
should make sense.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.470
Temporal locality just says I
brought in some data and so I

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.350
want to maximize this utility.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.520
So if I have any computation in
a parallel system, I might

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.910
be able to reorder my tasks in
a way that I have explicit

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:45.930
control over the scheduling --
which stripe executes when.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.270
Then you want to make sure that
all the computation that

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.470
needs that particular data
happens adjacent in time or in

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.830
some short time window so that
you can amortize the cost.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.860
Are those two concepts clear?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.110
Any questions on this?

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.880
So, you've done all of that.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.600
You've parallelized your code,
you've taken care of your

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.270
communication costs, you've
tried to reduce

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.360
it as much as possible.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.560
Where else can you look for
performance -- things just

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.140
don't look like they're
performing as

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.690
well as they could?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.550
So, the last frontier is
perhaps single thread

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.380
performance, so I'm going
to talk about that.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.160
So what is really
a single thread.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.770
So if you think of what you're
doing with parallel

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.340
programming, you're taking a
bunch of tasks -- this is the

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.750
work that you have to do -- and
you group them together

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.800
into threads or the equivalent
of threads, and some threads

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.340
will run on individual cores.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.790
So essentially you have one
thread running on a core, and

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.570
if that performance goes fast,
then your overall execution

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.960
can also benefit from that.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.310
So, that's single thread
performance.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.920
So if you look at a timeline,
here you have sequential code

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.360
going on, then we hit some
parallel part of the

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.350
computation.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.260
We have multiple executions
going on.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.430
Each one of these is a
thread of execution.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.380
Really, my finish line depends
on who's the longest thread,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.640
who's the slowest one to
complete, and that's going to

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.300
essentially control
my speed up.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.620
So I can improve this by doing
better load balancing.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.250
If I distribute the
work [? so that ?]

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.980
everybody's doing equivalent
amount of work, then I can

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.630
shift that finish line
earlier in time.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.990
That can work reasonably well.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.920
So we talked about load
balancing before.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.620
We can also make execution
on each processor faster.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.630
If each one of these threads
finishes faster or I've done

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.800
the load balancing and now I
can even squeeze out more

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.410
performance by shrinking each
one of those lines, then I can

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.460
get performance improvement
there as well.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.280
So that's improving single
thread performance.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.140
But how do we actually
understand what's going on?

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.360
How do I know where
to optimize?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.800
How do I know how long each
thread is taking?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.020
How do I know how long
my program is taking?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.090
Where are the problems?

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.750
So, there are performance
monitoring tools that hard

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.840
designed to help you do that.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.290
So what's the most
coarse-grained way of figuring

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.020
out how long your
program took?

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.090
You have some sample piece of
code shown over here, you

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.790
might compile it, and then you
might just use time --

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.790
standard units command say run
this program and tell me how

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.320
much time it took to run.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.670
So you get some alpha back from
time that said you took

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.210
about two seconds of user time,
this is actual code, you

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:27.700
took some small amount of time
in system code, and this is

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.910
your overall execution, this is
how much of the processor

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.610
you actually use.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.870
So, a 95% utilization.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.600
Then you might apply
some optimization.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.430
So here we'll use the compiler,
we'll change the

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.290
optimization level, compile
the same code, run it, and

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.270
we'll see wow, performance
improved.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.420
So we increased 99% utilization,
my running time

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.180
went down by a small chunk.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.940
But did we really learn
anything about

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.100
what's going on here?

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.600
There's some code going on,
there's a loop here, there's a

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.650
loop here, there's some
functions with more loops.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.300
So where is the actual
computation time going?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.550
So how would I actually go
about understanding this?

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.060
So what are some tricks you
might have used in trying to

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.200
figure out how long something
took in your computation?

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:17.690
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.700
So you might have a timer, you
record the time here, you

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.590
compute and then you stop the
timer and then you might

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.230
printout or record how
long that particular

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.960
block of code took.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.370
Then you might have a histogram
of them and then you

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.350
might analyze the histogram to
find out the distribution.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.810
You might repeat this over and
over again for many different

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.180
loops or many different
parts that are code.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.320
If you have a preconceived
notion of where the problem is

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.160
then you instrument that
and see if your

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.540
hypothesis is correct.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:49.880
That can help you identify the
problems. But increasingly you

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.340
can actually get more accurate
measurements.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.770
So, in the previous routine,
you're using the time, you

00:13:54.770 --> 00:14:01.490
were looking at how much time
has elapsed in seconds or in

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.760
small increments.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.920
But you can actually use
hardware counters today to

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.620
actually measure clock
cycles, clock ticks.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.710
That might be more useful.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.630
Actually, it's more useful
because you can measure a lot

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.100
more events than just
clock ticks.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.840
The counters in modern
architectures are really

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.890
specialized registers that count
up events and then you

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.890
can go in there and probe and
ask what is the value in this

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.400
register, and you can
use that as part of

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.160
your performance tuning.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.070
You use them much in the same
way as you would have done to

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:37.260
start a regular timer or
stop a regular timer.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.340
There are specialized
libraries that run.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.330
Unfortunately, these are very

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.760
architecture-specific at this point.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.940
There's not really a common
standard that says grab a

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.990
timer at each different
architecture in a uniform way,

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.760
although that's getting
better with some

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.570
standards coming out from--.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.870
I'll talk about that in
just a few slides.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.650
You can use this to, for
example, measure your

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.360
communication to computation
cost. So you can wrap your DMA

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.710
get and DMA put by timer calls,
and you can measure

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.880
your actual work by timer calls,
and figuring out how

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.320
much overlap can you get from
overlap in communication and

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.960
communication computation and
is that really worthwhile to

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.850
do pipelining.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.120
But this really requires
manual changes to code.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.490
You have to go in there
and start the timers.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.320
You have to have maybe an idea
of where the problem is, and

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.780
you have the Heisenberg
effect.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.370
If you have a loop and you want
to measure code within

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.910
the loop because you have a
nested loop inside of that,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.420
then now you're effecting the
performance of the outer loop.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.100
That can be problematic.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.110
So it has a better effect
because you can't really make

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.320
an accurate measurement on the
thing you're inspecting.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.100
So there's a slightly better
approach, dynamic profiling.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.030
Dynamic profiling is really
there's an event-based

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.750
profiling and time-based
profiling.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.530
Conceptually they do
the same thing.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.840
What's going on here is your
program is running and you're

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.050
going to say I'm interested in
events such as cache misses.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.160
Whenever n number of cache
misses happen, let's say

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.830
1,000, let me know.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.800
So you get an interrupt
whenever 1,000

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.860
cache misses happen.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.290
Then you can update a counter
or use that to trigger some

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.940
optimizations or analysis.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.120
This works really nicely because
you don't have to

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.820
touch your code.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.680
You essentially run your program
as you normally do

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.380
with just one modification
that includes running the

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.070
dynamic profiler, as well as
your actual computation.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.610
As far as multiple languages
because all it does is just

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.750
takes your binary so you can
program in any language, any

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.940
programming model.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.520
It's quite efficient to actually
use these dynamic

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.990
profiling tools.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.770
The sampling frequencies are
reasonably small, you can make

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.950
them reasonably small and still
have it be efficient.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.010
So some counter examples.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.350
Clock cycles, so you can
measure clock ticks.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.190
Pipeline stalls.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.660
This might be interesting if
you want to optimize your

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.310
instruction schedule -- you'll
actually see this in the

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.340
recitation next week.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.560
Cache hits, cache misses -- you
can get an idea of how bad

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.820
your cache performance is and
how much time you're spending

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:08.970
in the memory system.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.420
Number of instructions, loads,
stores, floating

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.230
point ops and so on.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.670
Then you can derive some useful
measures from that.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.730
So I can get an idea of
processor utilization --

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.850
divide cycles by time and that
gives me utilization.

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.200
I can derive some other things
and maybe some of the more

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.350
interesting things like
memory of traffic.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.900
So how much data am I actually
sending between a CPU and a

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.480
processor, or how much data am
I communicating from one

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.560
processor to the other.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.000
So I can just grab the counters
for number of loads

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.500
and number of stores, figure out
what the cache line size

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.440
is -- usually those are
documented or there are

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.214
calibration tools you can run
to get that value, and you

00:17:45.214 --> 00:17:46.860
figure out memory of traffic.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.740
Another one would be
bandwidth consumed.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.860
So bandwidth is memory of
traffic per second.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.110
So how would you measure that?

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:59.770
It's just the traffic divided
by the wall clock time.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.480
There's some others that
you can calculate.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.200
So these can be really useful
in helping you figure out

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.890
where are the things you
should go focus in on.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.220
I'm going to show you
some examples.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.810
The way these tools work is
you have your application

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.320
source code, you compile
it down to a binary.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.290
You take your binary and you
run it, and then that can

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.200
generate some profile that
stores locally on your disk.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.800
Then you can take that profile
and analyze it by some sort of

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.920
interpreter, and some cases you
can actually analyze the

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.340
binary as well, and reannotate
your source code.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.390
That can actually be very useful
because it'll tell you

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.640
this particular line of your
code is the one where you're

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.780
spending most of your
time computing.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.860
So some tools -- have any
of you used these tools?

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.320
Anybody use Gprof,
for example?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.520
Good.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.790
So, you might have an idea of
how these could be used.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.870
There are others.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.740
HPCToolkit, which I commonly
use from Rice.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.820
Pappy is very common because it
has a very nice interface

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.430
for grabbing all kinds
of counters.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.010
VTune from Intel, and there's
others that work in different

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.070
ways and so there are binary
instrumenters that do the same

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.900
things and do it slightly more
efficiently and actually give

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.350
you the ability to compile
your code at run time and

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.230
optimize it, taking advantage
of the profiling information

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.570
you've collected.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.670
So here's a sample
of running Gprof.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:23.670
Gprof should be available on
any Linux system, it's even

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.080
available on Cygwin,
if you see Cygwin.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.350
I've compiled some code --
this is MPEG 2D code, a

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:31.530
reference implementation.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.950
I specify some parameters
to run it.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.830
Here I add this dash Rflag which
says use a particular

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.010
kind of inverse DCDT that's a
floating point precise that

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.920
uses double precision for
the floating point

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.640
computations in DCT --

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.210
inverse DCT rather.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.890
So you can see actually where
most of the time is being

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.380
spent in the computation.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.270
So here's a time per function,
so each row

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:59.020
represents a function.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:05.860
So this is the percent of the
time, this is the actual time

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.450
in seconds, how many times I
actually called this function,

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.800
and some other useful things.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.920
So the second function that's
used here that happens is MPEG

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.770
intrablock decoding and here
you're doing some spatial

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.730
decomposition, restoring
spatial pictures by 5%.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.340
So if you were optimize this
particular code, where would

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.590
you go look?

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.950
You would look in the
reference DCT.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.900
So, MPEG has two versions
of DCT --

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.450
one that uses floating point,
another that just uses some

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.240
numerical tricks to operate over
integers for a loss of

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.780
precision, but they find that
acceptable as part of this

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.670
application.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.640
So you omit the Rflag, it
actually uses a different

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.760
function for doing the DCT.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.330
Now you see the distribution of
where the time is spent in

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.780
your computation changes.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.100
Now there's a new function
that's become the bottleneck

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.810
and it's called Form Component
Prediction.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.550
Then IDCT column, which
actually is the main

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.390
replacement of the previous
code, this one, is now about

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.250
1/3 of the actual computation.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.090
So, this could be useful because
you can Gprof your

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.700
application, figure out where
the bottlenecks are in terms

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.680
of performance, and you might
go in there and tweak the

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.030
algorithm completely.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.260
You might go in there and sort
of look at some problems that

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.120
might be implementation bugs
or performance bugs and be

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.580
able to fix those.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.150
Any questions on that?

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.340
You can do sort of more
accurate things.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.420
So, Gprof largely uses one
mechanism, HPCToolkit uses the

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.950
performance counters to actually
give you more finer

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.810
grade measurements
if you want them.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:53.340
So, in the HPCToolkit, you run
your program in the same way.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.130
You have MPEG 2D code, dash dash
just says this is where

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.740
the parameters are to impact
2D code following that dash

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.290
dash, and you can add some
parameters in there that say

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.450
these are counters I'm
interested in measuring.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.160
So the first one is
total cycles.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:13.180
The second one is the L1, so
primary cache load misses.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.850
Then you might want to count
the floating point

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.110
instructions and the
total instructions.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.490
As you run your program you
actually get a profiling

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.290
output, and then you can process
that file and it'll

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.220
spit out some summaries
for you.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.920
So it'll tell you this is the
total number of cycles, 698

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.580
samples with this frequency.

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.930
So if you multiply the two
together, you an idea of how

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.590
many cycles your computation
took.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.230
How many load misses?

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.910
So it's 27 samples at
this frequency.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.040
So remember what's going on
here is the counter is

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.510
measuring events, and when the
event reaches a particular

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.980
threshold it let's you know.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:52.170
So here the sampling threshold
is 32,000.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.960
So whenever 32,000 floating
point instructions occur you

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.880
get a sample.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.745
So you're just counting how many
interrupts you're getting

00:22:57.745 --> 00:22:58.810
or how many samples.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.140
So you multiply the two
together you can

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.770
get the final counts.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.270
It can do things like Gprof,
it'll tell you where your time

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.580
is and where you spent
most of your time.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.230
Actually breaks it down
into your module.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.620
So, MPEG calls some standard
libraries, libsi.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.400
I could break it down by
functions, break it down by

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.920
line number.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.800
You can even annotate
your source code.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.510
So here's just a simple example
that I used earlier,

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.960
and each one of these columns
represent one of the metrics

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.110
that we measured, and you can
see most of my time is spent

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.460
here, 36% at this particular
statement.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.640
So that can be very useful.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.280
You can go in there and
say, I want to do some

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.710
[? dization ?], I can maybe
reduce this overhead in some

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.330
way to get better performance.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.210
Any questions on that?

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:48.520
Yup.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.460
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.070
Unfortunately, I don't know
the answer to that.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.450
There's some nice gooies for
some of these tools.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.620
So VTune has a nice interface.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.530
I use HPCViewer.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.670
I use HPCToolkit, which provides
HPCViewer, so I just

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:14.200
grab the screenshot from one
of the tutorials on this.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.960
You have your source code.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.830
It shows you some of the same
information I had on a

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.950
previous slide, but in a
nicer graphical format.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:27.710
So, now I have all this
information, how do I actually

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.460
improve the performance?

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.375
Well, if you look at what is
the performance time on a

00:24:32.375 --> 00:24:36.120
uniprocessor, it's time spent
computing plus the time spent

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.090
waiting for data or
waiting for some

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.580
other things to complete.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.360
You have instructional level
parallels, which is really

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.100
critical for uniprocessors,
and architect that sort of

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.060
spent massive amounts of effort
in providing multiple

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.570
functional units,
deeply pipeline

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.900
the instruction pipeline.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.440
Doing things like speculation,
prediction to keep that

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.070
instructional level of
parallelism number high so you

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.260
can get really good
performance.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.630
You can do things like looking
at the assembly code and

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.230
re-ordering instructions to
avoid instruction hazards in

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.360
the pipeline.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.500
You might look at a register
allocation.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.510
But that's really very
low-hanging fruit.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:17.910
You have to reach really high
to grab that kind of fruit.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.520
You'll actually, unfortunately,
get the

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.670
experience that is part of
the next recitation.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.020
So apologies in advance.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.710
But you'll see that --
well I'm not going

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:26.550
to talk about that.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.460
Instead I'm going to focus about
some things that are

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.220
perhaps lower-hanging fruit.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.430
So data level parallelism.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.925
So we've used SIMD in
some of recitations.

00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:38.080
I'm giving you a short
example of that.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.190
Here, I'm going to talk about
how you actually get data

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.670
level parallelism or how do you
actually find the SIMD in

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:48.520
your computation so you can
get that added advantage.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.650
Some nice things about data
level parallelism in the form

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.290
of short vector instructions
is that the harder really

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.080
becomes simpler.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.660
You issue one instruction and
that same instruction operates

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.520
over multiple data elements
and you get

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.620
better instruction bandwidth.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.960
I just have to fetch one
instruction and if my vector

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.000
lens is 10, than that
effectively does 10

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.280
instructions for me.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.000
The architecture can get
simpler, reduces the

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.880
complexity.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.880
So it has some nice
advantages.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.470
The thing to go after is
the memory hierarchy.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.270
This is because of that speed
gap that we showed earlier on

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.020
in the course between memory
speed and processor speed, and

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.180
if you optimize a performance
usually it's like 1%

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.610
performance and your cache
registry gives you some

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.590
significant performance
improvement in

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.600
your overall execution.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.230
So you want to go after that
because that's the biggest

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.480
beast in the room.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.230
A brief overview of SIMD and
then some detailed examples as

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.740
to how you actually go about
extracting short vector

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.520
instructions.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.700
So, here we have an example
of scaleacode.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.920
We're iterating in a loop from
zero to n, and we're just

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.330
adding some array elements a to
b and storing results in c.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.262
So in the scaler mode, we just
have one add, each value of a

00:27:08.262 --> 00:27:09.610
and b is one register.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.090
We add those together,
we write the value

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.090
to a separate register.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.420
In the vector mode, we can pack
multiple data elements,

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.100
so here let's assume our vector
lens is four, I can

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.420
pack four of these data values
into one vector register.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.510
You can pack four of these data
elements into another

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.010
vector register, and now my
single vector instruction has

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.380
the effect of doing four ads
at th same time, and it can

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:36.940
store results into four
elements of c.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.660
Any questions on that?

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.106
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.310
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.560
We'll get to that.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:54.390
So, let's look at those to sort
of give you a more lower

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.030
level feel for this.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.270
Same code, I've just shown
data dependence graph.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:04.610
I've omitted things like the
increment of the loop and the

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.300
branch, just focusing on
the main computation.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.890
So I have two loads, one brings
a sub i, the other

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.040
brings b sub i.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.860
I do the add and I get c sub i
and then I can store that.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.490
So that might be sort of a
generic op code sequence that

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:21.540
you have. If you're scheduling
that, then in the first slot I

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.840
can do those two loads in
parallel, second cycle I can

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.160
do the add, third cycle
I can do the store.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.320
I can further improve
this performance.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.410
If you took 6.035 you might see
software pipelining, you

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.280
can actually overlap some
of these operations.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.750
Not really that important
here.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.970
So, what would the cycle or the
schedule look like on a

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.670
cycle-by-cycle basis if this
was defector output?

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.600
In the scaler case, you have
n iterations, right?

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.570
Each iteration's taking three
cycles so that's your overall

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:58.770
execution on time --
n times 3 cycles.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.560
In the vector case, each load
is bringing you four data

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:07.550
elements, so a sub i
to a sub i plus 3.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.000
Similarly for b.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.470
Then you add those together.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.060
So the schedule would look
essentially the same.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.210
The op codes are different,
and here what your overall

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.310
execution time be?

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.530
Well, what I've done is each
iteration is now doing four

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.700
additions for me.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:27.630
So if you notice, the loop
bounds have changed.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.400
Instead of going from i to n
by increments of 1, now I'm

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.300
going by increments of 4.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.940
So, overall, instead of having
n iterations, I can get by

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.810
with n over 4 iterations.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.300
That make sense?

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.110
So, what would my speed
up be in this case?

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
4.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.990
So you can get more and more
speed up if your vector lens

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.860
is longer, because then I can
cut down on the number of

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.310
iterations that I need.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.270
Depending on the length of my
vector register and the data

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:09.920
types that I have, that
effectively gives me different

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.380
kinds of vector lens for
different data types.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.860
So you saw on Cell you have 128
bit registers and you can

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.110
pack those with bytes,
characters, bytes, shorts,

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.700
integers, floats or doubles.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.890
So each one of those gives you
different kinds of a different

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.140
vector lens.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.990
SIMD is really now, SIMD
extensions are

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.690
increasingly popular.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:34.990
They're available on
a lot of ISAs.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.080
Alt of x, MMX, SSE
are available

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.900
on a lot x86 machines.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.930
And, of course, in Cell, in
fact, on the SPU, all your

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.000
instructions are SIMD
instruction, and when you're

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.930
doing a scaler instruction,
you're actually using just one

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:56.310
chunk of your vector register
and your vector pipeline.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.000
So how do you actually use
these SIMD instructions?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.190
Unfortunately, it's library
calls or using inline assembly

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.760
or using intrinsics.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.240
You'll get hands-on experience
with this with Cell, so you

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.090
might complain about that
when you actually do it.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.860
Compile technology is actually
getting better, and you'll see

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:21.050
that one of the reasons we're
using an XLC compiler is

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:25.320
because it has these vector data
types, which also latest

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.170
versions of GCC have that allow
you to express data

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.740
types as vector data types,
and the compiler can more

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.580
easily or more naturally get the
parallelism for you, SIMD

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.640
parallelism with you having to
go in there and do it by hand.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.110
But if you were to do it by
hand, or, in fact, what the

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.600
compilers are trying to
automate are different

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.730
techniques for looking for where
the SIMD parallelism is.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.000
There was some work done here
about six years ago by Sam

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.300
Larson, who is now graduated,
on super word level

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:57.910
parallelism.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.970
so I'm going to focus the rest
of this talk on this concept

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.170
of SIMDization because I think
it's probably the one that's

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.720
most useful for extracting
parallelism in some of the

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.680
codes that you're doing.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.150
So this is really ideal for
SIMD where you have really

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.210
short vector lens, 2 to 8.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.750
What you're looking for is
SIMDization that exists within

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.550
a basic block.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.780
So within a code block, within
a body of a loop or within

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.790
some control flow even.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.910
You can uncover this with simple
analysis, and this

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.470
really has pushed the boundary
on what automatic

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.280
compilers can do.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.870
Some of work that's gone on
at IMB, what they call the

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.980
octipiler, has eventually been
transferred to the XLC

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.170
compiler do a lot of defecniques
that build on SLP

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:46.090
and expand in various ways to
broaden the scope of what you

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.680
can automatically parallize.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.200
So here's an example of how
you might actually derive

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.120
SIMDization or opportunities
for SIMDization.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.280
So you have some code, let's
say you're doing RGB

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:03.190
computations where you're just
adding the r elements, that's

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.820
a red, green and blue.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.630
So this might be in a loop, and
what you might notice it

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.410
well I can pack the RGB elements
into one register.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:16.190
I can pack these into another
register, and I can pack these

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.630
literals into a third
register.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.220
So that gives me a way to pack
data together into SIMD

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:29.150
registers, and now I can replace
this scaler code with

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.570
instructions that pack
the vector register.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.160
I can do the computations
in parallel and

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.420
I can unpack them.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.050
We'll talk about that with a
little bit more illustration

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:37.730
in a second.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:38.980
Any questions on this?

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.560
Perhaps the biggest improvement
that you can get

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.520
from SIMDization is by looking
at adjacent memory references.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.260
Rather than doing one load you
can do a vector load, which

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:55.230
really gives you a bigger
bandwidth to memory.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:34:00.580
So in this case, I have a load
from I1, I2, and since these

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.750
memory locations are continuous,
I can replace them

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.530
by one vector load that brings
in all these data

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.320
elements in one shot.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.540
That essentially eliminates
three load instructions, which

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:17.210
are potentially most heavy
weight for one ligher weight

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:20.450
instruction because it amortizes
bandwidth and

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:21.700
exploits things like
spatial locality.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.530
Another one, vectorizable
loops.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.870
So this is probably one of
the most advanced ways of

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.200
exploiting SIMDization,
especially in really long

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.290
vector codes, so traditional
supercomputers like the Cray,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.370
and you'll probably hear Simmon
talk about this in the

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.590
next lecture.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.090
So I have some loop
and I hvae this

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.540
particular statement here.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:46.730
So how can I get SIMD
code out of this?

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.980
Anybody have any ideas?

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.080
Anybody know about
loop unrolling?

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.170
So if I unroll this loop, I
essentially -- that same trick

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.900
that I had shown earlier,
although I didn't

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:12.680
quite do it this way.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.440
I change a loop bound
from n to --

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.600
the increment from -- rather
than stepping through one at a

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:20.590
time, stepping through
four at a time.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:25.190
Now the loop body, rather than
doing one addition at a time,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.120
I'm doing four additions
at a time.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.770
So now this is very natural for
a vectorization, right?

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.410
Vector load, vector load, vector
store plus the vector

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.520
add in the middle.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.770
Is that intuitive?

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.320
So this gives you another way
of extracting parallelism.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.010
Looking at traditional loops,
seeing whether you can

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.510
actually unroll it in different
ways, be able to get

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.920
that SIMD parallelization.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.210
The last one I'll talk about
is about partial

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.400
vectorization.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.390
Either it might be some things
where you have a mix of

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:58.130
statements.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.890
So here I have a loop where I
have some load and then I'm

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.210
doing some computation here.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.460
So what could I do here?

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.260
It's not as symmetric
as the other loop.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:18.200
AUDIENCE: There's no vector
and [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.530
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:19.600
So you might omit that.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.580
But could you do anything
about the subtraction?

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.990
PROFESSOR: If I can unroll
this again, right?

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.680
Now there's no dependencies
between this instruction and

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.210
this instruction, so I can
really move these together,

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.580
and once I've moved these
together then these loads

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.170
become contiguous.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.790
These loads are contiguous so I
can replace these by vector

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.640
codes, vector equivalents.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:48.210
So now the vector load bring
in L0, L1, I have the

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:52.800
addition, that brings in those
two elements in a vector, and

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.960
then I can do my scaler
additions.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:59.300
But what do I do about the
value getting out of this

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.890
vector register into this scaler
register that I need

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.400
for the absolute values.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.740
So this is where the benefits
versus cost of

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.210
SIMDization come in.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.330
So the benefits are great
because you can replace

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.460
multiple instructions by one
instruction, or you can just

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.250
cut down the number of
instructions by specific

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:19.920
factor, your vector lens.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.400
Low stores can be replaced by
one wide memory operation, and

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.210
this is probably the biggest
opportunity for performance

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.800
improvements.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.300
But the cost is that you have
to pack data into the data

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.700
registers an you have to unpack
it out so that you can

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.460
have those kinds of
communications between this

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.430
vector register here and the
value here, this value here

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:41.400
and this value here.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.210
Often you can't simply access
vector values without doing

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.460
this packing and unpacking.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:55.450
So how do you actually do
the packing, unpacking?

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.880
This is predominantly where a
lot of the complexity goes.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.493
So the value of a here is
initialized by some function

00:38:06.493 --> 00:38:09.140
and the value of b here is
initialized by some function,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.200
and these might not be
things that I can

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.740
SIMdize very easily.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.480
So what I need to do is move
that value into the first

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.180
element of vector register, and
move the second value into

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.800
the second element of
the vector register.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.470
So if I have a four-way vector
register, then I have to do

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:27.790
four of these moves, and that
essentially is the packing.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.590
Then I could do my vector
computation, which is really

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.940
these two statements here.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.750
Then eventually I have to do my
unpacking because I have to

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.960
get the values out to do this
operation and this operation.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.180
So there's an extraction
that has to happen

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.430
out of my SIMD register.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.980
But you can amortize the cost
of the packing and unpacking

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.560
by just reusing your
vector registers.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.490
So these are like register
allocation techniques.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.960
So if I pack things into a
vector register, I find all

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.890
cases where I can actually reuse
that vector register and

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.490
I try to find opportunities
for extra SIMDization.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:08.120
So in the other case then, I
pack one then I can reuse that

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.320
same vector register.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.690
So what are some ways I can look
for to amortize the cost?

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.700
The interesting thing about
memory operations is while

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.950
there are many different ways
you can pack scaler values

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.700
into a vector register, there's
really only one way

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:28.380
you can pack loads coming in
from memory into a vector

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.290
register is because you want
the loads to be sequential,

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:33.340
you want to exploit the
spatial locality.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.130
So one vector load really gives
you specific ordering.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:40.140
So, that really constrains
you in various ways.

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.180
So you might bend over backwards
in some cases to

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.350
actually get your code to
be able to you reuse the

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.090
wide-word load without having
to do too much packing or

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:50.870
unpacking because that'll start

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.520
eating into your benefits.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:40:00.900
So simple example of how
you might find the SLP

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:02.740
parallelism.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.850
So the first thing you want to
do is start with are the

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:08.740
instructions that give you the
most benefit, so it's memory

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.860
references.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.840
So here there are two
memory references.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.680
They happen to be adjacent, so
I'm accessing a contiguous

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.930
memory chunks, so I can
parallelized that.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:20.540
That would be my first step.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.580
I can do a vector load and
that assignment can

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.880
become a and b.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.730
I can look for opportunities
where I can propagate this

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:34.250
vector values within the
vector register that's

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:35.840
holding a and b.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.980
So the way I do that is I look
for uses of a and b.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.960
In this case, there are
these two statements.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.440
So I can look for opportunities

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.690
to vectorize that.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.030
So in this case, both of these
instructions are also

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.960
vectorizable.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.990
Now I have a vector subtraction,
and I have a

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.680
vector register holding
new values h and j.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:08.200
So I follow that chain again
of where data's flowing.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.170
I find these operations and I
can vectorize that as well.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.860
So, sign up with a vectorizable
loop where all my

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.520
instructions, all my scale
instructions are now in SIMD

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.820
instructions.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.000
I can cut down on loop
iterations of total number of

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.220
instructions that I issue.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.650
But I've made some implicit
assumption here.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.020
Anybody know what it is?

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:42.538
AUDIENCE: Do you actually
need that many

00:41:42.538 --> 00:41:44.580
iterations of the loop?

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.680
PROFESSOR: Well, so you can
factor down the cost. so here

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.830
I've vectorized by 2, so I would
cut down the number of

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:50.590
iterations by 2.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.830
AUDIENCE: You could have an
odd number of iterations?

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.190
PROFESSOR: Right, so you could
have an odd number of

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.110
iterations.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.400
What do you do about the
remaining iterations.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.760
You might have to do scaler
code for that.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.260
What are some other
assumptions?

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:04.660
Maybe it will be clear here.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.160
So in vectorizing this, what
have I assumed about

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.040
relationships between
these statements?

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.690
I've essentially reorganized
all the statements so that

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.520
assumes I have this liberty to
move instructions around.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:19.810
Yup?

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.801
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
a and b don't change

00:42:22.801 --> 00:42:23.300
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:23.790
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:27.830
So there's nothing in here
that's changing the values.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.930
There's no dependencies between
these statements -- no

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.910
flow dependencies and no other
kind of constraints that limit

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.930
this kind of movement.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.800
So in real code it's not
actually the case.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.150
You end up with patterns of
computation where you can get

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.710
really a nice case of classic
cases you can vectorize those

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.840
really nicely.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.020
In a lot of other codes you
have a mix of vectorizable

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.520
code and scaler code and there's
a lot of communication

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.380
between the two.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.090
So the cost is really something
significant that you

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.340
have to consider.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.780
This was, as I mentioned, done
in somebody's Masters thesis

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.960
and eventually led to some
additional work that was his

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.770
PhD thesis.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:09.370
So in some of the early work,
what he did was he looked at a

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.470
bunch of benchmarks and looked
at how much available

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:15.960
parallelism you have in terms
of this kind of short vector

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.260
parallelism, or rather SLP
where you're looking for

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.830
vectorizable code within basic
blocks, which really differed

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.100
from a classic way of people
looking for vectorization.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:27.950
[? And you ?] have
well-structured loops and

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:32.120
doing kinds of transformations
you'll hear about next week.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.240
So for different kinds of vector
registers, so these are

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.010
your vector lens.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:41.470
So going from 128 bits to 1,024
bits, you can actually

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.330
reduce a whole lot
of instructions.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.380
So what I'm showing here
is the percent dynamic

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.420
instruction reduction.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.795
So if I take my baseline
application and just compile

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:53.670
it in a normal way and I run it
again an instruction count.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.175
I apply this SLP technique that
find the SIMDization and

00:43:57.175 --> 00:43:59.500
then run my application again,
use the performance counters

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.110
to count the number
of instructions

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.450
and compare the two.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:07.020
I can get 60%, 50%, 40%.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:11.700
In some cases I can completely
eliminate almost 90% or more

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.660
of the instructions.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.410
So it's a lot of opportunity for
performance improvements

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.410
that might be apparent.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.130
One because I'm reducing the
instruction bandwidth, I'm

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.370
reducing the amount of space I
need in my instruction cache,

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.590
I have fewer instructions so I
can fit more instructions into

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.190
my instruction cache, you reduce
the number of branches.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.870
You get better bandwidth to the
memory, better use of the

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.080
memory bandwidth.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.250
Overall, you're running fewer
iterations, so you're getting

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.050
lots of potential
for performance.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.350
So, I actually ran this
on the AltiVec.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.710
This was one of the earliest
generations of AltiVec, which

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:57.100
SIMD instructions didn't have
I believe double precision

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.420
floating point, so not all the
benchmarks you see on the

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:02.470
previsou slide are here, only
the ones that could run

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.120
reasonably accurately
with a single

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.590
precision floating point.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.240
What they measure is the
actual speed up.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.810
Doing this SIMDization versus
not doing a SIMDization, how

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:12.470
much performance you can get.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:17.550
The thing to take away is in
some cases where you have

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.260
nicely structured loops and some
nice patterns, you can

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.250
get up to 7x speed up
on some benchmarks.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.020
What might be the maximum speed
up that you can get

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:31.210
depends on the vector lens,
so 8, for example on some

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.170
architectures depending
on the data type.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.500
Is there any questions
on that?

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.530
So as part of the next
recitation, you'll actually

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.000
get an exercise of going through
and SIMDizing for

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.300
Cell, and whether that actually
means SIMDize

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.990
instructions for Cell might take
statements and sort of

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:50.320
replace them by intrinsic
functions, which eventually

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.630
map down to actually assembly
op codes that you'll need.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.940
So you don't actually have to
program at the assembly level,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.080
although in effect, you're
probably doing the same thing.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.040
Last thing we'll talk about
today is optimizing for the

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:05.110
memeory hierarchy.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.950
In addition to data level
parallelism, looking for

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.250
performance enhancements in the
memory system gives you

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:19.250
the best opportunities because
of this big gap in performance

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:23.800
between memory access latencies
and what the CPU

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.840
efficiency is.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.380
So exploiting locality in
a memroy system is key.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:30.940
So these concepts of temporal
and spatial locality.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.770
So let's look at an example.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:37.870
Let's say I have a loop and in
this loop I have some code

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.440
that's embodied in some function
a, some code embodied

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.660
in some function b, and some
code in some function c.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.720
The values produced by a are
consumed by the function b,

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.280
and similarly the values
consumed by b

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.880
are consumed by c.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.040
So this is a general data flow
graph that you might have for

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.590
this function.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:03.240
Let's say that all the data
could go into a small array

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.870
that then I can communicate
between functions.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.500
So if I look at my actual cache
size and how the working

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:15.400
set of each of these functions
is, so let's say this is my

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.260
cache size -- this is how
many instructions I can

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.390
pack into the cache.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:22.490
Looking at the collective number
of instructions in each

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:25.990
one of these functions,
I overflow that.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:27.810
I have more instructions
I can fit into my

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.130
cache any one time.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.890
So what does that mean for my
actual cash performance?

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:38.490
So when I run a, what do I
expect the cache hit and miss

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:40.670
rate behavior to be like?

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:45.830
So in the first iteration, I
need the instructions for a.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.210
I've never seen a before so I
have to fetch that data from

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.840
memory and put in the cache.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.320
So, the attachments.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.570
So what about b?

00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.310
Then c?

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:00.420
Same thing.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:03.920
So now I'm back at the
top of my loop.

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.250
So if everything fit in
the cache then I would

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.230
expect a to be a what?

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:11.320
You'll be a hit.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.900
But since I've constrained this
problem such that the

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.220
working set doesn't really fit
in the cache, what that means

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.690
is that I have to fetch some
new instructions for a.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.960
So let's say I have
to fetch all the

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.460
instructions for a again.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.590
That leads me to another miss.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:29.610
Now, bringing a again into my
cache kicks out some extra

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:32.100
instructions because I need to
make room in a finite memory

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:35.090
so I kick out b.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.120
Bring in b and I end
up kicking out c.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.530
So you end up with a pattern
where everything is a miss.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.740
This is a problem because the
way the loop is structured,

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.025
collectively I just can't pack
all those instructions into

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:52.760
the cache, so I end up taking
a lot of cache misses and

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.030
that's bad for performance.

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:56.690
But I can look at an
alternative way

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.710
of doing this loop.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.960
I can split up this loop into
three where in one loop I do

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.300
all the a instructions, in the
second loop I do all the b's,

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.260
and the third loop
I do all the c's.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.830
Now my working set
is really small.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:16.020
So the instructions for a fit in
the cache, instructions for

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.460
b fit in the cache, and
instructions for

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.670
c fit in the cache.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:24.330
So what do I expect for the
first time I see a?

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:25.110
Miss.

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:26.360
Then second time?

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:36.730
It'll be hit, because I've
brought in a, I haven't run b

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:40.150
or c yet, the number of
instructions I need for a is

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:41.370
smaller than what I
can fit into the

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:42.770
cache, so that's great.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.170
Nothing gets kicked out.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.200
So every one of those
iterations

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.450
for a becomes a hit.

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:49.220
So that's good.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.950
I've improved performance.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:54.550
For b I have the same pattern.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.620
First time I see b it's a miss,
every time after that

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:57.480
it's a hit.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.560
Similarly for c.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:02.490
So my cache miss rate goes from
being one, everything's a

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:07.050
miss, to decreasing to 1 over
n where n is essentially how

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.500
much I can run the loop.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.964
So we call that full scaling
because we've taken the loop

00:50:11.964 --> 00:50:14.440
where we've distributed, and
we've scaled every one of

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.550
those smaller loops to the
maximum that we could get.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.230
Now what about the data?

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:22.340
So we have the same example.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:26.820
Here we saw that the instruction
working set is

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.420
big, but what about the data?

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.330
So let's say in this case
I'm sending just a

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:32.270
small amount of data.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:35.640
Then the behavior
is really good.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.070
It's a small amount of data
that I need to communicate

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:38.690
from a to b.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.310
A small amount of
data you need to

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:42.040
communicate from b to c.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.270
So it's great.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.990
No problems with
the data cache.

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.530
What happens in full
scaling case?

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:53.330
AUDIENCE: It's not correct to
communicate from a to b.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:54.921
PROFESSOR: What do you mean
it's not correct?

00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:55.576
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's not

00:50:55.576 --> 00:50:56.826
communicating at the same time.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's not
at the same time.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.890
In fact, just assume
this is sequential.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.800
So I run a, I store some data,
and then when I run

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.680
b I grab that data.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.430
This is in sequential.

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:16.610
AUDIENCE: How do you know that
the transmission's valid then?

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.210
We could use some
global variable.

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.390
PROFESSOR: Simple case.

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.750
There's no global variables.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.210
All the data that b needs
comes from a.

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:28.290
So if I run a I produce
all the data and

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.540
that's all that b needs.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.110
So in the full scaling case,
what do I expect to

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.140
happen for the data?

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.730
Remember, in the full scaling
case, all the working sets for

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:42.810
the instructions are small so
they all fit in the cache.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:46.260
But now I'm running a for a lot
longer so I have to store

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:48.180
a lot more data for b.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.970
Similarly, I'm running b for a
lot longer so I have to store

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.690
a lot more data for c.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.770
So what do I expect to happen
with the working set here?

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.430
Instructions are still good,
but the data might be bad

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:06.410
because I've run a for a lot
more iterations at one shot.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.730
So now I have to buffer all
this data for a to b.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.960
Similarly, I've run b for a long
time so I have to buffer

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.960
a whole lot data for b to c.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.570
Is that clear?

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:15.930
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:19.040
PROFESSOR: So let's say every
time a runs it produces one

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.830
data element.

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.770
So now in this case,
every iteration

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:24.970
produces one data element.

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:25.880
That's fine.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.100
That's clear?

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:31.720
Here I run a n times, so I
produce n data elements.

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.950
And b let's say produces
one data element.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:39.560
So if my cache can only hold
let's say n by 2 data

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.140
elements, then there's
an overflow.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.770
So what that means is not
everything's in the cache, and

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.620
that's bad because of the same
reasons we saw for the

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.550
instructions.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:49.780
When I need those data I have
to go out to memory and get

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.060
them again, so it's extra
communication, extra

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:52.620
redundancy.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:54.530
AUDIENCE: In this case where you
don't need to store the a

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.780
variables
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:03.000
PROFESSOR: But notice these were
sequential simple case.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.210
I need all the data from a to
run all the iterations for b.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.650
Then, yeah, this goes away.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:13.570
So let's say this goes away,
but still b produces n

00:53:13.570 --> 00:53:15.240
elements and that overflows
the cache.

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:23.230
So there's a third example where
I don't fully distribute

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.520
everything, I partially
distribute some of the loops.

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:29.730
I can fully scale a and b
because I can fit those

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.600
instructions in the cache.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.090
That gets me around this
problem, because now a and b

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.850
are just communicating
one day data element.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.120
But c is still a problem because
I still have to run b

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.430
n times in the end before I can
run c so there are n data

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:46.940
elements in flight.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.480
So the data for b still becomes
a problem in terms of

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.500
its locality.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.810
Is that clear?

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.640
So, any ideas on how
I can improve this?

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.937
AUDIENCE: assuming you have the
wrong cache line and you

00:53:58.937 --> 00:54:00.187
have to do one or two memory
acceses to get the cache back.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:16.690
PROFESSOR: So, programs
typically have really good

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.090
instruction locality just
because the nature of the way

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:19.490
we run them.

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:23.350
We have small loops and they
iterate over and over again.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:26.410
Data is actually where you spend
most of your time in the

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:27.090
memory system.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:28.320
It's fetching data.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.650
So I didn't actually understand
why you think data

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.340
is less expensive than
instructions.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.879
AUDIENCE: What I'm saying say
you want to read an array,

00:54:35.879 --> 00:54:39.435
read the first, say, 8
elements to 8 words

00:54:39.435 --> 00:54:39.942
in the cache box.

00:54:39.942 --> 00:54:44.514
Well then you'd get 7 hits, so
every 8 iterations you have to

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:45.530
do a rewrite.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:46.190
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:49.800
So that assumes that you have
really good spatial locality,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.170
because you've assumed that I've
brought in 8 elements and

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.780
I'm going to use every
one of them.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.910
So if that's the case you have
really good spatial locality

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.690
and that's, in fact,
what you want.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:55:00.160
It's the same kind of thing
that I showed for the

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:00.820
instruction cache.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.450
The first thing is a miss,
the rest are hits.

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.160
The reason data is more
expensive, you simply have a

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.490
lot more data reads than
you have instructions.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.730
Typically you have small
loops, hundreds of

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:15.120
instructions and they might
access really big arrays that

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.160
are millions of data
references.

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.230
So that becomes a problem.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.250
So ideas on how to
improve this?

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.340
AUDIENCE: That's a loop?

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:24.190
PROFESSOR: That's a loop.

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:25.800
So what would you do in
the smaller loop?

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.330
PROFESSOR: Something
like that?

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:39.190
So in a nested loop, you have
a smaller loop that has a

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:43.220
small number of iterations,
so 64.

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:47.110
So, 64 might be just as much as
I can buffer for the data

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.380
in the cache.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:51.610
Then I wrap that loop with one
outer loop that completes the

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:52.860
whole number of iterations.

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:55.950
So if I had to do n, then
I divide n by 64.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:58.060
So that can work out
really well.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.190
So there's different kinds of
blocking techniques that you

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.800
can use on getting your data to
fit into your local store

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.340
or into your cache to exploit
these spatial and temporal

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.250
properties.

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:08.550
Question?

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:12.135
AUDIENCE: Would it not be
better to use a small

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:14.079
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] size so
you could run a, b, c

00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:15.329
sequentially?

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:18.430
PROFESSOR: You could
do that as well.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.620
But the problem with running a,
b, c sequentially is that

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.930
if they're in the same
loop, you end up with

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:26.050
instructions being bad.

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.370
That would really, this case --
so even if you change this

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:30.790
number you don't get around
the instructions.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.040
So you're going to see more
optimizations that do more of

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.990
these loop tricks.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:43.230
I talk about unrolling without
really defining what unrolling

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.930
is or going into a
lot of details.

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.170
Loop distribution, loop fision,
some of the things,

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:49.960
like loop tiling,
loop blocking.

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.620
I think Simmon's going to cover
some of these next week.

00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:56.890
So this was implemented, this
was done by another Master

00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:02.470
student at MIT who graduated
about two years ago, to show

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.910
that if you factor in cache
constraints versus ignoring

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:07.650
cache constraints, how much
performance you can get.

00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.580
This was done in the context
of StreamIt.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.710
So, in fact, some of you might
have recognized a to b to c as

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:16.950
being interconnected as
pipeline filters.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.690
We ran it on different
processors, so the StrongARM

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.550
processor's really small.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:25.780
InOrder processor has no L1
cache in this particular model

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:26.520
that we used.

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.710
But it had a really
long latency --

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.570
sorry, it had no L2 cache.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.390
It had really long latency
to memory.

00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:37.710
Pentium, an x86 processor.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.300
Reasonably fast. It had a
complicated memory system and

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.490
a lot, a lot of memory overlap
in terms of references.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:49.490
Then the Itanium processor,
which had a huge L2 cache at

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:50.590
its disposal.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.340
So what you can see is that
lower bars indicate

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.060
bigger speed ups.

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:57.680
This is normalized run time.

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.090
So on the processor where you
don't actually have caches to

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:03.870
save you, and the memory
communication is really

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.490
expensive, you can get a lot
of benefit from doing the

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.800
cache aware scaling, that loop
nesting to take advantage of

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.430
packing instructions instead of
instruction cache, packing

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:15.550
data into data cache and not
having to go out to memory if

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:17.100
you don't to.

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:23.470
So you can reduce run time to
about 1/3 of what it was with

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:26.160
this kind of cache
optimization.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.710
On the Pentium3 where you have
a cache to help you out, the

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.300
benefits are there, but you
don't get as big a benefit

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:38.550
from ignoring the cache
constraints versus being aware

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:39.670
of the cache constraints.

00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:44.480
So here you're actually doing
some of that middle column

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.360
whereas here we're doing
third columns,

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.980
the cache aware fusion.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:56.220
In a Itanium you really get no
benefits between the two.

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:56.580
Yep?

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:02.140
AUDIENCE: Can you explain what
the left columns are?

00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.040
PROFESSOR: These?

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.270
PROFESSOR: So this is tricky.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.000
So the left columns
are doing this.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.990
AUDIENCE: OK, sort of assuming
that icache is there.

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:20.500
PROFESSOR: Right, and the third
column is doing this.

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.680
So you want to do this because
the icache locality is the

00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.890
best. So you always want to go
to full or maximum scaling.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.310
I'm actually fudging a little
just for sake of clarity.

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:37.120
Here you're actually doing this
nesting to improve both

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.730
the instruction and
the data locality.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.160
So you can get really good
performance improvement.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.330
So what does that mean for
your Cell projects or for

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.020
Cell, we'll talk about that next
week at the recitation.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:52.150
Yeah?

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:53.572
AUDIENCE: Is there
some big reasons

00:59:53.572 --> 00:59:56.400
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.850
PROFESSOR: Well it just means
that if you have caches to

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:00.390
save you, and they're really big
caches and they're really

01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:06.990
efficient, the law of
diminishing returns.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.370
That's where profiling
comes in.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.100
So you look at the profiling
results, you look at your

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.360
cache misses, how many cache
misses are you taking.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.780
If it's really significant,
then you look at ways to

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.020
improve it.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.110
If your cache misses are really
low, you missed rate is

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.540
really low, then it doesn't make
sense to spend time and

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.120
energy focusing on that.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.830
Good question.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.360
So, any other questions?

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.410
So summarizing the gamut of
programming for performance.

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:35.410
So you tune to parallelism
first, because if you can't

01:00:35.410 --> 01:00:38.140
find the concurrency, your
Amdahl's law, you're not going

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.440
to a get a whole lot
of speed up.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.750
But then once you figured out
what the parallelism is, then

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:45.740
what you want to do is really
get the performance on each

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.055
processor, the single track
performance to be really good.

01:00:48.055 --> 01:00:49.870
You shouldn't ignore that.

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:51.630
The modern processors
are complex.

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.700
You need instructional level
parallelism, you need data

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.190
level parallelism, you
need memory hierarchy

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.210
optimizations, and so you
should consider those

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.230
optimizations.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.640
Here, profiling tools could
really help you figure out

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.030
where the biggest benefits to
performance will come from.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:11.490
You may have to, in fact,
change everything.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.320
You may have to change your
algorithm, your data

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.970
structures, your program
structure.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.460
So in the MPEG decoder case, for
example, I showed you that

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.910
if you change the flag that
says don't use double

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:25.530
precision inverse DCT, use a
numerical hack, then you can

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.330
get performance improvements
but you're changing your

01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:29.380
algorithm really.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:32.120
You really want to focus on just
the biggest nuggets --

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.760
where is most of the performance
coming in, or

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.600
where's the biggest performance
bottleneck, and

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.060
that's the thing you
want optimize.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.200
So remember the law of
diminishing returns.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.720
Don't spend your time on doing
things that aren't going to

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:46.010
get you anything significant
in return.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.450
That's it.

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.700
Any questions?

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:51.830
OK.

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:53.080
How are you guys doing
with the projects?

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:01.195
So, one of the added benefits of
the central CBS repository

01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:04.620
is I get notifications too
when you submit things.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.410
So I know of only two projects
that have been submitting

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:08.580
things regularly.

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.950
So, I hope that'll
pick up soon.

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:14.280
I guess a few minutes to finish
the quiz and then we'll

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:14.930
see you next week.

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.180
Have a good weekend.
