00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.380
PROFESSOR: So let's get started
with the second

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.640
lecture for today.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.210
So I guess one thing multicores
did, is really

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.910
shatter this nice view of
writing in your programs and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.040
hardwares to take care of,
giving you performance.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.690
So hardware just kind of
completely gave that up.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.010
But so what you're doing in this
class, is you're trying

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.590
to do it by yourself.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.560
Give all the responsibility
back to the program.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.720
And you realize as you go,
it's a much harder job.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.520
I mean, this is not simple
programming.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.860
So you need to have, you don't
have MIT class students on

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.625
every company to do this, so we
need to have some kind of

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:05.670
middle ground.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.240
And so some of the stuff we have
been doing is trying to

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.650
figure out are there
any middle ground.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.910
Can you actually take some of
that load away from the user

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.640
into things like languages
and compilers.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.340
So we will talk about
some of those.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.140
So right now we are kind of
switching from directly doing

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.920
what's necessary, to do the
Cell project into going

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.107
breadth So this lecture, and
then we will sit back and do a

00:01:35.107 --> 00:01:35.367
little bit of debugging and
performance work and that will

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:36.570
be directly helpful.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.736
And then next week we'll have
lots of guest lectures to kind

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:41.770
of give you breadth in there.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.090
So you'll understand no just
Cell programming but parallel

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.640
programming and parallel
processing, what the world is

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.320
like beyond that.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.300
So today we're going to have
Bill talk about streams.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.210
BILL THIES: OK very good.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.470
So my name is Bill Thies.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.720
I'm a graduate student working
with Saman and Roderick, and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.450
others here.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.710
And I'll talk about the
StreamIt language.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.230
So why do we need a new
programming language?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.490
Well we think that languages
haven't kept up with the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.520
architectures.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.860
So one way to look at this is
that if you look back at

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.110
previous languages, look at C
with von-Neumann machine.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.870
Now I grew up in rural
Pennsylvania not too far from

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.630
Amish Country.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.640
And so to me these go together
just like a horse and buggy.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.110
OK they're perfectly made
for each other.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.360
They basically go at
the same rate.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.720
Everything is fine.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.310
But the problem is, in comes
the modern architecture.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.360
OK this is an F-16.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.610
you have a lot more that you can
do with it then, then with

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.700
the horse and buggy.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.590
So how do you program these
new architectures?

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.840
Well architecture makers these
days are basically faced with

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.100
a really hard choice.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.060
On the one hand, you could get a
really cool architecture and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.950
develop an ad hoc programming
technique where you're really

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130
just leaving it to the
programmer to do something

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.900
complicated to get
performance.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.570
And unfortunately I
think that's the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.100
route that they took.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.490
I mean fortunately for the
industry, but unfortunately

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.010
for you, I think that's the
route they took with cell

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.700
which means all of you are
going to become basically

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.800
fighter pilots.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.160
You have to learn how
to fly the plane.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.100
You have to become an expert.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.140
You're going to become the best
people at programming

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.350
these architectures.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.810
And unfortunately the only other
option is to really bend

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.010
over backwards to support the
previous era of languages

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.670
like C and C .

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.500
And you can see what's coming
here, it's just hard to get

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.850
off the runway.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.400
So you don't want
this situation.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640
Out of consideration for whoever
is in the buggy,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.790
hopefully you'll
never take off.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.190
So looking from a more academic
perspective, why do

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.060
we need a new language
right now?

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.880
So if you look back over the
past 30 years, I know you've

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.330
seen this graph before.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.760
We were dealing with just
one core in the machine

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.950
for all this time.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.110
And now we have this plethora
of multicores

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.610
coming across the board.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.120
So how did we program
these old machines?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.670
Well we had languages like C and
FORTRAN that really have a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.230
lot of nice properties across
these architectures.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.540
So it was portable,
high-performance, composable--

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.870
you could have really good
software development--

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.180
malleable, maintainable, all the
nice things you'd like to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.250
see from a software engineering
perspective.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.450
And really if you wrote a
program back in 1970, you

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.170
could keep it in C and have it
continue to leverage all the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.620
new properties of machines
over the past 30 years.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.760
So just one fine
out of the box.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.620
And looking forward, that's
not going to be true.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.660
So for example, we could
say that C was the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.060
common machine language.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.760
That's what we say for the
past 30 years, was common

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520
across all the machines.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.120
But now looking forward,
that's not

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.210
going to be true anymore.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.800
Because you have to program
every core separately.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.270
So what's the common machine
language for multicores?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.240
We really think you need
something where you can write

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.370
a program once today, and have
it scale for the next 30 years

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.560
without having to modify
the program.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.930
So what kind of language do you
need to get that kind of

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.620
performance?

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.520
Well let's look a little deeper
into this notion of a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.020
common machine language.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.820
So why did it work so well
for the past 30 years?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.670
Well on uniprocessors, things
like C and FORTRAN fran really

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.800
encapsulated the common
properties.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.820
So things like a single flow of
control in the machine, a

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.260
single memory image, are both
properties of the language.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
But they also hid certain
properties from the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.070
programmer.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.550
So they hid the things that
were different between one

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.620
machine and another.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.320
So for example, the register
file, the ISA, the functional

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.540
units and so on.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.200
These things could change from
one architecture to another.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.330
And you didn't have to change
your program because those

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.820
aspects weren't in the
programming language.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.140
So that's why these languages
were succeeding.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.070
And what do we need to succeed
in the multicore era from a

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.580
language perspective?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.370
Well you need to encapsulate the
common properties again.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.830
And this time it's multiple
flows of control that you have

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.860
for all the different cores, and
multiple local memories.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.710
There's no more monolithic
memory anymore, that everyone

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.370
can read and write to.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.530
Also you need to hide
some of the

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.190
differences between the machines.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.990
So some cores have different
capabilities.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.570
On cell there's a heterogeneous
system between

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.560
the STEs and the PPE.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.090
Different communication models
on different architectures,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.010
different synchronization
models.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.970
So whatever common machine
language we come up with,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.600
we'll have to keep these
things hidden from the

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.130
programmer.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.960
Now a lot of different
researchers are taking

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.390
different tacts for how you want
to invent the next common

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.380
machine language.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.920
And the thrust that we're really
excited about is this

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.510
notion of streaming.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.460
So what is a stream program?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.130
Well if you look at a lot of the
high-performance systems

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.780
today-- including Powerpoint
which is running this awesome

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.730
animation--

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.880
you can basically see that
they're based around some

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.930
stream of data.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.290
So audio, video, like HDTV,
video editing, graphic stuff.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.570
I think actually, a lot of the
projects in this class that I

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.160
looked at, would fit into
the streaming mold.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.790
Things like the software
radio, array tracing, I

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.750
probably don't remember
them all.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.460
But when I looked at them, they
all looked like they had

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.670
a streaming component
somewhere in there.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.560
So what's special about a stream
program compared to

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.440
just a normal program?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.830
Well they have a lot of
attractive properties.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.380
If you look at their structure,
you can usually see

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.220
that the computation pattern
remains relatively constant

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.850
across the lifetime
of the program.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.600
So they have some well-defined
units that are communicating

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.810
with each other.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.790
And they continue that pattern
of communication throughout.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.130
And this really exposes a lot
of opportunities for the

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.670
compiler to do some
optimizations that it couldn't

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.640
do on just an arbitrary general
purpose program.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.020
And if you saw before, we have
basically all the types of

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.380
parallelism are really exposed
in a stream program.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.000
There's the pipeline parallelism
between different

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.650
producers and consumers.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.340
There's the task parallelism
basically going

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.420
from left to right.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.220
And also data parallelism which
means that a single one

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.900
of these stages can sometimes be
split to apply to multiple

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.960
elements in the data stream.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.380
So when you're thinking about
stream programming, there's a

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.840
lot of different ways
you can actually

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.500
represent the program.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.640
So whenever you have a
programming model, you have to

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.530
answer these kinds
of questions.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.150
For example do the senders and
the receivers block when they

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.700
try to communicate?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.470
How much buffering is allowed?

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.300
Is the computation
deterministic?

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.440
What kind of model do
you have in there?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.580
Can you avoid deadlock?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.880
Questions like these, and we
could spend a whole lecture

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.790
answering these questions,
putting them in different

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.980
categories.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.170
But what I want to just to do,
just to give you a feel is

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.010
touch on kind of three of the
major models that you might

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.410
see come up in different kinds
of programming models.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.550
And I'll just touch Kahn process
networks, synchronous

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.800
dataflow, and communicating
sequential processes, or CSP.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.930
So just one slide
on these models.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.300
So let's compare them
a little bit.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.650
First there's the Kahn
process networks.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.910
So this is kind of the
simplest model.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.940
It's very intuitive.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.610
You just have different
processes that are

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.460
communicating over FIFOs.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.700
And the FIFO size is
conceptually unbounded.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.840
So to a first approximation,
it's kind of like a Unix pipe.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.630
These processes can just read
from the input, and they can

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.310
push onto their outputs
without blocking.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.170
But if they try to read from an
input they do block until

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.850
an input is available.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.090
And the interesting thing is
that the communication pattern

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.520
can actually be dependent
on the data.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.410
So for example I could pop an
index off of one channel, and

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.300
then use that index to determine
which other channel

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.830
I'll read from on the
next time time step.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.560
But at the same time it
is deterministic.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.450
So for a given series of input
values on the stream, I'll

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.540
always have the same
communication pattern that I'm

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.630
trying from the other input.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.580
So if it's a deterministic
model, that's a nice property.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.320
Let's see, what else
to say here?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.670
There's actually a few recent
ventures that are using Kahn

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.710
process networks.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.190
So there's commercial interest.
For example Ambric

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.920
is a startup that I think will
be based on a Kahn process

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.750
network for the programming
model.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.410
Looking at another model called
synchronous dataflow,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.930
this is actually what we use
in the StreamIt system.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.760
And compared to Kahn
process networks,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.830
it's kind of a subset.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.600
It's a little bit more
restrictive.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.040
So if you look at the space
of all possible program

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.770
behaviors, Kahn process networks
are a pretty big

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.110
piece of the space.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.580
And then synchronous dataflow
is kind of a subset of that

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.490
space where you know more
about the communication

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.390
pattern at compile time.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.070
So for example, in synchronous
dataflow, the programmer

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.810
actually declares how many items
it will consume from

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.090
each of its in put channels
on a given execution step.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.770
So there's no more data
dependence regarding the

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.000
communication pattern.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.290
It'll always input some items
from some of the channels and

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.990
produce some number of items
to other channels.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.300
And this is a really nice
properties because it lets the

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.510
compiler do to scheduling
for you.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.020
So the compiling can see who's
communicating to who and

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.630
exactly what pattern.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.720
And it can statically interleave
the filters to

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.400
guarantee that everyone has
enough data to complete their

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.750
computation.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.490
So there's a lot of interesting
optimizations you

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:42.950
can do here.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.820
That's why it's very attractive
for StreamIt.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.820
And you can statically guarantee
freedom from

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.560
deadlock, which is a nice
property to have.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.850
The last one I want to touch on
is communicating sequential

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.440
processes or CSP.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.080
And in the space of program
behaviors, it's kind of an

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.790
overlapping that from Kahn
processing networks, and adds

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.170
a few new semantic behaviors.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.030
So the buffering model is
basically rendezvous

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.300
communication now.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.950
So there's no bothering
in the system.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.390
Basically anytime you send a
value to another process, you

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.380
have to block and wait until
that process will actually

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.060
receive that value from you.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.570
So everyone is rendevouzing at
every communication step.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.200
In addition to that, they
have some sophisticated

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.730
synchronization primitives.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.760
So you can for example, discuss
alternative behaviors

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.850
that you have. You can either
one thing or another which

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.510
will introduce the
nondeterminism in the model.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.150
Which could be a good or a bad
thing depending on the program

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.550
you're trying to express.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.090
And pretty much the most
well-known encapsulation of

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.550
CSP is this occam programming
language invented

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.550
quite a while ago.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.420
And some people are still
using that today.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.030
Any questions on the
model computations?

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.720
OK.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.570
So now let me get into
what StreamIt is.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.190
So StreamIt is a
great language.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.380
It's a high-level

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.930
architecture-independent language.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.660
Oh question the back.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.024
AUDIENCE: With the CSP I'm
trying to understand exactly

00:12:15.024 --> 00:12:19.660
what that means or how
it's different.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.150
Is basically what's it's saying
is you have a bunch

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.940
processes and they can send
messages to each other.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.390
BILL THIES: So all these models
have that property.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.230
AUDIENCE: They all
fit into that.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.220
But it seems like from your
explanation of CSP, that that

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:41.620
was just sort of the essence
of CSP is it more specific?

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.820
BILL THIES: So CSP is usually
associated with rendezvous

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.360
communication.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.270
That's the side of programs
that fit inside

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.780
Kahn process networks.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.860
It's any communicating model
where you basically have no

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.310
buffering between
the processes.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.520
Now the piece that sits outside
is usually lumped with

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.000
CSP, or especially with occam
They have a set a primitives

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.500
that are richer in terms
of synchronization.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.810
So for example, you can have
guards on your communication.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.040
Don't execute this consumption
from this channel until I see

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.550
a certain value.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.580
So there's some more rich
semantics there.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.720
And so that's the things that
are usually outside.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.710
They're outside the
other models.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.940
Does that make sense?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.190
Other questions?

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.210
OK so StreamIt.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.480
OK so StreamIt is
architecture-independent.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.190
It's basically a really nice
syntactic model for

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.480
interfacing with these lower
level models of computation

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.530
for streaming.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.460
And really we have two goals
in the StreamIt project.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.470
And the first is from the
programmer's side.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.000
So we want to improve the
programmer's life when you're

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.360
writing a parallel program.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.840
We want to make it easier for
you to write a parallel

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.060
program then you would have to
do in C or a language like

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.510
Java, or any other language
that you know.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.960
And at the same time, we want
scalable and portable

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.100
performance across
the multicores.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.820
So an interesting thing these
days is you'll find, is it's

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:13.570
often very hard a tempt the
programmer to switch to your

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.240
favorite language based
solely on performance.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.770
Or at least this has been the
story in the past. It may

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.210
change, looking forward.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.640
Because it's a lot harder to
get performance these days.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.730
But usually you have to offer
them some other carrot to get

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.720
them on board.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.660
And you know the carrot here
is that it's really nice to

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.630
program in.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.880
It's fun to program in.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.200
It's beautiful.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.820
It's a lot easier to program and
stream it then it would be

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.230
in something like C or Java
for a certain class of

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.380
programs. So that's how we get
them on board, and then we

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.010
also provide the performance.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.420
We're mostly based on the
synchronous in dataflow model.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.380
In that when there are static
communication patterns, we

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.560
leverage that from the
compiler side.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.850
So I'll also tell you about some
dynamic extensions that

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:58.410
we have, that is the much richer
model of communication.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.690
So what have we been doing
in the Streamit Project?

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.860
We have kind of a dual thrust
within our group building on

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.800
this language.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.470
So the first thrust is from
the programmability side,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.140
looking at applications and
programmability What can we

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.030
fit into the streaming model?

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.260
And we're also really pushing
the optimizations.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.660
So what can you do from both a
domain specific optimization

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.930
standpoint, as kind of emulating
a DSP engineer or a

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.770
signal processing expert
in the design flow.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.860
And also architecture specific
optimizations.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.520
So we've been compiling for a
lot of parallel machines.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.860
And we were hoping we could
have a full system for you

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.735
guys, this IEP, so you could
write it then stream it and

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:35.520
then hit the button.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.900
And it would work the whole
way down to cell.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.570
Unfortunately we're not
quite there yet.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.510
But we do have a pretty robust
compiler infrastructure.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.010
And you can download this off
the web and play with it if

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.190
you want to.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.270
One of our backends that we've
released so far actually does

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.260
go to a cluster of
workstations.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.550
So it's kind of an MPI-like
version of C. It uses Pthreads

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.120
for the parallelism model.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.630
And I mean, depending on what
kind of a hacker you are, you

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.950
actually might be able to lower
that down onto cell.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.840
So some of the stuff you might
be able to use if you're have

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.050
some initiative in there.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.400
And of course we'd be
willing to work with

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.260
you on this as well.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.460
so we have lots optimizations
in the tool flow.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:17.280
And actually Saman will spend
another lecture focusing on

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.240
the StreamIt compiler,
and how we get

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.010
performance out of the model.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.330
OK, so let's just jump right in
and do the analog of Hello

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.080
World in StreamIt.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.470
I'm going to kind of walk you
through the language and show

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.950
you the interesting pieces
from an intellectual

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.380
standpoint.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.720
What's interesting about
a streaming model that

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.280
you can take away.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.100
So instead of Hello World,
we have a counter.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.320
Since we're dealing with stream
programs here, you're

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.200
not usually doing
text processing.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.820
So how do you write counter?

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.040
Well there are two pieces
to the program.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.430
The first is kind of the
interconnect between the

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.270
different components.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:50.950
That's what we have up here.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.210
We're saying the program is a
pipeline with two stages, it

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.690
has a source, and it
has a printer.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.120
And then we can write
the source and

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.720
the printer as filters.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.190
We call those basic building
blocks filters in Streamit.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.430
So the source will just have
a variable x that it

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.130
initializes is zero.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.450
And then we have a work
function which is

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.570
automatically called by our
runtime system every time

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.820
through the steady state.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.400
So this work function well push
one item on to the output

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.130
channel, and it'll increment
the value afterward.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.870
Whereas the intPrinter
at the bottom here,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.720
will input one value.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.080
And its work function here just
pops that value off the

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.940
input tape, and prints
it to the output.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.180
Now how do we run this thing?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.490
Well there's no main function
here like you

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.730
see in Hello World.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.190
Is there comment?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.207
Oh, sorry.

00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:42.180
AUDIENCE: The two meanings of
push and two meanings of pop.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.670
BILL THIES: Two meanings?

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.120
AUDIENCE: Push 1, 2, 3.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.970
BILL THIES: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.490
So the first push here is just
declaring that this work

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.300
function will push one item
to the output tape.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.450
So this is the synchronous
dataflow aspect.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.510
Were associating an output rate
with this work function.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.480
So that's a declaration here.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.190
Whereas this push is just
actually executing the push

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.760
onto the output.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.000
So how do we run this thing?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.770
Well we compile it with a
StreamIt compiler, store C

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:09.980
into a binary.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.170
And then when we run, we run
for a given number of

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.390
iterations.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.100
So you don't just
call it once.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.060
Our model is that this is a
continuous stream of data

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.420
going through the program.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.110
And so when you run it, you
run it for some number of

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.570
iterations, or basically input
or output items, is what

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.590
you're running it for.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.470
So if you run this for four
iterations, it would

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.060
print in the 033.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.540
So we can leverage this
steady flow of data.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.050
Yeah Amir?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.500
AUDIENCE: 1, 2, 3, 4, pushing
X plus plus .

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.320
BILL THIES: I think
the plus, plus is

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.140
executed after the push.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.010
AUDIENCE: Push plus plus?

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:46.570
BILL THIES: So it
starts at zero.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:50.670
So I think a PostFix expression
executes after the

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.520
actual obsession.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.780
Yeah.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.220
Yeah.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.470
Other questions?

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.200
OK so let's step up a
level and look at

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.890
what we have in StreamIt.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.940
So the first question is, how
do you represent this

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.350
connectivity between different
building blocks?

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.200
How do you represent streams?

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.160
And if you look at traditional
programming models, kind of

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.140
the conventional wisdom
is that a stream

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.490
program is a graph.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.560
You have different
nodes that are

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.060
communicating to each other.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.350
And graphs are actually kind
of hard to analyze.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.420
They're hard to represent.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.090
They're a little
but confusing.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.900
So the approach we decided to
take in StreamIt is one of a

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.170
structured computation graph.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.145
So instead of having arbitrary
inner connections between the

00:19:32.145 --> 00:19:35.280
stages, we have a higher
hierarchical description in

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.150
which every individual stage
has a single input and a

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.340
single output.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.760
And you can compose these
together into

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.990
higher level stages.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.600
Of course there's some pages
that do split and join with

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.770
multiple inputs.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.520
We'll get to that.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.400
So the analog here is kind of
ah analogous to structured

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.160
control flow, in your favorite

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.780
imperative programming language.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.060
Of course there was a day when
everyone used goto statements

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.060
instead of having structure
control flow.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.400
We've got a fan of goto
statements in the audience?

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.550
OK, I'll get to you later.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.160
But the problem was, it's really
hard to understand the

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.110
program that's jumping all over
the place because there's

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.810
no local reasoning you can have.
You know you're jumping

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.150
to this location, you're coming
back a different way.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.950
It's hard to reason about
program components.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.960
So when people went to
structured control flow,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.410
there's just if else, four
loop statements.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.740
Those are the two basic
constructs.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.250
You can basically express all
kinds of computation in those

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.540
simple primitives.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.340
And things got a lot simpler.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.500
And you know people objected
at one point even.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.630
You know what about a
finite-state machine?

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.990
Don't you need goto statements
for a finite-state machine,

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.980
going from one state
to another another.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:46.850
And now everyone writes in FSM
with a really simple idiom.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.090
You usually have a while loop
around a case statement.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:51.830
Right, you have a
dispatch loop.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.780
So and now whenever you see
that pattern you can

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.490
recognize, oh there's a
finite-state machine.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.200
It's not just at set of gotos.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.840
It's a finite-state machine.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.370
So we think there are
similar idioms in

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.140
the streaming domain.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.820
And that's kind of the direction
we're pushing from a

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.600
design standpoint.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.510
So what are our structures
that we have?

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.310
Well here are our structured
streams. At the

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.310
base we have a filter.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.100
That's just the programmable
unit like I showed you.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.430
We have a pipeline, which just
connects one stream to another

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.400
in a sequence.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.620
So this gives you pipeline
parallelism.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.270
There's a splitjoin where you
have explicit parallelism in

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.020
the stream.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.470
So I'll talk about what these
splitters and joiners can do.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.730
It's basically a predefined
pattern of scattering data to

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.530
some child streams, and then
gathering that data back into

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.770
a single stream.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.500
So the whole construct still
remains single input and

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.020
single output.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.720
Likewise a feedback loop is
just a simple way to put a

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.340
loop in your stream.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.160
And of course these
are hierarchical.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.160
So all of these green boxes
can be any of the three

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.910
constructs.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.270
So that's how you can have these
hierarchical graphs.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.740
And again, since everything is
single-input single-output,

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.920
you can really mix and match.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.040
You know choose your favorite
components, and they'll always

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.760
fit together.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.390
You don't need to stitch
multiple connections.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.010
So let's dive inside one
of these filters now.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.620
And I gave you a feel for how
they look before, but here's a

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.080
little more detail.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.130
So how do we program
the filter?

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.600
Well a filter just transforms
one stream

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.950
into another stream.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.260
And here it's transforming a
stream of floating-point

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.780
numbers into another
floating-point number stream.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.800
I can take some parameters
at the top.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.310
These actually fixed at compile
time in our model,

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.860
which allows the compiler to
really specialize the filters

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.720
code depending on the context
in which it's being used.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.210
So for example here, we're
inputting N in a frequency.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.740
And then we have two stages
of execution.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.220
At initialization time-- this
runs one at the beginning of

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.940
the whole program-- we can
calculate some weights for

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.720
example, from the frequency.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.550
And we can store those weights
as a local variable.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.860
So you can think of this kind
of like a Java class.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.260
You can have some member
variables.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.350
You can retains state from one
execution to the next.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.790
The work function
is the closest

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.350
thing to the main function.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.860
This is called repeatedly
in the steady state.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.660
And here are the IO rates
of the work function.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.660
This filter actually peaks at
some data items. That means

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.010
that it inspects more items on
the input channel than it

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.490
actually consumes on
every iteration.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.920
So we'll look at N input items,
and we'll push one new

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.040
item onto the output and pop one
item from the input tape

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.200
every time we execute.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.800
So here we have a sliding
window computation.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.330
It means the next time through,
we'll just slide this

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.180
window up by one and inspect
the next N items

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.830
on the input tape.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:31.170
And inside the work function
you can have pretty much

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.590
general purpose code.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.520
Right now we just allow pointers
and a few other

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.980
things to keep things simple.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.050
But the idea is this is general
purpose imperative

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.380
code inside the work function.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.160
Now what's nice about this
representations of a filter is

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.020
for one thing is this
peak function.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.750
So what we really have is a
nice representation of the

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.100
data pattern, that you're
reading the data

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.470
on the input channel.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.290
And if you look at this for
example in a language like C,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.730
it's a lot messier.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.990
So usually when you're doing
buffer management, you have to

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.610
do some modulo operations.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.290
You have to keep a circular
buffer of your live data.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.540
And increase you know, a head or
tail pointer and mod around

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.910
the side with some kind
of modulo operation.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.580
And for a compiler, this
is a real nightmare.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.340
Because modulo operations
are kind of the the

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.680
worst thing to analyze.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.760
You can't see what it's actually
trying to read.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.060
And if you want to map this
buffer to a network or to a

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.460
combined communication with some
other actor or filter in

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.690
the graph, it's pretty
much impossible.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.540
So here is we're exposing that
all to the compiler.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.610
And you'll see how that
can make a difference.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.450
And also it's just a lot
easier to program.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.040
I mean, I don't like looking
at the code.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.260
So I'm going to go to
the next slide.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.930
OK, so how do we piece
things together?

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.560
Let's just build some higher
level components.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.380
So here's a pipeline
of two components.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.870
And we already saw a pipeline.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.920
You can just add one component
after another.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.680
And add just basically has the
effect of making a queue, and

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.570
just queueing up all of the
components that you added, and

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.530
connecting them one
after another.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.560
So here we have a BandPastFilter
by connecting a

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.310
LowPassFilter and feeding it's
output into a HighPassFilter.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.650
You end up with a
BandPassFilter.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.850
OK what about a splitjoin?

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.290
How do we make those?

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:14.730
So a splitjoin has an add
statement as well.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.260
And here we're adding components
in a loop.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.710
So what this means is now when
we say add, we're actually

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:22.700
adding from left to right.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.920
So instead of going top to down,
we're adding from left

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.610
to right across the splitjoin.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.440
And we can actually
do that in a loop.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.880
So here we're intPrinting a
parameter N. And depending on

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.110
that value, we'll add N

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.420
BandPassFilters to this splitjoin.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.590
So it's kind of cool, right?

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.000
Because you can input a
parameter, and that parameter

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.180
actually affects the structure
of your graph.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.450
So this graph is unrolled at
compiled time by our compiler,

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.110
constructing a big sequence
of computations.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.440
And it can resolve the structure
and communication

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.050
pattern in that graph, and then
map it to the underlying

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.300
substrate when we compile.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.680
Also to notice here are the
splitter and the joiner.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.420
So we have a predefined set
of splitter and joiners.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.760
I'll go into more
detail later.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.750
But here we're just duplicating
the data to every

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.970
one of these parallel
components, and then doing a

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.970
round-robin join pattern where
we bring them back together

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.030
into a single output stream.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.150
And if you want to do an
equalizer, you basically need

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.990
an adder at the bottom
to add the

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.310
different components together.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.290
And another thing you can notice
here is that we have

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.960
some inlining going on.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.530
So we actually embedded this
splitjoin inside a higher

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:29.980
level pipeline.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.260
So what this does is it prevents
you from having to

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.340
name every component
of your stream.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.870
You can have a single stream
definition with lots of nested

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.110
components.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.770
And the natural extension is,
you can basically scale-up to

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.230
basically the natural size of
a procedure, just like you

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.160
would in an imperative
language.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.190
And here is for example, an FM
radio where we have a few

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.650
inline components.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.530
And the interesting thing here
is that there's a pretty good

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.530
correspondence between the
lines of the text and the

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.480
actual structure of the graph.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.110
And that's something that's
hard to find in

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.100
an imperative language.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.120
I mean if you want to for
example, stitch nodes together

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.210
with edges, it's often very
hard to visualize the

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.140
resulting structure of the graph
that you have. But here

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.650
if you just go through the
program, you can see that the

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.940
AtoD component goes right over
to the AtoD, the demodulator

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.650
to the demodulator, and so on.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.640
And even for the parallel
components, you can kind of

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.720
piece them together.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.680
so that's kind of how we think
of building programs. Any

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.930
questions so far?

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.390
OK so this is kind of
how you go about

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.920
programming in StreamIt.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.370
But programming is kind of a
chug n' plug activity right?

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.140
Nobody wants to be
a code monkey.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.340
The reason we're all here is to
see what's beautiful about

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.590
this programming model.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.910
Right?

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.410
Don Knuth said this, a famous
computer scientist from

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.320
Stanford during his Turing
Award Lecture you know,

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.020
"Some programs are
elegant, some are

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.460
exquisite, some are sparkling.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.520
My claim is that it is possible
to write grand

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.910
programs, noble programs, truly

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.640
magnificent ones!" Right.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.210
We want the best programs
possible.

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.990
It's not just about
making it work.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.850
We want really beautiful
programs. So what's beautiful

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.370
about the streaming domain?

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.820
What can you go away with and
say wow, that was a really

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.540
beautiful expression
of the computation.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.290
Well for me I think one of the
interesting things here is the

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.680
splitjoin contruct.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.040
Splitjoins can really
be beautiful.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.000
You know some mornings I just
wake up and I'm like, oh I'm

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.250
so glad I live in a world
with splitjoins.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.510
You know?

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:27.820
And and now splitjoins will
be part of your world.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.010
You can say this tomorrow.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:30.380
This is just wonderful.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.840
So OK, what do we having in
the splitjoin constructs?

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.900
You can duplicate data.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.650
You can do a round-robin
communication pattern from one

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.130
to another, or round-robin
join.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.300
Now the duplicate is
pretty simple.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.090
You just take the input
stream and duplicate

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:45.440
it to all the children.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.240
No problem.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.980
What do you do for
a round-robin?

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.260
Well you path N items from the
input to a given child.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.950
So for example, if N is 1, we'll
just distribute one at a

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:01.170
time to the child streams. And
you get a pattern like this, a

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.890
round-robin just going across.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.290
And you can do the same thing
on the joiner side.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.310
Let's say you're joining
with a factor of one.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.490
You're just reading from the
children and putting them into

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.530
a single stream.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.190
OK so the pretty colorful, but
nothing too fancy yet.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.460
Let's consider a different
round-robin factor.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.420
So a round-robin of 2 means that
we peel off 2 items from

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.760
the input, and pass those items
to the first output.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.590
OK there actually is going
to be a quiz on this.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.630
So ask questions of this
doesn't make sense.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:37.290
OK pass the next 2 items, and 2
items round-robin like that.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.010
And you can actually
have nonuniform

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.210
weights if you want to.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.740
So on the right let's
say we're doing

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.270
round-robin 1, 2, 3.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.620
That means we pass 1 item from
the first stream, 2 items from

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.670
the next stream, and then 3
items from the third stream.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:50.460
OK, pretty simple.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.160
We're just doing 1, 2,
and 3, and so on.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.260
Does that make sense?

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:59.050
I'm going to build on this
so any questions?

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.780
OK this was colorful but this
totally beautiful yet.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.670
So what's beautiful
about this?

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.440
well let's see how you might
write a matrix transpose.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.720
OK, something you guys have
probably all written at one

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.120
point in your life is
transposing a matrix.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.430
Let's say this matrix has M
rows, and it has N columns

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.600
going across.

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.830
And we're starting with a
representation in which the

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.660
stream is basically, I think
this is row major order.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.430
The first thing that you're
doing is going across the rows

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.340
before you're going to the
next the next row.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.680
I'm sorry you're going across
the columns, and then down to

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.770
the next row.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.710
So it's zigzagging like this.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.020
And you want to pass through
a transpose, so you

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.420
zigzag the other way.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.870
You do the first column,
up, and then the next

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.340
column, and so on.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.110
And this comes up a lot
in a stream program.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.080
So it turns out you can
represent this as a splitjoin.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.570
Oh that's not good.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.420
Just in my moment in
glory as well.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.430
OK, yeah slides.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.680
You can download slides.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.670
Actually I can do this
on the board.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.980
This is the thinking
part anyway.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.910
Yeah, could you just
bring up GMail?

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.820
I have a backup on GMail.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.880
Can we focus on the board?

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.990
So this is going to be a
little exercise anyway.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.380
OK, here's what we had.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:20.230
We had M, M rows, N columns.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.780
We started with an interleaving
like this.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.060
Right, and we want to
go into a splitjoin.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.030
And this will be a round-robin
construct.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.090
And what I want you to do is
fill in the round-robin

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:41.020
weight, and also the number of
the streams. And you can have

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.270
a round-robin at the bottom.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:48.240
And when it comes out,
you want the opposite

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.490
interleaving.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.990
This is M and N.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:06.060
OK so there are 3 unknowns here,
what you're doing the

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.410
round-robin by-- can you guys
see that over there--

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.290
how many parallel streams there
are, and what you're

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.630
joining the round-robin by.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.170
Ok so I'm going to give you a
minute to think about this.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.960
Try to think about this.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.170
See if you can figure out what
these constants are.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.260
You just basically want to read
from this data in a row

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.770
major pattern, M rows and N
columns, and end up with

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.450
something that's column major.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.130
What are the values
for the constant?

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:35.570
Does it makes sense?

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.920
Ask a question if it
doesn't make sense.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.870
Yeah?

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.980
AUDIENCE: So we assume that
values are going to, based on

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.070
the line that you drew, across
it, tests like a stream line?

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.960
BILL THIES: Right,
right, right.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.860
So those values are coming
down the stream.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.870
You have a 1-dimensional
stream.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:50.870
It's interleaved like this.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.850
So you'll be reading
them like this.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.620
And then you the output a
1-dimensional stream that is

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.170
threading the columns.

00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:57.530
Does that make sense?

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.950
Somebody ask another question.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:01.840
Yeah

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:08.470
AUDIENCE: So the actual matrix
transpose codes, it's my

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.690
understand that nobody actually
does it sequentially

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.300
like that because of
locality issues.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.690
Instead it's broken
up into blocks.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.900
BILL THIES: So there are
ways to optimize this.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.150
AUDIENCE: And after you've sort
of serialized it, can you

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:25.000
then capture..

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.510
PROFESSOR: Guys,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.260
has a blocking segment.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.540
So you can heirarchically
do that.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:34.203
So, normally what happens is you
do the blocks and inside

00:33:34.203 --> 00:33:35.580
the blocks, you can
do it again.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.830
You can do it at two
levels, basically.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:46.390
BILL THIES: Any hypotheses?

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:46.690
Anyone?

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:55.430
AUDIENCE: Is it N for first
one, M for the second one?

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.170
BILL THIES: OK, what
do we have

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.110
AUDIENCE: N for the first one,
and M for the second?

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.490
BILL THIES: N,M and

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.105
AUDIENCE: Same for the M?

00:34:05.105 --> 00:34:07.990
BILL THIES: Same, M?

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:17.560
BILL THIES: OK OK, this
is a hypothesis.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.940
Other hypotheses?

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.920
AUDIENCE: N, M, 1.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.610
BILL THIES: OK, anyone else?

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.000
Any amendments?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.270
AUDIENCE: How about 1, 1, 1?

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.520
BILL THIES: 1, 1, 1?

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.890
OK lottery is closing.

00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:40.630
Yep?

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.945
AUDIENCE: !, M, M

00:34:41.945 --> 00:34:44.030
BILL THIES: 1 M, M?

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:53.260
1, M, M, OK and last call?

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:57.890
OK I believe two of the ones
submitted are correct.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.190
Is this and, yeah?

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:05.480
OK I think this, N, M, 1, works
and 1, N, M, works.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.830
So let me explain the 1, N,
M, this is how I like

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.000
to think about it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.510
One way to think about this
is we just want to

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.370
move the whole matrix.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.090
You doing OK, yeah?

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.220
OK we just want to
move the whole

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.600
matrix into this splitjoin.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.290
So the way we can do that
is have M columns of the

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.660
splitjoin since we have N
columns of the matrix.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.540
And what we'll do is we'll just
do a round-robin one at a

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.400
time, from the columns of
the matrix into the

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.260
columns of the splitjoin.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.530
So we'll take the first element,
send it to the last,

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.070
next element, next column,
and so on.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.380
So we get the whole matrix here,
Now I want to read it

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.540
out column-wise.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.650
So we'll do a joiner of M. We'll
read M from the left

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.260
stream that'll read all M items
from the columns, send

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.300
it out, and then M items
in the next column, and

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:50.730
then send it out.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:52.490
Does that make sense?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.370
How many people understood
that?

00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.760
All right,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.920
So if you think about it, you
can also do it in M, N, 1.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.310
That's basically, yeah,
it's very similar.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.420
OK there we were.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.990
And yes.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.570
We can do 1, N, M. We basically
read the matrix

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.420
down, and then pull it
down into column.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.260
And it's very easy to write
this as a transpose.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.660
So we just have a transpose
filter in

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.920
which we're doing nothing.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.630
No competition in the actual
rows or the actual contents of

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.790
the splitjoin.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.140
And we just split the data by
1, have N different identity

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.390
filters, and then join it back
together by M. Any questions

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:45.700
about this?

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.080
An interesting way to
write a transpose.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.260
OK so there's one more
opportunity to shine here.

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.660
And that's a little more
interesting permutation called

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.590
a bit-reversed ordering.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:59.120
And so this comes up in an FFT
and another algorithm.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.460
The permutation here, is that
we're taking the data

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.030
at the index n.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.690
And let's say n has binary
digits b sub 0, b sub

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.640
1, up to b sub k.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.390
And we want to rearrange that
data, so this data goes to a

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:15.630
different index with the
reversed bits of its index.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.320
So if it was and index n before,
it ends up at b sub k

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.250
down to b sub 1, b sub 0.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.630
So for example, let's
just look at

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.330
3-digit binary numbers.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.850
If we have 0, 0, 0, this
is 1 input item.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.720
We're reversing those digits,
you still get 0, 0, 0.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.590
Item at index 1 will
be 0, 0, 1.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.330
We want to reorder
that to index 4.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:44.270
OK, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, stays the
same, 0 1, 1, goes to 1,

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.000
1, 0 shifts over.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.040
And from there on,
it's symmetric.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.410
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.540
BILL THIES: Sorry?

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:51.710
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.190
BILL THIES: OK.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.480
So here I'm writing
the indices.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.790
So I'm not writing the data.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.940
So index 0, 1, 2, 3 up through
index 8., or index 7.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.340
OK and on the bottom you have
indices 0 through 7.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.780
So the data will actually be
moved, reordered like that.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.360
Does that make sense?

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.320
It's a reordering of data.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.660
Does this transformation
make sense?

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:13.980
Other questions?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.940
OK, it turns out you can write
this as a splitjoin.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.380
And you just need 3 different
weights for the round-robins.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:26.010
OK round-robin with 1 weight
on the top here, and two

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.480
different round-robin weights
on the bottom.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.460
And here I'm assuming you have 3
binary digits in your index.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.290
So you're reordering
in groups to 8.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.510
OK, so let me give you a second
to think about this.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:40.670
What are the values
for these weights?

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:41.990
I'll give you a hint
in just a second,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.890
or ask another question.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:46.096
Yes?

00:38:46.096 --> 00:38:47.346
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.860
BILL THIES: So what we're doing
here, is we're exposing

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.240
the communication pattern.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.970
That's the thing.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.800
If you write this in an
imperative way, you end up

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.440
basically having your, you're
conflating basically the data

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.930
dependencies with the
reordering pattern.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.150
So what I'm trying to convey
here, is how you can use the

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:09.790
streaming model to show how
you're sending data around.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.410
Because when you're on an
architecture-like cell,

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.610
everything is about
the data motion.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:15.460
You're taking data from one
place and you're trying to

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.080
efficiently get it to the
producers or the consumers.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.400
And you really need to-- the
compiler needs to understand

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.530
the data motion.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.700
And also, it's just another
way of writing it, which I

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.100
think it's actually easier to
understand once you see it.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.990
It's a way to think about the
actual reordering from a

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.060
theoretical standpoint

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.310
Any wagers on this?

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.790
So what we to do, if you think
about the bit-reverse

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.630
ordering, what we want to do is
distribute the data by the

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.300
low-order bits.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.080
And then gather the data
by the high-order bits.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.450
So you want a fine-grained
parity when you're shuffling.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:55.870
You can also do it the
other way around.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.340
It's totally symmetrical.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.230
But one way to think about it
is, you want a fine-grained

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.090
parity when you're distributing
data, and then a

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:03.540
course-grained when you're
coming together.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.050
Anyone see it?

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.740
Give you ten more seconds.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.680
Come on?

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.860
Yeah it is a little
bit tricky.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.030
OK well let me explain
how it works.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.370
So 1, 2, and 4.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:35.900
Ok so what these round-robin 1
splitters do, is these are

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.510
basically the fine-grained
parities.

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.740
So OK, the first round-robin,
that will send all the even

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.450
bits to the left, and all the
odd values to the right.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.060
Right, that's the lowest
order bit.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.370
Because it's doing
every other one,

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.540
shuffling it left and right.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.630
So this round-robin is seeing
only the even values.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.170
Now it's going to split
them up based on who's

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.370
divisible by 4.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.410
Now we'll go to the left
or go to the right.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.610
This is basically shuffling in
the order of the bits, from

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.420
low-order bits to
high-order bits.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.250
So these will be ordered in
terms of their low-order bits.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.050
And now we just want to read
them out from left to right.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.010
Just take the order that we made
with those round-robins,

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.360
and read them out from
left to right.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.480
And since they have 8 values,
you can do that just by

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.410
chunking them up.

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.440
We'll read 2, 2, and then we'll
read these two, 2 and 2,

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.320
and now put all 8.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.010
Does that make sense?

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.100
OK, so yes, it's a bit clever.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.910
So I think it's a nice way
of thinking about what a

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.540
bit-reversed ordering means.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.870
And you can write this in
a very general way.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:37.600
You just have a recursive
bit-reversed

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.930
filter for N values.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.950
And base case, you
only have 2.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.200
So there's no reordering
to do when you when

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.530
you think about it.

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.550
So you're not doing
any computation.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.790
Otherwise yo have a round-robin
split in half, and

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:51.990
then have a coarse-grain
joiner.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:56.060
So, you get a structure
like this.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.700
If you're, as you're building
up, just distributing and then

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.330
bringing back together in
a course-grained way.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.580
OK.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.720
Let's see how do I
don't do this?

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.990
OK so one thing to notice,
there's one more

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.730
example of a splitjoin.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.170
Question?

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.140
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.990
BILL THIES: OK so in general, at
the base of this hierarchy,

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:20.260
we could've added some other
filter to do some competition.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.980
Identity just means we're
doing no computation.

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.230
It's a predefined filter
that just does nothing.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.460
PROFESSOR: On complex data.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.610
BILL THIES: On complex data.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.780
Sorry this is a templated
filter.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.100
So we're reordering
complex values.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.490
And we're passing the
input to the output.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:35.740
Amir?

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:40.050
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.760
BILL THIES: In general the
language does not have support

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.480
for templates.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.570
We only do it for these
base classes.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.570
That's more of an implementation
detail.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:46.860
Yeah.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.010
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.420
BILL THIES: Right now
there isn't, but

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.840
nothing fundamental there.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.060
Yeah?

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.410
Other questions?

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.000
Yeah?

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.864
AUDIENCE: How did you know that
there are two filters

00:42:56.864 --> 00:42:59.510
after that?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.830
BILL THIES: Two filters,
sorry here?

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.030
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.570
BILL THIES: OK.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:07.160
OK.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.180
So we have two add statements
between the

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.740
split and the join.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.650
So that branches to two
parallel streams.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.240
Is that your question?

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:20.673
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:20.673 --> 00:43:20.990
How do you that theorem, that
there's not like three.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.590
BILL THIES: So the compiler
will analyze

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:25.610
this, the compile time.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.360
And it'll know these values of
N and propagate them down at

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.950
compile time.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.660
So it'll basically symbolically
evaluate this

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.010
code, see there are two
branches, and you can unroll

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.180
this communication pattern.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.800
AUDIENCE: I think another way of
thinking about it is, each

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.262
add statement essentially
adds another

00:43:43.262 --> 00:43:44.730
branch in your splitjoin.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.240
PROFESSOR: That is
another box.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.880
BILL THIES: It's about to
get clear actually.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.130
Other questions?

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.580
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.690
BILL THIES: That's one way
to think about it, yeah.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.590
Wait say again, counting?

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.060
AUDIENCE: A rating sort.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.630
BILL THIES: A rating
sort, right.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:07.890
OK, well is it sorting?

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.460
It's not really sorting.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:09.620
AUDIENCE: Well it's not
really sorting.

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.730
BILL THIES: It's
a permutation.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:13.730
AUDIENCE: Could you
do a rating sort?

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:14.940
BILL THIES: You could
do a rating sort.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.050
So actually, what I want to show
next is how you can morph

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.890
this program into a merge sort
by changing only a few lines.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:22.640
OK look carefully.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.710
Don't blink.

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.500
OK there's merge sort.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.710
So very similar pattern.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.440
This is one of those idioms.
It's a recursive idiom with

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.860
splitjoins.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.130
But now in the base case,
we have a sort.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.840
So we would basically
branch down.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.760
What we ended up with was
a sort in the base case.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.800
We're just sorting
a few values.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.080
And we call [? merge sort ?]
twice again, and

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.410
then we do a merge.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.150
So instead of identity at the
base case here, we now have a

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.680
basic sorting routine.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.260
And we merge those results
from both sides.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.850
And the only thing I changed in
terms of the communication

00:44:52.850 --> 00:44:56.100
rate, is to be more efficient
we just distributed data in

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.120
chuncks instead of doing a
fine-grained splitting.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:01.550
Actually you do it however
you want in a merge sort.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:02.360
But this is chunked up.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.960
And let's just zoom in here.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.420
This is how a merger sort
looks in StreamIt.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.480
So we split the data two ways,
both directions, come

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.210
together, do a sort on both
sides, and then you merge.

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.840
And so by having the, you know
you can interleave pipelines

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.030
and splitjoins like this.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.720
So you have these hierarchical
structures that are coming

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:21.350
back together.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.420
Does this make sense?

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.890
OK.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.830
I'm going to hold off on
messaging actually.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.830
Let me see, what do
I want to cover?

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.330
OK let me actually
skip to the end.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:38.580
Oh, I can show you this.

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.380
Yeah, I'm going to cut
short a little bit.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:44.860
So here's how other programs
look written in StreamIt.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.110
OK, you can have
a Bitonic sort.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.840
OK so you see a lot of these
regular structures.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.340
And the compiler can unroll
this and then

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.320
match it to the substrate.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.380
This is how and FFT looks.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.740
It's quite an ah elegant
implementation of an FFT.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.430
It'd be good to go into
in more detail.

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.560
You can do things like block
matrix multiply.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.420
You don't always have to have
column or row-wise ordering.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.420
It's natural to split
things up like this.

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.400
We have a lot of DSP algorithms,
the filter bank,

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.790
FM radio with equalizer,
radar array front end.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.040
Here's an MP3 decoder.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.160
And let's see, I'm going to
skip this section and just

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.410
give you a taste for
the end here.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.190
I'm skipping a hundred slides.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.840
Yeah.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.100
OK so if I give you a feel.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.990
Our biggest program written
in StreamIt so far, is the

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.680
complete MPEG-2 encoder
and decoder.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.940
So here is MPEG-2 decoder.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.720
And I think you've seen
block diagrams of this

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.420
already in the class.

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.800
And so it's a pretty
natural expression.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.590
You can really get a feel for
the high-level structure of

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.250
the algorithm mapping down.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.430
And for example, here on the
top we're doing the spatial

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.980
decoding looking inside
each frame.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.170
Whereas at the bottom we're
doing the temporal decoding

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.580
between two frames, the
motion compensation.

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.970
And one thing that I didn't have
a chance to mention, is

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.540
that we have a concept of
teleport messaging.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.070
What this means is, I showed you
how the steady state flow

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.270
data goes between these
actors in the stream.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.820
But sometimes you want to
control the stream as well.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.280
For example, this is
a variable length

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.050
decoder at the top.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.010
It's parsing the input data.

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.390
It might want to change how the
processing is happening

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.260
downstream.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.180
For example, say that you have--
you know in this case

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.430
you have different picture
types coming in.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.320
And you want to tell other
components to change their

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.370
processing based on a
non-local effect.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:32.340
And that's hard to do if you
just want static data rates.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.180
But what we have is this limited
notion of limited

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.660
dynamism, where you're basically
poking into somebody

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.730
else's stream.

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.600
And we let you do that
very precisely.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.440
I don't have time to go into
the details, but you can

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.500
basically synchronize the
arrival of these messages with

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.220
the data that's also flowing
through the stream, And so in

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.340
this case, were sending through
the picture type.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.320
And it really simplifies
the program code.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.430
I didn't have time for details,
but why don't we put

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:57.530
in the slides anyway, if
you're interested.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.350
And if you do a similar
communication pattern in C,

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:01.760
it's a little bit
of a nightmare.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.020
You have all these different,
basically memory spaces,

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.320
different files.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.570
And the control information
is basically going left

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:09.980
and right all over.

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.650
So this really helps both the
compiler and the programmer as

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.080
well in StreamIt.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.220
So it's all implemented.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.720
It's about 2,000 lines
of code in StreamIt.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.100
Which is about 2/3 of the size
of the C code, taking into

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.020
account similar functionality
there.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.120
And it's a pretty big program.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.780
You can write 48 static streams.
And then we expand

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.400
that to more than 600
instantiated filters.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.970
So this gives you a lot of
flexibility when you're trying

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:32.750
to get parallelism.

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:33.260
Question?

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.920
AUDIENCE: When a compiler
downloads all bytes?

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.780
BILL THIES: Oh the object
code, you mean.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.920
OK, so right now our current
implementation, we duplicate a

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.990
lot of code.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.600
So it end up being bigger
than it needs to be.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.820
There's no reason for
us to do that.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.630
That's kind of a-- we have
a research compiler

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:49.640
that make that easy.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.240
AUDIENCE: So object-wise
, its not data.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.350
BILL THIES: Object-wise we
still need to do that

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.120
comparison.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.830
Yeah that's a good question.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:58.660
Yeah.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.940
Other questions?

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.070
OK so let me cut to the end.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.360
OK, so we have the StreamIt
language.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:05.940
And we think it really

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.570
preserves the program structure.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.620
It's a new way of thinking about
how you orchestrate the

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.100
data reordering with the
splitjoins, showing you who is

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.470
communicating to who, and how
you can stitch together

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:16.980
different pieces in your
program development.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.400
And again, really our goal is to
get this scalable multicore

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.170
performance.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:22.840
But you can't get people
on board just on

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840
a performance stat.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.540
You need to show them a new
programming model that

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.250
actually makes their
lives easier.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.870
So that's what we're
working on.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.060
And thinks with listening.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.450
BILL THIES: Any last
questions?

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:37.940
Yes?

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:42.770
AUDIENCE: So in the
anti-decoder, you have a lot

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:47.110
of computations size that were
not sequential streams. Like

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:52.300
for example, the output of the
distinct cosine transform is

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:57.750
not a stream of pixel, you are
going to have coefficients and

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:58.080
things like that.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:59.500
Which are a logical
sort of chunk.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.780
BILL THIES: Yes so depending
on the granularity of the

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.730
competition, you don't need to
pass individual values over

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:08.610
the stream.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.540
For example, you can have a
stream that inputs the whole

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.980
array at a time.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.120
And so we basically advocate
that if you have something

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.520
that course-grained, you should
be passing an array or

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.660
a macroblock, in the case of
MPEG, or a set of coefficients

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.650
in a structure.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.060
So when you have coarse-grain
parallelism, you write your

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.630
program in a course-grained
way.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:28.600
The fine-grained things
I showed for the bit

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.560
interleaving and so on, is
more for the fine-grained

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.260
programs. AUDIENCE:
Can you do both?

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:38.305
In the sense that can you stream
over an array, so it's

00:50:38.305 --> 00:50:39.780
stream of stream, so to speak.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.270
BILL THIES: So there's an
interesting multidimensional

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.760
problem there.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.700
Right now we've taken a
1-dimensional approach.

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.360
So far it's basically the
programmer has to set an

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.500
iteration order, and end up with
a 1-dimensional stream

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.200
coming into and out
of every filter.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.780
We're working on
extending that.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.020
Yeah, but when you have
basically streams of

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.210
2-dimensional data, you like the
freedom to either iterate

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.340
basically in time or
in space, depending

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.350
on what you're doing.

00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:05.180
And so I think that's more
of a research problem.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:08.240
So far we're just been doing a
1-dimensional representation.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.590
Yeah good point.

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:13.650
Other questions?

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.370
Yeah?

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.290
AUDIENCE: Why did you decide on
this synchronous dataflow

00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:19.620
model as opposed to something
more general?

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.180
BILL THIES: So our philosophy
has been that you want to

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:27.180
start with the most kind of
basic block of a stream

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.850
program, and optimize
it really well.

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.340
And then you can stitch
those together into

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.510
higher level blocks.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:34.770
So we think of synchronous
dataflow as being kind of the

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.750
basic block of streaming.

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.790
You know what's coming in, you
know what's coming out.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:41.390
And even if you have a more
general model, they'll be

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.750
pieces that fit under their
synchronous dataflow model.

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.490
And so we saw a lot
of optimizations

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:47.720
opportunities in there.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.100
And really knowing those IO
rates can let you do a lot of

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.180
things that you can't do
in a general model.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.010
So I wanted to get the simple
case right first. And actually

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:58.010
kind of our focus now is on
expanding, and how do you look

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.960
at the heterogeneous system, and
how do you optimize a more

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.980
dynamic system.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.230
Yep.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.520
Other questions?

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.420
OK.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.180
Yes.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.140
You can check out
our web page.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.550
Yeah if you Google for
StreamIt, I'm sure

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.770
you can find it.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.930
Yeah, we have a public
release.

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:22.380
Yes, send us any problems.
It's actually it's a good

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.050
test. We want to make sure
it works for everyone.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.830
But I mean, we've had, you know,
hundreds of downloads.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.930
There are a lot of people
using StreamIt.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:31.440
It shouldn't break if
you download it.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.690
Yeah.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.500
OK good.

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.750
Thanks.
