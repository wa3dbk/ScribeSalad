00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.780
PROFESSOR: All right, everyone.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.360
Welcome back.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.240
Today we're going to
talk about the profiling

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.120
tools available on Cell
to help you evaluate

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.550
how your programs are running.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.260
In the next hour
I'll talk about SIMD,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.450
which is how you can take
advantage of the hardware

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.015
support for data
parallelization.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.370
First up, I'd like to follow
up with some questions

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.860
that we had last time
about gdb, and then I'll

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.330
discuss some of the various
methods for profiling on Cell.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.120
I'll talk about
the Cell simulator

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680
and using the decrementers,
and then we're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.810
going to talk about static
profiling and instruction

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.120
reordering, which I started
to get into last time.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.120
So first up, we ran
into some problems

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.980
last time with gdb,
various error messages.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.470
First thing,
sometimes gbd is going

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.400
to examine the wrong
variable, as we saw

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.364
when the names are ambiguous.

00:01:14.364 --> 00:01:15.780
One thing you can
do to get around

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.080
this-- we had problems
with ambiguity

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100
between variables, which have
the same name where one of them

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.520
was in the spu thread and one
of them was in the ppu thread.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.530
And so to work around
this, one thing you can do

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.480
is use spu-gdb, which will
just log on to a particular spu

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.780
thread, then you can just
look for variable names

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.410
in that thread.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.600
You can also, of course,
rename your variables.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.490
Second problem is
that sometimes gdb

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.500
will delete your
breakpoints before you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.470
want it to delete them.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.690
Reason being, it will
remove breakpoints

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.260
whenever the program
associated with a breakpoint

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.530
has been unloaded.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530
But sometimes you have
more than one thread

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.730
running the same program,
and so the second one you

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.620
won't be able to break into.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.860
So again, you can use spu-gdb
to log on to a particular thread

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.440
if you want to do that.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.740
Another thing you can do is
for example put a delay loop

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.620
at the end of your
spu thread in order

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.120
to keep that thread running
for as long as possible.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.540
It seems that as long as gdb
doesn't unload that thread,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.520
then it won't delete
your breakpoint.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.770
And finally, I saw this kind
of cryptic error thread event

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.250
breakpoint gdb should not stop.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.110
Indeed it shouldn't.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.780
One thing, to get
around this, it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.730
seems that this problem
doesn't happen on spu-gdb.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.690
So I'll just recap how to use
spu-gdb to debug your programs.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.400
Last time we were
using mostly ppu-gdb,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.080
which will help you debug
kind of both your PPU program

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.879
and your SPU program together.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.920
And you're able to switch
between all the threads

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.190
that are available.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.340
On the other hand, when
you're using spu-gdb,

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.900
it's just going to log on
to a particular SPU thread.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.530
So what you do is you invoke
your original people PPU

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.980
program with SPU
debug star equals 1.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.190
And then you can background it.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.760
Now what happens is every
time that your-- every time

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.530
that your SPU-- sorry, every
time that your program spawns

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.427
a new SPU thread, it
will print the process ID

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:27.510
and then actually that
thread, the spawned thread,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.510
will stop and wait for a
debugger to attach to it.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.080
So at this point, you can run
spu-gdb -p and then the process

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.390
number that they give you.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.870
And when you attach to it,
you can continue that thread

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.002
to resume debugging.

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:41.585
Any questions?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.910
OK, so the Cell simulator
is one of the tools

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.845
that we have available
to help you debug.

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:02.970
This is how you invoke it
if you have it installed,

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.660
opt/ibm/systemsim
cell/bin/systemsim,

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.050
and you want to use -g to
use the graphical interface.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.320
And a little window will
pop up and you'll click Go.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.450
The window looks like this.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.080
It actually, from
here, you can have

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.663
a lot of fine-grained
control over how

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:17.740
your program is running.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.420
In fact you can advance the
state of the simulation cycle

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.561
by cycle to look at what's going
on inside the simulated Cell

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:26.060
system.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.520
And when you boot
up this simulator,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.070
you can actually get a complete
Linux environment in there

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.660
with an x term.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.550
And what you can do in
this Linux environment is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.201
you can copy over programs
and then you can--

00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:44.700
you can copy over programs which
were compiled for the Cell,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.783
and then you can run them.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.590
In order to transfer a program
to your simulated system

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.750
so that you can run it,
you can use this function--

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.810
or you can use this
program call through which

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.740
is available on the
simulated system.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.830
And what it will
do is it will grab

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.710
onto a file which is on the
host system and copy it in.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.100
And it will just
put it on standard

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.979
out so you can redirect it
to whatever file you want.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.520
And then when you
make it executable,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.205
then you can run it.

00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:17.080
All right, questions?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.320
While you're in
the simulator, you

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.160
can view a lot of
different things.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.020
You can get a lot of information
about the state of the machine.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.860
In particular, you can
look at the registers

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.794
at any particular time, again
with clock step by clock step.

00:05:37.794 --> 00:05:40.460
This might not be as interesting
now that you have the debugger.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.530
And you can run the
debugger on real hardware.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.740
But one thing which
the Cell simulator does

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.820
get you is these
dynamic profiling tools.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.990
And what it will
do is it will look

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.510
at the state of the simulation
and it will figure out

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.440
where things are stalling,
where the time is

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.310
being spent by the processor.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.910
And you can get separate
stats like these.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.930
Let's see, it tells you, for
example, total cycle count

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.820
stalls for various reasons.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.760
You get all these
statistics separately

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.430
for the PPU and each SPU.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.090
So this can be very helpful
if you're trying to do,

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.530
for example, you're
trying to figure out

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.610
exactly what's
going on each SPU,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.490
do load balancing, whatever.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.310
And so these
statistics will hold--

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.730
these statistics will cover
whatever length of the program

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.462
you run.

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:35.420
But you can also get more
fine-grain statistics

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.690
using these profiling functions.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.410
So if you include profile
dot H in your program,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.300
then you get access
to these functions,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.700
profile clear, start, and stop.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.140
And what these will
do is they actually--

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.970
when they get compiled
into your program,

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.170
there are no ops when you run
them on a real Cell processor.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.430
But the simulator will be
able to latch onto them

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.740
and you can use those to start
and stop regions of interest

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.730
for profiling.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.747
Now the simulator
comes with the SDK,

00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:09.580
and it's a little bit
cumbersome to install.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.150
So we haven't made it available
yet on the actual PS3 hardware.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.610
You can run it on x86, and so
if your group would like to get

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.680
set up with that on
one of your computers,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.195
or we'll try and make it
available on our hardware

00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:24.320
if there's enough interest.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.340
So please let us know.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:39.250
OK, the next thing we'll
cover is using decrementers

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.070
to profile your program.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.176
This is one way you can use
dynamic profiling, which

00:07:45.176 --> 00:07:46.800
actually doesn't
require the simulator.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.130
So when you get information
from the decrementers,

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.000
you can run these programs
on your actual Cell hardware.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.670
Basically the
decrementer is just

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.490
a counter that counts
down at a constant rate.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.490
So you can use it as
a clock to figure out

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.490
how long different
events are lasting.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:11.230
And the rate at which the
decrementer counts down

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.360
is not that fast.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.830
So you're not going to be
able to use it to time things

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.480
on the order of a
few clock cycles.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.390
It's best for
timing things which

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.200
are maybe on the
order of thousands

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.190
of instructions in length.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:36.919
And how you use it is there
are these SPU write channel

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.280
and SPU read channel
functions which

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.470
give you access to some of
the internals of the Cell

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:42.970
processor.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.030
And so here's an example
setup you can use.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.000
Basically, first you
call write channel,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.640
and you pass in this
MFC_DECREMENTER_EVENT thing.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.654
And what that will do is
initialize this decrementer

00:09:00.654 --> 00:09:01.320
counter for you.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.780
And then you read the value
before and after the function

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.370
you want to profile,
and when you subtract,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.580
that just gives you the length
or the time that was elapsed

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.974
in some arbitrary units.

00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:20.390
And of course,
it's counting down,

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.190
so you want to subtract
the start from the end.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.480
And after you're
done using it, you

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.080
can do another write
channel to stop

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.269
the counter from continuing.

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:33.310
All right, any questions?

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.420
OK, let's continue talking about
instruction reordering, which

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.952
I started last time.

00:09:47.952 --> 00:09:50.410
So I'm going to kind of start
from the beginning this time,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.010
and maybe it'll
be more coherent.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.810
So on the Cell
architecture, when

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.600
you're looking at what
instructions are being run,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.870
the instructions are mostly
going to be of the form

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.420
evaluate some function
of some of the registers

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.330
and write the result
to some other register.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.500
And the assembly
file are what you

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.580
get when you run
with GCC-S is just

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.960
going to be a human-readable
representation

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.550
of these instructions.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.915
And I'll show you how to
read that actually later.

00:10:21.915 --> 00:10:23.540
And you can think of
these instructions

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.200
just as executing in series
just in the order in which they

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.530
appear in the assembly.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.120
So if you think of one
instruction starting and then

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.340
finishing, the next
instruction comes in,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.150
finishes, that should be
consistent with the actual

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.340
behavior of the hardware.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.630
Now for real hardware,
waiting for one instruction

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.680
to finish before the next one
starts is going to be too slow.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.060
So there are these various
optimizations we pull

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.460
or that they do on
the hardware in order

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.540
to run instructions sooner than
when the previous instruction

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.870
finishes.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.752
So the big one of
these is pipelining,

00:11:02.752 --> 00:11:04.960
where you have multiple
stages inside your processor,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.135
and you can run
each instruction--

00:11:07.135 --> 00:11:10.070
you can push each instruction
in before the previous one has

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.270
completed.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.530
And in pipelining,
you're going to be

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.230
subject to these dependencies
between instructions.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.880
For example, if one
instruction reads from a value

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.490
that the previous
instruction wrote, then

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.700
clearly you can't start
the second instruction

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.960
until after the first
instruction has completed.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.450
The Cell processor also has--
actually has multiple pipelines

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.470
in which you can
insert instructions

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.320
and another
optimization that they

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.620
do is branch prediction
in order to reduce stalls

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.030
from branching.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:50.820
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.150
AUDIENCE: Can you talk about
static branch prediction?

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.604
PROFESSOR: Yes, so static
branch prediction means--

00:11:56.604 --> 00:11:58.270
or, rather the way
it's done on the Cell

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.050
is that what's
predicted for the branch

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:07.810
is not going to be affected by
the history of which branches

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.020
have been taken.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.690
And some other
processors actually

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.015
do use this information.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:22.020
All right, now the
thing about pipelining

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.760
is that because we
still have to honor

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.980
these dependencies
between instructions,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.140
the order in which we
evaluate instructions,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.400
that's going to make a
difference on how long

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.940
the program runs.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.640
So let's take the
simple example where

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.290
we have three
instructions, a, b, and c,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.850
and we have this
pipeline processor where

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:44.120
we can insert instructions
at these clock ticks.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.710
So suppose that c
depends on b, and there

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.734
are no other dependencies
in the system.

00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:52.150
Then this sequence
of instructions

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.800
is going to take five
cycles, because we

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.250
can push b in after
the first cycle,

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.580
but we can't push c in
until two cycles after that.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.001
Is that clear?

00:13:02.001 --> 00:13:02.500
Questions?

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.140
All right, now because
c depends on b,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.630
it kind of makes sense to
push b as far up as we can in

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.310
order to ease this dependency.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.710
So if we execute b before
a instead of after a--

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.010
and remember we can
reorder b and a however

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.620
we want because there's no
dependencies between them--

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.290
then we can start b at the first
tick, then we put in a right

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.350
after that, and then c.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.210
And now the sequence only
takes four clock cycles.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.780
All right?

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.721
So observe that, when we put
in c in this third clock cycle,

00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:40.970
we actually couldn't have
put in the third instruction

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.217
any sooner, no matter what
the dependencies were.

00:13:45.217 --> 00:13:46.800
And so in general,
we're going to want

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.800
that to be the case where
we want instructions

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.690
to be waiting on the pipeline
rather than on dependencies.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.170
So that means in
the first picture

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.941
there's this stall
of one clock cycle,

00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:03.440
and we're going to
want to eliminate

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.881
these kinds of stalls.

00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:05.380
All right?

00:14:10.804 --> 00:14:12.220
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.530
going to use these static
profiling tools to figure out

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.250
where stalls happen.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.150
Now the first thing we're going
to do-- the first thing that we

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.700
have to do is generate the
assembly and the instruction

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.660
schedule that goes with it.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.390
And so you can use GCC -S, and
the same flag works with xlc

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.300
to generate the assembly.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.960
And then we have this
utility called spu_timing,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.580
which runs on the Cell,
and which will tell you

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.410
the instruction schedule.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.490
Basically it'll take
in your assembly file

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.265
and tell you exactly when each
instruction in that assembly

00:14:45.265 --> 00:14:45.890
gets scheduled.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.490
If you call it with
-running-count,

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.375
then it'll tell you the
running count of clock cycles

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:55.750
at each stage,
which means if you

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.560
look at the last number,
that will tell you

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.450
how long your program took
to run in clock cycles.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.330
And we'll write the
output to a file

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.560
with the same name as the input
but with dot timing at the end.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.070
Now if you're
using our Makefile,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.810
you can actually do all
this, generate the assembly

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:18.430
and the timing info, all in
one step by doing SPU_TIMING=1

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.370
and then make the name of
the .s file, all right?

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.670
Now if you'll
recall on Cell we're

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.870
going to have only
in-order execution.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.570
The instructions are just
going to execute in the order

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.990
that they're specified
in the assembly.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:42.847
And because the Cell
has dual pipelines,

00:15:42.847 --> 00:15:45.430
that means there's two pipelines
in which instructions can go,

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.410
and the pipelines are
going to be selected just

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.220
based on the instruction type.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.080
And of course, two
instructions are only

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.492
going to go in simultaneously
when the dependencies allow it.

00:15:57.492 --> 00:15:58.408
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:00.922 --> 00:16:01.630
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.980
So if you're looking
at the assembly,

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.550
you're going to see lots
of lines of this form OP

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:14.000
DESTINATION and then
the source registers.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.599
So when you're trying to
figure out dependencies,

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:18.390
it's going to be helpful
to be able to look

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.600
at each line of the
assembly and figure out

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.900
what registers that
line is reading from,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.160
and what registers that
line is spreading to.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.280
And there's also information
in the assembly file

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.280
I went into that last
time, which tells you

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.880
kind of for each
chunk of assembly what

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.830
the corresponding
source file line is.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.060
All right, and the actual
output of the static profiler,

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.380
like I said, it will
spit out a schedule

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.450
of when each instruction runs.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.750
And in the schedule,
you're going

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.290
to see one digit for each
cycle that the instruction is

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:58.870
running.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.730
So however many
digits there are,

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.460
that's how many
cycles are being used.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.839
And in front of some
of the instructions,

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.930
you're going to see these
dashes which represent stalls.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.790
So these three dashes in
front of this instruction fm

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.560
means that based
on the pipeline,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.980
you could've scheduled
this instruction up here

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.569
right after the previous
instruction finished.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.420
However, because you're waiting
on particular dependencies,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.560
you're only going to
be able to schedule it

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.770
these three cycles later.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.230
So that's a three cycle stall.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.030
And the static
profile output is also

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.820
going to show other information.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.660
The original assembly appears
on the right-hand side.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.090
And which pipeline the
instructions are going into

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.870
is going to show up on the left.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.928
Any questions about this format?

00:17:50.928 --> 00:17:53.207
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:55.540
PROFESSOR: Dual-issue just
means that these instructions

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.645
are going to be executed
at the same time.

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.609
AUDIENCE: So can
people figure out,

00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:04.064
for example, what is the
latency for fm instruction?

00:18:04.064 --> 00:18:06.028
How many circles does fm take?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.866
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:14.866 --> 00:18:17.062
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:17.812
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:18:17.812 --> 00:18:20.758
AUDIENCE: What are the
numbers on the right?

00:18:20.758 --> 00:18:22.329
PROFESSOR: Over here?

00:18:22.329 --> 00:18:23.870
All right, so these
are the arguments

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.620
to the assembly instructions.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.953
So remember the first one is
going to be the destination

00:18:27.953 --> 00:18:30.950
register and the other ones
are going to be all the source

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.130
registers that that
instruction is going to use.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:43.140
All right, so
again, we want to be

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.710
able to reorder these
instructions to minimize

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.240
stalls.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.489
And what you're
going to do is you're

00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:51.280
going to try and look
for instructions that

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.877
are going to take a long time
potentially, for example, loads

00:18:54.877 --> 00:18:57.460
and floating point instructions
are going to take a long time.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.300
And of these instructions
have dependencies

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.750
then those dependencies
are going to stall.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.702
So not only do you want
to minimize stalls,

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:10.160
you also want to dual issue
instructions whenever possible,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.285
although that's a little
bit more difficult to just

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:14.530
kind of eyeball.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.390
But anyway, if you get up to
the ideal running point, where

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.890
you're able to dual issue every
instruction, then that means

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.940
you're going to be running
two instructions per cycle,

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.170
or it's going to take 1/2
cycle per instruction.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.490
Anyway, going through
these assembly files,

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.539
and figuring out where
the dependencies are,

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.080
which instructions you can move
around, it's kind of tedious,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.040
and you're not going to be
able to apply these techniques

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.890
to your entire program.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.744
So if you only
have limited time,

00:19:43.744 --> 00:19:45.160
what you're going
to have to do is

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.700
try these on the most
critical code first.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.590
And that's usually
going to be loop bodies,

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.990
because those are going to
get executed many, many times.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.610
And any savings
that you see there

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.450
will be multiplied
many, many times over.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.320
So I'm going to go
through an example

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.990
of one possible
optimization you could do.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.490
So we'll actually go
through these same files

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:16.130
in the exercise about
two minutes from now.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.580
This is from Lab 1.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.340
And this is one of
the code snippets

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:28.050
or the assembly snippets
from the SPU program.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:32.180
So notice that over
here we have these load

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.280
instructions followed
by a, I guess

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:37.670
this is a shift instruction.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.370
And there's two pairs of these.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.500
And in each one, the
shift instruction

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.060
is going to depend on the
result of the previous load.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.810
Does everyone see that
from the arguments?

00:20:50.886 --> 00:20:53.260
So now the problem is that
because the shift is happening

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.280
right after the load, it's
going to stall for a long time,

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.650
because the load
takes six cycles.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.644
All right, so what
can we do over here

00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:03.810
in order to reduce stalling?

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.940
Yep?

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.840
AUDIENCE: Two
loads concurrently?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.026
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we can
do the loads concurrently,

00:21:12.026 --> 00:21:14.150
and in general, we just
want to move these loads up

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.070
as high as we can.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:24.030
So if I move the two loads
up to the top of this--

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.340
oops-- the top of
this snippet, then we

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:30.130
have two loads followed
by all the instructions

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.180
that came after.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.890
Now the first shift is going
to stall by only two cycles,

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.020
and the second shift is
not going to stall at all.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:39.870
All right?

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:40.786
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.665
PROFESSOR: So, pardon?

00:21:46.665 --> 00:21:47.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.224
PROFESSOR: So the question is
what would this change look

00:21:50.224 --> 00:21:51.170
like in code?

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.190
The thing is that
kind of the order

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.640
of these generate
instructions is

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.434
going to be dependent
on the compiler,

00:21:56.434 --> 00:21:57.850
and it's really
up to the compiler

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.890
how it wants to order
these instructions.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.380
So this change is
not going to be

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.240
reflected in like your C code.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.050
And that's why you have
to do these optimizations

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.050
after the assembly is generated.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.097
Does that make sense?

00:22:11.097 --> 00:22:12.013
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.700
PROFESSOR: If you
have a smart compiler

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.160
then it might do some kind
of instruction scheduling

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.010
in order to minimize stalls
using this methodology.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:27.684
Yup?

00:22:27.684 --> 00:22:30.054
AUDIENCE: I'm quite
impressed with XLC.

00:22:30.054 --> 00:22:33.500
I compiled the same
program under GCC

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.260
for SPU with optimization
level 3 under XLC.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.760
XLC ran in half the time.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.475
So it was doing a much better
job of instruction scheduling--

00:22:45.475 --> 00:22:46.266
AUDIENCE: Than GCC?

00:22:46.266 --> 00:22:48.780
AUDIENCE: Than GCC.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.950
So that's something,
if you've got a choice,

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:56.430
and the XLC compiler
is working for you--

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:00.210
AUDIENCE: In general, this kind
of sort of low-level assembly

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.980
hacking for instruction ordering
is not something you'll do,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.450
just because
compilers are getting

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.090
incredibly good at doing
instruction scheduling.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.660
But here the exercise is for
you to sort of get familiar

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.695
with the tools and
understand a little bit more

00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:16.140
in detail as to what's
going on at the instruction

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.110
level [INAUDIBLE] pipelines.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.370
Another thing to
note here is, well,

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.676
two things you could
consider here, how high up

00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:26.920
can you push the limits?

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.510
And related to that is, why
can't you completely hide

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.520
the latency for the first load,
and hence the first shift still

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.550
takes two seconds to stall.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.605
So that's dependent
upon how much slack

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:41.630
do you have in your schedule,
dependent on dependencies

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.825
and where the loops starts.

00:23:43.825 --> 00:23:45.200
So in some cases,
you just simply

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.520
can't hide the entire latency.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.446
So it's part of considerations
you have to consider.

00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:52.820
But [INAUDIBLE]
and the compilers

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.796
are getting really good at it.

00:23:56.994 --> 00:23:58.660
PROFESSOR: And in
case you're wondering,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.840
I think this code
was compiled using

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.960
XLC on no
optimizations, which is

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.280
why there's this really easy
opportunity for optimization

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.450
here.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.090
It turns out, if we run
the timing utility again,

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.570
we saved eight cycles.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.490
So notice that on
the previous picture,

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.910
we're going up to
seven in that column.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:27.630
And now we're only going up to
the previous nine, all right?

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.620
So what we're going to do for
the exercise right now is you

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.874
can try something like this.

00:24:32.874 --> 00:24:35.290
What we're going to try and
do is just improve performance

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.490
by rescheduling instructions.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.540
And so if you
download the tarball,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.520
you'll get the exact same
file I was working on before.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.880
And what we're going to
have you do is just generate

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.220
the assembly, practice
generating the assembly,

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.390
modifying it, and then
continuing with the rest of the

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.670
build process to
get a new object

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.709
file that's based on
your modified assembly.

00:24:58.709 --> 00:24:59.750
All right, any questions?

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.800
Now you just need to find,
for example, one opportunity

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.830
for optimization.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.840
And you can do the exact same
thing that I did, if you want.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.080
And so the key is just after
you've done your reordering,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.930
you want to re-run
the timing utility

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.930
to see how many
cycles you saved.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.700
Also you want to, of course,
continue the build process

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.070
to get the final
executable file.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.570
And you want to run that just
to make sure that your code is

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.206
still correct.

00:25:28.206 --> 00:25:30.696
AUDIENCE: Are we
able to get this?

00:25:30.696 --> 00:27:16.400
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.840
PROFESSOR: OK, so this
static profiling process does

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.290
have its limitations.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.520
The first is that, and this
is a pretty major limitation,

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.240
the static profiler assumes that
none of the branches are taken.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.900
So basically it just zips
through the entire assembly

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.210
file in a straight line.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.740
So that means you're
going to have a skewed

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.942
view of how long code inside
conditionals or loop bodies is

00:27:41.942 --> 00:27:43.900
going to take, because
conditionals, if there's

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.170
savings in there, they
may not run at all.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.250
And loop bodies,
any savings in there

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.170
may get multiplied
many, many times.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.950
So if, for example,
you see that you've

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.660
saved eight cycles in
the static scheduling,

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.510
you're going to need to
know some more context, that

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.150
is whether it's
inside a loop body

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.019
and how many times you
expect that to run.

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:06.060
So you're going to need
a little more information

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.980
to get a good idea of how these
instruction reorderings are

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.630
actually affecting the
runtime of your program.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:14.750
And also, because this is
static profiling, which

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.650
means you're not using an
actual program run to get data,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.522
you're not going
to get behavior--

00:28:21.522 --> 00:28:23.730
you're not going to capture
any behavior that depends

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.720
on the inputs to your program.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:31.160
So for example, you don't
get counts of how many times

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.810
each loop runs, or when
each branch is taken.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.120
One other thing to
worry about, which

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:44.330
isn't going to be manifested
in these static profiling

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.694
predictions, is
branch prediction.

00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:49.360
Now remember the
static profiler is just

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.110
going to ignore all branches.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.630
And the thing is that
branch prediction,

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.260
because branch
prediction is used

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.890
to reduce the stall
after a branch is taken

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.780
by kind of pre-fetching
instructions

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.370
and possibly doing other things.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.310
So what we'll do is
guess the direction

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.654
that the branch will take.

00:29:07.654 --> 00:29:09.570
And then we'll start
pre-fetching instructions

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.870
from the expected
place where it's going

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.390
to resume after the branch.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:18.150
And the thing is, if your
branch prediction is wrong,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.010
then you're going to incur
a pretty large penalty.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.190
And the penalty is on
the order of 20 cycles

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.940
while it flushes the
pipeline and starts

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.980
fetching instructions
from the new place.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.670
On the other hand, if branch
prediction is correct,

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.450
then there's no penalty
at all, actually.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:34.910
So the next
instruction will just

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.340
resume right after the branch.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.350
Anyway, you can give
hints to the compiler

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.590
to tell it what you think the
outcomes of branches will be.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.540
And this can help in
some circumstances.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.510
Basically there are these
macros that you can define.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:58.710
And what you're going to use is
this built-in expect compiler

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.850
intrinsic, and
what that means is

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.170
if you put that inside
an if, it will mean,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.740
you know, run the if as
if the condition were exp.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.990
But then I'm going to
expect that the value

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.870
of this condition is going to
be, for example, true or false.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.100
All right, does that make sense?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.940
Anyway, just one note about
the exercise that you did.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:28.560
I believe the original run
time was 469 clock cycles.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.480
Actually, if you run XLC
with 05 optimizations,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:39.610
it will reduce that to 188, so
almost 280 cycles of savings.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:43.614
All right, so we'll-- pardon?

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:47.970
AUDIENCE: The one that
we just [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.750
PROFESSOR: No, so the
original code was--

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.150
the original assembly
was compiled on O 0,

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.270
or no optimizations.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.670
But then if you're doing
an optimization by hand,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.470
it saves eight
cycles off of O 0.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.260
These are actually
pretty easy to find.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.540
And the 05 optimization level
will actually shave off 280

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.260
cycles.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.880
So we'll break for
about 10 minutes,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.670
and then after the break,
we'll do SIMD on Cell.
