00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.903
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: So I'm
Arvind and this is Micah.

00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:29.290
And we worked together on a
framework for flexible stream

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.530
processing on the cell.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.999
So we were also oriented
towards an application which is,

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.290
in this case, a software radio.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.622
And we used this
application as a case study.

00:00:37.622 --> 00:00:38.330
Where is the mic?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.230
I'll try and speak
as loud as I can.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
So our project was about
flexible stream processing

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.030
framework for the cell.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.870
And we used the software
radios as a case study,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.620
essentially, of an
application you could

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.480
build using this framework.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.990
The motivation for our
project is essentially

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.490
what we've been
discussing in class.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.380
It's been reiterated.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.940
The cell isn't easy to program.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.530
There's no shared memory.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.541
There's just message passing,
which is quite messy.

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.540
You have to explicitly
parallelize your programs

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.452
if you want to write them
as, say, custom C programs.

00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:13.410
Some of the groups have
describe the challenges

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.660
they faced when doing that.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.470
Extracting parallelism
can be tricky.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.700
For example, if you want to
do pipelining, then on DSPs

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130
you have to predict
what addresses

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.290
you're going to
require, and set up

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.210
a DMA so that those addresses
are fetched in advance.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.680
And as Bill mentioned
in his talk in class,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.590
stream programming can help
alleviate some of these issues

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.090
for some applications,
like software radio

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.015
where the applications
fit naturally

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.790
into the streaming model.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.110
So what we tried to
do for our project

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.100
was build a light
weight-- as light weight

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.910
as possible because the
code has to fit on DSPs,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.140
but as expressive as possible,
as well, so as to simplify life

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.274
for developers.

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:55.940
The streaming framework which is
targeted specifically at signal

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.870
processing applications.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.960
The data model, at least, is
based on a research project

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.720
that I have worked
on in the past, which

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.520
is a WaveScope streaming
database management system.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.480
It is is a research project
with the database group.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.240
The data model is essentially
an extension of the streaming

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.940
model to handle
larger blocks of data

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.149
so as to process them better.

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.189
For example, several signal
processing operators,

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.830
like the fast Fourier
transform, need

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.270
to do multiple
passes over the data

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.240
and, therefore, trying to
treat streams on a sample

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.300
by sample basis
leads to high cost,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.790
scheduling overhead, as
well as inefficiency.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.380
So that's what the
data model does.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.170
And we tried to port
this data model over

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.100
to the cell processor
and see how well we

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.150
could exploit the features
of the cell processor.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.730
In particular, the high on-chip
bandwidth between the SPEs

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.860
to do with streaming.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.865
So our case study was, as we
mentioned, a simple software

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:51.690
radio application.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.481
It's really simple.

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:57.600
It uses incoherent demodulation,
as well as just simple

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.150
amplitude-shift key modulation.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.900
As I said, the main
goals of our framework

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.034
were to simplify
life and modeling

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.575
as much parallelism
as possible-- try

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:08.170
and extract pipeline
parallelism, data parallelism.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.650
Some of the kinds of
parallelism, We'll mention.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.850
The kind of parallelism we were
able to finally implement--

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.846
so far, it's only
pipeline parallelism,

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:18.220
but as future work, we'd be
interested in the other kinds

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.178
of parallelism as well.

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:21.540
More about it as I go on.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.660
So in the framework we
at least implemented,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.010
the programming model
is quite simple.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.776
The basic execution unit is
what we call an operator.

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.150
It's analogous to what in
StreamIt would be called a work

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.820
function, or what
in GNURadio, which

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.730
is a framework for
building soft radios,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.210
would be called a block.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.530
So these operators can be any
arbitrary C++ classes with

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.560
state, and they implement
an iterate method which

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.105
the developer has to overload
in order to process a block

00:03:47.105 --> 00:03:48.330
of data.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.060
The WaveScope data model
also provides a library

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.760
for managing memory and
passing blocks of signal

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.270
data between these operators.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.770
Applications in
this model are built

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.330
by chaining operators together.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.460
So this is a snippet
of some of the code

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.800
we wrote for the
software radio, roughly.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.730
So you create a box,
let's say a FIRFilter,

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.590
which processes
elements of type float.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.690
And then, it takes in
some arguments, initialize

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.220
the filters,
parameters, and so on.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.970
You want to create a
white noise generator

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.374
and hook up the filter to
the white noise generator.

00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:23.040
We use this to simulate a simple
channel, [INAUDIBLE] channel.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.080
So I'll just describe the
components of our framework.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.340
We have a lightweight scheduler
on both the PPE, as well as

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.490
the SPEs.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.090
Right now, it uses a static
operator mapping in the sense

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.570
that you have to specify a
static configuration file,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.550
where you say this operator
name will run on this [? SPU ?]

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.390
number.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.435
But we've not completely
implemented dynamically

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.290
reconfiguring at runtime.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.680
And we haven't yet seen
the need for doing that.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.197
So it wouldn't be too
hard to add if needed.

00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:56.030
But right now, you can
easily shuffle around

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.310
the operator mapping by
tweaking the configuration file.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.810
Signal blocks, as I said,
were adapted from WaveScope.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.190
They use reference counting
and avoid in-memory copies,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.650
which can be quite expensive,
especially on the cell.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.220
They also provide a convenient
API to manipulate signals.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.428
So you don't have to do much
of the memory management

00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:15.670
yourself or debug any
of the hard problems

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.389
to do with memory management.

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.930
We also ported this
library to ensure

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.410
that data is aligned for you
automatically and transported

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.180
via queues.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.710
So one of the major
things we had to implement

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.360
was a queuing library and
remote heap management--

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.180
what amounted essentially to a
remote heap management library.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.750
So in some sense, we
faced a choice here.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.710
We could either
have the PPE control

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.030
and allocate memory statically
and make all the decisions

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.390
about what memory
is allocated where.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.390
Or, we could have the
SPEs manage it themselves.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.895
We decided to go for the
latter, partly because it

00:05:49.895 --> 00:05:52.020
was more dynamic and, also,
because we weren't sure

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.865
what the implications of
all the control flow passing

00:05:54.865 --> 00:05:56.892
through the PPE were for this.

00:05:56.892 --> 00:05:59.350
So we chose the second approach,
which is autonomous memory

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.350
management.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.774
So when an SPE sends a streaming
data element to another SPE,

00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:07.690
it doesn't have to
actually explicitly request

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.480
the other SPE for
allocating memory.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.870
It has a remote
heap interface so

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.450
that it can directly allocate
data and write to the SPE.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.080
This is currently of
fixed size, but it

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.970
could be improved
by using this heap

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.110
to share a bunch of queues.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.526
Right now, we have
one remote heap

00:06:24.526 --> 00:06:28.450
for each queue between
operators on different SPEs.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.170
So our system
automatically handles

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:40.740
pipelining streaming data from
SPE to SPE using the DMA API.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.417
So Micah will takeover from here
and describe the software radio

00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:44.452
implementation briefly.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:06.570
MICAH BRODSKY: So our
software radio implementation

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.301
is relatively simple.

00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:10.800
We weren't pushing
on that too hard,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.650
especially because it took
the vast majority of our time

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.390
just to get the
framework to work.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.860
Saving the programmer
trouble meant

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.855
that we inherited a lot
of trouble ourselves.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.312
It breaks down to
about 25 boxes,

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.895
which we took in our
config file which

00:07:27.895 --> 00:07:32.690
is manually mapped to the SPEs.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.025
About 3,000 lines of code,
most of which is framework.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.340
So I guess, if we were
more put-together,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.637
we'd have a nice
diagram to show you.

00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:46.470
There's enough time.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.780
I'll try to draw a quick
diagram on the chalkboard.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.278
We're simulating both sender,
receiver and a channel.

00:08:03.373 --> 00:08:05.940
So the computation in
question looks something

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.270
like you have a bitstream.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.950
You need to take
these and convert them

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.350
into some-- can
you read anything?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.910
So you take stream of bits in.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.850
Take bits.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.950
Basically, use a
lookup mechanism

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.659
to convert it to
an analog waveform,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.387
and filter that to
produce something

00:08:44.387 --> 00:08:45.595
that has a narrower spectrum.

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:50.420
Running out of space here.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.376
Means that.

00:08:51.376 --> 00:08:54.932
Multiply that
against a sine wave.

00:08:54.932 --> 00:08:56.640
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN:
That's for modulation

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.410
MICAH BRODSKY: And so
you get-- you've probably

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.900
seen pictures of this.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.860
It's very much like AM
It's basically binary

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.150
AM. [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.990
It's one of the simplest
things you can do.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.780
Then, this is to
simulate a channel, which

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.170
is a random FIR filter,
finite impulse response.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.690
What that means,
it's basically taking

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.060
the copies of the input
at different time offsets

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.190
with random coefficients
and just summing them up.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.010
It's a huge multiply
add computation.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.706
So this is 80 taps.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.785
And add some Gaussian noise.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.450
And then this, we take
over, and then try

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.560
to figure out what we put
in in the first place.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.745
So a bunch of filtering.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.610
Again, more finite impulse
response filtering.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.950
There's a little
closed loop that

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.100
tries to estimate the signal
amplitude and correct for it.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.600
That's called
automatic gain control

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.850
to sort of keep it constant.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.910
And I'm probably getting these
things a little out of order.

00:10:20.897 --> 00:10:22.605
This is the incoherent
demodulation part.

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:24.563
We square the signal to
get rid of the carrier.

00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:27.830
Automatic gain control.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.420
Filtering.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.800
There's another loop.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.370
This is called a
phase lock loop.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.420
The idea is try to match a
sine wave to some input signal.

00:10:41.605 --> 00:10:44.190
I don't know how to
explain it very well.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.960
It's basically a locking
type of detector.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.330
The idea is to lock into the
phase of some periodic thing.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.805
This is for recovering
when do you sample.

00:10:51.805 --> 00:10:53.430
Because you've got
this messy waveform,

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.354
you've got to know when to
look and, say, OK, is it high,

00:10:56.354 --> 00:10:57.478
is it low to get a bit out.

00:10:57.478 --> 00:10:58.822
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:58.822 --> 00:11:00.414
MICAH BRODSKY: Yeah.

00:11:00.414 --> 00:11:01.705
I think that gives the picture.

00:11:01.705 --> 00:11:04.220
I'm probably boring everybody.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.981
Here's a picture
generated from the system.

00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:08.355
So the green line
is the data in.

00:11:11.224 --> 00:11:13.112
Hi, low. [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:15.711
The red line is
the analog signal

00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:17.760
out right before it's
supposed to decide

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.044
what the heck the input was.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.250
This is after squaring,
and filtering,

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.705
and automatic gain
control, and all that.

00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:28.300
The little blips are
actually because we

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.785
used a modulation called
alternate-mark-inversion.

00:11:30.785 --> 00:11:33.232
It basically flips every one.

00:11:33.232 --> 00:11:35.612
That's why it's blipping
instead of being constant,

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.516
which is to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:37.516 --> 00:11:39.729
And then the little blue
daggers are the results

00:11:39.729 --> 00:11:42.596
of the phase lock loop to try
and recover when to sample.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:44.720
And they're kind of off,
but they're kind of right.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.300
And so, if you take
the little blue blip,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.330
if the red line is
above 0, it's a 1.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.219
And if it's below 0, it's 0.

00:11:55.219 --> 00:11:56.760
And that's how you
get your bits out.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.041
This was hard to get right,
mostly because of the framework

00:12:08.041 --> 00:12:08.541
issues.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.280
Implementing distributed
objects on a system

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.174
without real shared
memory is hard

00:12:18.174 --> 00:12:19.840
because you have to
serialize everything

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.423
into a stream of
bits and deserialize.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.880
So it really makes pie out of
any existing object oriented

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.770
code.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:35.044
We did quite a bit of work to
get decent lock-free almost

00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:36.010
zero-copy.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.510
Another day or so,
we probably would

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.860
have gotten zero-copy--
transfer-- streaming

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.370
of the data from place to place.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.120
And we had to keep the
code footprint low.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.640
C++ is bloated.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.590
We don't have an
overlay system yet to--

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.689
if SPE is not running
a particular box,

00:12:55.689 --> 00:12:57.230
it still has to have
the code for it.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.355
So we don't have any
infrastructure for--

00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:00.980
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN:
There's some macros

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.960
to get around that, right?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.230
MICAH BRODSKY: Yeah.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.190
It's pretty messy.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.397
So all the code is
on all the SPEs.

00:13:06.397 --> 00:13:07.980
So code bloat is
particularly a issue.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.900
And XLC has this
particular penchant

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.240
for runtime type information
and exception handling.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.450
Incredible amount of voodoo
is necessary to get them

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.792
and that 70 K of useless
bloat out of there.

00:13:25.595 --> 00:13:27.470
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: We
pretty much have the--

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.188
MICAH BRODSKY: It
works, but not always.

00:13:32.188 --> 00:13:33.562
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN:
We did manage

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:35.853
to get it running long enough
to get some measurements.

00:13:35.853 --> 00:13:39.660
MICAH BRODSKY: Yeah, we did
get some decent data out.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.508
Running on the PPE only, we
can about 170,000 samples

00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:45.440
per second through.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.474
And with the scheduling file,
that's kind of rule of thumb--

00:13:48.474 --> 00:13:50.640
we just roughly said, OK,
that looks about this big.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.520
We'll throw it on
this SPE, SPE, SPE.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.060
We got roughly four times
that using five SPEs.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.685
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN:
The core foorprints

00:13:57.685 --> 00:13:59.057
are really large, but--

00:13:59.057 --> 00:13:59.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:02.946 --> 00:14:05.664
MICAH BRODSKY: We
really had to push down

00:14:05.664 --> 00:14:06.580
things like our queue.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.543
We just didn't
have enough memory.

00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:09.043
It sucked.

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:15.624
We basically just
said that already.

00:14:15.624 --> 00:14:16.508
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: Some
performance bottlenecks, I

00:14:16.508 --> 00:14:16.950
guess.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.050
MICAH BRODSKY: Interesting
performance behavior.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.050
We found that the SPEs are
ridiculously underutilized.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.970
Most of the algorithms are
quite a bit zippier on the SPEs.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.880
And so, they may be running
about a third of the time,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.860
and the rest of time
just waiting for input.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.639
And then the PPE, which is
doing only a tiny amount

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:40.180
of the computation-- basically
just feeding it in and sucking

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.540
it out-- is spending
half of its time all busy

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.350
and, the other half of the time,
stuck in flow control waiting

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:54.790
for queue space, which is-- our
flow control algorithm sucks.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.290
Better with time.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.190
So it seems like you
should be able to do

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.760
quite a bit better than we
did with a bit more work.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.642
We need to cut
down the footprint.

00:15:12.642 --> 00:15:14.600
And once we have a little
bit of breathing room

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.240
and get rid of the nasty
race bugs and such,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.650
we can finally investigate
what was our original, pie

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.160
in the sky goal of
automatically deciding

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:28.070
what goes where, taking
measurements of the performance

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.920
and then feeding that
back to producing a better

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.870
placement of operators,
and applying data

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.600
parallelism by
instantiating operators

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.590
on multiple different SPEs
and splitting the data stream.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.330
And just doing more.

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:52.228
AUDIENCE: Since your PPE is
at 40% to 50% utilization,

00:15:52.228 --> 00:15:54.225
did you put actual
work on there?

00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:56.100
MICAH BRODSKY: We did
put some work on there.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.808
Actually, we put work
on there because we

00:15:57.808 --> 00:15:59.726
couldn't fit all the
boxes-- the code for all

00:15:59.726 --> 00:16:01.352
the boxes under the SPEs.

00:16:01.352 --> 00:16:03.310
So we started strategically
to put a few things

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.060
at the beginning
and a few things

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.434
at the end which
weren't supposed

00:16:05.434 --> 00:16:07.290
to be very
computationally intensive,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.014
and yet they managed to
take up half the CPU.

00:16:10.014 --> 00:16:11.680
The issue with the
other half of the CPU

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.210
is that it's actually
inside an inner loop

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.580
deep recursive in blocking
because, basically,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.840
our back pressure
isn't online yet.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.690
So if it tries to emit
something to a queue,

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.530
and that queue is
full, it just stops.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.030
And it really could be running
a whole bunch of other stuff,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.452
but it's not smart
enough to do that ahead.

00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:29.327
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.577 --> 00:16:38.410
MICAH BRODSKY: Unlike
a model like StreamIt,

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.130
everything here is
asynchronous and code driven.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.641
The SPUs they can decide on
the fly how much to emit.

00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:47.640
The programmer doesn't
have to declare anything,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.980
But it means everything's
asynchronous.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.509
And so you basically
[? race the issues ?] galore.

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:55.300
AUDIENCE: But in this
a application, do you

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.570
find any dynamic rates?

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.061
MICAH BRODSKY: In this
application, there's not much.

00:16:58.061 --> 00:16:59.352
It's a very simple application.

00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.037
If we actually went
to packetization,

00:17:02.037 --> 00:17:04.472
error correction,
compression, things like that,

00:17:04.472 --> 00:17:06.013
we'd probably see
a lot more of that.

00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:08.001
This is definitely
underutilized in

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:13.333
the asynchronous
capabilities of the system.

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:15.124
AUDIENCE: In the case
of radio, wouldn't it

00:17:15.124 --> 00:17:18.438
be OK to draw [INAUDIBLE]
frame into audio data

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:22.260
just because you're spending
so much time waiting,

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.030
it'd be better just to
relieve pressure on the queues

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.420
by just dropping some
frames that are unnecessary.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:27.898
MICAH BRODSKY: It might well be.

00:17:27.898 --> 00:17:29.332
AUDIENCE: And
interpolating it in the end

00:17:29.332 --> 00:17:30.766
to try to fix it
up a little bit.

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:31.244
MICAH BRODSKY: It might well be.

00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:32.702
We decided not to
do that as a part

00:17:32.702 --> 00:17:36.210
of the framework because
[INAUDIBLE] policy decision,

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.994
and we didn't want to make that
for all possible applications.

00:17:38.994 --> 00:17:41.050
But if we figure out a
good way to dispose that,

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.960
that definitely
would be an option.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.140
Just drop a few packets.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.334
Drop a few samples.

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:48.875
AUDIENCE: So what
about buffer sizes?

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.937
Do you declare the
buffer size as well?

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:51.770
MICAH BRODSKY: Yeah.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.786
The way we have it
now-- there's actually

00:17:53.786 --> 00:17:57.030
just a #define in the code that
says all buffers are this size.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.340
AUDIENCE: Do you need any
double buffering in there?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.715
MICAH BRODSKY:
You don't need it.

00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:03.250
Well, actually, the way
it works is that there's

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.360
this remote heap input queue.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.640
And an upstream SPE just DMAs
things in as it feels like.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.950
And then the
downstream SPE looks.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.140
Is there something here?

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.330
Grab it, use it.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.139
So it just works, however
much buffering there is.

00:18:17.139 --> 00:18:19.430
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: The ring
buffer and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.620
should get that
block [? free. ?]

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.610
MICAH BRODSKY: That's a benefit
of the asynchronous approach.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.514
It just works, if you have
memory, which we don't.

00:18:30.165 --> 00:18:30.940
Queues are tiny.

00:18:35.995 --> 00:18:37.867
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
is angrily telling me

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.450
that his connection dropped but
he's not picking up the phone.

00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.990
Yeah, I could see it in there.

00:19:01.427 --> 00:19:04.906
AUDIENCE: Any other
questions for them?

00:19:04.906 --> 00:19:07.920
Did you want to do the demo?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.370
MICAH BRODSKY: Nah.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.320
SPEAKER ON PHONE: What did
you do to get race conditions?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.320
MICAH BRODSKY: How
did we manage to get

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.403
ourselves race conditions?

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.775
Well, it's a mix of the
fact that all the SPUs

00:19:22.775 --> 00:19:25.170
can essentially operate
as independent threads

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.110
and are sort of
asynchronously DMAing things

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.350
to each other and
somewhat poor--

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.880
legacy driven architectural
decisions on the way the PPU

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.462
code works.

00:19:35.462 --> 00:19:38.397
Because we ported a lot of code
from the WaveScope platform.

00:19:38.397 --> 00:19:38.897
[?

00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:40.085
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: Which
wasn't very ?] well documented.

00:19:40.085 --> 00:19:41.585
MICAH BRODSKY: And
that was intended

00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:43.740
to be multithreaded
with Pthreads, which

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.344
in our original, naive before
we actually started the class

00:19:47.344 --> 00:19:48.802
impression, we
thought we were just

00:19:48.802 --> 00:19:50.718
going to port the whole
thing and use Pthreads

00:19:50.718 --> 00:19:52.800
on the sub, which of
course is not possible.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.490
So there were still some
threaded components in there.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.386
And we introduced a lot of
bugs trying to port the thing.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.080
See if i can--

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.440
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN: The
surprising thing was the fact

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.523
that we had to replace
array constructors in order

00:20:08.523 --> 00:20:10.717
to eliminate [? RTTI. ?]
And it was just a big deal

00:20:10.717 --> 00:20:11.550
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.335
MICAH BRODSKY: We had
to get rid of new,

00:20:12.335 --> 00:20:13.770
we had to get rid of delete.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.689
We had to get rid of
array constructors.

00:20:15.689 --> 00:20:17.156
We had to get rid of--

00:20:17.156 --> 00:20:18.134
ARVIND THIAGARAJAN:
Virtual destructors.

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:19.112
MICAH BRODSKY: --pure
virtual functions

00:20:19.112 --> 00:20:20.112
and virtual destructors.

00:20:20.112 --> 00:20:21.490
It was a mess.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.193
I guess one more
pithy thing I could

00:20:25.193 --> 00:20:27.950
say about race conditions
is it's incredible

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.620
how many subtle race
conditions and bugs we found in

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:35.260
the remote keeping
queueing library.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.930
Because there's one-- it's a
lock free asynchronous data

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.110
structure.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:45.346
There are two threads-- two
SPUs reading and writing from it

00:20:45.346 --> 00:20:46.630
at the same time.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.380
And there's all sorts
of little subtleties

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.042
where if you get it
a little bit wrong,

00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:52.250
you end up with one of the
queue pointers overrunning

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.850
the other guy, and
you have basically

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.130
dangling pointers
and things like that.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.910
At least three or four
times, we spent a few hours

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.410
until we discovered that was the
cause of mysterious behavior.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.110
AUDIENCE: Anything else?

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.710
Thank you.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.260
