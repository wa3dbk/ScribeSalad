00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.490
PROFESSOR: So I will go into a
little about what the class

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.790
is, and what you're
going to do.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.100
I'll just put one slide about
requirements and outcomes.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.190
So what are the requirements?

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.550
We require you to be a good
programmer with a lot of

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.390
programming experience.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.180
As I said, we are going down
to very bare metal.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.980
And there won't be any
niceties of just

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.850
writing Java code.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.140
So you're going to run into a
lot of these kind of issues.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.260
Fluent in C is --

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.430
I wouldn't call it a 100%
requirement, but it really

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.770
helps if you're fluent in C.
If not, you'll have to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510
probably spend a lot of time
trying to understand C, C++.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.230
And in this class that means --
just start doing it today,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.080
just get a C book and then
try to understand.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.640
If you run a lot of Java it
might be an easy transition.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.070
But get to the transition
fast, don't wait.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.140
What are we expecting
at the end?

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.920
We expect at the end
for you to know --

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.880
AUDIENCE: I have to go.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.716
Thank you very much
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.790
PROFESSOR: So what
do we expect?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.290
We expect at the end you'll
probably understand a lot of

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.410
fundamentals and concepts of
parallel programming --

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.260
both hardware and software.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.230
Because the nice
thing about --

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.770
or the nice thing or the
bad thing about Cell --

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710
is a lot of hardware conceptuals
to expose.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.340
There's no nice abstraction
layers in there.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.280
You'll understand a lot of
issues about parallel

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.060
performance.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.220
We started here, you write a
program, compile -- it's not

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.570
just order n you're
looking for.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.970
You're looking for all
these constants.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.290
All these things matter,
basically.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.100
You should be able to synthesize
a fairly complex

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.020
parallel program by the end,
because that's what your group

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.260
project's going to be.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.060
And you'll get a lot of hands-on
experience with the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.930
Cell processor, so we'll
understand this one

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.350
instance very well.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.820
So that is what we are expecting
will happen at the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.390
end of this 3.5 weeks.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.360
So the project.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750
You proposed the projects, we
did something different.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.230
So it's all your ideas that
we are going to do.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.710
We selected seven groups out
of these -- there are seven

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.000
projects in there --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.300
mainly based on the strength
of the project proposals.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.330
And I was pretty impressed with
the height of things you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.030
guys proposed.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.660
So here are the seven
projects.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.480
Let's actually try to figure
out who's who.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.400
Who's doing distributed
real-time ray tracer?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.110
OK, that's not true.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.510
OK, how about the global
illumination?

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.060
OK.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.490
Linear algebra pack?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.990
OK, good.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.600
Molecular dynamics?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.030
OK.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.890
Speech synthesizer?

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.950
OK.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.480
Soft radio?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.600
OK.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.550
Backgammon tutor?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.050
OK.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.660
And there are some people who
are, I think, in this class

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.260
thinking that they
can join a group.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.420
So at the end, there are a few
groups that only have one

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.190
member, so probably go ahead
and talk to them and see

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.240
whether they are willing
to work with people.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.720
So I'll give you a little bit of
time, because I'm going to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.970
finish early.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.570
OK, let's ask -- who are
the people who are

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.380
hoping to join a group?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.240
Is there anybody who came?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.660
I got a few emails, I don't
know that anybody's here.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.900
Oh good.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.420
So it's not going
to be a problem.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.020
So I did the project
characteristics.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.860
You can see that they are
ambitious projects, but

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.310
accomplishable.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.990
I was worried that people would
say, "I'm going to build

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.460
this entire thing", and it's
going to take a year.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.500
But I think most of the projects
that they proposed

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.260
are doable.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.020
Another thing is important
and relevant things.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.410
I think for a lot of these
things, if the code is done

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.960
right other people might
even use it.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.160
I think this can start
something, it's not just going

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.600
to be this project.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.710
And there's a lot of opportunity
to sizzle.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.710
I think some people will come
up with these things that I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.100
think at the end will
be so amazing.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.880
And that's what got
me excited.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.310
But get them started as soon as
possible, because this is

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.800
not a semester course, this is
going to run so fast. There's

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.440
only a few all nighters
you can pull,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.850
basically is what it is.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610
So there's a note of caution.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.230
Cell processor is very new.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.350
We heard about that today.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.940
I mean this is a really
cool thing, but it has

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.850
its problems in there.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.530
It's not an easy architecture
to work with.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.960
There is though this
nice abstraction.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.510
So it's just then from this
being completely abstracted

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.570
out, writing Java code, to
all the way to metal.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.560
So it's just almost a jump
from going to a higher

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.790
language of assembly.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.990
So there's a huge, big gap in
there, and that's going to be

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.810
a lot of issues in there.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.270
The tool chain is very
thin and brittle.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.870
So my pointing out all those
things, you wish there's a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.720
tool, but there's nothing.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.510
And even the existing tools --

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.715
we just got the SDK 2.0 into
working I think this morning

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:03.800
-- and so there might
be issues in there.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.980
Most of the staff have
limited experience.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.380
For example, SDK 2.0.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.110
We just got it working, so we
haven't used it yet in there.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.835
So that can create problems,
especially in

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:17.480
a fast moving course.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.580
The projects you are doing
are of your own making.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.920
Most of the classes --

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.000
if you need to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.040
classes, we actually come up
with the projects, TAs go and

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.420
implement it once, we know
all the gotchas.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.070
And then when you get the
project we know there's an

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.230
existence proof that
it's doable, it

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.840
works, the tools work.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.470
We know at least there's
one path through it.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.950
There's nothing like
that here.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.500
Everybody's kind of just jumping
at it head on, and

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.170
hoping that we can read them.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.670
And we might find issues that
are very hard, and that's why

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.230
we actually have very
close contact with

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.150
those guys at IBM.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.330
So if things happen, we'll call
them and they will be

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.680
available to help us.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.730
But it's not something you can
say -- oh yeah, I know, just

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:58.380
go do that.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.050
Or -- here's the way out.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.900
So there might be issues like
that, so we have to be very

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.020
careful of that.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.540
And you will face these kinds of
problems. That's more given

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.960
than anything else, so
be ready for that.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.390
This is not just writing some
high level code and getting

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.540
away with it.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.250
And you're all in
this together.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.120
So the staff, you,
me, everybody --

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.170
we're just doing it for the
first time in some sense.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.840
And that's the fun part about
it, because as you pointed

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.040
out, there might be some stuff
that you guys come out with

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.060
that will become more like
folklore and the basis for the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.330
things people do.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.690
Because you might say --
hey, there's a neat

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.470
way of doing that.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.220
You will be the first to
do this kind of thing.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.460
So there's that time, but on
planning the three week course

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.550
it's a large chunk to bite.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.030
If it is more for a PhD,
then you can say --

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.430
OK, spend three months
figuring it out.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.830
There's no other time limit.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.406
So we will try to manage this
process, but you need to try

00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:53.780
to -- expectations of what you
are trying to get done, and

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.980
then be able to get it done.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.570
So you have to always
balance this out.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.120
If you're running into issues,
get to us very fast. Because

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.150
we need to figure it out.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.250
And we might have to actually
also figure it out from

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.590
somebody else, so we can
escalate it up and get the

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.110
information.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.500
Because three weeks are
going to go so fast.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.850
How many people are taking
the class for a grade?

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.935
So people who are taking it for
a grade, here is what we

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:18.750
are going to do.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.540
The first thing, what I call
mini quizzes, is just a prop

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.260
so you will come into class.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.860
So the way I am going to do that
is, at the beginning of

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.360
the class I am going to give you
a piece of paper with two

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.510
questions from the
previous lecture.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.020
You can do anything you
want to answer it.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.510
You can talk to people,
look it up, whatever.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.660
And then at the end
of the class

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.630
basically we want it back.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.110
And the only requirement is, you
have to come individually

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.290
to pick your thing up, and you
have to come individually to

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.310
hand it in, and you can't write
somebody else's anwers

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.910
physically, but you can
talk to each other.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.232
So we'll try to make it a little
bit entertaining, and a

00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:58.270
little bit thought-provoking,
but nothing like you have to

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.520
spend hours doing it.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.390
It'll be probably
five minutes.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.670
Normally we will do a break
inbetween, so you probably can

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.310
talk to each other and come up
with some of the answers.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.110
So this is just the fact that
the people who are actually

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.270
getting the grades will be
coming to class, more than

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.680
anything else I'll be testing.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.320
And then we have these lab
projects at the beginning,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.280
that will get some grade.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.330
And the final group project.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.800
And then we have a final
competition.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.405
So since everybody's not doing
the same project, we are going

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:32.720
to decide on performance --

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.400
so how well your code ran, how
much MIPS or [? GOPs ?] you

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.710
were able to get from that.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.380
And how raw performance
is in there.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.440
And then we will also
look at it from a

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.430
complexity point of view.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.900
So for example, as I pointed
out, if you do matrix

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.630
multiplier you get certain
performance, so if you do

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.710
[? FF3, ?] you get certain
performance.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.460
So just absolute numbers is not
what matters, but how far

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.920
you can get hard
algorithm too.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.390
Completeness.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.100
So were you able to get
your project through?

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.170
How much do you actually have a
compete solution at the end

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.210
that something works?

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.300
That's important.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.150
Algorithmic complexity -- how
much of a complexity did you

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.810
bite in, both from more of a
pure algorithm point of view,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.070
and also implementing some
shared complexity in there.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.860
And demo and presentation.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.250
So OK, those two.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.740
So we are going to select
a winning team.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.960
We haven't figured exactly what,
but we'll give everybody

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.400
a gift set depending on --

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.250
this is what we are aiming
at right now.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.550
Also we are going to invite the
winning team to spend a

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.910
day at IBM TJ Watson.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.470
You get to give a presentation
to a bunch of people there,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.020
and probably go see what
they are doing.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.840
That should be a fun
day to spend.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.810
We haven't scheduled a day,
depending on the class

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.580
schedule and stuff like that,
the winning team will go spend

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.160
a day out in there.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.920
That will be a fun thing to
do, there's a lot of cool

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.140
stuff going on there.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.670
They will get to actually
interact with some

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.090
researchers, see what they
do, as well as present

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.180
this work to them.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.230
And since this is new
everybody's excited.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.620
I think hopefully we'll come
up with a team that will do

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.460
things that other people will be
interested in and will use.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.590
So these kind of come from
backward because I wanted to

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.790
get Mike Perrone first.
So my name is Saman --

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:24.510
Saman Amarasinghe --

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.950
I live in CSAIL.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.510
I have had a lot of
interest in --

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.780
Not as much as you
guys probably.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.820
I have a lot of interest in
languages, compilers, and

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.000
computer architecture.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.350
So if you have been at this game
for a long time, in the

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.200
early 1990s there was a huge
surge in parallel performance,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.630
work on parallelism, and at
that time I did the SUIF

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.140
parallelizing compiler
in there.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.120
And then, everybody says -- hey,
there's this Moore slope

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.420
of performance, who cares
about parallelism?

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.890
So there was this decade
when this paralellism

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.900
kind of died down.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.460
I kind of hid under the radar
and kind of survived through

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.810
that thing, and then again I
think parallelism coming up.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.280
So we are doing a bunch of
parallel work in here.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.860
So I probably have a perspective
that goes

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.820
somewhere old, and
then coming up.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.570
Probably Aaron can also
relate to that.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.440
Aaron: There's one of
us who did that.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah exactly.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.080
Going through that, kind
of survived in that.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.430
And Rodric is sitting there.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:29.310
So Rodric is right now at IBM
PJ Watson, but he's probably

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.400
going to live at CSAIL next
month, so he's going to be

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.290
here more than me in fact.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.320
He was actually in the lab until
a few months ago, as a

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.160
research scientist. He's also
interested in a lot of these

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.680
kinds of things -- compilers,
architecture, parallel

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.890
architecture, and
FPGA type work.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.000
And then we have two TAs.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.340
Where's David and Phil?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.790
OK, get up.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.020
So they actually have
some experience.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.910
Probably they are about a week
ahead of you on understanding

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.300
Cell, not too much.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.910
They are going to lead the
recitations and be available

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.160
to help you in there.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.610
So really use those resources
as much as possible.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.980
And then we are going to have
a huge amount of guest

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:17.740
lecturers, and I was pretty
happy with the

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.840
kind of list we got.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.270
Mike Perrone just came and gave
you the lecture, and Alan

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.780
is going to talk
in a few weeks.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.440
And Professor Arvind, Brad
Kuszmaul, Mike Acton -- that

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.400
Mike Perrone talk about is
going to come at the end.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.760
And Bill Thies, who was one
of the PhD students in the

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.990
Streamit group, is going
to talk about

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.310
the Streamit language.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.350
So the way we have kind of
structured the class is, how

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.090
do you go about extracting
parallelism.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.490
There's implicit parallelism.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.260
And sometimes the
current way of

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.340
everything done by hardware.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.370
In the next lecture, I will just
touch upon superscalar

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.690
hardware, what it is and
what its problems are.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.700
Implicit parallelism means
you can do by compiler.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.150
So you write a C program, and
let the compiler deal with the

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.620
parallelism.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.035
For as long as you are a
programmer, you don't have to

00:13:13.035 --> 00:13:16.050
deal with that thing.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.230
In lectures 11 and 12
I will talk about

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.440
parallelizing compilers.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.890
So we'll cover how you can
do that [? in C. ?]

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.020
So that means kind of abstract
it out, and leaving it out of

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.450
the end programmer.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.430
So the hardware exposes it, but
we put a software layer.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.420
And then the other end is
explicit parallelism.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.830
That's where, I think, we are
going to spend most of the

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.550
time in this class.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.830
So in the first part of explicit
parallelism is the

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.170
library approach.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.410
What that means is you are using
MPI type things, so you

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.270
are basically at the metal
dealing with this parallelism.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.830
I am going to do lecture
4 on concurrency.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:58.540
How many people took 6.170 last
year when I was teaching?

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.880
OK.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.310
I did a lecture on concurrency
there, so something very

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.020
similar I'm going to do in here
-- to get the basics of

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.660
parallelism.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.320
In order to write a parallel
program, the program has to

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.090
run concurrently.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.750
There's a lot of issues for
writing concurrent programs.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.110
It is necessary to get parallel,
it's not sufficient.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.470
There are a lot more other
things to worry about.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.590
But let's deal with those
kind of issues --

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.520
deal with things like
synchronization, deadlocks,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.600
and issues like that.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.140
So I'm going to give that, and
then Rodric is going to have a

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.910
few lecture on design
patterns.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.930
So if you want to write a
parallel program, how do you

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.980
look at it?

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.710
Different algorithms will
have different ways of

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:36.580
parallelizing.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.330
So he's going to go about
looking at these kind of

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.200
parallel patterns.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.956
If you have this kind of
program, here is a

00:14:41.956 --> 00:14:42.660
way to look at it.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.770
Here's another way
to look at it.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.880
So kind of go through
that in there.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.250
And in concurrency we work
with a lot more abstract

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.130
parallel model, and get slowly
down to all the realism needed

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.520
in dealing with Cell.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.860
And then we are going to have
a bunch of guest lectures,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.320
mainly dealing with other ways
of doing parallelism.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.810
So this is one way.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.850
We are going to have a lecture
on Streamit, because you might

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.220
be able to use that also
as a way on Cell.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.330
So a little bit of high
abstraction, we are trying to

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.480
make that available on Cell.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.250
So if that comes to, then you
might be able to even have

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.630
that as a part of your
toolbox in there.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.220
The other three talks are
about very different

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.560
approaches for parallelism.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.606
I think they will give you a
big picture view, it's not

00:15:30.606 --> 00:15:32.090
that you're just going
through one

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.040
parallelling down in there.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.400
I think at the end of to the day
you'll understand not only

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.370
how to deal with Cell, but
kind of a general way of

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.020
looking at parallelism, and
maybe from that approach

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.580
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] parallelism
in there.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.970
So the lectures are organized
as follows.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.440
We are now at the end
of the day here.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.590
Tomorrow we'll have
a recitation on

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.120
getting to know Cell.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.450
We are trying to figure out a
good room, so just check your

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.060
email to figure out exactly
where we are going to have it,

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.580
because we are trying
to figure it out.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.930
We want to find a room with
machines so everybody can

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.295
actualy get hands-on experience
in kind of a

00:16:04.295 --> 00:16:05.000
lecture format.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.720
And then we will have the
architecture, just general

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.730
parallel architecture, and an
introduction to concurrent

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:13.470
programming.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.260
And then Rodric is going to
have individual meets with

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.770
individual groups,
trying to get the

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.190
groups' projects going.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.330
So at that point kind of figure
out how we are doing

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.270
it, have some early ideas about
it so you can start

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.840
thinking and start the process
of doing that.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.910
You can start working on Cell
probably from tomorrow, but

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.040
really get a day to kind of
get familiarized, and then

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.410
here start the project.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.210
And then we will have
some lectures on

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.240
design patterns in here.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.370
And as we go we'll have more
hands-on experience also.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.460
Then we'll have a lecture
on Streamit.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:03.210
So if you are using Streamit for
a part of the run program,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.870
you'll be able to understand
what's going on.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.380
And we'll get to some debugging
tools, hopefully we

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.320
will have to deal with these
things before that, but here's

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.240
something that if you're really
stuck, to get a breadth

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.790
of tools available in here.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.430
And then we'll talk in general
about debugging and

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.360
performance monitoring and
performance optimization.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.400
So at this point hopefully you
have done the first cart, you

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.560
have figured out what problems,
and start optimizing

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.530
things in here.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:32.440
And then we'll going into a
little bit more breadth,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.080
things like traffic paralleizing
compilers that I

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.330
talk about, getting implicit
parallelism in here.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.290
And then we will have a bunch of
guest lecturers coming in.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.680
And we'll talk about some
hardware and the future,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.690
because we are just starting
this very new phase in

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:51.130
programming that might change
almost everybody.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.490
Five years, ten years down the
line if you go through

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.250
computer science, you might have
a very different flavor,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.990
if what people think of
parallelism takes hold.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.800
So let's look at some future,
and talk about that.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.910
And it's a nice way to
finish the lectures.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.600
A few more days and then
we'll have group

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.920
presentations in here.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:13.890
So each group will get about
15 minutes time to present

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.130
what they have done and give
a little bit of a demo.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.710
And then finally on
Friday we will

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.200
have awards and reception.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.470
So this is what we got.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.720
Any questions?

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:36.090
AUDIENCE: For recitations, if
we're not in a room with

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.570
machines should we
bring laptops?

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.910
PROFESSOR: So that's
a good question.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.815
Who doesn't have a laptop
they can bring?

00:18:44.394 --> 00:18:47.290
OK.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.820
If that is the case, we can have
it in any room we want,

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.970
and have the network.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.380
And we might have one or two
additional machines for people

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.710
who don't have a laptop.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.230
And that actually will work
much better than everybody

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.580
marching into some kind of a
computer room that's not

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.410
structured properly
for doing a class.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:06.160
OK, that actually helps a lot.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.980
That's a good point, I think
that helps a lot.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.024
OK, we'll do that
that way then.

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.510
AUDIENCE: How do we get access
to these machines?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.830
Rodric, you --

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:23.010
RODRIC RABBAH: Every room has
a PS3 dedicated to them.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.060
And every group has accounts
on their dedicated PS3.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.020
I have your usernames
and passwords.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.200
I will pass them out tomorrow,
because I'm going to propagate

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.480
the new SDK to all the PS3's --
to sort of test it with one

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.890
and make sure everything's
working.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.350
So you'll get them at the first
recitation tomorrow.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.440
Unless you really want them
today, then come talk to me or

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.355
send me email.

00:19:43.355 --> 00:19:44.420
PROFESSOR: You'll get
to take home --

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.240
RODRIC RABBAH: Yes.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.360
PROFESSOR: We couldn't even put
it in the machine room,

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.365
because they were scared
somebody was going

00:19:50.365 --> 00:19:51.200
to take them home.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.310
So we actually have it in a
different room -- closed,

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.590
nicely locked --

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.010
or on the network.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.475
So I have been a very popular
person lately, a lot of people

00:20:00.475 --> 00:20:02.740
have tried to bribe me
to get access to

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:03.990
one of these masters.

00:20:07.218 --> 00:20:08.468
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:19.283 --> 00:20:22.570
AUDIENCE: How much does
the PS3 cost?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:29.016
PROFESSOR: Officially $600, but
then eBay's going up to

00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:30.710
like $2,500 these days.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.880
AUDIENCE: No.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.530
PROFESSOR: That's gone down?

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.360
AUDIENCE: They're down between
$400 and $500.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.020
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.933
AUDIENCE: They tried
[? to rope me in. ?]

00:20:36.933 --> 00:20:38.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.260
But during Christmas
it was down for --

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.118
a few desperate payers who
were trying to bribe me.

00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:49.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.690
So I guess their volume
has caught up to --

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.320
AUDIENCE: No, the demand
has dropped.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.630
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.850
AUDIENCE: Will we get to
see the Playstation?

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.610
PROFESSOR: Tomorrow we
can bring one --

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.120
AUDIENCE: I can bring
one [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.980
PROFESSOR: If you put
a game in it's fun.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.540
You can put a game in and play
it, but this is going to be

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.920
Linux so it's a little
bit boring.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.652
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.652 --> 00:21:22.115
AUDIENCE: So these are
things that actually

00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:23.090
cannot play the games.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.730
PROFESSOR: It can.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.730
Interestingly, mostly these
game machines are sold for

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:31.450
less than production value.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.350
So Microsoft, Nintendo, and
Sony before made sure that

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:41.090
nobody can run anything other
than the published games that

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.680
they've charged $25 per pop to

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.520
recover the cost. Huh?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.620
No, $60 for the game.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.660
I think they are charging $25
from the game maker just for

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.040
the privilege of running
the game.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.140
That's how they make
their money.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.070
But, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.370
when they made PS3 bootable
by Linux.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:04.200
So in fact, it's much cheaper,
you get a Blu-Ray player, and

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.529
this Cell processor for a lot
less than the production cost.

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:09.819
AUDIENCE: Does Linux on
the PS3 run on top

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:11.601
of the PS3 OS though?

00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:13.290
PROFESSOR: No.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.720
It just boots up PS3.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.240
What it does is in fact --

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.130
right now, you don't get
access to the graphics

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.240
processor properly.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.570
So you can run open G11.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.120
You have framebuffer access,
but you don't get the full

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.410
graphics access out of that.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.530
AUDIENCE: Which distribution
are we using?

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:30.900
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.342
AUDIENCE: We're using
Yellow Dog.

00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:38.770
AUDIENCE: So in other words,
Mario and Luigi are

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:40.416
subsidizing what we're
going to do.

00:22:40.416 --> 00:22:41.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.830
All those shoot them up games
are basically what subsidizes.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.280
Actually he said, in one sense,
you get the processor

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.610
down to $200 because they are
selling all the other things.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.010
And the other thing, actually
if you want to build a high

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.680
performance Cell farm, it's
probably cheaper because I

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.210
think that the Cell blend
would be $2,000.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.480
It should be cheaper to
buy a bunch of PS3's,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.400
connect them together.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.520
But there might be issues about
things like network

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.160
access, file access, because as
you pointed out, the board

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.880
access is pretty primitive.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.510
Because for games you don't
need this high bandwidth

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.200
connection, you just need
to download it once.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.860
So there might be issues
using it for cluster.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.670
OK.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:33.920
Anything else?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.520
OK, good.
