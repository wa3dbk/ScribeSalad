00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.280
PROFESSOR: So, the next part,
today's going to be about

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.420
concurrent programming.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.550
So in this lecture we are going
to study concurrent

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.680
programing with the emphasis for
correctness of programs.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.470
Because parallel programs
will have the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.860
same correctness issues.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.760
So, if you want to get parallel,
you'd better get the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.610
concurrency right first.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060
What we're also going do is
start with a much simpler

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.530
machine model.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.980
In a program where we are going
to use Java, because I

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.680
think a lot of people
understand Java.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.010
Also, we are going to do
some very simple shared

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.240
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.500
machine abstraction.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350
I'm not going to even talk about
any machine anymore.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.090
I'm just going to talk about
concurrent programming here.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.980
You need to get through this
one before you can start to

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.230
dig in deep into
the next level.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.800
So in the next lecture, we will
switch from Java to C-C ,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.070
I guess using MPI primitives
in here.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.190
We'll start moving into
parallelism with emphasis on

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.930
performance.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.200
And, of course, you have to get
correctness, that's given,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.460
but we'll start looking at
performance in there.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490
And we'll start using the
distributive memory machine,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.950
all the notions and details of
Cell, so we'll just kind of go

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.100
down and down in
that direction.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.490
So, what's concurrency?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.520
Sequential program
is -- because

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.640
sequential program opposite.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
It's basically single
thread of execution,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.620
with is a good one.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.710
Finish that, go to the
next, go to the next.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.500
That's a very simple abstract
model that for about 35 years,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.970
40 years, none of the machines
were actually following, that

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.900
they had things in the back
that actually had some

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.660
parallelism.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.270
A concurrent program is the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.470
because it's a collection of
autonomous sequential threads

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.190
executing logically
in parallel.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.180
So you can execute this thing
either multi-programming, so

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.790
we can multiplex different
parts on multiprocessing.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.920
Well, multiprocessing basically
has [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.720
starting on different
machines.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.870
You can distribute, you
can actually send it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.820
to different places.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.110
Of course, you have to deal
with memory issues.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.040
So, concurrency's not only
parallel systems. So you can

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.450
do interleaved concurrency.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.940
You can have logically parallel,
but you run Thread A

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.610
for a while, contacts with
Thread B for a while, contacts

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.650
with Thread C, so you can have
multiple threads on the same

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.630
machine running.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.830
Or you can actually have
running parallel.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.810
You can have three different
machines running, A, B and C

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.870
all the time.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.510
So you can have both in there.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.570
But logically you should not
see a difference except for

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.540
performance and stuff
like that.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.060
So what I'm going to do is
do a bunch of examples.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.310
Can you read this?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.670
Let's start with a bank.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.430
So you have a bank account.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.130
So in Java you just basically
have ID, password, and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.410
balance, and you have some
way to construct

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.330
this object in here.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.180
And you can ask, and see the
password is correct.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.160
You can get the balance.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.840
And you can post the balance.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.470
So that's a very simple
account object.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.510
If you have a bank, you have a
bunch of accounts in a hash

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.210
map, and you create the
hash map in here.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.360
Then you can basically
[? figure out ?]

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.670
the bank, you actually create
a bank in here, and you can

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.170
get an account, given an ID.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.280
Now, assume you want
to build an ATM.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.740
How do you build an ATM?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.390
So, you have a bank -- you
need a bank in here, and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.120
here's some input and output
streams in here.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.830
When you start the ATM, you will
set up these input and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.790
output streams in here.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.810
In the main function, what
you'll do is, you get a bank,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.710
create where the input streams
are coming from.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.400
Create output goes standard --
system output goes there.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.860
And create an ATM in here, and
you will make the ATM run.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.240
So how do you run the ATM?

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.750
So, what happens in run
is, you run forever?

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.150
ATM doesn't stop any time.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.350
What you can do is you can ask
when somebody walks into the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.540
ATM, you can say what's
the account ID.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.790
Type the account ID.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.160
You can get that account, so
of course, if the account

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.040
already is wrong it says,
throw exception.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.560
You can say OK, what's the
password, get the password.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.170
You take the password, if it's
wrong you throw exception.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.160
Then you can say, here's
your balance today.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.440
What do you want to do?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.300
If you want to withdraw
or deposit.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.560
If you want to withdraw you can
do a minus number, if you

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.620
want to deposit it will
be a plus number.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.310
Then you can post that
into your balance.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.540
Everybody got the
thing for ATMs?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.160
So, assume activity trace.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.120
So somebody comes and gives the
account ID, at least gives

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
the password, and say that they
have $100,000 and say how

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.050
much you withdraw,
$200 withdraw.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.080
And you get the balance
in here.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.100
Looks nice.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.630
It works.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.760
So I need to run multiple ATMs.
Assume I am in a place

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.070
that I actually want to put two
ATMs or four ATMs next to

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.410
each other.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.920
So how am I going to do that?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.840
So, in order to do that, there's
concurrency in Java.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.030
So one way to get Java
concurrency is you can extend

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.150
this class thread and
define a method run.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.490
Or you have interface called
[? Runabout, ?]

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.690
that you can basically use
that interface and has

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.840
estimated run.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.130
Then when you have made
that run and when

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.370
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.430
start, that will get started.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.150
Very simple way to do that.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.400
Let me give you an example.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.940
Little bit of a digression.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.600
Why do you want concurrent
programming?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.580
A lot of times, natural
application structure is not

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.570
sequential.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.010
The world is not sequential.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.680
And then try to sequentialize
the world sometimes means it's

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.150
much more complicated
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.660
So sometimes it's natural to
do things in parallel.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.570
A lot of times the
sequentiality's an artifact of

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.295
the programming language,
because we use a

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:37.740
language like that.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.960
Sometimes doing things in
parallel ways, you can really

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.390
improve things like throughput
and responsiveness.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.020
If you are doing IO, if you're
doing sequential programming

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.620
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.160
you're just twiddling your
thumb waiting for

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
the IO to come back.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.920
In parallel things actually, you
can do parallel IO and you

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.110
can do a lot cool
stuff in here.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.810
Of course, in this class,
if you are multicore and

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.830
multiprocessor multicore, you
can get parallel executions.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.260
So there are more than one
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.970
Also, if you are building a very
large distributed system,

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.210
concurrent programming is, you
had to deal with, especially

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.600
dealing with things like
client-server type of

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.840
applications.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.265
So here's our original ATMs. So
to go to multiple ATMs, I

00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:28.030
am doing a few changes.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.910
I'll go back and forth
a few times.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.090
So the first thing I have done
is I have sett here number of

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.310
ATMs to be four.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.520
Can you really read it
from back there?

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.920
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.240
Then what I have done is, in
here, I did four ATMs here,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.140
and then I put it in a loop to
create this ATM, so I created

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.960
four ATMs in here and start
four ATMs, basically.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.490
Then of course I extended these
ATMs so now we will

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.670
extend [? up a thread. ?]

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.260
And I haven't started that.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.110
And the ATMs [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.560
ATMs, so it's great.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.820
So now what happens is I assume
now there's two guys

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.800
going, both ATMs, at least
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] been.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.920
Then enter the account and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE],

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.960
that's works really well.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.710
No problem.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.980
So we have two ATMs, two people

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.660
actually went on parallel.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.580
One then deposited some money,
other one took money, great.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.580
Now, as MIT students, they
want to do something,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.170
they can hack it.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.410
So, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.550
basically [UNINTELLIGIBLE] went
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.040
basically what
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:33.890
enter the password, and they
said I want to get $100.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.510
I would get $90, basically.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.630
So he had $100 in his account.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.610
Then what he got was, so he
actually managed to get $180

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.990
out of an account
that had $100.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.850
This is not a good ATM, at
least from the bank's

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.440
perspective.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.760
So what went wrong?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.250
If you look at what happened in
activity trace, so we print

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.480
100 in here.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.990
And then you said, you want to
read this value, you both

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.820
entered 90, right here.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.790
And this account balance
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.840
because the account
balance was 100.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.110
You saw also the
account balance

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.280
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE], yes,
it is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.440
Then each went post, it went to
10 -- this also did a post

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.680
of the same time, result
came both 10.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.350
How could this happen?

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.780
So that way it can happen
is, so in the ATM, the

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.600
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE], what
happens is v is minus 90, and

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.390
this post [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
also when you start a

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.970
v it's minus 90.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.480
Then you treat the
balance as 100.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.810
So in this interleaving, and so
it is the plus, you get 10.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.240
Also, before you write it out,
you read the balance in the

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.145
other interleaving, you've got
the balance as 100, and you do

00:09:57.145 --> 00:09:58.820
the plus as 10.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.020
So it destroyed the balance,
now balance became 10, and

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.710
also this guy also wrote the
balance -- it doesn't matter,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.960
it got 10 updated twice,
and that's it.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.460
So you can have interleaving
in here, that actually did

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.550
something that's not a
signature program.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.680
And you're in big trouble.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.530
So in order to get out of
that, problem is all

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.110
interleaving of threads are not
acceptable and current.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.250
What you want is some kind
of a sequential-looking

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.620
performance, even though you'd
get parallel, you don't want

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.050
to do all these interleavings
in here.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.030
So in order to do that,
Java provides this

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.910
synchronization mechanism.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.240
That's just strict
interleaving.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.930
So, what synchronizations do
is, they ensure safety for

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.760
shared updates.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.330
So if you're sharing
something, so it

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.180
avoids races, basically.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.760
It avoids this old interleaving
ordering here.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.500
Also, it allows you to
coordinate actions among

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.240
shared space, basically.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.500
Because at some point people
have to coordinate and take

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.140
that parallel computation.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.960
With notification
you can do that.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.540
So, when multiple threads access
the shared resource,

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:09.620
simultaneously, it's safe only
if all accesses have no effect

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.660
on the resource.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.660
Basically, we're reading
variables.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.105
But everybody can read the same
variable, because you're

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:15.880
not changing anything.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.050
I can do that.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.850
Or all accesses are
idempotent.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.800
So you can say, we
can do that.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.310
Or only one access at a time.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.100
Which is called mutual
exclusion.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.780
So in this case we are
changing something.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.670
It's not that important.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.560
So we have to actually
do mutual exclusion.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.840
So here's a way to look at
safety problems. Here might be

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.340
an algorithm that you and your
roommate have. So you arrive

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.700
home, look in the
fridge, no milk.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.680
Leave for grocery, arrive
at grocery, buy milk

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.800
and arrive at home.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.080
The minute you leave for
grocery, your roommate arrives

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.790
and do this.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.620
Then what do you have is
you have too much milk.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.770
So here's the problem
in a little bit

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.060
more abstract sense.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.890
And you need a way to
synchronize this.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.290
So how about this.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.320
No milk and no note.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.280
So you leave a note before you
actually leave the house and

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.070
buy milk, and then you come
back and remove the note.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.320
Does this work?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.900
PROFESSOR: I mean here
also you can do that,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.230
no milk and no note.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.420
So both are started.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.470
We would leave a note,
and these things can

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:39.300
happen at the same time.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.990
There's a little bit of things
saying OK, why didn't you see

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.680
your roommate.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.820
They go buy milk, he goes
to buy milk and you have

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.880
too much milk too.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.610
So the way to do this
in Java is this

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.670
notion of critical section.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.380
Critical section is where only
one thread can be in it at a

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.200
given time.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.670
The way you can do it with
Java is, you can put

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.730
synchronized in front
of the method.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:07.250
And you do that method, only
one person can be executing

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.530
that method at any one time.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.530
So in here I would say get
balance and post so you can

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.990
synchronize.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.810
So when you do that,
what happens is --

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.700
so in here you read.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.050
No problem, you can
do this parallel.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.490
You can do this in parallel.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:25.390
And then you say, first
take out post in here.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:31.730
And this [? takes out ?] post.
Because of synchronization

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.700
these things can't have an
order, because this has to

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.000
happen in some order.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.720
Either this happens first
and this has to

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.090
finish before this one.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.540
At that point you can actually
-- what happened now?

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.530
Are we happy?

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.800
At least banks realize --

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.870
bank's book is correct.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.760
Because it realizes,
here is more money.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.120
But actually it let you
take more money than

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:01.450
your account had.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.820
So at least it got
that value right.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.250
But what happened was, why
is this happening now?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.170
AUDIENCE: You want the
check covered.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.900
PROFESSOR: OK, you want
to check also.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.420
Good.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.820
So the key thing is, here
we didn't check.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.100
So you have a negative bank
balance happening.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.490
So this is a problem
with atomacity.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.760
Because synchronized
methods execute the

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.860
body at atomic units.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.860
So when that happens, the entire
thing of body happens

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.880
without anybody else
[? modifying. ?]

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.590
That's the only thing that's
happening at any given time.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.540
The code read [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.550
you chose is probably too
small in this case.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.140
What we need to do is, we
need to basically have

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.090
synchronizing not on the
method but a lot more

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.330
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in there,
so you have to do block

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.920
synchronization.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.470
So synchronized keywords
actually work like this too.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.510
You can say instead of doing
a method, you can just

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.800
synchronize account and all
those things happen

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.130
synchronously within
that block.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.060
So, now what we have done
is we have built a

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.310
bigger atomic unit.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.640
So here's the programming
here.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.250
So here's the synchronized
unit in here.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.140
So what we did was, we say
instead of these synchronized

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.270
and these synchronize
separately, both of these

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.230
computations have to
happen atomically.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.180
So when I check our
bank balance, we

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.350
can't do anything else.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.460
So now what happens?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.610
So yeah, in this situation
you're reading, reading, and

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.160
you get synchronized account
in here, and I do account

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.750
balance plus [? well ?]

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.790
and post the account.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:51.540
So in here I go to
10, I do that.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.750
If I start the other one here,
I have to wait till that

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.390
entire synchronization is
over before I do that.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.430
Of course, I don't have enough
balance, so I throw exception.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:03.680
Are we still happy?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.190
Is there issue on this one?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.030
I mean, I guess -- assume you
can do something clever, but I

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.940
haven't done that.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.150
But there's one issue in here.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.260
Which, when you start it's
just, balance is 100.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.620
So in this one, say
balance is 100.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.320
You go type it and then voila,
you type it and then, sorry, I

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.590
don't have money.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.640
So that's not nice, because if
you've got the balance you

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.840
should be able to get that.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.740
So how we deal with that?

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:40.167
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.490
PROFESSOR: So that's probably
the best solution to that

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:51.900
because we can only
log into one.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.330
But in this example I assume
what we are doing.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.253
How can we deal with this one?

00:16:57.253 --> 00:16:59.188
AUDIENCE: There are two
ways of doing it.

00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:01.283
One is to put the whole thing
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE] section.

00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:03.250
The other way is to notify
somebody that the

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.790
PROFESSOR:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.590
So what I can do is I can
say OK, wait a minute.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.060
I am actually going to
make the critical

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.520
section even bigger.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.970
So now I print the balance
before I do that.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.200
So the entire thing is
critical section.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.955
I print the balance off
and then go ahead

00:17:23.955 --> 00:17:24.270
and withdraw that.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.940
So what might happen
in this case?

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.810
That's the issue of a little
bit of waiting.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:34.840
So what happens is, in here.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.520
You do this one, and you do
synchronized account.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.590
And you put the balance and
other one do synchronized and

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.090
you ask the question.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:43.770
In here.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.770
And you start thinking.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.300
We can start thinking that my
machine is not responsive,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.420
it's just waiting for the
critical section started.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and you
have this [? IOUN ?]

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.040
sitting in the middle.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.650
That's not good either.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:56.640
So he has a performance issue.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.940
So that's not a good
way of doing that.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.870
So you don't get any
response in here.

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.730
So you can make this
atomic [? radius ?]

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.200
but there's a price you'll
pay by making it

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.450
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] large.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.710
So here's another thing
we want to do.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.250
I want to do something that can
transfer account balance

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.130
from one account to another.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.580
So I might do that if I have a
method in here to transfer

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:21.140
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.080
account, this amount.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.030
So what I do is, I synchronize
from account.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.940
I say, I get balance in here.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.350
If the balance is available,
I can synchronize the two

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.600
accounts and force it there.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.010
See any problems?

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:46.680
So let's see what happenes.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.470
So assume I want to transfer
10 to Ben's account and Ben

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.400
wants to transfer 20 to
Alyssa's account.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.420
So what happens is,
this goes --

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.250
get the value in here, and
you synchronize to

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:05.160
two and say OK, great.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.020
Now what happens is, in here,
in from, I am holding a

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.860
Alyssa's account.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.030
There I am holding
Ben's account.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.730
Now, inside I want to
synchronize for Alyssa.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.630
And I'm still [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
when I --

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.480
wait until Alyssa
got released.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.400
And he says I want to wait
till Ben got released.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.100
And nobody's going to release,
and you're hung.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.770
You are in what you call
a deadlock situation.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.020
That's a deadlock.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.690
So you have to be very careful
when you do synchronizing.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.830
If you do multiple
synchronization, the easiest

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.820
thing you can do is, you
do it in some order.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.100
And end up in a a deadlock
situation.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.470
This is a very common way of
parallel programs doing that.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.390
So how to avoid deadlock?

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.460
Because deadlock is, there's
a cycle in locking graph.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.330
So somebody's going to lock
somebody, he's going to lock

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.150
that person, and we
have a cycle.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.620
You can end up in deadlock
situation.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:06.260
So standard solution for that
is, you take locks in some

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.580
kind of canonical order.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.390
You don't take in
arbitary order.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.080
So it's some kind of a -- you
have some base in, OK, if you

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.740
are taking this lock, you have
to have, after that, you can

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.580
take a higher order lock.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.390
So you have to have some
kind of order in here.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.600
Acquire in increasing
order and release

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.475
in decreasing order.

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:29.190
So you have some kind
of force in here.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.640
This ensures deadlock freedom
most of the time, but it's not

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.820
that easy to do a
lot of the time.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.320
Because your program might not
fit into this nice ordering a

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.940
lot of times, and then sometimes
you realize that you

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.770
had locked something and at that
time it's too late when

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.350
you realize it.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.100
And then it has a
different order.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.630
So this is, you have to sometime
do some changes to

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.540
basically make the program
work like this.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.180
So in here, what you can do
is, in the program you can

00:20:54.180 --> 00:21:00.220
associate some kind of a rank,
and when you put in account,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.200
you put the rank to the
account number.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.210
So you have some kind
of ordering in here.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:08.570
Then what you have is, you
always get the first, highest

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:09.920
rank one before you
go the next one.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.520
So there's some ordering
in here.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.995
So at least then we'll be at
least forced into some

00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:16.442
ordering in here.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:19.190
AUDIENCE: Is there a way of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.660
deadlock [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.470
PROFESSOR: Not statically.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.290
Because most of the time that
means you have to know all the

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.710
possible control profile,
to do that.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.130
And, for example, there are some
tools that can -- because

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.070
you might know that, for
example, assume you are trying

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.040
to enforce some ordering
of locks.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.260
But it's not the software, it's
the locking software,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.080
that doesn't know about those.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.680
You can actually write a locking
software that will

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.460
tell you, like look, you are
trying to acquire locking out

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.060
of order, out of this
locking order.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.820
Most of the time you might be
OK because it might not hit,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.640
but [? we assume ?] that if
you are doing unsafe thing

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.350
that might work, so.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.130
So you can put some dynamic
checks that might warn you

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.730
that you might be in a
situation, but it doesn't

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.520
guarantee you.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.800
So deadlock is something, you
have to basically -- there's

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.360
no nice tools for.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.030
Basically, it's almost a
software [? methodology. ?]

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.840
So, for example, you can impose
a software methodology

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.370
to say, I'm following this
convention and that will

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.770
guarantee me deadlock freedom.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.470
So one good convention
is this, basically

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.820
some order in here.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.620
So, another interesting thing
and hard thing is race

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.390
conditions.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.570
These are non-deterministic
timing dependent, and cause

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.550
data corruption, crashes that
are impossible to detect.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:41.100
So the problem with race
conditions is the minute you

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.570
put your debug, or put any
debugging things, race

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.970
conditions goes away.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.490
It comes back when you are in
it all and you're debugging

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:49.940
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.300
It happens again because
it's basically

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.080
an independent thing.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.050
In fact, I have this
interesting

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.650
experience with myself.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.910
A long time ago I was working
at Microsoft and

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.230
I worked two summers.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.540
In one summer I was working on
their LAN manager and network

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.930
manager, and there's a bug that
after you run the network

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.410
manager for some time
it just freezes.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.560
That's not a nice behavior
to have if you are

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.370
running your network.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.330
That bug lasted the
entire year.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.550
And at the end they had,
I think, a $2,000

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.930
bounty on that bug.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.590
Because the minute you do
any instrumentation, the

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.930
[? bug isn't ?]

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.460
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.730
When you have more
instrumentation and have 100

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.840
machines running, heavily,
hitting another machine.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.310
Once in a while voila.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.200
It freezes.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.670
And you have no idea
why it happened.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.365
That was so hard to debug
because there's nothing you

00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:43.400
could do, because any time
you do any changes,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.650
the bug goes away.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.390
You had to be very careful
because these things are not

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.160
easy to find, and happen
intermittently.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.390
And very hard to debug.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.270
So having good discipline and
good design really helps to

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.000
get rid of it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.280
These are not something you can
go through like program

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.580
debugs, it [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
cycle.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.110
If you read that cycle, it's
a very slow cycle.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.230
The best way to do that is get
the design right first.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.040
So what's a data race?

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.630
So I assume I had this
program like that.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:22.500
So I read [? hit ?] in there,
and then I modify

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.710
and write in this.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.590
This doesn't have to be
in two statements.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.990
If we [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.790
same statement, the compiler
might put it in register,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.000
read, update and modify
and write.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.540
So it might just look hits
equals hits plus 1 and hits

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.340
equals hits plus
1 on the cycle.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.640
Doesn't have to
[? have temporary. ?]

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.590
and in your call.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.020
Because the compiler puts a
[? temporary ?] in there.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.840
And if you execute like
this you're happy.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.480
But if you get excluded in this
order, I don't get at it

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.170
two times, I only get it because
I read hit the order

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.010
given values.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.210
This adds once and writes.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.820
And this also adds one to
[? the ordinary value ?]

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.630
and write.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.695
So I only get it increased
by one and you

00:24:57.695 --> 00:24:59.240
are in a bad situation.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.030
The problems with data races
is this non-determinism.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.470
We ensured [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.430
that this mutual exclusion.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.660
So if you have same data access,
make sure that they

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.560
are in the mutual
exclude region.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.150
You can basically see that it
has access to old objects.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:30.470
Before you go there, one
interesting thing is this is

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.320
just a problem with all parallel
programs. So at the

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.990
beginning you say OK, I'm going
to have this nice mutual

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.060
excluded, lock ordered
program.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.500
You write this.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.890
It worked correctly,
beautifully, but run dog slow

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.150
because now we are huge
critical sections.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.560
Everybody's waiting in data and
then someone says I want

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.810
to run fast. I think I
don't need this lock.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.980
It doesn't seem to be, so keep
removing locks, making

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.560
critical sections smaller
and stuff like that.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.920
That's where all the problems
start cropping up, because all

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.780
this nice design goes
to the dogs when you

00:25:58.780 --> 00:25:59.840
have performance issues.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.520
So when you realize that, you
want to write this nice

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.980
program, nice large critical
sections, stuff like that.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.020
The programs will
work correctly.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.938
But run like a dog because now
it's sequential in many cases

00:26:09.938 --> 00:26:11.520
because you are doing this.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.500
Then you go and say OK, I
want to run parallel.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.320
Eh, this is OK.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.400
That's when problems
start creeping up.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.140
So make sure that when you get
a discipline, as you can go

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.160
into the performance improvement
but you still

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.090
maintain at least some
part of discipline.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.740
That's the hard thing.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.550
So I want to switch gears a
little bit to talk about a

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.630
classic problem.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.960
It's called dining philosophers
problem.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.270
So, there are five philosophers

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.890
sitting around a table.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:39.710
Between each of the

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.040
philosophers there's a chopstick.

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.780
So each philosopher
do two things.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:50.690
He thinks -- he or she thinks
or he or she eats.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.760
So the philosopher thinks
for a while.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.480
And then the philosopher
is hungry.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.530
She stops thinking and she
picks up a left and right

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.260
chopstick, eats, and puts
the chopsticks down.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.910
He cannot eat until they have
both chopsticks right in hand

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.370
because you can't eat
with one chopstick.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.330
So you have to wait until
you get both chopsticks.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.530
When you are done, you put
the chopsticks down.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.240
Then after you're done, you go
back to thinking again for a

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.730
while and come back to eating.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.000
That's the classic problem.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.890
So how to write that,
record that?

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.280
You can have philosopher
extend thread, and

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:30.590
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:37.490
philosopher you have a chopstick
in here, and instead

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.200
of philosopher buy left
and right chopstick.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.880
Then what you do is you create
a number of philosophers and

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.850
you get a new chopstick and
start to the left and you go

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.960
to the other philosophers
assigning left and right

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.430
chopsticks in here, and
then you start the

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.160
philosophers going.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.230
So you just set up a chopstick
[? on it, ?]

00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:01.200
and then you share the chopstick
and do that.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.790
So here is what a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.790
philosopher does.

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.900
So I am here, I'm taking my left
chopstick, I'm taking my

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.150
right chopstick and I'm going to
eat and I'm done eating and

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.260
I'm putting down there.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.120
What will happen in this one?

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.430
PROFESSOR: In what situation,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.280
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE],
but right

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.440
technical though is different.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.960
PROFESSOR: You end up in
a deadlock because

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.270
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.025
we will pick up the left
chopstick suddenly, and they

00:28:41.025 --> 00:28:42.010
all try to take the
right chopstick.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.170
There's no right chopstick and
nobody has right chopstick and

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.300
everybody waiting for somebody
to drop the chopstick, that's

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.830
not going to happen.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.320
So you have a problem.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.640
Second way to solve that is
this, and you say OK.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.780
The problem is everybody
trying to

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.150
pick up this chopstick.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:01.670
I will put unique variable
table, unique object table.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.750
If anybody want to eat, I
need to own the table.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.480
What will this do?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.830
AUDIENCE: It prevents two people
who wouldn't normally

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.970
interact from eating
at the same table.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:17.540
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.220
So what happens is only one
person can eat at a time.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.430
Which works perfectly,
beautifully, sequential.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.375
So, you wonder if one
philosopher eating, the person

00:29:28.375 --> 00:29:30.290
or [? posit ?] can eat.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.230
But you're not allowed
to because the

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.050
chopstick in there.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.200
So one way of doing that is
sequentialized large regions,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.440
with putting these critical
sections in there.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.050
This works.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.420
Not greatly, but it will work.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.030
Another thing is, of course,
what I point out to have some

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.550
kind of ordering.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:51.120
So you put some position
ordering and saying if you are

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:55.910
sitting in even position, you're
the first to pick the

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.490
left one, if you are putting
an odd position, you're

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:58.350
supposed to pick
the right one.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.640
So in some sense, it got
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.460
go here, the person go here,
so only one can get that so

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.240
you don't have ordering.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.900
At least between those two
you can maintain that.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.895
So you can do something but you
have to figure out what

00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:11.250
the right ordering in here.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.170
This is not a linear
list, linear

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:14.500
ordering for this circuit.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.160
But you can copy ordering and
say OK, look, if you do that

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:23.380
this new way, you can run into
a deadlock situation.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.780
There are a lot of types of
synchronizations in Java, and

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.410
then tomorrow you learn
more different type of

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:34.520
synchronization with available
using [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE],

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.770
so using MPI.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.620
But there are a lot of potential
problems you are

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.370
worried about.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.780
Deadlock you have
to worry about.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.480
Two or more threads stop, wait
for each other forever.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.090
Livelock.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:52.230
What livelock means is two or
more threads basically trying

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.700
to do something but never
made progress.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.560
So good example.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.960
So assume I go -- it's like
sometimes you try to cross

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.745
each other on the road and you
go into them and say oops, or

00:31:03.745 --> 00:31:06.490
you both say oops, sorry,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.480
You get into a situation that
you try to go something, both

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.620
you start to move a little bit
and then do that and you keep

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.340
doing that forever and ever,
doing it, right.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:15.650
So that can happen.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.360
If you program right, you can
actually try to avoid deadlock

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.800
by doing that, but both no one
making forward progress, so

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.050
that's called livelock.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.440
So another thing that's
called starvation.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.550
So the ordering is a
very good example.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:36.230
So ordering says the higher
order guy always gets the lock

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.080
for the lower guy.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.920
So assume you have thousands
of things and everybody's

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.240
trying to do something.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.790
If you have an lower number,
you probably never get to

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.530
around to get picked up because
always if higher order

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.490
person has, that person
will get the lock.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.890
So if they're ordering
constraint in there, you can

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.870
be in situation that some people
always get and others

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.350
never get -- there's no fairness
in that, because when

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.100
you some ordering constraints.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.480
So again, lack of fairness.

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.060
Of course, race conditions.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:17.000
So you didn't realize that the
same object is accessed by

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.650
multiple people without being
in a particular section.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.190
That's the key --

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.350
I mean don't try to do fancy
things by letting multiple

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.680
people have access
to same thing.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.760
This is not much of issue on
distributed memory machines

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.580
because there's only you
access to your memory.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:37.420
But the problem there is if you
keep values, you suddenly

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.810
start giving it to everybody and
say go play, assuming that

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.160
only one person have
access to it.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.530
So multiple people might be
modifying it and then what are

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.060
you going to do.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.190
So that issue is there.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.720
So when you are doing, using
data, you got to be very

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.100
careful who holds it
and at what time.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.740
So, concurrency and parallelism
are important

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:05.310
concepts in comparison beyond
what we are doing in here.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.870
Concurrency can simplify
programming beyond anything.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.310
It's very hard to understand and
debug concurrent programs.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.950
That's the entire reason that we
are still doing sequential

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.670
programming and this is entire
reason that multiple people

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.380
are looking at it in a very --
people are scared because

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.350
writing and getting concurrent
program right is probably an

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.630
order of magnitude harder than
trying to get sequential

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.660
programs right.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:32.660
This is issue.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.630
Parallelism is critical
for high performance.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.060
I mean, it was huge for
supercomputers in national

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.050
labs and now it's becoming
everybody's

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.300
issue because of multicore.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.610
Basically, you need to
understand concurrent and

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.510
concurrence issues, it's the
basis of writing parallel

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.670
programs. So, you will run
into all these issues,

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.770
deadlock, you can deadlock on
limited access on Cell, you

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.720
can deadlock on messages.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.510
So everybody is waiting for
somebody else to send you a

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.670
message and nobody's sending a
message because that other guy

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.230
will send you a message.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.730
You can [? easier ?]

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.600
do that in a message in there,
and a lot of times you can

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.270
deadlock in that.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.146
So this lecture we kind of did
concurrent programming, how to

00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:15.380
write a concurrent program.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.640
We are going to switch gears
and start going into

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.700
parallelism next.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.590
But keep these issues in my
mind when you are writing

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.620
parallel programs. Have things
like 617 we had very good

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.340
discipline on testing and
methodology of development.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.180
You probably won't have kind
of discipline on how to do

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.260
parallelism.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.810
So there are many ways --

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.810
next few lectures we'll cover
many different ways of doing

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.010
parallelism.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.210
Parallelism's a very powerful
tool, but if you don't use it

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.650
in a disciplined way, you will
not be able to debug these

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:50.620
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.300
I mean you run into bugs that
are so subtle, so difficult

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.410
it's very hard to find.

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:58.530
You don't want in
that situation.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.820
So having a good design, good
disciplining programming will

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.250
actually get you working
correct program.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:06.960
Good.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.630
That's all I have for today.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:12.520
You can spend some time
filling out this one.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.120
Just put your name down
and you're done.
