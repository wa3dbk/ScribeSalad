00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.070
PROFESSOR: So last week, last
few lectures, you heard about

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.760
parallel architectures and
started with lecture four on

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.290
discussions of concurrency.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.730
How do you take applications
or independent actors that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.260
want to operate on the
same data and make

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.790
them run safely together?

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.930
And so just recapping the last
two lectures, you saw really

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.330
two primary classes
of architectures.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.800
Although Saman talked
about a few more.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.630
There was the class of shared
memory processors, you know,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.500
the multicores that Intel, AMD,
and PowerPC, for example,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.970
have today, where you have
one copy of the data.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.660
And that's really shared among
all the different processors

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.770
because they essentially
share the same memory.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.460
And you need things like
atomicity and synchronization

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.770
to be able to make sure that the
sharing is done properly

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.230
so that you don't get into data
race situations where

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.790
multiple processors try to
update the same data element

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.260
and you end up with
erroneous results.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.530
You also heard about distributed
memory processors.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.780
So an example of that might be
the Cell, loosely said, where

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.710
you have cores that primarily
access their own local memory.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.940
And while you can have a single
global memory address

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.410
space, to get data from memory
you essentially have to

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.720
communicate with the different
processors to explicitly fetch

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.340
data in and out.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.640
So things like data
distribution, where the data

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.730
is, and what your communication
pattern is like

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.980
affect your performance.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.340
So what I'm going to talk about
in today's lecture is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.940
programming these two
different kinds of

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.260
architectures, shared memory
processors and distributed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.570
memory processors, and present
you with some concepts for

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.890
commonly programming
these machines.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.620
So in shared memory processors,
you have, say, n

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.070
processors, 1 to n.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.890
And they're connected
to a single memory.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.810
And if one processor asks for
the value stored at address X,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.270
everybody knows where
it'll go look.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.480
Because there's only one address
X. And so different

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.000
processors can communicate
through shared variables.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.620
And you need things like
locking, as I mentioned, to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.900
avoid race conditions or
erroneous computation.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.860
So as an example of
parallelization, you know,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.220
straightforward parallelization
in a shared

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.000
memory machine, would be you
have the simple loop that's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.610
just running through an array.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.140
And you're adding elements of
array A to elements of array

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.480
B. And you're going to write
them to some new array, C.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.880
Well, if I gave you this loop
you can probably recognize

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.370
that there's really no data
dependencies here.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.860
I can split up this loop into
three chunks -- let's say I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.010
have three processors -- where
one processor does all the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.310
computations for iterations
zero through three, so the

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.470
first four iterations.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.530
Second processor does the
next four iterations.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.600
And the third processor does
the last four iterations.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.473
And so that's shown with the
little -- should have brought

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:27.680
a laser pointer.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.500
So that's showing here.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.980
And what you might need to
do is some mechanism to

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.840
essentially tell the different
processors, here's the code

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.110
that you need to run and
maybe where to start.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.070
And then you may need some way
of sort of synchronizing these

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.765
different processors that say,
I'm done, I can move on to the

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.490
next computation steps.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.950
So this is an example of a data
parallel computation.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.720
The loop has no real
dependencies and, you know,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.840
each processor can operate
on different data sets.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.540
And what you could do is you
can have a process --

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.360
this is a single application
that forks off or creates what

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.840
are commonly called
the threads.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.230
And each thread goes on and
executes in this case the same

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.860
computation.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.970
So a single process can create
multiple concurrent threads.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.290
And really each thread is just
a mechanism for encapsulating

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.060
some trace of execution,
some execution path.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.980
So in this case you're
essentially encapsulating this

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.860
particular loop here.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.670
And maybe you parameterize
your start index and your

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.990
ending index or maybe
your loop bounds.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.420
And in a shared memory
processor, since you're

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.470
communicating --

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.760
since there's only a single
memory, really you don't need

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.900
to do anything special about
the data in this particular

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.270
example, because everybody knows
where to go look for it.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.240
Everybody can access it.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.330
Everything's independent.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.850
There's no real issues with
races or deadlocks.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.930
So I just wrote down some actual
code for that loop that

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.315
parallelize it using Pthreads,
a commonly

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:01.530
used threading mechanism.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.200
Just to give you a little bit
of flavor for, you know, the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.580
complexity of -- the simple loop
that we had expands to a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.840
lot more code in this case.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.300
So you have your array.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.050
It has 12 elements.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.930
A, B, and C. And you have
the basic functions.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.710
So this is the actual code
or computation that we

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.010
want to carry out.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.190
And what I've done here is
I've parameterized where

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.790
you're essentially starting
in the array.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.090
So you get this parameter.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.210
And then you calculate four
iterations' worth.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.312
And this is essentially the
computation that we're

00:05:31.312 --> 00:05:31.870
carrying out.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.500
And now in my main program or
in my main function, rather,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.320
what I do is I have this concept
of threads that I'm

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.140
going to create.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.140
In this case I'm going to
create three of them.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.040
There are some parameters that
I have to pass in, so some

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.670
attributes which are now
going to get into here.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.470
But then I pass in the
function pointer.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.220
This is essentially a mechanism
that says once I've

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.030
created this thread, I go to
this function and execute this

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.920
particular code.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.320
And then some arguments
that are functions.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.850
So here I'm just passing in an
index at which each loop

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.400
switch starts with.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.790
And after I've created each
thread here, implicitly in the

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.140
thread creation, the
code can just

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.210
immediately start running.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.800
And then once all the threads
have started running, I can

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.470
essentially just exit
the program

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.720
because I've completed.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.100
So what I've shown you with
that first example was the

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.670
concept of, or example
of, data parallelism.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.790
So you're performing the same
computation, but instead of

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.140
operating on one big chunk of
data, I've partitioned the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.020
data into smaller chunks
and I've replicated the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.190
computation so that I can get
that kind of parallelism.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.700
But there's another form of
parallelism called control

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.630
parallelism, which essentially
uses the same model of

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.330
threading but doesn't
necessarily have to run the

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.380
same function or run the same
computation each thread.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.400
So I've sort of illustrated
that in the illustration

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.050
there, where these are your data
parallel computations and

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:06.390
these are some other
computations in your code.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.370
So there is sort of a
programming model that allows

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.580
you to do this kind of
parallelism and tries to sort

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.840
of help the programmer by taking
their sequential code

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.770
and then adding annotations that
say, this loop is data

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:27.500
parallel or this set of code
is has this kind of control

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.000
parallelism in it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.760
So you start with your
parallel code.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.900
This is the same program,
multiple data kind of

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.870
parallelization.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.020
So you might have seen in the
previous talk and the previous

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.390
lecture, it was SIMD, single
instruction or same

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.130
instruction, multiple data,
which allowed you to execute

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.950
the same operation, you
know, and add over

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.490
multiple data elements.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.630
So here it's a similar
kind of terminology.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.510
There's same program, multiple
data, and multiple program,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.920
multiple data.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.600
This talk is largely focused on
the SPMD model, where you

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.860
essentially have one central
decision maker or you're

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.670
trying to solve one central
computation.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.190
And you're trying to parallelize
that over your

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.470
architecture to get the
best performance.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.990
So you start off with your
program and then you annotate

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.200
the code with what's parallel
and what's not parallel.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.990
And you might add in some
synchronization directives so

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.450
that if you do in fact have
sharing, you might want to use

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.320
the right locking mechanism
to guarantee safety.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.990
Now, in OpenMP, there are
some limitations as

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.840
to what it can do.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.130
So it in fact assumes
that the programmer

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.260
knows what he's doing.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.670
And the programmer is largely
responsible for getting the

00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.680
synchronization right, or that
if they're sharing that they

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.900
get those dependencies
protected correctly.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.850
So you can take your program,
insert these annotations, and

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.950
then you go on and
test and debug.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.730
So a simple OpenMP example,
again using the simple loop --

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.930
now, I've thrown away some of
the extra code -- you're

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.190
adding these two extra
pragmas in this case.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:05.370
The first one, your parallel
pragma, I call the data

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.450
parallel pragma, really says
that you can execute as many

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.120
of the following code block as
there are processors or as

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.250
many as you have thread
contexts.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.260
So in this case I implicitly
made the assumption that I

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.840
have three processors, so I can
automatically partition my

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.060
code into three sets.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.380
And this transformation can sort
of be done automatically

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.810
by the compiler.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.750
And then there's a for pragma
that says this loop is

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.430
parallel and you can divide up
the work in the mechanism

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.230
that's work sharing.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.430
So multiple threads can
collaborate to solve the same

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.540
computation, but each one does
a smaller amount of work.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:49.760
So this is in contrast to what
I'm going to focus on a lot

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.190
more in the rest of our talk,
which is distributed memory

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.080
processors and programming
for distributed memories.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.760
And this will feel a lot more
like programming for the Cell

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.780
as you get more and more
involved in that and your

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.930
projects get more intense.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.220
So in distributed memory
processors, to recap the

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.020
previous lectures, you
have n processors.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.070
Each processor has
its own memory.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.180
And they essentially share the
interconnection network.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.670
Each processor has its own
address, X. So when a

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.440
processor, P1, asks for X it
knows where to go look.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.810
It's going to look in its
own local memory.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.490
So if all processors are asking
for the same value as

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.670
sort of address X, then each
one goes and looks in a

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.280
different place.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.620
So there are n places
to look, really.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.830
And what's stored in those
addresses will vary because

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.200
it's everybody's local memory.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.150
So if one processor, say P1,
wants to look at the value

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.480
stored in processor two's
address, it actually has to

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.120
explicitly request it.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.320
The processor two has
to send it data.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.880
And processor one has to figure
out, you know, what to

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.720
do with that copy.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.970
So it has to store
it somewhere.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.400
So this message passing really
exposes explicit communication

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.300
to exchange data.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.620
And you'll see that there are
different kinds of data

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:12.800
communications.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.240
But really the concept of what
you exchange has three

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.030
different -- or four different,
rather --

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.300
things you need to address.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.760
One is how is the data
described and

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.530
what does it describe?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:25.970
How are the processes
identified?

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.870
So how do I identify that
processor one is

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.990
sending me this data?

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.760
And if I'm receiving data
how do I know who I'm

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.010
receiving it from?

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.570
Are all messages the same?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.100
Well, you know, if I send a
message to somebody, do I have

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.770
any guarantee that it's
received or not?

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.450
And what does it mean for a send
operation or a receive

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.720
operation to be completed?

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.580
You know, is there some sort
of acknowledgment process?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.380
So an example of a message
passing program -- and if

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.580
you've started to look at the
lab you'll see that this is

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.770
essentially where the
lab came from.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.920
It's the same idea.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.050
I've created -- here I have some
two-dimensional space.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.380
And I have points in this
two-dimensional space.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.920
I have points B, which are these
blue circles, and I have

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.160
points A which I've represented
as these yellow or

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.040
golden squares.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.740
And what I want to do is for
every point in A I want to

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.820
calculate the distance to all
of the points B. So there's

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.190
sort of a pair wise interaction

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.880
between the two arrays.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.710
So a simple loop that
essentially does this --

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.980
and there are n squared
interactions, you have, you

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.410
know, a loop that loops over
all the A elements, a loop

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.920
that loops over all
the B elements.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.350
And you essentially calculate
in this case Euclidean

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:43.500
distance which I'm
not showing.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.990
And you store it into
some new array.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.800
So if I give you two processors
to do this work,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.180
processor one and processor
two, and I give you some

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.780
mechanism to share between
the two --

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.270
so here's my CPU.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.940
Each processor has
local memory.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.300
What would be some approach
for actually

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.360
parallelizing this?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.240
Anybody look at the lab yet?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.860
OK, so what would you do
with two processors?

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:19.630
AUDIENCE: One has half
memory [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.120
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.360
So what was said was that you
split one of the arrays in two

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.590
and you can actually get that
kind of concurrency.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.080
So, you know, let's
say processor one

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.470
already has the data.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.320
And it has some place that it's
already allocated where

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.270
it's going to write C, the
results of the computation,

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.860
then I can break up the work
just like it was suggested.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.550
So what P1 has to do
is send data to P2.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.650
It says here's the data.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.190
Here's the computation.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.250
Go ahead and help me out.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.340
So I send the first array
elements, and then I send half

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.580
of the other elements
that I want the

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.630
calculations done for.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.760
And then P1 and P2 can
now sort of start

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.670
computing in parallel.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.650
But notice that P2 has its own
array that it's going to store

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.210
results in.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.210
And so as these compute they
actually fill in different

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.570
logical places or logical parts
of the overall matrix.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.720
So what has to be done is at the
end for P1 to have all the

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.880
results, P2 has to send it sort
of the rest of the matrix

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.400
to complete it.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.200
And so now P1 has
all the results.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.480
The computation is done
and you can move on.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.690
Does that make sense?

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:31.870
OK.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.490
So you'll get to actually do
this as part of your labs.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.600
So in this example messaging
program, you have started out

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.170
with a sequential code.

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.330
And we had two processors.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.570
So processor one actually
sends the code.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.410
So it is essentially a template
for the code you'll

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.350
end up writing.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.330
And it does have to work
in the outer loop.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.480
So this n array over which it
is iterating the A array, is

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.840
it's only doing half as many.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.170
And processor two has to
actually receive the data.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.140
And it specifies where to
receive the data into.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.110
So I've omitted some things, for
example, extra information

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.260
sort of hidden in these
parameters.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.650
So here you're sending all of
A, all of B. Whereas, you

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.600
know, you could have specified
extra parameters that says,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.740
you know, I'm sending you A.
Here's n elements to read from

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.110
A. Here's B. Here's n by
two elements to read

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.040
from B. And so on.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.650
But the computation is
essentially the same except

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.140
for the index at which you
start, in this case changed

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.370
for processor two.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.610
And now, when the computation is
done, this guy essentially

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.180
waits until the data
is received.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.410
Processor two eventually sends
it that data and now

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.050
you can move on.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.450
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.215
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:15:53.215 --> 00:15:57.583
AUDIENCE: So would processor two
have to wait for the data

00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:58.554
from processor one?

00:15:58.554 --> 00:15:59.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so there's a --

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:01.760
I'll get into that later.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.980
So what does it mean
to receive?

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.670
To do this computation, I
actually need this instruction

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.420
to complete.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.250
So what does it need for that
instruction to complete?

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.370
I do have to get the data
because otherwise I don't know

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.360
what to compute on.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.140
So there is some implicit
synchronization

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.100
that you have to do.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.490
And in some cases
it's explicit.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.770
So I'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.400
Does that sort of hint
at the answer?

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.140
Are you still confused?

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.040
AUDIENCE: So processor one
doesn't do the computation but

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.330
it still sends the data --

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:41.470
PROFESSOR: So in terms of
tracing, processor one sends

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.940
the data and then can
immediately start executing

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.380
its code, right?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.960
Processor two, in this
particular example, has to

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.500
wait until it receives
the data.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.810
So once this receive completes,
then you can

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.770
actually go and start executing

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.070
the rest of the code.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.930
So imagine that it essentially
says, wait until I have data.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:16:59.950
Wait until I have
something to do.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.720
Does that help?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.670
AUDIENCE: Can the
main processor

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.080
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.920
PROFESSOR: Can the
main processor --

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.196
AUDIENCE: I mean, in Cell,
everybody is not peers.

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:13.360
There is a master there.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.760
And what master can do instead
of doing computation, master

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.713
can be basically the
quarterback, sending data,

00:17:21.713 --> 00:17:22.061
receiving data.

00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:25.534
And SPEs can be basically
waiting for data, get the

00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:26.750
computation, send it back.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.728
So in some sense in Cell you
probably don't want to do the

00:17:30.728 --> 00:17:32.498
computation on the master.

00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:34.140
Because that means the
master slows down.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.608
The master will do only
the data management.

00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:41.730
So that might be one symmetrical
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.280
PROFESSOR: And you'll see
that in the example.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.500
Because the PPE in that case
has to send the data to two

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.390
different SPEs.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.580
Yup?

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.136
AUDIENCE: In some sense
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.005
at points seems to be
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] sense that if

00:17:57.005 --> 00:18:00.368
-- so have a huge array
and you want to

00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:03.090
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] the
data to receive the whole

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.940
array, then you have
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we'll
get into that later.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.840
Yeah, I mean, that's
a good point.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.450
You know, communication
is not cheap.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.140
And if you sort of don't take
that into consideration, you

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.920
end up paying a lot
for overhead for

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.640
parallelizing things.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.250
PROFESSOR: Well, you can do
things in software as well.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.210
We'll get into that.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.850
OK, so some crude performance
analysis.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.960
So I have to calculate
this distance.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.610
And given two processors, I can

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.020
effectively get a 2x speedup.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.620
By dividing up the work I can
get done in half the time.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.250
Well, if you gave me four
processors, I can maybe get

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.980
done four times as fast. And
in my communication model

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.690
here, I have one copy of one
array that's essentially

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.540
sending to every processor.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.060
And there's some subset of A.
So I'm partitioning my other

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.580
array into smaller subsets.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.320
And I'm sending those to each
of the different processors.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.610
So we'll get into terminology
for how to actually name these

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.820
communications later.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.930
But really the thing to take
away here is that this

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.000
granularity -- how I'm
partitioning A -- affects my

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.580
performance and communication
almost directly.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.690
And, you know, the comment that
was just made is that,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:16.090
you know, what do you do
about communication?

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.040
It's not free.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.270
So all of those will
be addressed.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.150
So to understand performance,
we sort of summarize three

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:23.950
main concepts that you
essentially need to

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.890
understand.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.945
One is coverage, or in other
words, how much parallelism do

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:32.880
I actually have in
my application?

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.980
And this can actually affect,
you know, how much work is it

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.730
worth spending on this
particular application?

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.910
Granularity --

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.860
you know, how do you partition
your data among your different

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.980
processors so that you can keep
communication down, so

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.970
you can keep synchronization
down, and so on.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.130
Locality --

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.990
so while not shown in the
particular example, if two

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.840
processors are communicating, if
they are close in space or

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.570
far in space, or if the
communication between two

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.400
processors is far cheaper than
two other processors, can I

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.540
exploit that in some way?

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.370
And so we'll talk about
that as well.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.170
So an example of sort of
parallelism in an application,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.030
there are two essentially
projects that are doing ray

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.030
tracing, so I thought I'd
have this slide here.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.890
You know, how much parallelism
do you have in

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.490
a ray tracing program.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.170
In ray tracing what you do is
you essentially have some

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.080
camera source, some observer.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.060
And you're trying to figure out,
you know, how to color or

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.180
how to shade different pixels
in your screen.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.160
So what you do is you shoot rays
from a particular source

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.850
through your plane.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.270
And then you see how the rays
bounce off of other objects.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.310
And that allows you to render
scenes in various ways.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.580
So you have different kinds of
parallelisms. You have your

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.190
primary ray that's shot in.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.750
And if you're shooting into
something like water or some

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.440
very reflective surface, or some
surface that can actually

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.410
reflect, transmit, you can
essentially end up with a lot

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.980
more rays that are created
at run time.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.040
So there's dynamic parallelism
in this particular example.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.800
And you can shoot a lot
of rays from here.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.190
So there's different kinds of
parallelism you can exploit.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.080
Not all prior programs have this
kind of, sort of, a lot

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.450
of parallelism, or
embarrassingly parallel

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.180
computation.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.490
You know, you saw
some basic code

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.090
sequences in earlier lectures.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.020
So there's a sequential part.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.710
And the reason this is
sequential is because there

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.020
are data flow dependencies
between each of the different

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.090
computations.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.600
So here I calculate a, but I
need the result of a to do

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.660
this instruction.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.300
I calculate d here and I need
that result to calculate e.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.722
But then this loop really here
is just assigning or it's

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:46.860
initializing some big array.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.940
And I can really do
that in parallel.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.520
So I have sequential parts
and parallel parts.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.590
So how does that affect
my overall speedups?

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.460
And so there's this law which
is really a demonstration of

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.550
diminishing returns,
Amdahl's Law.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.850
It says that if, you know, you
have a really fast car, it's

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.310
only as good to you as fast
as you can drive it.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.880
So if there's a lot of
congestion on your road or,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.320
you know, there are posted speed
limits or some other

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.700
mechanism, you really can't
exploit all the

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.670
speed of your car.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.440
Or in other words, you're only
as fast as the fastest

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.940
mechanisms of the computation
that you can have.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:31.530
So to look at this in more
detail, your potential speedup

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.210
is really proportional to the
fraction of the code that can

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.420
be parallelized.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.730
So if I have some computation
-- let's say it has three

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.355
parts: a sequential part that
takes 25 seconds, a parallel

00:22:42.355 --> 00:22:45.120
part that takes 50 seconds,
and a sequential part that

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.250
runs in 25 seconds.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.680
So the total execution
time is 100 seconds.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.390
And if I have one processor,
that's really all I can do.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.350
And if she gave me more than one
processor -- so let's say

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.010
I have five processors.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.390
Well, I can't do anything about
the sequential work.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.920
So that's still going
to take 25 seconds.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.120
And I can't do anything about
this sequential work either.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.850
That still takes 25 seconds.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.080
But this parallel part I can
essentially break up among the

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.060
different processors.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.470
So five in this case.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.680
And that gets me, you know,
five-way parallelism.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.970
So the 50 seconds now is
reduced to 10 seconds.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.990
Is that clear so far?

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.330
So the overall running time in
that case is 60 seconds.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.690
So what would be my speedup?

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:29.580
Well, you calculate speedup,
old running time divided by

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.790
the new running time.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.820
So 100 seconds divided
by 60 seconds.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.020
Or my parallel version
is 1.67 times faster.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.660
So this is great.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.690
If I increase the number of
processors, then I should be

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:41.980
able to get more and
more parallelism.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:47.530
But it also means that there's
sort of an upper bound on how

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.160
much speedup you can get.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.450
So if you look at the fraction
of work in your application

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.840
that's parallel, that's p.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.530
And your number of processors,
well, your speedup is --

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.270
let's say the old running time
is just one unit of work.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.340
If the time it takes for the
sequential work -- so that's 1

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.720
minus p, since p is the fraction
of the parallel work.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.120
And it's the time to do
the parallel work.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.480
And since I can parallelize
that fraction over n

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.500
processors, I can sort of reduce
that to really small

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.640
amounts in the limit.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.890
Does that make sense so far?

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.260
So the speedup can tend to 1
over 1 minus p in the limit.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.560
If I increase the number of
processors or that gets really

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.820
large, that's essentially my
upper bound on how fast

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.110
programs can work.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.550
You know, how much can I exploit
out of my program?

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.370
So this is great.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:43.540
What this law says -- the
implication here is if your

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.790
program has a lot of inherent
parallelism, you

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.010
can do really well.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.090
But if your program doesn't have
any parallelism, well,

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.450
there's really nothing
you can do.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.680
So parallel architectures
won't really help you.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.660
And there's some interesting
trade-offs, for example, that

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.850
you might consider if you're
designing a chip or if you're

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.670
looking at an application or
domain of applications,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.080
figuring out what is the best
architecture to run them on.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.510
So in terms of performance
scalability, as I increase the

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.890
number of processors,
I have speedup.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.230
You can define, sort of,
an efficiency to

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.570
be linear at 100%.

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:20.590
But typically you end up in sort
of the sublinear domain.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:25.800
That's because communication
is not often free.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.350
But you can get super linear
speedups ups on real

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.450
architectures because of
secondary and tertiary effects

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.770
that come from register
allocation or caching effects.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.120
So they can hide a lot of
latency or you can take

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.090
advantage of a lot of pipelining
mechanisms in the

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.330
architecture to get super
linear speedups.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.620
So you can end up in two
different domains.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:55.000
So a small, you know, overview
of the extent of parallelism

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.440
in your program and
how that affects

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.280
your overall execution.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.620
And the other concept
is granularity.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.520
So given that I have this
much parallelism, how

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.590
do I exploit it?

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.810
There are different ways of
exploiting it, and that comes

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.440
down to, well, how do I
subdivide my problem?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.410
What is the granularity of the
sub-problems I'm going to

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.320
calculate on?

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.130
And, really, granularity from
my perspective, is just a

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.760
qualitative measure of what is
the ratio of your computation

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.950
to your communication?

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.130
So if you're doing a lot of
computation, very little

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.400
communication, you could
be doing really

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.580
well or vice versa.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.240
Then you could be computation
limited, and so you need a lot

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.450
of bandwidth for example
in your architecture.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.258
AUDIENCE: Like before, you
really didn't have to give

00:26:37.258 --> 00:26:40.880
every single processor
an entire copy of B.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.850
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:42.010
Yeah.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.070
Good point.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.960
And as you saw in the previous
slides, you have --

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.380
computation stages
are separated by

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.790
communication stages.

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.070
And your communication in a
lot of cases essentially

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.060
serves as synchronization.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.560
I need everybody to get to the
same point before I can move

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.780
on logically in my
computation.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.830
So there are two kinds of sort
of classes of granularity.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.840
There's fine grain and, as
you'll see, coarse grain.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.010
So in fine-grain parallelism,
you have low computation to

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.460
communication ratio.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.150
And that has good properties
in that you have a small

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.010
amount of work done between
communication stages.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.910
And it has bad properties in
that it gives you less

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.530
performance opportunity.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.850
It should be more, right?

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.100
More opportunity for --

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:35.600
AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.100
Less.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.480
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.120
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.370
I didn't get enough sleep.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.470
So less opportunities for
performance enhancement, but

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.870
you have high communication
ratio because essentially

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:50.800
you're communicating
very often.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.120
So these are the computations
here and these yellow bars are

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.850
the synchronization points.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.640
So I have to distribute
data or communicate.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.000
I do computations but,
you know, computation

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.990
doesn't last very long.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.410
And I do more communication or
more synchronization, and I

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:07.750
repeat the process.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.370
So naturally you can adjust this
granularity to sort of

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.530
reduce the communication
overhead.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.510
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:17.010
two things in that
overhead part.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.120
One is the volume.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.380
So one, communication.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.484
Also there's a large part
of synchronization cost.

00:28:23.484 --> 00:28:26.210
Basically you get a
communication goal and you

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.022
have to go start the messages
and wait until

00:28:29.022 --> 00:28:29.210
everybody is done.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.250
So that overhead also can go.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:35.642
Even if you don't send that much
data, just the fact that

00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:38.260
you are communicating, that
means you have to do a lot of

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.076
this additional bookkeeping
stuff, that especially in the

00:28:43.076 --> 00:28:43.679
distributed [? memory ?]

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:44.954
[? machine is ?] pretty
expensive.

00:28:44.954 --> 00:28:45.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.780
Thanks.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.490
So in coarse-grain parallelism,
you sort of make

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.070
the work chunks more and
more so that you do the

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.440
communication synchronization
less and less.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440
And so that's shown here.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.750
You do longer pieces of
work and have fewer

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:04.370
synchronization stages.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.690
So in that regime, you can have
more opportunities for

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.590
performance improvements, but
the tricky thing that you get

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.730
into is what's called
load balancing.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.090
So if each of these different
computations takes differing

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.130
amounts of time to complete,
then what you might end up

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.380
doing is a lot of people might
end up idle as they wait until

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.690
everybody's essentially reached
their finish line.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:27.960
Yep?

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.000
AUDIENCE: If you don't have to
acknowledge that something's

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.593
done can't you just say, [?

00:29:31.593 --> 00:29:32.040
OK, I'm done with
your salt ?].

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.570
Hand it to the initial
processor

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.100
and keep doing whatever?

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.470
PROFESSOR: So, you can do
that in cases where that

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.430
essentially there is a
mechanism -- or the

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.340
application allows for it.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.473
But as I'll show -- well, you
won't see until the next

00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:46.340
lecture -- there are
dependencies, for example,

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.420
that might preclude you
from doing that.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.170
If everybody needs to reach the
same point because you're

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.550
updating a large data structure
before you can go

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.290
on, then you might not
be able to do that.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.810
So think of doing molecular
dynamics simulations.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.970
You need everybody to calculate
a new position

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.895
before you can go on and
calculate new kinds of coarse

00:30:02.895 --> 00:30:03.030
interactions.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.700
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
nothing else to calculate yet.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.700
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.410
AUDIENCE: But also there
is pipelining.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.400
So what do you talk about
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] because you

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.785
might want to get the next data
while you're computing

00:30:10.785 --> 00:30:13.830
now so that when I'm done
I can start sending.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] you
can all have some of that.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.970
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.935
Yeah, because communication is
such an intensive part, there

00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:22.920
are different ways of
dealing with it.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.000
And that will be right
after load balancing.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.880
So the load balancing problem
is just an illustration.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.610
And things that appear in sort
of this lightish pink will

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:34.900
serve as sort of visual cues.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.985
This is the same color coding
scheme that David's using in

00:30:36.985 --> 00:30:37.780
the recitations.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.620
So this is PPU code.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.180
Things that appear in yellow
will be SPU code.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.490
And these are just meant to
essentially show you how you

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.780
might do things like this on
Cell, just to help you along

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.930
in picking up more of the syntax
and functionality you

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.190
need for your programs.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:58.090
So in the load balancing
problem, you essentially have,

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:03.930
let's say, three different
threads of computation.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.880
And so that's shown here:
red, blue, and orange.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.650
And you've reached some
communication stage.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:13.560
So the PPU program in this case
is saying, send a message

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.340
to each of my SPEs, to each of
my different processors, that

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.210
you're ready to start.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.150
And so now once every processor
gets that message,

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.370
they can start computing.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.970
And let's assume they have data
and so on ready to go.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:29.880
And what's going to happen is
each processor is going to run

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.710
through the computation
at different rates.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.980
Now this could be because
one processor

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.100
is faster than another.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.960
Or it could be because
one processor is

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.930
more loaded than another.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:40.550
Or it could be just because
each processor is assigned

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.090
sort of differing
amounts of work.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.090
So one has a short loop.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.240
One has a longer loop.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.400
And so as the animation shows,
sort of, execution proceeds

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.930
and everybody's waiting until
the orange guy has completed.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.200
But nobody could have made
progress until everybody's

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.130
reached synchronization point
because, you know, there's a

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.160
strict dependence that's being
enforced here that says, I'm

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.820
going to wait until everybody's
told me they're

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:08.130
done before I go on to the
next step of computation.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.500
And so you know, in Cell
you do that using

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.360
mailboxes in this case.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.610
That clear so far?

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.160
So how do you get around this
load balancing problem?

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.800
Well, there are two
different ways.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.430
There's static load balancing.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.540
I know my application
really, really well.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:27.280
And I understand sort of
different computations.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.920
So what I can do is I can divide
up the work and have a

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.320
static mapping of the work
to my processors.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.890
And static mapping just means,
you know, in this particular

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.680
example, that I'm going to
assign the work to different

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.820
processors and that's what
the processors will do.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.410
Work can't shift around
between processors.

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:49.330
And so in this case I
have a work queue.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.750
Each of those bars is
some computation.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.590
You know, I can assign some
chunk to P1, processor one,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.400
some chunk to processor two.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.060
And then computation
can go on.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.320
Those allocations
don't change.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.430
So this works well if I
understand the application,

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.760
well and I know the computation,
and my cores are

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.780
relatively homogeneous and, you
know, there's not a lot of

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:13.540
contention for them.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.690
So if all the cores are the
same, each core has an equal

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.710
amount of work -- the total
amount of work -- this works

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.470
really well because nobody
is sitting too idle.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.140
It doesn't work so well for
heterogeneous architectures or

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:24.590
multicores.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.690
Because one might be faster
than the other.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.470
It increases the complexity of
the allocation I need to do.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:33.170
If there's a lot of contention
for some resources, then that

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.470
can affect the static
load balancing.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:41.180
So work distribution might
end up being uneven.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.740
So the alternative is dynamic
load balancing.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.040
And you certainly could do
sort of a hybrid load

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.860
balancing, static plus
dynamic mechanism.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.360
Although I don't have
that in the slides.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:57.020
So in the dynamic load
balancing scheme, two

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.860
different mechanisms I'm
going to illustrate.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.620
So in the first scheme, you
start with something like the

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.610
static mechanism.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:07.090
So I have some work going
to processor one.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.080
And I have some work going
to processor two.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.840
But then as processor two
executes and completes faster

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.610
than processor one, it takes on
some of the additional work

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.520
from processor one.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.650
So the work that was here
is now shifted.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.160
And so you can keep helping
out, you know, your other

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.040
processors to compute
things faster.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.630
In the other scheme, you have
a work queue where you

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.780
essentially are distributing
work on the fly.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.740
So as things complete, you're
just sending them

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.240
more work to do.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.610
So in this animation
here, I start off.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.820
I send work to two different
processors.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.780
P2 is really fast so it's just
zipping through things.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.360
And then P1 eventually finishes
and new work is

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.570
allocated to the two
different schemes.

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.120
So dynamic load balancing is
intended to sort of give equal

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.250
amounts of work in a different
scheme for processors.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.880
So it really increased
utilization and spent less and

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.310
less time being idle.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.500
OK.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.480
So load balancing was one part
of sort of how granularity can

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.270
have a performance trade-off.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.660
The other is synchronization.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.520
So there were already some good
questions as to, well,

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.350
you know, how does this play
into overall execution?

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:17.000
When can I wait?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.810
When can't I wait?

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:21.930
So I'm going to illustrate it
with just a simple data

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.960
dependence graph.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.600
Although you can imagine that
in each one of these circles

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.550
there's some really heavy
load computation.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.340
And you'll see that in the
next lecture, in fact.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:32.540
So if I have some simple
computation here --

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.930
I have some operands.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.800
I'm doing an addition.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.910
Here I do another addition.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.690
I need both of these results
before I can do this

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.140
multiplication.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.070
Here I have, you know, some
loop that's adding through

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.200
some array elements.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.870
I need all those results before
I do final substraction

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.580
and produce my final result.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.330
So what are some synchronization
points here?

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.630
Well, it really depends on how
I allocate the different

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.090
instructions to processors.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.580
So if I have an allocation that
just says, well, let's

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.240
put all these chains on one
processor, put these two

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.470
chains on two different
processors, well, where are my

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.890
synchronization points?

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:13.120
Well, it depends on where this
guy is and where this guy is.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.880
Because for this instruction
to execute, it needs to

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.910
receive data from P1 and P2.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:23.260
So if P1 and P2 are different
from what's in that box,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.100
somebody has to wait.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.460
And so there's a

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.550
synchronization that has to happen.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.520
So essentially at all join
points there's potential for

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.510
synchronization.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.810
But I can adjust the granularity
so that I can

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.330
remove more and more
synchronization points.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.950
So if I had assigned all this
entire sub-graph to the same

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.580
processor, I really get rid of
the synchronization because it

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.910
is essentially local to that
particular processor.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.820
And there's no extra messaging
that would have to happen

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.415
across processors that says,
I'm ready, or I'm ready to

00:37:01.415 --> 00:37:04.330
send you data, or you can move
on to the next step.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:06.650
And so in this case the last
synchronization point would be

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.890
at this join point.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.470
Let's say if it's allocated on
P1 or on some other processor.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.420
So how would I get rid of this
synchronization point?

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:19.080
AUDIENCE: Do the whole thing.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:19.390
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.160
You put the entire thing
on a single processor.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.940
But you get no parallelism
in this case.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.360
So the coarse-grain, fine-grain
grain parallelism

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.410
granularity issue
comes to play.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.410
So the last sort of thing I'm
going to talk about in terms

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:37.440
of how granularity impacts
performance -- and this was

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.570
already touched on -- is that
communication is really not

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.760
cheap and can be quite
overwhelming on a lot of

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.820
architectures.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.600
And what's interesting about
multicores is that they're

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.840
essentially putting a lot
more resources closer

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.470
together on a chip.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:55.010
So it essentially is changing
the factors for communication.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.910
So rather than having, you know,
your parallel cluster

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.700
now which is connected, say,
by ethernet or some other

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.690
high-speed link, now you
essentially have large

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.920
clusters or will have large
clusters on a chip.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.250
So communication factors
really change.

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:15.310
But the cost model is relatively
captured by these

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:16.560
different parameters.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.450
So what is the cost of
my communication?

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.915
Well, it's equal to, well, how
many messages am I sending and

00:38:26.915 --> 00:38:30.130
what is the frequency with
which I'm sending them?

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.130
There's some overhead
for message.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.140
So I have to actually package
data together.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.920
I have to stick in a control
header and then send it out.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.360
So that takes me some work
on the receiver side.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.450
I have to take the message.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:46.390
I maybe have to decode the
header, figure out where to

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.470
store the data that's coming
in on the message.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.700
So there's some overhead
associated with that as well.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.420
There's a network delay for
sending a message, so putting

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.375
a message on the network so that
it can be transmitted, or

00:38:58.375 --> 00:38:59.880
picking things up
off the network.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.050
So there's a latency also
associated with how long does

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.765
it take for a message to get
from point A to point B. What

00:39:07.765 --> 00:39:11.020
is the bandwidth that I
have across a link?

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.350
So if I have a lot of bandwidth
then that can really

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.670
lower my communication cost. But
if I have little bandwidth

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.450
then that can really
create contention.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.940
How much data am I sending?

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.780
And, you know, number
of messages.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.730
So this numerator here is really
an average of the data

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:29.590
that you're sending
per communication.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.100
There's a cost induced
per contention.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.880
And then finally there's
-- so all of

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.580
these are added factors.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.830
The higher they are, except for
bandwidth, because it's in

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.020
the denominator here,
the worse your

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.800
communication cost becomes.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.010
So you can try to reduce the
communication cost by

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:46.220
communicating less.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.100
So you adjust your
granularity.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.460
And that can impact your
synchronization or what kind

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.960
of data you're shipping
around.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.450
You can do some architectural
tweaks or maybe some software

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.800
tweaks to really get the network
latency down and the

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.190
overhead per message down.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.880
So on something like raw
architecture, which we saw in

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.230
Saman's lecture, there's a
really fast mechanism to

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.900
communicate your nearest
neighbor in three cycles.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.580
So one processor can send a
single operand to another

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.310
reasonably fast. You know, you
can improve the bandwidth

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.010
again in architectural
mechanism.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:21.720
You can do some tricks as to how
you package your data in

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.490
each message.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.380
And lastly, what I'm going to
talk about in a couple of

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.320
slides is, well, I can also
improve it using some

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.965
mechanisms that try
to increase the

00:40:31.965 --> 00:40:33.390
overlap between messages.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:35.160
And what does this
really mean?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.070
What am I overlapping it with?

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.100
And it's really the
communication and computation

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.590
stages are going to somehow
get aligned.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.300
So before I actually show you
that, I just want to point out

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.220
that there are two kinds
of messages.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.020
There's data messages, and these
are, for example, the

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.240
arrays that I'm sending around
to different processors for

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.760
the distance calculations
between points in space.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.650
But there are also
control messages.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.460
So control messages essentially
say, I'm done, or

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.900
I'm ready to go, or is there
any work for me to do?

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.700
So on Cell, control messages,
you know, you can think of

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.560
using Mailboxes for those and
the DMAs for doing the data

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.590
communication.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.170
So data messages are relatively
much larger --

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.150
you're sending a lot of data
-- versus control messages

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.190
that are really much shorter,
just essentially just sending

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.930
you very brief information.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.980
So in order to get that overlap,
what you can do is

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.610
essentially use this concept
of pipelining.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:35.250
So you've seen pipelining
in superscalar.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.620
Someone talked about that.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.130
And what you are essentially
trying to do is break up the

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.950
communication and computation
into different stages and then

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.860
figure out a way to overlap
them so that you can

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:47.970
essentially hide the
latency for the

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.090
sends and the receives.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.830
So let's say you have some work
that you're doing, and it

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.570
really requires you to
send the data --

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.200
somebody has to send you the
data or you essentially have

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.440
to wait until you get it.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.850
And then after you've waited and
the data is there, you can

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.470
actually go on and
do your work.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:07.670
So these are color coded.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.540
So this is essentially one
iteration of the work.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.220
And so you could overlap them
by breaking up the work into

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:21.050
send, wait, work stages, where
each iteration trying to send

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.340
or request the data for the next
iteration, I wait on the

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.420
data from a previous iteration
and then I do my work.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.910
So depending on how I partition,
I can really get

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.280
really good overlap.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:35.320
And so what you want to get to
is the concept of the steady

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.130
state, where in your main loop
body, all you're doing is

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.590
essentially pre-fetching or
requesting data that's going

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.030
to be used in future iterations
for future work.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.890
And then you're waiting on --

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.490
yeah.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:54.100
I think my color coding
is a little bogus.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.860
That's good.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.360
So here's an example of how
you might do this kind of

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.700
buffer pipelining in Cell.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.710
So I have some main loop that's
going to do some work,

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.670
that's encapsulating
this process data.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.780
And what I'm going to
use is two buffers.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.750
So the scheme is also called
double buffering.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.200
I'm going to use this ID to
represent which buffer I'm

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:15.700
going to use.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.910
So it's either buffer
zero or buffer one.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.230
And this instruction here
essentially flips the bit.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.700
So it's either zero or one.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:27.620
So I fetch data into buffer zero
and then I enter my loop.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.680
So this is essentially the first
send, which is trying to

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.330
get me one iteration ahead.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.760
So I enter this mail loop and
I do some calculation to

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.380
figure out where to write
the next data.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.735
And then I do another request
for the next data item that

00:43:43.735 --> 00:43:47.800
I'm going to -- sorry, there's
an m missing here --

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.900
I'm going to fetch data into
a different buffer, right.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.360
This is ID where I've already
flipped the bit once.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.160
So this get is going to write
data into buffer zero.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.730
And this get is going to write
data into buffer one.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:02.770
I flip the bit again.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:08.720
So now I'm going to issue a wait
instruction that says is

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.380
the data from buffer
zero ready?

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.260
And if it is then I can go on
and actually do my work.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.590
Does that make sense?

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:16.150
People are confused?

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:17.400
Should I go over it again?

00:44:19.772 --> 00:44:21.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.260
PROFESSOR: So this
is an [? x or. ?]

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:27.710
So I could have just said buffer
equals zero or buffer

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.960
equals one.

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.410
Oh, sorry.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:34.620
This is one.

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:34.690
Yeah.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.980
Yeah.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.950
So this is a one here.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:41.440
Last-minute editing.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.430
It's right there.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.672
Did that confuse you?

00:44:44.672 --> 00:44:45.195
AUDIENCE: No.

00:44:45.195 --> 00:44:47.810
But, like, I don't
see [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:48.140
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.410
OK.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.190
So I'll go over it again.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.600
So this get here is going
to write into ID zero.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.500
So that's buffer zero.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.930
And then I'm going
to change the ID.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.400
So imagine there's a one here.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:04.190
So now the next time I use ID,
which is here, I'm trying to

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.950
get the data.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.920
And I'm going to write
it to buffer one.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.270
The DMA on the Cell processor
essentially says I can send

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.450
this request off and I can check
later to see when that

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.710
data is available.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.940
But that data is going to go
into a different buffer,

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.420
essentially B1.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.450
Whereas I'm going to work
on buffer zero.

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:25.920
Because I changed the
ID back here.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.610
Now you get it?

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.790
So I fetch data into buffer
zero initially

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:31.540
before I start to loop.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.110
And then I start working.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.380
I probably should have had
an animation in here.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.430
So then you go into
your main loop.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.880
You try to start fetching into
buffet one and then you try to

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.280
compute out of buffer zero.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.130
But before you can start
computing out of buffer zero,

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.250
you just have to make sure
that your data is there.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:52.790
And so that's what the
synchronization is doing here.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.180
Hope that was clear.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:58.710
OK, so this kind of computation
and communication

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.680
overlap really helps in
hiding the latency.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.990
And it can be real useful
in terms of improving

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.240
performance.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.450
And there are different kinds
of communication patterns.

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:14.720
So there's point to point.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.080
And you can use these both for
data communication or control

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.060
communication.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.880
And it just means that, you
know, one processor can

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.580
explicitly send a message
to another processor.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.345
There's also broadcast that
says, hey, I have some data

00:46:26.345 --> 00:46:28.603
that everybody's interested in,
so I can just broadcast it

00:46:28.603 --> 00:46:31.000
to everybody on the network.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.930
Or a reduce, which
is the opposite.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:36.350
It says everybody on the network
has data that I need

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.840
to compute, so everybody
send me their data.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.790
There's an all to all, which
says all processors should

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.410
just do a global exchange of
data that they have. And then

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.100
there's a scatter
and a gather.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.810
So a scatter and a gather are
really different types of

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:54.770
broadcast. So it's one to
several or one to many.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:57.340
And gather, which
is many to one.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.370
So this is useful when you're
doing a computation that

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:04.670
really is trying to pull data
in together but only from a

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.260
subset of all processors.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:12.250
So it depends on how you've
partitioned your problems.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.430
So there's a well-known sort
of message passing library

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:24.950
specification called MPI that
tries to specify all of these

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:29.120
different communications in
order to sort of facilitate

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:30.310
parallel programming.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.590
Its full featured actually has
more types of communications

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.660
and more kinds of functionality
than I showed on

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.870
the previous slides.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.360
But it's not a language or
a compiler specification.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.470
It's really just a library
that you can implement in

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:45.750
various ways on different
architectures.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.720
Again, it's same program,
multiple data, or supports the

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.080
SPMD model.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.990
And it works reasonably well for
parallel architectures for

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:59.760
clusters, heterogeneous
multicores, homogeneous

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.830
multicores.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.240
Because really all it's doing
is just abstracting out --

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.130
it's giving you a mechanism
to abstract out all the

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.540
communication that you would
need in your computation.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.280
So you can have additional
things like precise buffer

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.370
management.

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:19.250
You can have some collective
operations.

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:22.985
I'll show an example of for
doing things things in a

00:48:22.985 --> 00:48:27.370
scalable manner when a lot of
things need to communicate

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:29.140
with each other.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.840
So just a brief history of
where MPI came from.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.270
And, you know, very early
when, you know, parallel

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:38.260
computers started becoming more
and more widespread and

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.720
there were these networks and
people had problems porting

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.840
their applications or writing
applications for these

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.860
[? came, ?] just because it was
difficult, as you might be

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.200
finding in terms of programming
things with the

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.540
Cell processor.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.800
You know, there needed to be
ways to sort of address the

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.860
spectrum of communication.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.330
And it often helps to have a
standard because if everybody

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.680
implements the same standard
specification, that allows

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.370
your code to be ported
around from one

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:04.710
architecture to the other.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.090
And so MPI came around.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.130
The forum was organized
in 1992.

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.980
And that had a lot of people
participating in it from

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:17.000
vendors, you know, people like
IBM, a company like IBM,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.030
Intel, and people who had
expertise in writing

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:27.550
libraries, users who were
interested in using these

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.910
kinds of specifications to
do their computations, so

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:36.010
scientific people who were
in the scientific domain.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.050
And it was finished in
about 18 months.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.582
I don't know if that's a
reasonably long time or a

00:49:40.582 --> 00:49:40.950
short time.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:44.340
But considering, you know, I
think the MPEG-4 standard took

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.170
a bit longer to do, as
a comparison point.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:49.880
I don't have the actual data.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.270
So point-to-point
communication --

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.590
and again, a reminder, this is
how you would do it on Cell.

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:00.300
These are SPE sends
and receives.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.490
You have one processor
that's sending

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:04.660
it to another processor.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.260
Or you have some network
in between.

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.430
And processor A can essentially
send the data

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.910
explicitly to processor two.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.880
And the message in this case
would include how the data is

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.240
packaged, some other information
such as the length

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.570
of the data, destination,
possibly some tag so you can

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:22.650
identify the actual
communication.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:26.560
And, you know, there's an actual
mapping for the actual

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.760
functions on Cell.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.950
And there's a get for the send
and a put for the receive.

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:41.760
So there's a question of, well,
how do I know if my data

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.880
actually got sent?

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.410
How do I know if it
was received?

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.190
And there's, you know, you can
think of a synchronous send

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.200
and a synchronous receive, or
asynchronous communication.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.940
So in the synchronous
communication, you actually

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.390
wait for notification.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.250
So this is kind of like
your fax machine.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.900
You put something
into your fax.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.190
It goes out and you eventually
get a beep that says your

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.260
transmission was OK.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.900
Or if it wasn't OK then, you
know, you get a message that

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.630
says, you know, something
went wrong.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.520
And you can redo your
communication.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.730
An asynchronous send is
kind of like your --

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.055
AUDIENCE: Most [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
you could get

00:51:13.055 --> 00:51:13.320
a reply too.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
can get a reply.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:16.420
Thanks.

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.360
An asynchronous send, it's like
you write a letter, you

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.680
go put it in the mailbox, and
you don't know whether it

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:26.425
actually made it into the actual
postman's bag and it

00:51:26.425 --> 00:51:29.660
was delivered to your
destination or if it was

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:30.940
actually delivered.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.200
So you only know that the
message was sent.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.250
You know, you put it
in the mailbox.

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:37.940
But you don't know anything else
about what happened to

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.100
the message along the way.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.530
There's also the concept
of a blocking versus a

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.940
non-blocking message.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.110
So this is orthogonal really
to synchronous versus

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.930
asynchronous.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:54.940
So in blocking messages, a
sender waits until there's

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.440
some signal that says the
message has been transmitted.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.180
So this is, for example if I'm
writing data into a buffer,

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.350
and the buffer essentially gets
transmitted to somebody

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:10.590
else, we wait until the
buffer is empty.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:13.070
And what that means is that
somebody has read it on the

00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:15.350
other end or somebody has
drained that buffer from

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:16.670
somewhere else.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.820
The receiver, if he's waiting on
data, well, he just waits.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.850
He essentially blocks until
somebody has put

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:24.110
data into the buffer.

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.470
And you can get into potential
deadlock situations.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.100
So you saw deadlock with locks
in the concurrency talk.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:30.920
I'm going to show
you a different

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.590
kind of deadlock example.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.630
An example of a blocking
send on Cell --

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.250
allows you to use mailboxes.

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:47.260
Or you can sort of use
mailboxes for that.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.050
Mailboxes again are just for
communicating short messages,

00:52:50.050 --> 00:52:53.910
really, not necessarily for
communicating data messages.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:58.340
So an SPE does some work, and
then it writes out a message,

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.750
in this case to notify the PPU
that, let's say, it's done.

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.660
And then it goes on and
does more work.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.230
And then it wants to notify
the PPU of something else.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:12.190
So in this case this particular
send will block

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.930
because, let's say, the PPU
hasn't drained its mailbox.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:16.220
It hasn't read the mailbox.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:20.960
So you essentially stop and wait
until the PPU has, you

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.810
know, caught up.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.860
AUDIENCE: So all mailbox
sends are blocking?

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:27.990
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.240
David says yes.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.730
A non-blocking send is something
that essentially

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:44.400
allows you to send a message
out and just continue on.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.650
You don't care exactly about
what's happened to the message

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.910
or what's going on with
the receiver.

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:54.530
So you write the data into
the buffer and you

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.040
just continue executing.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.740
And this really helps you in
terms of avoiding idle times

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.560
and deadlocks, but it might
not always be the

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.840
thing that you want.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:05.970
So an example of sort of a
non-blocking send and wait on

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:09.170
Cell is using the DMAs
to ship data out.

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.580
You know, you can put something,
put in a request to

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:13.910
send data out on the DMA.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:19.190
And you could wait for it if you
want in terms of reading

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:22.680
the status bits to make
sure it's completed.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.530
OK, so what is a source of
deadlock in the blocking case?

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.130
And it really comes about if you
don't really have enough

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.140
buffering in your communication
network.

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.300
And often you can resolve that
by having additional storage.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.700
So let's say I have processor
one and processor two and

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.000
they're trying to send messages
to each other.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.710
So processor one sends a message
at the same time

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:45.170
processor two sends a message.

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:46.990
And these are going
to go, let's say,

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.200
into the same buffer.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:53.815
Well, neither can make progress
because somebody has

00:54:53.815 --> 00:54:55.930
to essentially drain that buffer
before these receives

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.180
can execute.

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:02.990
So what happens with that code
is it really depends on how

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.830
much buffering you have
between the two.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:06.370
If you have a lot of buffering,
then you may never

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.000
see the deadlock.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.930
But if you have a really tiny
buffer, then you do a send.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:18.180
The other person can't do the
send because the buffer hasn't

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:18.970
been drained.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.220
And so you end up
with a deadlock.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.600
And so a potential solution
is, well, you actually

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:24.620
increase your buffer length.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.170
But that doesn't always
work because you can

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.480
still get into trouble.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.040
So what you might need to do
is essentially be more

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:33.990
diligent about how you order
your sends and receives.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.740
So if you have processor one
doing a send, make sure it's

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.400
matched up with a receive
on the other end.

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.050
And similarly, if you're doing
a receive here, make sure

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.100
there's sort of a matching
send on the other end.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.870
And that helps you in sort of
making sure that things are

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:51.160
operating reasonably in lock
step at, you know, partially

00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.410
ordered times.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:03.600
That was really examples of
point-to-point communication.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.990
A broadcast mechanism is
slightly different.

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:09.190
It says, I have data that I
want to send to everybody.

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:11.750
It could be really efficient
for sending short control

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:15.570
messages, maybe even efficient
for sending data messages.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.950
So as an example, if you
remember our calculation of

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.380
distances between all points,
the parallelization strategy

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.900
said, well, I'm going
to send one copy of

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.370
the array A to everybody.

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:29.820
In the two processor
case that was easy.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.730
But if I have n processors,
then rather than sending

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:35.570
point-to-point communication
from A to everybody else, what

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.300
I could do is just, say,
broadcast A to everybody and

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.420
they can grab it off
the network.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.210
So in MPI there's this
function, MPI

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.560
broadcast, that does that.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.700
I'm using sort of generic
abstract sends, receives and

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:53.350
broadcasts in my examples.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.600
So you can broadcast
A to everybody.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.550
And then if I have n processors,
then what I might

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:03.310
do is distribute the m's in a
round robin manner to each of

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:04.230
the different processes.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.710
So you pointed this out.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:07.180
I don't have to send
B to everybody.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.390
I can just send, you
know, in this case,

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.420
one particular element.

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.840
Is that clear?

00:57:16.838 --> 00:57:18.670
AUDIENCE: There's no
broadcast on Cell?

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:21.210
PROFESSOR: There is no
broadcast on Cell.

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:25.680
There is no mechanism for
reduction either.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:30.340
And you can't quite do
scatters and gathers.

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.430
I don't think.

00:57:32.430 --> 00:57:35.380
OK, so an example of a
reduction, you know, I said

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.650
it's the opposite of a
broadcast. Everybody has data

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:39.860
that needs to essentially
get to the same point.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:45.610
So as an example, if everybody
in this room had a value,

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.770
including myself, and I wanted
to know what is the collective

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:49.670
value of everybody in the
room, you all have to

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:50.840
send me your data.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.800
Now, this is important because
if -- you know, in this case

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.700
we're doing an addition.

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.290
It's an associative operation.

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.050
So what we can do is we
can be smart about

00:57:58.050 --> 00:57:59.350
how the data is sent.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:02.160
So, you know, guys that are
close together can essentially

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.420
add up their numbers
and forward me.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.120
So instead of getting
n messages I

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.520
can get log n messages.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.450
And so if every pair of you
added your numbers and

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:11.040
forwarded me that, that cuts
down communication by half.

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.640
And so you can, you know --
starting from the back of

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.420
room, by the time you get to
me, I only get two messages

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.800
instead of n messages.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.680
So a reduction combines data
from all processors.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.030
In MPI, you know, there's
this function MPI

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:26.300
reduce for doing that.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.180
And the collective operations
are things that are

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:29.920
associative.

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.730
And subtract --

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:33.660
sorry.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:39.500
And or and -- you can read
them on the slide.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.540
There is a semantic caveat here
that no processor can

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:45.760
finish the reduction before all
processors have at least

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.730
sent it one data or have
contributed, rather, a

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.790
particular value.

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:54.740
So in many numerical algorithms,
you can actually

00:58:54.740 --> 00:59:00.200
use the broadcast and send to
broadcast and reduce in place

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.430
of sends and receives because
it really improves the

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:06.970
simplicity of your
computation.

00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:09.260
You don't have to do n sends
to communicate there.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.350
You can just broadcast. It
gives you a mechanism for

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.970
essentially having a shared
memory abstraction on

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.150
distributed memory
architecture.

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.392
There are things like all to all
communication which would

00:59:18.392 --> 00:59:19.730
also help you in that sense.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.960
Although I don't talk about all
to all communication here.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.360
So I'm going to show you an
example of sort of a more

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.810
detailed MPI.

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.690
But I also want to contrast this
to the OpenMP programming

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.000
on shared memory processors
because one might look simpler

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.470
than the other.

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.540
So suppose that you have a
numerical integration method

00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.990
that essentially you're going
to use to calculate pi.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:48.200
So as you get finer and finer,
you can get more accurate --

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:50.030
as you shrink these intervals
you can get

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:53.900
better values for pi.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.690
And the code for doing
that is some C code.

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.270
You have some variables.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:02.800
And then you have a step that
essentially tells you how many

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.730
times you're going to
do this computation.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.440
And for each time step you
calculate this particular

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.540
function here.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.040
And you add it all up and in the
end you can sort of print

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.640
out what is the value of
pi that you calculated.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.600
So clearly as, you know, as you
shrink your intervals, you

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.340
can get more and more accurate
measures of pi.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.740
So that translates to increasing
the number of steps

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:29.160
in that particular C code.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.700
So you can use that numerical
integration to calculate pi

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.900
with OpenMP.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:37.356
And what that translates to is
-- sorry, there should have

01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:41.370
been an animation here to ask
you what I should add in.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.220
You have this particular loop.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:46.330
And this is computation that
you want to parallelize.

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:48.890
And there is really four
questions that you essentially

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.540
have to go through.

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.220
Are there variables
that are shared?

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.420
Because you have to get
the process right.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.200
If there are variables that
are shared, you have to

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.830
explicitly synchronize them and
use locks to protect them.

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:02.880
What values are private?

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.690
So in OpenMP, things that are
private are data on the stack,

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:12.000
things that are defined
lexically within the scope of

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.030
the computation that you
encapsulate by an OpenMP

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:18.900
pragma, and what variables
you might want

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.340
to use for a reduction.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.490
So in this case I'm doing a
summation, and this is the

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:25.400
computation that I
can parallelize.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.770
Then I essentially want to do
a reduction for the plus

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:32.980
operator since I'm doing an
addition on this variable.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.760
This loop here is parallel.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.040
It's data parallel.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.900
I can split it up.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.190
The for loop is also --

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:43.810
I can do this work
sharing on it.

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:45.960
So I use the parallel
for pragma.

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.360
And the variable x
here is private.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.010
It's defined here but I can
essentially give a directive

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.530
that says, this is private.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.290
You can essentially rename
it on each processor.

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:58.890
Its value won't have any
effect on the overall

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.270
computation because each
computation will have its own

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:03.910
local copy.

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:06.360
That clear so far?

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.950
So computing pi with integration
using MPI takes up

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.110
two slides.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.980
You know, I could fit it on one
slide but you couldn't see

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.170
it in the back.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.990
So there's some initialization.

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:20.130
In fact, I think there's only
six basic MPI commands that

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.120
you need for computing.

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:26.030
Three of them are here and
you'll see the others are MPI

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.680
send and MPI receive.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.550
And there's one more that you'll
see on the next slide.

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.170
So there's some loop
that says while I'm

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.790
not done keep computing.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:39.120
And what you do is you broadcast
n to all the

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.990
different processors.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.900
N is really your time step.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:47.660
How many small intervals of
execution are you going to do?

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.930
And you can go through,
do your computation.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.510
So now this -- the MPI
essentially encapsulates the

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.290
computation over n processors.

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.250
And then you get to an MPI
reduce command at some point

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:01.810
that says, OK, what values
did everybody compute?

01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:03.430
Do the reduction on that.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:06.410
Write that value into my MPI.

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:10.700
Now what happens here is there's
processor ID zero

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.140
which I'm going to consider
the master.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.030
So he's the one who's going to
actually print out the value.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.780
So the reduction essentially
synchronizes until everybody's

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:22.370
communicated a value
to processor zero.

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.990
And then it can print
out the pi.

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:27.660
And then you can finalize, which
actually makes sure the

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.890
computation can exit.

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:30.360
And you can go on
and terminate.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.750
So the last concept in terms of
understanding performance

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:43.010
for parallelism is this
notion of locality.

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:46.240
And there's locality in your
communication and locality in

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.930
your computation.

01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:50.700
So what do I mean by that?

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.690
So in terms of communication,
you know, if I have two

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:58.830
operations and let's say -- this
is a picture or schematic

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:02.130
of what the MIT raw
chip looks like.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.570
Each one of these is a core.

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:06.620
There's some network, some basic
computation elements.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.270
And if I have, you know, an
addition that feeds into a

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:12.910
shift, well, I can put the
addition here and the shift

01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:15.720
there, but that means I have a
really long path that I need

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.700
to go to in terms
of communicating

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.190
that data value around.

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:22.590
So the computation naturally
should just be closer together

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.950
because that decreases the
latency that I need to

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:27.940
communicate.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:30.300
So rather than doing net
mapping, what I might want to

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.900
do is just go to somebody who is
close to me and available.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.130
AUDIENCE: Also there
are volume issues.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.140
So assume more than that.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.309
A lot of other people also
want to communicate.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:43.296
So if [UNINTELLIGIBLE] randomly
distributed, you can

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:44.292
assume there's a lot
more communication

01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:47.880
going into the channel.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.710
Whereas if you put locality in
there then you can scale

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:56.210
communication much better than
scaling the network.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.400
PROFESSOR: There's also a notion
of locality in terms of

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.040
memory accesses.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.880
And these are potentially also
very important or more

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.010
important, rather, because
of the latencies

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.310
for accessing memory.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.860
So if I have, you know, this
loop that's doing some

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:19.270
addition or some computation on
an array and I distribute

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.900
it, say, over four
processors --

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.880
this is, again, let's assume
a data parallel loop.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.460
So what I can do is have a work
sharing mechanism that

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.970
says, this thread here
will operate on

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:31.570
the first four indices.

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:34.135
This thread here will operate
on the next four indices and

01:05:34.135 --> 01:05:36.120
the next four and
the next four.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.530
And then you essentially get to
join barrier and then you

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:40.950
can continue on.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:44.840
And if we consider how the
access patterns are going to

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.730
be generated for this particular
loop, well, in the

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:52.560
sequential case I'm essentially

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.200
generating them in sequence.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.620
So that allows me to exploit,
for example, on traditional

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.780
[? CAT ?] architecture, a notion
of spatial locality.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.620
If I look at how things are
organized in memory, in the

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.710
sequential case I can
perhaps fetch an

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:07.870
entire block at a time.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:11.340
So I can fetch all the
elements of A0

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.680
to A3 in one shot.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:16.820
I can fetch all the elements
of A4 to A7 in one shot.

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.520
And that allows me to
essentially improve

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.080
performance because I overlap
communication.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.890
I'm predicting that once I see
a reference, I'm going to use

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:29.140
data that's adjacent
to it in space.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.070
There's also a notion of
temporal locality that says

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.990
that if I use some particular
data element, I'm going to

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.430
reuse it later on.

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:37.970
I'm not showing that here.

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:41.190
But in the parallel case what
could happen is if each one of

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:43.920
these threads is requesting a
different data element -- and

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.470
let's say execution essentially
proceeds -- you

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.230
know, all the threads
are requesting their

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:53.970
data at the same time.

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.240
Then all these requests are
going to end up going to the

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.130
same memory bank.

01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:02.420
The first thread is requesting
ace of zero.

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.770
The next thread is requesting
ace of four, the next thread

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.750
ace of eight, next
thread ace of 12.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.010
And all of these happen to be
in the same memory bank.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.040
So what that means is, you
know, there's a lot of

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.940
contention for that
one memory bank.

01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:17.650
And in effect I've serialized
the computation.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:17.850
Right?

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:20.620
Everybody see that?

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.090
And, you know, this can be
a problem in that you can

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:26.920
essentially fully serialize the
computation in that, you

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.720
know, there's contention on the
first bank, contention on

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.620
the second bank, and then
contention on the third bank,

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.040
and then contention on
the fourth bank.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.000
And so I've done absolutely
nothing other than pay

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.720
overhead for parallelization.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.590
I've made extra work for
myself [? concreting ?]

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.250
the threads.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:46.810
Maybe I've done some extra
work in terms of

01:07:46.810 --> 01:07:48.840
synchronization.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.460
So I'm fully serial.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.810
So what you want to do is
actually reorganize the way

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.840
data is laid out in memory so
that you can effectively get

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.620
the benefit of parallelization.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:07.420
So if you have the data
organized as is there, you can

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:09.670
shuffle things around.

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:13.000
And then you end up with fully
parallel or a layout that's

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.320
more amenable to full
parallelism because now each

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.930
thread is going to
a different bank.

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:20.650
And that essentially gives you
a four-way parallelism.

01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:22.750
And so you get the performance
benefits.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:30.623
So there are different kinds of
sort of considerations you

01:08:30.623 --> 01:08:34.400
need to take into account for
shared memory architectures in

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.400
terms of how the design affects
the memory latency.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.190
So in a uniform memory access
architecture, every processor

01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:44.240
is either, you can think
of it as being

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.200
equidistant from memory.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.295
Or another way, it has the
same access latency for

01:08:48.295 --> 01:08:50.100
getting data from memory.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.480
Most shared memory architectures
are non-uniform,

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.710
also known as NUMA
architecture.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.460
So you have physically
partitioned memories.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.020
And the processors can have the
same address space, but

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.930
the placement of data affects
the performance because going

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:10.860
to one bank versus another
can be faster or slower.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:12.560
So what kind of architecture
is Cell?

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:19.100
Yeah.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:19.710
No guesses?

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:22.910
AUDIENCE: It's not
a shared memory.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:23.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:24.720
It's not a shared memory
architecture.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:30.500
So a summary of parallel
performance factors.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.390
So there's three things
I tried to cover.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.510
Coverage or the extent
of parallelism in the

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:37.420
application.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.480
So you saw Amdahl's Law and it
actually gave you a sort of a

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.990
model that said when is
parallelizing your application

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:45.000
going to be worthwhile?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.750
And it really boils down to
how much parallelism you

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.990
actually have in your particular
algorithm.

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:50.870
If your algorithm is sequential,
then there's

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:56.110
really nothing you can do for
programming for performance

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:57.820
using parallel architectures.

01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:02.500
I talked about granularity of
the data partitioning and the

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.360
granularity of the work
distribution.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.080
You know, if you had really
fine-grain things versus

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.200
really coarse-grain things,
how does that translate to

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.980
different communication costs?

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.770
And then last thing I
shared was locality.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:16.620
So if you have near neighbors
talking, that may be different

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:19.230
than two things that are
further apart in space

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.730
communicating.

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:23.690
And there are some issues in
terms of the memory latency

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:28.310
and how you actually can
take advantage of that.

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:33.400
So this really is an overview
of sort of the parallel

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.670
programming concepts and the
performance implications.

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.530
So the next lecture will be,
you know, how do I actually

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.560
parallelize my program?

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:42.480
And we'll talk about that.
