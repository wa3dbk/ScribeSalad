00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.640
KENNETH ABBOTT: As I said,
my name is Ken Abbott.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.220
I'm the operating officer
for Firm Risk Management

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.850
at Morgan Stanley, which means
I'm the everything else guy.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.480
I'm like the normal
stuff with a bar over it.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.640
The complement of normal--
I get all the odd stuff.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.065
I consider myself the
Harvey Keitel character.

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:43.954
You know, the fixer?

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:45.870
And so I get a lot of
interesting stuff to do.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.920
I've covered commodities,
I've covered fixed income,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.900
I've covered equities, I've
covered credit derivatives,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.120
I've covered mortgages.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.670
Now I'm also the
Chief Risk Officer

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.000
for the buy side
of Morgan Stanley.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.170
The investment management
business and the private equity

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.550
holdings that we have.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.160
And I look after
lot of that stuff

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.237
and I sit on probably
40 different committees

00:01:05.237 --> 00:01:07.320
because it's become very,
very, very bureaucratic.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.127
But that's the way it goes.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:13.710
What I want to talk about today
is some of the core approaches

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.250
we use to measure a risk
in a market risk setting.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.380
This is part of a larger course
I teach at a couple places.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
I'm a triple alum at
NYU-- no I'm a double alum

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.193
and now I'm on their
faculty [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:32.370
I have a masters in economics
from their arts and sciences

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.115
program.

00:01:33.115 --> 00:01:35.460
I have a masters in
statistics from Stern

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.160
when Stern used to
have a stat program.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.260
And now I teach at Courant.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.915
I also teach at Claremont
and I teach at Baruch,

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:43.790
part of that program.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.990
So I've been through
this material many times.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.380
So what I want to do is lay
the foundation for this notion

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.510
that we call value at
risk, this idea of VaR.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.526
[INAUDIBLE] put this back on.

00:02:01.526 --> 00:02:02.090
Got it.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.990
I'll make it work.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.300
I'll talk about it from
a mathematical standpoint

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.210
and from a statistical
standpoint,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.960
but also give you some of
the intuition behind what

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.190
it is that we're trying to do
when we measure this thing.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.377
First, a couple words
about risk management.

00:02:20.377 --> 00:02:21.210
What is the risk do?

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.106
25 years ago, maybe three firms
had risk management groups.

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:26.730
I was part of the
first risk management

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.864
group at Bankers Trust in 1986.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:33.780
No one else had a risk
management group as far

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.330
as I know.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.590
Market risk management really
came to be in the late '80s.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.090
Credit risk management
had obviously

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.700
been around in large financial
institutions the whole time.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.180
So our job is to make
sure that management

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.660
knows what's on the books.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.910
So step one is, what is the
risk profile of the firm?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.582
How do I make sure
that management

00:02:57.582 --> 00:02:58.540
is informed about this?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.160
So it requires two things.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.520
One, I have to know
what the risk profile is

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.000
because I have to
know it in order

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.460
to be able to communicate it.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.210
But the second thing, equally
important, particularly

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.880
important for you
guys and girls,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.310
is that you need to
be able to express

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.860
relatively complex
concepts in simple words

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.190
and pretty pictures.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.290
All right?

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.900
Chances are if you go
to work for big firm,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.260
your boss won't be a quant.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.880
My boss happens to have a
degree from Carnegie Mellon.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.770
He can count to 11
with his shoes on.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.790
His boss is a lawyer.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.500
His boss is the chairman.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.220
Commonly, the most senior people
are very, very intelligent,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.900
very, very articulate,
very, very learned.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.432
But not necessarily quants.

00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:49.890
Many of them have had a year
or two of calculus, maybe even

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.860
linear algebra.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.800
You can't show them-- look,
when you and I chat and we talk

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.980
about regression analysis, I
could say X transpose X inverse

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.310
X transpose y.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.476
And those of you that have
taken a regression course

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.830
think, ah, that's beta hat.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.080
And we can just stop it there.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.010
I can just put this form up
there and you may recognize it.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.760
I would have to spend 45
minutes explaining this

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.733
to people on the top
floor because this is not

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:16.649
what they're studying.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.320
So we can talk the
code amongst ourselves,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.372
but when we go outside our
little group-- getting bigger--

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:27.830
we have to make sure that we
can express ourselves clearly.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.950
That's done in clear,
effective prose, and in graphs.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.800
And I'll show you some of
that stuff as we go on.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.360
So step one, make
sure management

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.130
knows what the risk profile is.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.450
Step two, protect the firm
against unacceptably large

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.290
concentrations.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.090
This is the subjective part.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.690
I can know the risk,
but how big is big?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.045
How much is too much?

00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:50.430
How much is too concentrated?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.550
If I have $1 million of
sensitivity per basis point,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.405
that's a 1/100th of
1% move in a rate.

00:04:56.405 --> 00:04:57.350
Is that big?

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.920
Is that small?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.197
How do I know how much?

00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:02.280
How much of a particular
stock issue should I own?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.100
How much of a bond issue?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.610
How much futures open interest?

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.800
How big a limit should I
have on this type of risk?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.121
That's where intuition and
experience come into play.

00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:13.620
So that's the second
part of our job

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.040
is to protect against
unacceptably large losses.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.150
So the third, no
surprises, you can

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.980
liken the trading business--
it's taking calculated risks.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.560
Sometimes you're going to lose.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.190
Many times you're going to lose.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.630
In fact, if you win 51% of
the time, life is pretty good.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.740
So what you want to do
is make sure you have

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.090
the right information so you
can estimate, if things get bad,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.240
how bad will they get?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.750
And to use that,
we leverage a lot

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.710
of relatively simple notions
that we see in statistics.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.804
And so I should use a coloring
mask here, not a spotlight.

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:55.720
We do a couple things.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.750
Just like the way when they talk
about the press in your course

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.400
about journalism,
we can shine a light

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.430
anywhere we want, and
we do all the time.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.040
You know what?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.660
I'm going to think about
this particular kind of risk.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.400
I'm going to point out that
this is really important.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.733
You need to pay attention to it.

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:09.924
And then I could shade it.

00:06:09.924 --> 00:06:12.340
I can make it blue, I can make
a red, I can make it green.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.660
I'd say this is good, this
is bad, this is too big,

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.080
this is too small,
this is perfectly fine.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.610
So that's just a little bit of
quick background on what we do.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.035
So I'm going to go through
as much of this as I can.

00:06:25.035 --> 00:06:26.760
I'm going to fly
through the first part

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.670
and I want to hit these because
these are the ways that we

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.990
actually estimate risk.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.590
Variance, covariance
as a quadratic form.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.610
Monte Carlo simulation,
the way I'll show you

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.310
is based on a quadratic form.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.490
And historical simulation
is Monte Carlo simulation

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.130
without the Monte Carlo part.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.890
It's using historical data.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.080
And I'll go through
that fairly quickly.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.320
Questions, comments?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.960
No?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.780
Excellent.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.710
Stop me-- look,
if any one of you

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.750
doesn't understand something
I say, probably many of you

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.084
don't understand it.

00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:02.250
I don't know you guys, so
I don't know what you know

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.930
and what you don't know.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.096
So if there's a term that
comes up, you're not sure,

00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:08.930
just say, Ken, I
don't have a PhD.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.420
I work for a living.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.130
I make fun of academics.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.010
I know you work
for a living too.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.780
All right.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.809
There's a guy I tease
at Claremont [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.100
in his class, I say, who is
this pointy-headed academic

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.760
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.937
Only kidding.

00:07:24.937 --> 00:07:27.520
All right, so I'm going to talk
about one-asset value at risk.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.200
First I'm going to introduce
the notion of value at risk.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.780
I'm going to talk
about one asset.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.780
I'm going to talk about
price-based instruments.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.052
We're going to go
into yield space,

00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:36.510
so we'll talk about
the conversions

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.300
we have to do there.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.481
One thing I'll do after
this class is over,

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.980
since I know I'm going to fly
through some of the material--

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.563
and since this is
MIT, I'm sure you're

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:46.276
used to just flying
through material.

00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:48.150
And there's a lot of
this, the proof of which

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.066
is left to the reader
as an exercise.

00:07:50.066 --> 00:07:51.690
I'm sure you get a
fair amount of that.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.120
I will give you papers.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.070
If you have questions, my
email is on the first page.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.610
I welcome your questions.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.540
I tell my students
that every year.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.500
I'm OK with you sending
me an email asking me

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.450
for a reference, a
citation, something.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.760
I'm perfectly fine with that.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.040
Don't worry, oh, he's too busy.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.245
I'm fine.

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:12.950
If you've got a question,
something is not clear,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.750
I've got access to
thousands of papers.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.790
And I've screened them.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.860
I've read thousands
of papers, I say

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.780
this is a good one,
that's a waste of time.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.475
But I can give you
background material

00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:26.110
on regulation, on bond pricing,
on derivative algorithms.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.680
Let me know.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.000
I'm happy to provide that
at any point in time.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.536
You get that free
with your tuition.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.120
A couple of key metrics.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.953
I don't want to spend
too much time on this.

00:08:36.953 --> 00:08:38.620
Interest rate
exposure, how sensitive

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.850
am I to changes in interest
rates, equity exposure,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.200
commodity exposure,
credit spread exposure.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.080
We'll talk about linearity,
we won't talk too much

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.512
about regularity of cash flow.

00:08:48.512 --> 00:08:49.970
We won't really
get into that here.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.129
And we need to know correlation
across different asset classes.

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:54.545
And I'll show you
what that means.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.790
At the heart of this
notion of value at risk

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.350
is this idea of a
statistical order statistic.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.317
Who here has heard
of order statistics?

00:09:08.317 --> 00:09:10.150
All right, I'm going
to give you 30 seconds.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:15.165
The best simple description
of an order statistic.

00:09:15.165 --> 00:09:16.710
PROFESSOR: The
maximum or the minimum

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.600
of a set of observations.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.230
KENNETH ABBOTT: All right?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.540
When we talk about
value at risk,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.420
I want to know the worst
1% of the outcomes.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.030
And what's cool about
order statistics

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.610
is they're well established
in the literature.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.840
Pretty well understood.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.430
And so people are
familiar with it.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.180
Once we put our toe
into the academic water

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.160
and we start talking
about this notion,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.071
there's a vast
body of literature

00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:47.570
that says this is
how this thing is.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.460
This is how it pays.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.680
This is what the
distribution looks like.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.200
And so we can
estimate these things.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.830
And so what we're looking
at in value at risk,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:03.867
if my distribution of
returns, how much I make.

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:05.450
In particular, if I
look historically,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.860
I have a position.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.630
How much would this position
have earned me over the last n

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.140
days, n weeks, n months.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.430
If I look at a frequency
distribution of that,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.690
I'm likely-- don't have to-- I'm
likely to get something that's

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.417
symmetric.

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:22.250
I'm likely to get
something that's unimodal.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.610
It may or may not
have fat tails.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.290
We'll talk about
that a little later.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.040
If my return distribution
were beautifully symmetric

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.490
and beautifully normal and
independent, then the risk--

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.790
I could measure this
1% order statistic.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:46.570
What's the 1% likely worst
case outcome tomorrow?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.960
I might do that by integrating
the normal function

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.150
from negative infinity--
for all intents and purposes

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.640
five or six standard deviations.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.970
Anyway, from negative
infinity to negative 2.33

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.080
standard deviations.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.710
Why?

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.250
Because the area under
the curve, that's 0.01.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.440
Now this is a one-sided
confidence interval

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.540
as opposed to a two-sided
confidence integral.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.060
And this is one of these
things that as an undergrad

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.370
you learn two-sided, and
then the first time someone

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.670
shows you one sided you're
like, wait a minute.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.212
What is this?

00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:17.336
Than you say, oh, I get it.

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:18.690
You're just looking at the area.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.210
I could build a gazillion
two-sided confidence intervals.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.620
One sided, it's got
to stop at one place.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.870
All right so this set
of outcomes-- and this

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.480
is standardized-- this is in
standard deviation space--

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.150
negative infinity to 2.33.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.900
If I want 95%, or 5% likely
loss, so I could say,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.910
tomorrow there's a
5% chance my loss is

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.230
going to be x or
greater, I would go

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.950
to 1.645 standard deviations.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.120
Because the integral from
negative infinity to 1.645

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.970
standard deviations
is about 0.05.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.650
It's not just a good
idea, it's the law.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.560
Does that make sense?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.602
And again, I'm going to
say assuming the normal.

00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:02.060
That's like the
old economist joke,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.630
assume a can opener when
he's on a desert island.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.900
You guys don't know that one.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.410
I got lots of economics jokes.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.970
I'll tell them later on
maybe-- or after class.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.950
If I'm assuming normal
distribution, and that's

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.084
what I'm going to
do, what I want to do

00:12:16.084 --> 00:12:19.600
is I'm going to set this thing
up in a normal distribution

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.140
framework.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.200
Now doing this approach and
assuming normal distributions,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.720
I liken it to using Latin.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.240
Nobody really uses it
anymore but everything we do

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.872
is based upon it.

00:12:33.872 --> 00:12:35.080
So that's our starting point.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.710
And it's really easy
to teach it this way

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.560
and then we relax
the assumptions

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.210
like so many things in life.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.880
I teach you the
strict case then we

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.630
relax the assumptions to get
to the way it's done now.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.360
So this makes sense?

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.870
All right.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.290
So let's get there.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.670
This is way oversimplified--
but let's say

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.117
I have something like this.

00:12:55.117 --> 00:12:56.700
Who has taken
intermediate statistics?

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.290
We have the notion
of stationarity

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.720
that we talk about all the time.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.022
The mean and variance
constant is one simplistic way

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:10.980
of thinking about this.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.147
Do you have a better way
for me to put that to them?

00:13:13.147 --> 00:13:15.146
Because you know what
their background would be.

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:15.870
PROFESSOR: No.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.953
KENNETH ABBOTT: All right.

00:13:16.953 --> 00:13:20.400
Just, mean and
variance are constant.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.930
When I look at the
time series itself,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.110
the time series mean and
the time series variance

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.520
are not constant.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.920
And there also could be other
time series stuff going on.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.900
There could be seasonality,
there could be autocorrelation.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.430
This looks something
like a random walk

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.560
but it's not stationary.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.371
It's hard for me to draw
inference by looking at that

00:13:43.371 --> 00:13:43.870
alone.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.328
So we want to try
to predict what's

00:13:45.328 --> 00:13:47.460
going to happen in the
future, it's kind of hard.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.180
And the game, here, that we're
playing, is we want to know

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.510
how much money do I need to
hold to support that position?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.146
Now, who here has taken
an accounting course?

00:13:58.146 --> 00:14:00.780
All right, word to
the wise-- there's

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.020
two things I tell students
in quant finance programs.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.686
First of all, I know you have to
take a time series course-- I'm

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:07.447
sure-- this is MIT.

00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.030
If you don't get a
time series course,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.910
get your money back because
you've got to take time series.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.540
Accounting is important.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.500
Accounting is important
because so much

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.350
of what we do, the way
we think about things

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.760
is predicated on the dollars.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.320
And you need to know how
the dollars are recorded.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.850
Quick aside.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.530
Balance sheet.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.405
I'll give you a 30 second
accounting lecture.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.230
Assets, what we own.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.410
Everything we own-- we
have stuff, it's assets.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.560
We came to that stuff
one of two ways.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.750
We either pay for it out of our
pocket, or we borrowed money.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.150
There's no third way.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.624
So everything we
own, we either paid

00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:52.290
for out of our pocket
or borrowed money.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.950
The amount we paid for out
of our pocket is the equity.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.000
The ratio of this to
this is called leverage

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.510
among other things.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.040
All right?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.400
If I'm this company.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.230
I have this much
stuff and I bought it

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.630
with this much debt,
and this much equity.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.760
Again, that's a gross
oversimplification.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.710
When this gets down to
zero, it's game over.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.870
Belly up.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.160
All right?

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.520
Does that make sense?

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.590
Now you've taken a
semester of accounting.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.050
No, only kidding.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.970
But it's actually important to
have a grip on how that works.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.270
Because what we
need to make sure of

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.560
is that if we're going to take
this position and hold it,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.690
we need to make sure that
with some level of certainty--

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.310
every time we lose
money this gets reduced.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.040
When this goes down to
zero, I go bankrupt.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.650
So that's what
we're trying to do.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.340
We need to protect
this, and we do it

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.220
by knowing how much of
this could move against us.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.247
Everybody with me?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.080
Anybody not with me?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.624
It's OK to have
questions, it really is.

00:16:00.624 --> 00:16:03.540
Excellent.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.680
All right, so if I do a
frequency distribution

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.980
of this time series, I just
say, show me the frequency

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.270
with which this thing shows.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.891
I get this thing,
it's kind of trimodal.

00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:17.890
It's all over the place.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.480
It doesn't tell me anything.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.200
If I look at the levels--
the frequency distribution,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.290
the relative frequency
distribution of the levels

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.800
themselves, I don't get
a whole lot of intuition.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.080
If I go into return
space, which is either

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.440
looking at the log
differences from day to day,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.340
or the percentage
changes from day to day,

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.030
or perhaps the absolute
changes from day to day--

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.810
it varies from market to market.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.910
Oh, look, now we're
in familiar territory.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.260
So what I'm doing
here-- and this

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.350
is why I started out with
a normal distribution

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.640
because this thing is unimodal.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.310
It's more or less symmetric.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.960
Right?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.940
Now is it a perfect measure?

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.146
No, because it's
probably got fat tails.

00:16:55.146 --> 00:16:56.520
So it's a little
bit like looking

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.500
for the glasses you lost up on
67th Street down on 59th street

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.140
because there's
more light there.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.410
But it's a starting point.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:09.369
So what I'm saying to you is
once I difference it-- no,

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:10.660
I won't talk about [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.099
Once I difference
the timeshares,

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.682
once I take the timeshares and
look at the percentage changes,

00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:17.140
and I look at the frequency
distribution of those changes,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.109
I get this which is
far more amenable.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.140
And I can draw
inference from that.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.950
I can say, ah, now if
this thing is normal,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.630
then I know that x%
of my observations

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.410
will take place over here.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.280
Now I can start
drawing inferences.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.310
And a thing to
keep in mind here,

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:39.180
one thing we do
constantly in statistics

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:43.900
is we do parameter estimates.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.410
And remember, every time
you estimate something

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.480
you estimate it with error.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.610
I think that maybe the
single most important thing

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.951
I learned when I got
my statistics degree.

00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:54.950
Everything you estimate
you estimate with error.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.060
People do means,
they say, oh, it's x.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.712
No, that's the average and
that's an unbiased estimator,

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:01.670
but guess what, there's
a huge amount of noise.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.045
And there's a
certain probability

00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:04.400
that you're wrong by x%.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.110
So every time we come up with a
number, when somebody tells me

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.300
the risk is 10, that means
it's probably not 10,000,

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.532
it's probably not zero.

00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:14.490
Just keep that in mind.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.200
Just sort of throw that in
on the side for nothing.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.250
All right, so when I take
the returns of this same time

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.980
series, I get something
that's unimodal, symmetric,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.560
may or may not have fat tails.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.750
That has important
implications for whether or not

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.550
my normal distribution
underestimates

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.300
the amount of risk I'm taking.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.990
Everybody with me on
that more or less?

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.744
Questions?

00:18:33.744 --> 00:18:34.660
Now would be the time.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.160
Good enough?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.660
He's lived this.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.170
All right.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.610
So once I have my time series
of returns, which I just

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.170
plotted there, I can
gauge their dispersion

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.382
with this measure
called variance.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:53.715
And you guys probably know this.

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:07.360
Variance, the expected
value of x_i minus x bar-- I

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.960
love these thick
chalks-- squared.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:19.640
And it's the sum of x_i minus
x bar squared over n minus 1.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.680
It's a measure of dispersion.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.940
Variance has its--
Now, I should say

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:31.840
that this is sigma squared hat.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.340
Right?

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.660
Estimate-- parameter estimate.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.190
Parameter.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.600
Parameter estimate.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.990
This is measured with error.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.616
Anybody here know what the
distribution of this is?

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:46.750
Anyone?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.270
$5.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.530
Close.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:51.810
n chi-squared.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.550
Worth $2.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.010
Talk to me after class.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.487
It's a chi-squared distribution.

00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:58.320
What does that mean?

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.177
That means that we know it
can't be 0 or less than 0.

00:20:04.177 --> 00:20:06.510
If you figure out a way to
get variances less than zero,

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.750
let's talk.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.810
And it's got a long
right tail, but that's

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.020
because this is squared.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.660
[INAUDIBLE] one
point can move it up.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.100
Anyway, once I
have my returns, I

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.960
have a measure of the dispersion
of these returns called

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.290
variance.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.270
I take the square
root of the variance,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.390
which is the standard
deviation, or the volatility.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.890
When I'm doing it
with a data set,

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.220
I usually refer to it as
the standard deviation.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.120
When I'm referring to
the standard deviation

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.500
of the distribution, I usually
call it the standard error.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.072
Is that a law or is that
just common parlance?

00:20:42.072 --> 00:20:43.052
PROFESSOR: Both.

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:45.218
The standard error is
typically for something that's

00:20:45.218 --> 00:20:47.264
random, like an estimate.

00:20:47.264 --> 00:20:50.087
Whereas the standard deviation
is more like for sample--

00:20:50.087 --> 00:20:51.170
KENNETH ABBOTT: Empirical.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.909
See, it's important because
when you first learn this,

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:55.950
they don't tell you that.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.420
And they flip them
back and forth.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.420
And then when you take
the intermediate courses,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.360
they say, no, don't
use standard deviation

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.460
when you mean standard error.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.350
And you'll get points off on
your exam for that, right?

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.710
All right, so, the
standard deviation

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.790
is the square root
of the variance,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.790
also called the volatility.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.470
In a normal distribution,
1% of the observations

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.775
is outside of 2.33
standard deviations.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:27.380
For 95%, it's out past 1.64,
1.645 standard deviations.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.880
Now you're saying,
wait a minute,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.000
where did my 1.96 go that
I learned as an undergrad.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.740
Two-sided.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.740
So if I go from the mean
to 1.96 standard deviations

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.570
on either side,
that encompasses 95%

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.000
of the total area of the
integral from negative infinity

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.880
to positive infinity.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.963
Everybody with me on that?

00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:46.560
Does that make sense?

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.020
The two-sided versus one-sided.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.270
That's confused me.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.310
When I was your age,
it confused me a lot.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.950
But I got there.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.960
All right so this
is how we do it.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.092
Excel functions are VAR and--
you don't need to know that.

00:22:00.092 --> 00:22:02.300
All right, so in this case,
I estimating the variance

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.340
of this particular time series.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.920
I took the standard deviation
by taking the square root

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.040
of the variance.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.610
It's in percentages.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.990
When you do this, I tell
you, it's like physics,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:16.737
your units will screw
you up every time.

00:22:16.737 --> 00:22:17.570
What am I measuring?

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:18.740
What are my units?

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.130
I still make units mistakes.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:20.890
I want you to know that.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:21.880
And I'm in this
business 30 years.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.400
I still make units mistakes.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.950
Just like physics.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.740
I'm in percentage
change space, so I

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.573
want to talk in terms
of percentage changes.

00:22:28.573 --> 00:22:31.820
The standard deviation is
1.8% of that time series

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.090
I showed you.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.410
So 2.33 standard deviations
times the standard deviation

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.720
is about 4.2%.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:46.280
What that says, given this data
set-- one time series-- I'm

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.430
saying, I expect to
lose, on any given day,

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:54.540
if I have that position,
99% of the time I'm going

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.240
to lose 4.2% of it or less.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.472
Very important.

00:23:01.472 --> 00:23:02.180
Think about that.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.750
Is that clear?

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.960
That's how I get there.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.880
I'm making a statement about
the probability of loss.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.490
I'm saying there's
a 1% probability,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:19.910
for that particular time
series-- which is-- all right?

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.530
If this is my
historical data set

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.640
and it's my only historical
data set, and I own this,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.812
tomorrow I may be 4.2%
lighter than I was today

00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:30.520
because the market
could move against me.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.930
And I'm 99% sure, if the
future's like the past,

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:40.240
that my loss tomorrow is
going to be 4.2% or less.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.670
That's VaR.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.860
Simplest case, assuming
normal distribution,

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:50.500
single asset, not fixed income.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.290
Yes, no?

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.180
Questions, comments?

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:58.779
AUDIENCE: Yes, [INAUDIBLE]
positive and [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:58.779 --> 00:23:59.820
KENNETH ABBOTT: Yes, yes.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.960
Assuming my distribution
is symmetric.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.210
Now that's the right
assumption to point out.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.110
Because in the real world,
it may not be symmetric.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.580
And when we go into
historical simulation,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.081
we use empirical
distributions where

00:24:15.081 --> 00:24:17.163
we don't care if it's
symmetric because we're only

00:24:17.163 --> 00:24:18.310
looking at the downside.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:21.390
And whether I'm long
or short, I might

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:24.337
care about the downside
or the putative upside.

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:26.170
Because I'm short, and
I care about how much

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:27.220
is going to move up.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:27.750
Make sense?

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.720
That's the right
question to ask.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.350
Yes?

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you're
doing it for upside as well?

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:35.005
KENNETH ABBOTT: Yes.

00:24:35.005 --> 00:24:36.000
AUDIENCE: Could it
just be the same thing?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.833
KENNETH ABBOTT: Yes.

00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.970
In fact, in this case,
in what we're doing here

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.380
of variance/covariance
or closed form VaR,

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.954
it's for long or short.

00:24:43.954 --> 00:24:45.870
But getting your signs
right, I'm telling you,

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.380
it's like physics.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.940
I still make that mistake.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.688
Yes?

00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:53.178
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] symmetric.

00:24:53.178 --> 00:24:55.600
Do you guys still use
this process to say, OK--

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.300
KENNETH ABBOTT: I use it
all the time as a heuristic.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:00.290
All right?

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:05.530
Because let's say I've got-- and
that's a very good question--

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.260
let's say I've got five
years worth of data

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.330
and I don't have time to
do an empirical estimate.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.090
It could be lopsided.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.910
If you tell me a two
standard deviation move

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.880
is x, that means
something to me.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.230
Now, there's a
problem with that.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.432
And the problem is that
people extrapolate that.

00:25:28.432 --> 00:25:30.890
Sometimes people talk to me
and, oh, it's an eight standard

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.610
deviation move.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.769
Eight standard deviation
moves don't happen.

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:36.935
I don't think we've seen
an eight standard deviation

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:40.120
move in the Cenozoic era.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.020
It just doesn't happen.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.500
Three standard deviation--
you will see a three standard

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.160
deviation move once every
10,000 observations.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.874
Now, I learned this
the hard way by just,

00:25:53.874 --> 00:25:55.540
see how many times
do I have to do this?

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.789
And then I looked it up in
the table, oh, I was right.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.950
When we oversimplify, and
start to talk about everything

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.491
in terms of that
normal distribution,

00:26:04.491 --> 00:26:07.100
we really just lose
our grip on reality.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.020
But I use it as a
heuristic all the time.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.457
I'll do it even now,
and I know better.

00:26:12.457 --> 00:26:14.290
But I'll go, what's two
standard deviations?

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.664
What's three
standard deviations?

00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:22.270
Because by and large-- and I
still do this, I get my data

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.560
and I line it up and I do
frequency distributions.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.510
Hold on, I do this all
the time with my data.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.660
Is it symmetric?

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.050
Is it fat tailed?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.000
Is it unimodal?

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.435
So that's a very good question.

00:26:35.435 --> 00:26:36.270
Any other questions?

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
have we talked

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.830
about the [? standard t ?]
distribution?

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.511
PROFESSOR: We Introduced
it in the last lecture.

00:26:43.511 --> 00:26:48.540
And the problems set this
week does relate to that.

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.180
KENNETH ABBOTT: All
right, perfect lead-in.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.090
So the statement I made,
it's 1% of the time

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.340
I'd expect to lose more than
4.2 pesos on 100 peso position.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.870
That's my inferential statement.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.020
In fact, over the
same time period

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.760
I lost 4.2% 1.5% of the time
instead of 1% of the time.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.220
What that tells me, what that
suggests to me, is my data set

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.860
has fat tails.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.820
What that means is the
likelihood of a loss--

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.340
a simple way of thinking
about it [INAUDIBLE] care

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.590
whether what that means
in a metaphysical sense,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.410
a way to interpret it.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.290
The likelihood of
a loss is greater

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.491
than would be implied by
the normal distribution.

00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:38.990
All right?

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.330
So when you hear
people say fat tails,

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.870
generally, that's what
they're talking about.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.370
There are different ways you
could interpret that statement,

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.860
but when somebody is talking
about a financial time series,

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.252
it has fat tails.

00:27:51.252 --> 00:27:52.960
Roughly 3/4 of your
financial time series

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.829
will have fat tails.

00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:55.620
They will also have
time series properties,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.110
they won't be true random walks.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.080
True random walks
says that I don't

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.840
know whether it's going to go
up or down based on the data

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.150
I have.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.659
The time series has no memory.

00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:07.950
When we start introducing
time series properties, which

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.950
many financial time series
have, then there's seasonality,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.130
there's mean reversion,
there's all kinds

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.130
of other stuff, other
ways that we have to think

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.250
about modeling the data.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.764
Make sense?

00:28:20.764 --> 00:28:25.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] higher
standard deviation than

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:26.430
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.410
KENNETH ABBOTT:
Say it once again.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.605
AUDIENCE: Better
yield, does it mean

00:28:30.605 --> 00:28:33.030
that we have a higher standard
deviation than [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:33.570
KENNETH ABBOTT: No.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.611
The standard deviation is
the standard deviation.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:42.100
No matter what I do, this is
standard deviation, that's it.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.790
Don't have a higher
standard deviation.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.730
But the likelihood
of-- the put it

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:52.740
this way-- the likelihood
of a move of 2.33

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.860
standard deviations
is more than 1%.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.670
That's the way I think of it.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.585
Make sense?

00:29:02.585 --> 00:29:05.091
AUDIENCE: Is there any way
for you to [INAUDIBLE] to--

00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:05.966
KENNETH ABBOTT: What?

00:29:05.966 --> 00:29:07.340
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
is there any way

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.690
to put into that graph what
a fatter tail looks like?

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.890
KENNETH ABBOTT: Oh,
well, be patient.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.365
If we have time.

00:29:13.365 --> 00:29:14.740
In fact, we do
that all the time.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.700
And one of our
techniques doesn't care.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.290
It goes to the
empirical distribution.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:20.620
So it captures the
fat tails completely.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.210
In fact, the homework
assignment which I usually

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.010
precede this lecture
by has people

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.740
graphing all kinds
of distributions

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.384
to see what these
things look like.

00:29:31.384 --> 00:29:32.550
We won't have time for that.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.130
But if you have questions,
send them to me.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.520
I'll send you some stuff
to read about this.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:39.228
All right, so now you
know one asset VaR,

00:29:39.228 --> 00:29:41.240
now you're qualified to
go work for a big bank.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.470
All right?

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.530
Get your data,
calculate returns.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:50.100
Now I usually put in step 2b,
graph your data and look at it.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.630
All right?

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.350
Because everybody's
data has dirt in it.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.410
Don't trust anyone else.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:56.850
If you're going
to get fired, get

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.266
fired for being
incompetent, don't

00:29:58.266 --> 00:30:01.310
get fired for using
someone else's bad data.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.260
Don't trust anyone.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:05.100
My mother gives me data,
Mom, I'm graphing it.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.290
Because I think you let
some poop slip into my data.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:15.430
Mother Teresa could come to me
with a thumb drive: "Ken, S&amp;P

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.316
500."

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:18.190
Sorry, Mother Teresa.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.500
I'm graphing it before I use it.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.070
All right?

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.236
So I don't want to say that
this is usually in here.

00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:24.855
We do extensive error testing.

00:30:24.855 --> 00:30:27.670
Because there could be bad data,
there could be missing data.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.210
And missing data is a whole
other lecture that I give.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.723
You might be shocked
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:40.590
So for one asset VaR, get my
data, create my return series.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.010
Percentage changes, log changes.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.720
Sometimes that's
absolute differences.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.053
Take the variance, take the
square root of the variance,

00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.100
multiply by 2.33.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.800
Done and dusted.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.990
Go home, take your
shoes off, relax.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.640
OK.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.290
Percentage changes
versus log changes.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.530
For all intents and purposes,
it doesn't really matter

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.161
and I will often use
one or the other.

00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:19.030
The way I think about
this-- all right,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.110
there'll be a little
bit of bias at the ends.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.240
But for the overwhelming
bulk of the observations

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.800
whether you use percentage
changes or log changes

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.200
doesn't matter.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.250
Generally, even though I
know the data is closer

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.850
to log-normally distributed
than normally distributed,

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.082
I'll use percentage changes
just because it's easier.

00:31:36.082 --> 00:31:37.790
Why would we use
log-normal distribution?

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:42.587
Well, when we're
doing simulation,

00:31:42.587 --> 00:31:44.920
the log-normal distribution
has this very nifty property

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.430
of keeping your yields
from going negative.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.440
But, even that-- I
can call that into

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.510
question because
there are instances

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:54.436
of yields going negative.

00:31:54.436 --> 00:31:55.670
It's happened.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.180
Doesn't happen a
lot, but it happens.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.824
All right.

00:31:58.824 --> 00:32:00.240
So I talked about
bad data, talked

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.420
about one-sided
versus two-sided.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.727
I'll talk about longs and shorts
a little bit later when we

00:32:05.727 --> 00:32:06.810
we're talking multi-asset.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.280
I'm going to cover a
fixed income piece.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.410
We use this thing called a PV01
because what I measure in fixed

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.730
income markets isn't a price.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.290
I usually measure a yield.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.592
I have to get from a change
of yield to a change of price.

00:32:23.592 --> 00:32:25.050
Hmm, sounds like
a Jacobian, right?

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.990
With kind of a poor
man's Jacobian.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.560
It's a measure that
captures the fact

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:36.340
that my price-yield
relationship--

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:40.180
price, yield-- is non-linear.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:44.700
For any small approximation
I look at the tangent.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.020
And I use my PV01 which has
a similar notion to duration,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.390
but PV01 is a little
more practical.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.019
The slope of that
tells me how much

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:55.060
my price will change for
a given change of yield.

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:55.690
See, there it is.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.280
You knew you were going to
use the calculus, right?

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.730
You're always
using the calculus.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.280
You can't escape it.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.380
But the price-yield
line is non-linear.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.710
But for all intents and
purposes, what I'm doing is

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.940
I'm shifting the
price-yield relationship--

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.120
I'm shifting my yield
change into price change

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.560
by multiplying my yield
change by my PV01 which

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:21.131
is my price sensitivity to
1/100th percent move in yields.

00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:22.380
Think about that for a second.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.880
We don't have time
to-- I would love

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.270
to spend an hour on this,
and about trading strategies,

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.524
and about bull steepeners
and bear steepeners

00:33:28.524 --> 00:33:30.690
and barbell trades, but we
don't have time for that.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:35.090
Suffice to say if I'm
measuring yields the thing

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:41.960
is going to trade as a 789
or a 622 or a 401 yield.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.880
How do I get that in
the change in price?

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.046
Because I can't tell my
boss, hey, I had a good day.

00:33:46.046 --> 00:33:48.360
I bought it at 402
and sold it at 401.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.170
No, how much money did you make?

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.920
Yield to coffee break
yield to lunch time,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.880
yield to go home
at the end of day.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.710
How do I get from change in
yield to change in price?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.330
Usually PV01.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.446
I could use duration.

00:34:00.446 --> 00:34:02.820
Bond traders who think in
terms of yield to coffee break,

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.515
yield to lunch time, yield to
go home at the end of the day

00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:05.525
typically think
in terms of PV01.

00:34:05.525 --> 00:34:07.130
Do you agree with
that statement?

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.503
KENNETH ABBOTT: How often
on the fixed income desk

00:34:10.503 --> 00:34:11.957
did you use duration measures?

00:34:11.957 --> 00:34:15.880
AUDIENCE: Well,
actually, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.070
KENNETH ABBOTT: Because
of the investor horizon?

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.761
OK, the insurance companies.

00:34:20.761 --> 00:34:23.219
Very important point I want to
reach here as a quick aside.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.389
You're going to hear
this notion of PV01,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.239
which is called PVBP or DV01.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:31.460
That's the price sensitivity
to a one basis point move.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.840
One basis point is 1/100th
of a percent in yield.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.360
Duration is the half life,
essentially, of my cash flow.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.870
What's the weighted expected
time to owe my cash flows?

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:51.070
If my duration is 7.9 years,
my PV01 is probably about $790

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.500
per million.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.069
In terms of significant digits,
they're roughly the same

00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:58.610
but they have different meanings
and the units are different.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:03.530
Duration is measured in yield,
PV01 is measured in dollars.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.280
In bond space I
typically think in PV01.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.580
If I'm selling to
long term investors

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:11.530
they have particular demands
because they've got cash flow

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.310
payments they have to hedge.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.740
So they may think of it
in terms of duration.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.560
For our purposes, we're
talking DV01 or PV01 or PVBP,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.050
those three terms
more or less equal.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:23.710
Make sense?

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:24.553
Yes?

00:35:24.553 --> 00:35:27.018
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in
terms of [INAUDIBLE] versus

00:35:27.018 --> 00:35:28.259
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:29.300
KENNETH ABBOTT: We could.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.850
In some instances, in
some areas and options

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:34.800
we might look at
an overall 1% move.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.000
But we have to look at
what trades in the market.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.970
What trades in the
market is the yield.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.710
When we quote the
yield, I'm going

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.380
to quote it going
from 702 to 701.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.840
I'm not going to have the
calculator handy to say,

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.410
a 702 move to a 701.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.990
What's 702 minus
701 divided by 702?

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.000
Make sense?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.159
It's the path of
least resistance.

00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:58.450
What's the difference between
a bond and a bond trader?

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.116
A bond matures.

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:01.892
A little fixed
income humor for you.

00:36:01.892 --> 00:36:02.850
Apparently very little.

00:36:06.659 --> 00:36:08.450
I don't want to spend
too much time on this

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.570
because we just
don't have the time.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.930
I provide an example here.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.141
If you guys want
examples, contact me.

00:36:15.141 --> 00:36:17.390
I'll send you the spreadsheets
I use for other classes

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.056
if you just want to
play around with it.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:26.360
When I talk about PV01,
when I talk about yields,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.509
I usually have some
kind of risk-free rate.

00:36:28.509 --> 00:36:30.800
Although this whole notion
of the risk-free rate, which

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.680
is-- so much of modern
finance is predicated

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.800
on this assumption that
there is a risk-free rate,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.460
which used to be
considered the US treasury.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.918
It used to be
considered risk-free.

00:36:38.918 --> 00:36:43.390
Well, there's a credit spread
out there for US Treasury.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.750
I don't mean to throw a
monkey wrench into the works.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:47.739
But there's no such thing.

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:50.030
I'm not going to question 75
years of academic finance.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.210
But it's troublesome.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.440
Just like when I was taking
economics 30 years ago,

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.850
inflation just mucked
with everything.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.555
All of the models fell apart.

00:36:59.555 --> 00:37:01.260
There were appendices
to every chapter

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.610
on how you have to change this
model to address inflation.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.500
And then inflation went away
and everything was better.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.140
But this may not go away.

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.650
I've got two components here.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:17.530
If the yield is 6%, I might
have a 450 treasury rate and 150

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.820
basis point credit spread.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.430
The credit spread reflects
the probability of default.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.770
And I don't want to get into
measures of risk neutrality

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:25.830
here.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.840
But if I'm an issuer and I
have a chance of default,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.010
I have to pay my investors more.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:40.767
Usually when we
measure sensitivity

00:37:40.767 --> 00:37:42.600
we talk about that
credit spread sensitivity

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.340
and the risk-free sensitivity.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.492
We say, well, how could
they possibly be different?

00:37:47.492 --> 00:37:49.200
And I don't want to
get into detail here,

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.380
but the notion is, when credit
spreads start getting high,

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.964
it implies a higher
probability of default.

00:37:56.964 --> 00:37:59.380
You have to think about credit
spread sensitivity a little

00:37:59.380 --> 00:37:59.750
differently.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.541
Because when you get
to 1,000 basis points,

00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:03.450
1,500 basis points
credit spread,

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.920
it's a high
probability of default.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.230
And your credit models
will think differently.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.270
Your credit models will
say, ah, that means

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.260
I'm not going to get
my next three payments.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.690
There's an expected, there's
a probability of default,

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.400
there's a loss given default,
and there's recovery.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.660
A bunch of other stochastic
measures come into play.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.180
I don't want to spend any more
time on it because it's just

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.820
going to confuse you now.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:25.720
Suffice to say we have
these yields and yields

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.390
are composed of risk-free
rates and credit spreads.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.597
And I apologize for
rushing through that,

00:38:31.597 --> 00:38:32.930
but we don't have time to do it.

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.450
Typically you have
more than one asset.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:43.030
So in this framework where I
take 2.33 standard deviations

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.370
times my dollar investment,
or my renminbi investment

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:47.705
or my sterling investment.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.060
That example was with one asset.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.010
If I want to expand
this, I can expand

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:01.276
this using this notion of
covariance and correlation.

00:39:01.276 --> 00:39:03.650
You guys covered correlation
and covariance at some point

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.940
in your careers?

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.780
Yes, no?

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.460
All right?

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:12.820
Both of them measure the way one
asset moves vis-à-vis another

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.310
asset.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.040
Correlation is scaled between
negative 1 and positive 1.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:23.280
So I think of correlation
as an index of linearity.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.650
Covariance is not scaled.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.290
I'll give you an example of the
difference between covariance

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.240
and correlation.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.430
What if I have 50 years
of data on crop yields

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:35.900
and that same 50 years of data
on tons of fertilizer used?

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.550
I would expect a
positive correlation

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.709
between tons of fertilizer
used and crop yields.

00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:43.750
So the correlation would
exist between negative 1

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.360
and positive 1.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.072
The covariance
could be any number,

00:39:47.072 --> 00:39:48.780
and that covariance
will change depending

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.670
on whether I measure
my fertilizer

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:56.950
in tons, or in pounds, or
in ounces, or in kilos.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.500
The correlation will
always be exactly the same.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.630
The linear relationship is
captured by the correlation.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.440
But the units-- in
covariance, the units count.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:14.100
If I have covariance--
here it is.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.450
Covariance matrices
are symmetric.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.940
They have the variance
along the diagonal.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.500
And the covariance is
on the off-diagonal.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.980
Which is to say that the
variance is the covariance

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.510
of an item with itself.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.750
The correlation
matrix, also symmetric,

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.800
is the same thing scaled,
with correlations,

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.900
where the diagonal is 1.0.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.430
If I have covariance--
because correlation

00:40:51.430 --> 00:41:01.560
is covariance--
covariance divided

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.100
by the product of the
standard deviations

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.650
gets me-- sorry--
correlation hat.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.410
This is like the
apostrophe in French.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:16.980
You forget it all the time.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.060
But the one time you really
need it, you won't do it

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.820
and you'll be in trouble.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.650
If you have the covariances,
you can get to the correlations.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.090
If you have the
correlations, you

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:29.700
can't get to the covariances
unless you know the variances.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.750
That's a classic
mid-term question.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:37.300
I give that almost-- not every
year, maybe every other year.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.350
Don't have time to spend
much more time on it.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.500
Suffice to say this
measure of covariance

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.870
says when x is a certain
distance from its mean,

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:47.131
how far is y from its mean
and in what direction?

00:41:47.131 --> 00:41:47.630
Yes?

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.320
Now this is just a
little empirical stuff

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.400
because I'm not as
clever as you guys.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.530
And I don't trust anyone.

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:00.550
I read it in the textbook,
I don't trust anyone.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.707
a, b, here's a plus b.

00:42:03.707 --> 00:42:06.040
Variance of a plus b is
variance of a plus variance of b

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.340
plus 2 times covariance a b.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.180
It's not just a good
idea, it's the law.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.350
I saw it in a thousand
statistics textbooks,

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.762
I tested it anyway.

00:42:13.762 --> 00:42:15.220
Because if I want
to get fired, I'm

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.170
going to get fired for
making my own mistake,

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.590
not making someone
else's mistake.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:20.280
I do this all the time.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.610
And I just prove it
empirically here.

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:26.752
The proof of which will be left
to the reader as an exercise.

00:42:26.752 --> 00:42:28.313
I hated when books said that.

00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:29.771
PROFESSOR: I actually
kind of think

00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:31.385
that's a proven
point, that you really

00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:34.719
should never trust output from
computer programs or packages--

00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:36.760
KENNETH ABBOTT: Or your
mother, or Mother Teresa.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.218
PROFESSOR: It's
good to check them.

00:42:38.218 --> 00:42:39.344
Check all the calculations.

00:42:39.344 --> 00:42:41.717
KENNETH ABBOTT: Mother Teresa
will slip you some bad data

00:42:41.717 --> 00:42:42.335
if she can.

00:42:42.335 --> 00:42:43.550
I'm telling you, she will.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.420
She's tricky that way.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.370
Don't trust anyone.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:51.010
I've caught mistakes
in software, all right?

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:56.930
I had a programmer-- it's
one of my favorite stories--

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.260
we're doing one of our first
Monte Carlo simulations,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.990
and we're factoring a matrix.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.640
If we have time, we'll get--
so I factor a covariance matrix

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:13.900
into E transpose lambda E. It's
our friend the quadratic form.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.330
We're going to see this again.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:20.872
And this is a diagonal
matrix of eigenvalues.

00:43:20.872 --> 00:43:22.330
And I take the
square root of that.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:28.060
So I can say this is E transpose
lambda to the 1/2 lambda

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.860
to the 1/2 E.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.850
And so my programmer had
gotten this, and I said,

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:34.910
do me a favor.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.040
I said, take this, and transpose
and multiply by itself.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.730
So take the square
root and multiply it

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.650
by the other square root, and
show me that you get this.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:44.410
Just show me.

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:45.130
He said I got it.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:45.880
I said you got it?

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.450
He said out to 16 decimals.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.510
I said stop.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:56.075
On my block, the square root
of 2 times the square root of 2

00:43:56.075 --> 00:43:58.820
equals 2.0.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.860
All right?

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:04.470
2.0000000, what do you mean
out to 16 decimal places?

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.980
What planet are you on?

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.640
And I scratched the
surface, and I dug,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.570
and I asked a
bunch of questions.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.385
And it turned out
in this code he

00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:16.390
was passing a float to a fixed.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:17.760
All right?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.480
Don't trust anyone's software.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.330
Check it yourself.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.610
Someday when I'm dead and
you guys are in my position,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.880
you'll be thanking me for that.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.657
Put a stone on my
grave or something.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.154
All right so covariance.

00:44:36.154 --> 00:44:37.820
Covariance tells me
some measure of when

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.250
x moves, how far does y move?
[? Or ?] for any other asset?

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.750
Could I have a piece
of your cookie?

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.670
I hardly had lunch.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.461
You want me to have a
piece of this, right?

00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:49.559
It's just looking
very good there.

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:50.059
Thank you.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.140
It's foraging.

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.940
I'm convinced 10
million years ago,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.620
my ape ancestors
were the first one

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.350
at the dead antelope
on the planes.

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.314
All right.

00:45:05.314 --> 00:45:08.960
So we're talking about
correlation, covariance.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.190
Covariance is not unit free.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.420
I can use either, but I have to
make sure I get my units right.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.130
Units screw me up every time.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.610
They still screw me up.

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:23.570
That was a good cookie.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.030
All right.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.220
So more facts.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.030
Variance of xa
times yb; x squared

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.467
variance a, y squared variance
b plus 2xy covariance ab.

00:45:35.467 --> 00:45:36.550
You guys seen this before?

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:37.530
I assume you have.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.390
Now I can get pretty
silly with this if I want.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:46.970
x, a, y, b you get
the picture, right?

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:51.160
But what you should
be thinking, this

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:58.860
is a covariance matrix,
sigma squared, sigma squared,

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.840
sigma squared.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.050
It's the sum of the variances
plus 2 times the sum

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:05.500
of the covariances.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.100
So if I have one unit of every
asset, I've got n assets,

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:12.300
all have to do to get the
portfolio variance is sum up

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.890
the whole covariance matrix.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.700
Now, you never get only
one unit, but just saying.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:20.840
But you notice that this is
kind of a regular pattern

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.770
that we see here.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.210
And so what I can
do is I can use

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.230
a combination of my
correlation matrix

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.180
and a little bit of linear
algebra legerdemain,

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.330
to do some very
convenient calculations.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.580
And here I just give an
example of a covariance matrix

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.060
and a correlation matrix.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.607
Note the correlation
matrices between negative 1

00:46:39.607 --> 00:46:41.430
and positive 1.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.930
All right.

00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:46.140
Let me cut to the chase here.

00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:53.140
I'll draw it here
because I really

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.180
want to get into some
of the other stuff.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:04.160
What this means, if I have a
covariance structure sigma.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.830
And I have a vector
of positions,

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.430
x dollars in dollar/yen,
y dollars in gold,

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.800
z dollars in oil.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.140
And let's say I've
got a position vector,

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.560
x_1, x_2, x_3, x_n.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.580
If I have all my
positions recorded

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.450
as a vector-- this is asset
one, asset two, and this

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:41.000
is in dollars-- and I have
the covariance structure,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.490
the variance of
this portfolio that

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.460
has these assets and this
covariance structure-- this

00:47:47.460 --> 00:48:01.780
is where the magic happens--
is x transpose sigma x equals

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.260
sigma squared hat portfolio.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.900
Now you really could
go work for a bank.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.580
This is how portfolio
variance, using

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.640
the variance/covariance
method, is done.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:22.740
In fact, when we were doing
it this way 20 years ago,

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.380
spreadsheets only
have 256 columns.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.600
So we tried to simplify
everything into 256--

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.270
or sometimes you
had to sum it up

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.560
using two different
spreadsheets.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.620
We didn't have
multitab spreadsheets.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:36.740
That was a dream,
multitab spreadsheets.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.530
This was Lotus 1-2-3 we're
talking about here, OK?

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.600
You guys don't even know
what Lotus 1-2-3 is.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.121
It's like an abacus
but on the screen.

00:48:45.121 --> 00:48:45.620
Yes?

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.107
AUDIENCE: What's
x again in this?

00:48:47.107 --> 00:48:48.440
KENNETH ABBOTT: Position vector.

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.050
Let's say I tell you that you've
got dollar/yen, gold, and oil.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:58.490
You've got $100 of dollar/yen,
$50 of oil, and $25 of gold.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.370
It would be 100, 50, 25.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:05.189
Now, I should say
$100 of dollar/yen,

00:49:05.189 --> 00:49:06.980
your position vector
would actually show up

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.240
as negative 100, 50, 25.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.150
Why is that?

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:14.330
Because if I'm measuring
my dollar/yen--

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:18.830
and this is just a
little aside-- typically,

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:22.740
I measure dollar/yen
in yen per dollar.

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.800
So dollar/yen might be 95.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.640
If I own yen and I'm a dollar
investor and I own yen,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.340
and yen go from 95 per
dollar to 100 per dollar,

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.270
do I make or lose money?

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.540
I lose money.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:42.090
Negative 100.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.840
Just store that.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.699
You won't be tested on that,
but we think about that

00:49:47.699 --> 00:49:48.240
all the time.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.410
Same thing with yields.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.694
Typically, when I
record my PV01--

00:49:51.694 --> 00:49:53.860
and I'll record some version,
something like my PV01

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.630
in that vector, my
interest rate sensitivity,

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.171
I'm going to record
it as a negative.

00:49:57.171 --> 00:50:01.190
Because when yields go up and
I own the bond, I lose money.

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.920
Signs, very important.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.030
And, again, we've
covered-- usually

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.220
I do this in a two hour lecture.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.180
And we've covered it in less
than an hour, so pretty good.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.437
All right.

00:50:14.437 --> 00:50:16.270
I spent a lot more time
on the fixed income.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:17.230
[STUDENT COUGHING]

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.966
Are you taking
something for that?

00:50:18.966 --> 00:50:21.691
That does not sound healthy.

00:50:21.691 --> 00:50:22.940
I don't mean to embarrass you.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.106
But I just want to make
sure that you're taking care

00:50:25.106 --> 00:50:27.468
of yourself because grad
students don't-- I was a grad

00:50:27.468 --> 00:50:29.468
student, I didn't take
care of myself very well.

00:50:29.468 --> 00:50:29.967
I worry.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.350
All right.

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.150
Big picture,
variance/covariance.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.400
Collect data,
calculate returns, test

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.680
the data, matrix construction,
get my position vector,

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.230
multiply my matrices.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.830
All right?

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:51.630
Quick and dirty,
that's how we do it.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.030
That's the simplified
approach to measuring

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:57.469
this order statistic
called value at risk using

00:50:57.469 --> 00:50:58.552
this particular technique.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:03.890
Questions, comments?

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.004
Anyone?

00:51:06.004 --> 00:51:08.536
Anything you think I need
to elucidate on that?

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:18.070
And this is, in fact, how we
did this up until the late '90s.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:19.860
Firms used variance/covariance.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:24.210
I heard a statistic
in Europe in 1996

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.367
that 80% of the European banks
were using this technique

00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:28.450
to do their value at risk.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.780
It was no more
complicated than this.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.165
I use a little flow diagram.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:38.210
Get your data returns,
graph your data

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.670
to make sure you
don't screw it up.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:44.280
Get your covariance matrix,
multiply your matrices out.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.230
x transpose sigma x.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.340
Using the position vectors and
then you can do your analysis.

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.010
Normally I would
spend some more time

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.468
on that bottom row and different
things you can do with it,

00:51:54.468 --> 00:51:58.566
but that will have
to suffice for now.

00:51:58.566 --> 00:52:01.044
A couple of points I want
to make before we move on

00:52:01.044 --> 00:52:01.960
about the assumptions.

00:52:04.147 --> 00:52:06.230
Actually, I'll fly through
this here so we can get

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.310
into Monte Carlo simulation.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:10.790
Where am I going to get my data?

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.748
Where do I get my data?

00:52:11.748 --> 00:52:13.660
I often get a lot of
my data from Bloomberg,

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.036
I get it from public sources,
I get it from the internet.

00:52:16.036 --> 00:52:17.660
Especially when you
get it from-- look,

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.730
if it says so on the
internet, it must be true.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:20.861
Right?

00:52:20.861 --> 00:52:24.530
Didn't Abe Lincoln say,
don't believe everything

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.230
you read on the internet?

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:29.760
That was a quote, I
saw that some place.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.367
You get data from
people, you check it.

00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:34.200
There's some sources
that are very reliable.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.190
If you're looking for yield
data or foreign exchange data,

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.590
the Federal Reserve has it.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.910
And they have it back
20 years, daily data.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:45.860
It's the H.15 and the H.10.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.490

it's easy to download, just

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.175
be aware of it.

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:58.720
on the website that goes
through computations

for regression analysis
and asset pricing models

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.490
and the data that's used
there is from the Federal

00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:05.560

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.610
KENNETH ABBOTT: It's
H.15 It's for yields,

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:07.690
it's probably from the H.15.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.670
PROFESSOR: Those files, you
can see how to actually get

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:10.750
that data for yourselves.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.970
KENNETH ABBOTT: Now,
another great source of data

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:15.080
is Bloomberg.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.890
Now the good thing
about Bloomberg data

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.660
is everybody uses
it, so it's clean.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.840
Relatively clean.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:22.990
I still find errors in
it from time to time.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:25.490
But what happens is when you
find an error in your Bloomberg

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.200
data, you get on the phone
to Bloomberg right away

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.270
and say I found an
error in your data.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.270
They say, oh, what date?

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:32.320
June 14, you know, 2012.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:34.370
And they'll say,
OK, we'll fix it.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.900
All right?

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.340
So everybody does that, and
the data set is pretty clean.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.430
I found consistently
that Bloomberg data is

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.497
the cleanest in my experience.

00:53:43.497 --> 00:53:45.080
How much data do we
use in doing this?

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.460
I could use one year of data,
I can use two weeks of data.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.626
Now, times series, we usually
want 100 observations.

00:53:49.626 --> 00:53:52.020
That's always been
my rule of thumb.

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.320
I can use one year of data.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.880
There are regulators
that require you

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.110
to use at least a year of data.

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:58.560
You could use two years of data.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.790
In fact, some firms
use one year of data.

00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:04.410
There's one firm that
uses five years of data.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:07.000
And there, we could say,
well, am I going to weight it.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.060
Am I going to weight my
more recent data heavily?

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.480
I could do that with
exponential smoothing, which we

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.730
won't have time to talk about.

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:17.550
It's a technique I can use to
lend more credence to the more

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:18.680
recent data.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.450
Now, I'm a relatively
simple guy.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.000
I tend to use
equally weighted data

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.050
because I believe in
Occam's razor, which

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:29.920
is, the simplest explanation
is usually the best.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.319
I think we get
too clever by half

00:54:31.319 --> 00:54:32.485
when we try to parameterize.

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.110
How much more does
last week's data

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:41.550
have an impact than from two
weeks ago, three weeks ago.

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:44.680
I'm not saying that it
doesn't, what I am saying is,

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:48.980
I'm not smart enough to know
exactly how much it does.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.120
And assuming that
everything's equally

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.300
weighted throughout time is
just as strong an assumption.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:59.050
But it's a very simple
assumption, and I love simple.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:00.002
Yes?

00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:04.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
calculate covariance matrix?

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.132
KENNETH ABBOTT: Yes.

00:55:05.132 --> 00:55:07.317
All right, quickly.

00:55:07.317 --> 00:55:09.150
Actually I think I have
some slides on that.

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.850
Let me just finish this
and I'll get to that.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:15.640
Gaps in data.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.011
Missing data is a problem.

00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:18.260
How do I fill in missing data?

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:22.420
I can do a linear interpolation,
I can use the prior day's data.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.780
I can do a Brownian
bridge, which is I just

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.800
do a Monte Carlo between them.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.880
I can do a regression
based, I can use regression

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.901
to project changes from one
onto changes in another.

00:55:31.901 --> 00:55:33.400
That's usually a
whole other lecture

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.860
I gave on how to
do missing data.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.670
Now you've got that
lecture for free.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.320
That's all you need to know.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.320
It's not only a lecture, it's a
very hard homework assignment.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.292
But how frequently
do I update my data?

00:55:47.292 --> 00:55:49.500
Some people update their
covariance structures daily.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:50.830
I think that's an overkill.

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:54.760
We update our data set weekly.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.520
That's what we do.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:00.650
And I think that's overkill,
but tell that to my regulators.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.850
And we use daily data,
weekly data, monthly data.

00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:04.400
We typically use daily data.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.957
Some firms may do
it differently.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.770
All right.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.060
Here's your
exponential smoothing.

00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:22.210
Remember, I usually measure
covariance, sum of x_i

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:27.640
minus x bar times y minus
y bar divided by n minus 1.

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.670
What if I stuck
an omega in there?

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:34.390
And I use this
calculation instead,

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.310
where the denominator is the sum
of all the omegas-- you should

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:39.470
be thinking finite series.

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.841
You have to realize, I
was a decent math student,

00:56:44.841 --> 00:56:46.090
I wasn't a great math student.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.360
And what I found when I was
studying this, I was like, wow,

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.340
all that stuff that I
learned, it actually--

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.890
finite series, who knew?

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.130
Who knew that I'd
actually use it?

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.470
So I take this, and let's say
I'm working backwards in time.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:02.070
So today's observations is t_0.

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.880
Yesterday's observation
is t_1, t_2, t_3.

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.630
So today's observation
would get-- and let's

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.820
assume for the time
being that this omega

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:15.320
is on the order 0.95.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.090
It could be anything.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:21.850
So today would be
0.95 to the 0 divided

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.400
by the sum of all the omegas.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.900
Tomorrow it will be 0.95 divided
by the sum of the omegas.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.270
The next would be
0.95 squared divided

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:31.950
by the sum of the omegas.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.780
0.95 cubed and get
smaller and smaller.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:42.760
For example, if you use
0.94, 99% of your weight

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.220
will be in the last 76 days.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.390
76 observations, I
shouldn't say 76 days.

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:49.800
76 observations.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:55.270
So there's this notion that the
impact declines exponentially.

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.580
Does that make sense?

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.530
People use this pretty commonly,
but what scares me about it--

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.275
somebody stuck these
fancy transitions

00:58:03.275 --> 00:58:04.656
in between these slides.

00:58:04.656 --> 00:58:07.940
Anyway, is that here's
my standard deviation

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:09.960
with a rolling six-month window.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.910
And here's my standard deviation
using different weights.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.660
The point I want to
make here, and it's

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:20.840
an important point, my
assumption about my weighting

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.520
coefficient has
a material impact

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:29.110
on the size of my
measured volatility.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.400
Now when I see this,
and this is just me.

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.510
There's no finance
or statistics theory

00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:38.470
behind this, any time the
choice-- any time an assumption

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.900
has this material an impact,
bells and whistles go off

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:43.040
and sirens.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.840
All right, and red lights flash.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.190
Be very, very careful.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.660
Now, lies, damn
lies, and statistics.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.610
You tell me the
outcome you want,

00:58:51.610 --> 00:58:54.280
and I'll tell you what
statistics to use.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.720
That's where this
could be abused.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.480
Oh, you want to show
high volatility?

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.510
Well let's use this.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.710
You want to show low
volatility, let's use this?

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:07.780
See, I choose to just take
the simplest approach.

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.890
And that's me.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:12.460
That's not a terribly
scientific opinion,

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.613
but that's what I think.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:21.470
Daily versus weekly,
percentage changes log changes.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:23.130
Units.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:27.290
Just like dollar/yen,
interest rates.

00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:30.080
Am I long or am I short?

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.490
If I'm long gold, I show
it as a positive number.

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.600
And if I'm short gold,
in my position vector,

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:36.550
I show it as a negative number.

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:40.970
If I'm long yen, and yen is
measured in yen per dollar,

00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:42.470
then I show it as
a negative number.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.370
If I'm long yen, but my
covariance matrix measures yen

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:51.740
as dollars per yen--
0.000094, whatever--

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.620
then I show it as
a positive number.

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.766
It's just like
physics only worse

00:59:58.766 --> 01:00:00.140
because it'll cost
you real-- no,

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.312
I guess physics would
be worse because if you

01:00:01.312 --> 01:00:03.500
get the units wrong,
you blow up, right?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.282
This will just cost you money.

01:00:06.282 --> 01:00:07.240
I've made this mistake.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.000
I've made the units mistake.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.283
All right, we talked
about fixed income.

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:21.770
So that's what I want to
cover from the bare bones

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:22.870
setup for VaR.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.850
Now I'm going to skip
the historical simulation

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:26.110
and go right to the
Monte Carlo because I

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.693
want to show you another way we
can use covariance structures.

[POWERPOINT SOUND EFFECT]

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.040
That's going to happen
two or three more times.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.710
Somebody did this, somebody
made my presentation cute

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:45.460
some years ago.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.309
And I just-- I apologize.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.185
All right, see, there's a lot
to meat in this presentation

01:00:53.185 --> 01:00:56.670
that we don't have
time to get to.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:01.120
Another approach to
doing value at risk

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:05.620
is rather than use this
parametric approach,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.270
is to simulate the outcomes.

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:13.950
Simulate the outcomes 100 times,
1,000 times, 10,000 times,

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.920
a million times, and say, these
are all the possible outcomes

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.640
based on my simulation
assumptions.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.309
And let's say I
simulate 10,000 times,

01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:25.350
and I have 10,000 possible
outcomes for tomorrow.

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:29.840
And I wanted to measure my value
at risk at the 1% significance

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.270
level.

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.790
All I would do is take
my 10,000 outcomes

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:39.170
and I would sort them and
take my hundredth worst.

01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.366
Put it in your pocket, go home.

01:01:41.366 --> 01:01:43.310
That's it.

01:01:43.310 --> 01:01:45.970
This is a different
way of getting

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:47.010
to that order statistic.

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.026
Lends a lot more flexibility.

01:01:52.026 --> 01:01:54.400
So I can go and I can tweak
the way I do that simulation,

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.145
I can relax my
assumptions of normality.

01:01:58.304 --> 01:01:59.970
I don't have to use
normal distribution,

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:01.740
I could use a t distribution,
I could do lots,

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.906
I could tweak my distribution,
I could customize it.

01:02:03.906 --> 01:02:06.150
I could put mean
reversion in there,

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:08.410
I could do all kinds of stuff.

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:12.300
So another way we do
value at risk is we

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.110
simulate possible outcomes.

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.670
We rank the outcomes,
and we just count them.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.763
If I've got the
10,000 observations

01:02:21.763 --> 01:02:23.240
and I want my 5%
order statistic,

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.230
well I just take my 500th.

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.820
Make sense?

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.890
It's that simple.

01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:32.306
Well, I don't want
to make it seem

01:02:32.306 --> 01:02:33.200
like it's that simple
because it actually

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.140
gets a little messy in here.

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.680
But when we do Monte
Carlo simulation,

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.449
we're simulating what we
think is going to happen

01:02:40.449 --> 01:02:41.740
all subject to our assumptions.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.880
And we run through this
Monte Carlo simulation.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.830
Simulation of method using
sequences of random numbers.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.550
Coined during the
Manhattan Project,

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:54.430
similar to games of chance.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.610
You need to describe your system
in terms of probability density

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:58.480
functions.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.900
What type of distribution?

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.040
Is this normal?

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:02.540
Is it t?

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.470
Is it chi squared?

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:04.500
Is it F?

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.360
All right?

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.800
That's the way we do it.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.720
So quickly, how do I do that?

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.200
I have to have random numbers.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.760
Now they're truly
random numbers.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.457
Somewhere at MIT you could
buy-- I used to say tape,

01:03:22.457 --> 01:03:23.540
but people don't use tape.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:28.840
They'll give you a website where
you can get the atomic decay.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.450
That's random.

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:31.706
All right?

01:03:31.706 --> 01:03:36.480
Anything else is pseudo-random.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.190
What you see when
you go into MATLAB,

01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:41.570
you have a random number
generator, it's an algorithm.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:45.110
It probably takes some number
and takes the square root

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:47.910
of that number and then goes
54 decimal places to the right

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:51.690
and takes the 55 decimal
places to the right,

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:55.170
multiplies those
two numbers together

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.110
and then takes the fifth root,
and then goes 16 decimal places

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:01.610
to the right to get that--
it's some algorithm.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:05.590
True story, before I came to
appreciate that these were all

01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:09.225
highly algorithmically
driven, I was in my 20's, I

01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:11.390
was taking a computer
class, I saw two computers,

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.830
they were both running
random number of generators

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.190
and they were generating
the same random numbers.

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:19.870
And I thought I was
at the event horizon.

01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:22.760
I thought that light was
bending and the world

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.610
was coming to an end, all right?

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:27.767
Because this this stuff
can't happen, all right?

01:04:27.767 --> 01:04:29.350
It was happening
right in front of me.

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:31.860
It was a pseudo-random
number generator.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.860
I didn't know, I was 24.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.360
Anyway.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:42.810
quasi-random numbers, it's sort
of a way of imposing some order

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:43.790
on your random numbers.

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:47.020
You random numbers, one
particular set of draws

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:49.895
may not have enough draws
in a particular area

01:04:49.895 --> 01:04:51.270
to give you the
numbers you want.

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.767
I can impose some
conditions upon that.

01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:56.100
I don't want to get into a
discussion of random numbers.

01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:02.250
How do I get from
random uniform--

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.610
most random number generators
give you random uniform number

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.280
between 0 and 1.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.080
What you'll typically do is
you'll take that random uniform

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.190
number, you'll map it over
to the cumulative density

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.340
function, and map it down.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.720
So this gets you from
random uniform space

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.150
into standard deviation space.

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:24.860
We used to worry
about how we did this,

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:27.534
now your software
does it for you.

01:05:27.534 --> 01:05:29.450
I've gotten comfortable
enough, truth be told.

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:36.040
I usually trust my random number
generators in Excel, in MATLAB.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.980
So I kind of violate my
own rules, I don't check.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:43.940
But I think most of your
standard random number

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.074
of generators are
decent enough now.

01:05:46.074 --> 01:05:47.490
And you can go
straight to normal,

01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:50.150
you don't have to do
random uniform and back

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.280
into random normal.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.910
You can get it distributed
in any way you want.

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:05.524
What I do when I do a Monte
Carlo simulation-- and this

01:06:05.524 --> 01:06:08.065
is going to be rushed because
we've only got like 20 minutes.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.165
If I take a covariance
matrix-- you're

01:06:14.165 --> 01:06:15.540
going to have to
trust me on this

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.460
because again, I'm covering
like eight hours of lecture

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.907
in an hour and a half.

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.740
You guys go to MIT so
I have no doubt you're

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:22.823
going to be all over this.

01:06:48.134 --> 01:06:52.080
Let's take this out
of here for a second.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.250
I can factor my
covariance structure.

01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:02.716
I can factor my covariance
structure like this.

01:07:02.716 --> 01:07:05.300
And this is the
transpose of this.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.920
I didn't realize that the first
time we did this commercially

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.690
I saw this instead of
this and I thought we had

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:13.940
sent bad data to the customer.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.280
I got physically sick.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.190
And then I remembered
AB transpose

01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:25.840
equals B transpose A--
these things keep happening.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.720
My high school math
keeps coming back to me.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.114
But I had forgotten this
and I got physically sick

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:33.030
because I thought we'd
sent bad data because I

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:36.400
was looking at this when it's
just the transpose of this.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.900
Anyway, I can factor
this into this where this

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.550
is a matrix of eigenvectors.

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:48.195
This is a diagonal matrix
of the eigenvalues.

01:07:48.195 --> 01:07:50.640
All right?

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.100
This is the vaunted
Gaussian copula.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.930
This is it.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:07:59.560
Most people view
it as a black box.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.890
If you've had any more than
introductory statistics,

01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:03.360
this should be a
glass box to you.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.765
That's why I wanted to go
through this even though I'd

01:08:04.765 --> 01:08:07.872
love to spend another hour and
a half and do about 50 examples.

01:08:07.872 --> 01:08:09.330
Because this is
how I learned this,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.880
I didn't learn it from looking
at this equation and saying,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.530
oh, I get it.

01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:15.870
I learned it from actually
doing it about 1,000 times

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:20.020
in a spreadsheet, and sunk
in like water into a stone.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.649
So I factor this
matrix, and then

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:33.250
I take this, which is the
square root matrix, which

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:36.020
is my transpose of
my eigenvector matrix

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.490
and diagonal matrix contain the
square root of my eigenvalues.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:42.750
Now, could this ever
be negative and take me

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:44.910
into imaginary root land?

01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:50.140
Well, if my variances
are positive or zero,

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.176
then that will be a problem.

01:08:52.176 --> 01:08:53.800
So here we get into
this-- remember you

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.899
guys studied positive
semidefinite,

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:56.649
positive definite.

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:59.232
Once again, it's another one of
these high school math things.

01:08:59.232 --> 01:09:00.130
Like, here it is.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.035
I had to know this.

01:09:02.035 --> 01:09:04.160
Suddenly I care whether
it's positive semidefinite.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.270
Covariance structures have
to be positive semidefinite.

01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:10.450
If you don't have a
complete data set,

01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:13.439
let's say you've got 100
observations, 100 observations,

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:17.740
100 observations, 25
observations, 100 observations,

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.486
you may have a
negative eigenvalue.

01:09:19.486 --> 01:09:21.569
If you just measure the
covariance with the amount

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:23.160
of data that you have.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.430
My intuition-- and I doubt
this is the [INAUDIBLE]--

01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:28.880
is that you're measuring
with error and you have fewer

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.470
observations you
measure with more error.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:35.160
So it's possible if some
of your covariance measures

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.000
have 25 observations
and some of them

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.590
have 100 observations that
there's more error in some

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:42.229
than in others.

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:44.529
And so there's the
theoretical possibility

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:46.550
for negative variance.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:51.060
True story, we didn't
know this in the '90s.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:54.075
I took this problem to the
chairman of the statistics

01:09:54.075 --> 01:09:58.290
department at NYU said, I'm
getting negative eigenvalues.

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:00.140
And he didn't know.

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.370
He had no idea,
he's a smart guy.

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:06.260
You have to fill in
your missing data.

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.500
You have to fill in
your missing data.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500
If you've got 1,000
observations, 1,000

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.654
observations, 1,000
observations, 200 observations,

01:10:12.654 --> 01:10:14.320
and you want to make
sure you won't have

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.300
a negative
eigenvalue, you've got

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:17.810
to fill in those observations.

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:20.510
Which is why missing data
is a whole other thing

01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:22.999
we talk about.

01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:24.790
Again, I could spend
a lot of time on that.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:26.123
And I learned that the hard way.

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:32.640
But anyway, so I take
this square root matrix,

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:40.240
if I pre-multiply that square
root matrix by row after row

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:46.700
of normals, I will
get out an array

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.580
that has the same
covariance structure as that

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.606
with which I started.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.130
Another story here,
I've been using

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.710
the same eigenvalue-- I
believe in full attribution,

01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.660
I'm not a clever guy.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:02.660
I have not an original
thought in my head.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:04.580
And whenever I use
someone else's stuff,

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.830
I give them credit for it.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.606
And the guy who
wrote the code that

01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:10.230
did the eigenvalue
decomposition-- this

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:13.740
is something that was
translated from Fortran IV.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.820
It wasn't even
[INAUDIBLE], there's

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.570
a dichotomy in the world.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.100
There are people that
have written Fortran,

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:22.100
and people that haven't.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.730
I'm guessing that there are two
people in this room that have

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:27.020
ever written a line of Fortran.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.580
Anyone here?

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.530
Just saying.

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:34.882
Yeah, with cards
or without cards?

01:11:34.882 --> 01:11:36.740
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.410
KENNETH ABBOTT: I
didn't use cards.

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:40.410
See, you're an old-timer
because you used cards.

01:11:44.226 --> 01:11:47.701
The punch line is, I've
been using this guy's code.

01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:48.950
And I could show you the code.

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:50.650
It's like the Lone
Ranger, I didn't even

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:52.370
get a chance to thank him.

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:55.360
Because he didn't put
his name on the code.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.430
On the internet now, if
you do something clever

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:58.610
on the quant
newsgroups, you're going

01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:59.980
to post your name all over it.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.840
I've been wanting to thank
this guy for like 20 years

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.040
and I haven't been able to.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.100
Anyway, eigenvalue code
that's been translated.

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.660
Let me show you what this means.

01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:11.840
Here's some source data.

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:17.446
Here's some percentage changes.

01:12:17.446 --> 01:12:20.120
Just like we talked about.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.880
Here is the
empirical correlation

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.970
of those percentage changes.

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.570
So the correlation of my
government 10 year to my AAA 10

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:32.590
year is 0.83.

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:33.852
To my AA, 0.84.

01:12:33.852 --> 01:12:36.310
All right, you see this.

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:38.690
And I have this
covariance matrix

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:42.320
which is the-- the correlation
matrix is a scaled version

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.470
of the covariance matrix.

01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:46.720
And I do a little bit of
statistical legerdemain.

01:12:51.582 --> 01:12:52.790
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.985
Take the square root of that.

01:12:56.985 --> 01:12:59.660
And again, I'd love to spend
a lot more time on this,

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:03.090
but we just don't--
suffice to say,

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.820
I call this a transformation
matrix, that's my term.

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:12.235
This matrix here is this.

01:13:12.235 --> 01:13:13.760
If we had another
hour and a half

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.710
I'd take the step by
step to get you there.

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.400
The proof of which is left
to the reader as an exercise.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.930
I'll leave this spreadsheet
for you, I'll send it to you.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:22.600
I have this matrix.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.672
This matrix is like a prism.

01:13:24.672 --> 01:13:26.380
I'm going to pass
white light through it,

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.390
I'm going to get a
beautiful rainbow.

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:32.120
Let me show you what I mean.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.770
So remember that matrix,
this matrix I'm calling t.

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:41.410
Remember my matrix is 10 by 10.

01:13:41.410 --> 01:13:47.095
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:13:47.095 --> 01:13:50.410
10 columns of data.

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:53.614
10 by 10 correlation matrix.

01:13:53.614 --> 01:13:54.548
Let's check.

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:08.980
Now I've got row vectors
of sorry-- uncorrelated

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.760
random normals.

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:20.710
So what I'm doing then
is I'm pre-multiplying

01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:26.860
that transformation matrix
row by row by each row

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:28.960
of uncorrelated random normals.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.940
And what I get is
correlated random normals.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:37.110
So what I'm telling
you here is this array

01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:44.080
happens to be 10
wide and 1,000 long.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.810
And I'm telling
you that I started

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:53.200
with my historical data-- let
me see how much data have there.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.230
A couple hundred observations
of historical data.

01:14:57.230 --> 01:15:03.940
And what I've done is once I
have that covariance structure,

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:17.210
I can create a
data set here which

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:25.300
has the same statistical
properties as this.

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:35.280
Not quite the same.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.545
It can have the same means
and the same variances.

01:15:39.545 --> 01:15:41.430
This is what Monte Carlo
simulation is about.

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:43.804
I wish we had another hour
because I'd like to spend time

01:15:43.804 --> 01:15:45.360
and-- this is one
of these things,

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.000
and again, when I first saw
this, I was like, oh my god.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.176
I felt like I got the
keys to the kingdom.

01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:53.550
And I did, this is manually,
did it all on a spreadsheet.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:54.966
Didn't believe
anyone else's code,

01:15:54.966 --> 01:15:57.080
did it all on a spreadsheet.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:03.149
But what that means-- quickly,
let me just go back over here

01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.690
for a second.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:09.630
I happen to have about
800 observations here.

01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.450
Historical observations.

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:22.370
What I did was I happened to
generate 1,000 samples here.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:25.530
But I could generate
10,000 or 100,000,

01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:27.740
or a million or 10
million or a billion

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.570
just by doing more
random normals.

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:31.640
I could generate--
in effect, what

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.695
I'm generating here is
synthetic time series that

01:16:36.695 --> 01:16:39.680
have properties similar
to my underlying data.

01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.430
That's what Monte Carlo
simulation is about.

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:48.100
The means and the variances and
the covariances of this data

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.470
set are just like that.

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:53.700
Now, again, true story, when
somebody first showed me this

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.680
I did not believe them.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.346
So I developed a
bunch of little tests.

01:16:58.346 --> 01:17:02.210
And I said, let me just look
at the correlation of my Monte

01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:07.430
Carlo data versus my
original correlation matrix.

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:13.270
So 0.83, 0.84, 0.85,
0.85, 0.67, 0.81.

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:16.510
You look at the corresponding
ones of the random numbers I

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:21.890
just generated, 0.81, 0.82,
0.84, 0.84, 0.64, 0.52.

01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.641
0.54 versus 0.52.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.580
0.18 Versus 0.12.

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:28.600
0.51 versus 0.47.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.270
Somebody want to tell me
why they're not spot on?

01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:34.150
Sampling error.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:37.270
The more data I use the
closer it will get to that.

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:41.290
If I do 1 million, I'd better
get right on top of that.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.450
Does that make sense?

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.490
So what I'm telling
you here is that I can

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.080
generate synthetic time series.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.559
Now, why would I
generate so many?

01:17:49.559 --> 01:17:51.100
Well because,
remember, I care what's

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.260
going on out in that tail.

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:56.220
If I only have 100 observations
and I'm looking empirically

01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:01.040
at my tail, I've only got one
observation out in the 1% tail.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.040
And that doesn't tell me a
whole lot about what's going on.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.100
If I can simulate that
distribution exactly,

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.635
I can say, you know what, I
want a billion observations

01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:10.740
in that tail.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.000
Now we can look at that tail.

01:18:18.506 --> 01:18:19.880
If I have 1 billion
observations,

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.750
let's say I'm looking at some
kind of normal distribution.

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:27.200
I'm circling it out
here, I'm seeing--

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.930
I can really dig in and see what
the properties of this thing

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:30.560
are.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.980
In fact, this can really
only take two distributions,

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.063
and really, it's only one.

01:18:34.063 --> 01:18:36.870
But that's another story.

01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:39.210
So what I do in Monte
Carlo simulations,

01:18:39.210 --> 01:18:45.800
I'm simulating these outcomes
so we can get a lot more meat

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.419
in this tail to understand
what's happening out there.

01:18:48.419 --> 01:18:49.460
Does it drop off quickly?

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:50.970
Does it not drop off quickly?

01:18:50.970 --> 01:18:53.920
That's kind of what it's about.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.850
So we're about out of time.

01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:59.850
We just covered like four
weeks of material, all right?

01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:00.990
But you guys are from MIT.

01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:02.680
I have complete
confidence in you.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:03.950
I say that to the
people who work for me.

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:05.700
I have complete
confidence in your ability

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.270
to get that done by
tomorrow morning.

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:13.020
Questions or comments?

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.050
I know you're sipping
from the fire hose here.

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:17.160
I fully appreciate that.

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:21.610
So those are examples.

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:24.210
When I do this with
historical simulation

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:29.870
I won't generate these
Monte Carlo trials,

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.070
I'll just use historical data.

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:35.740
And my fat tails
are built into it.

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.250
But what I've shown
you today is what

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:42.030
we developed a
one-asset VaR model,

01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:47.530
then we developed a multi-asset
variance/covariance model.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:50.520
And then I showed you
quickly, and in far less time

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.050
than I would like
to have shown you,

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:57.060
is how I can use another
statistical technique, which

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:01.950
is called the Gaussian copula,
to generate synthetic data

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:05.470
sets that will have the
same properties as my source

01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:07.470
historical data.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.060
All right?

01:20:10.982 --> 01:20:12.444
There you have it.

01:20:12.444 --> 01:20:12.944
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:12.944 --> 01:20:16.304
Oh you don't have to--
please, please, please.

01:20:16.304 --> 01:20:18.470
And I'll tell you, for me,
one of the coolest things

01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:20.240
was actually being
able to apply so much

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.410
of the math I learned in
high school and in college

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.826
and never thought
I'd apply again.

01:20:23.826 --> 01:20:25.860
One of my best
moments was actually

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.355
finding a use for trigonometry.

01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:34.030
If you're not an engineer,
where are you going to use it?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:35.030
Where do you use it?

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.090
Seasonals.

01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:38.210
You do seasonal estimation.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:41.489
And what you do is you do
fast Fourier transform.

01:20:41.489 --> 01:20:43.280
Because I can describe
any seasonal pattern

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:45.990
with a linear combination of
sine and cosine functions.

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:47.475
And it actually works.

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.600
I have my students do it
as an exercise every year.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.080
I say, go get New York
city temperature data.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.650
And show me some
linear combination

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:57.230
of sine and cosine
functions that

01:20:57.230 --> 01:21:00.740
will show me the seasonal
pattern of temperature data.

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:04.952
And when I first realized I
could use trigonometry, yes!

01:21:04.952 --> 01:21:07.460
It wasn't a waste of time.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.960
I still-- polar
coordinates, I still

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.165
haven't found a
use for that one.

01:21:11.165 --> 01:21:11.790
But it's there.

01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:12.890
I know it's there.

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:13.790
All right?

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:15.340
Go home.
