00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.390
PROFESSOR: All right,
OK, let's get started.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.450
So before I make
introduction, let me just

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.670
make a few announcements.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.000
A few of you came to us asking
about the grading for the term.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.520
And some feel the problem sets
may be on the difficult side,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.670
and some of you haven't done
all of them, and some of you

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.970
have done more.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.720
So we just want to let you know
that the most important thing

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.280
to us in grading is really
you show your effort in terms

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.220
of learning.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.280
And we purposely
made the problem

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.740
sets more difficult
than the lecture,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.080
so you can-- if you want to
dig in deeper so you have

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.820
the opportunity to learn more.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.310
But by no means we
expect you to finish

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.980
or feel easy in solving
all the problem sets.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.390
So I just want to
put you at ease

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.080
that if that's your
concern, that's definitely--

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.610
you don't need to
worry about it.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.800
And we will be really just
evaluating your effort.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.260
And based on what do
we observed so far,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.770
we actually believe every single
one of you is doing quite well.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.060
So you shouldn't worry about
your performance at the class.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.120
So continue to do a good job
on your class participation,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.250
and do some of the problem sets.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.970
And then you will be in
fine shape for your grade.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.130
So that's all of that.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340
So without any
further delay, let

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.480
me introduce my colleague,
Doctor Stephen Blythe.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.720
I'll be very brief.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.160
And he's-- Stephen is doing
two jobs at the same time.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.430
He's responsible for the all
the public markets at Harvard

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.100
Management, as well as being
a professor of practice

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.070
at Harvard.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.962
So with that, I turn to Stephen.

00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:24.300
STEPHEN BLYTHE: OK, well,
thank you, and thank you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720
for having me to
speak this afternoon.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.640
Before I begin, I wanted
to ask you a question.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.830
So I'm speaking, actually,
at almost exactly

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.640
the 20th anniversary of
something very important.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.660
So on the 19th of October,
1993, which I guess

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.680
might be the birthday
of some of you,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.471
but almost exactly 20 years
ago, Congress voted 264 to 159--

00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:58.340
I actually remember the count
of the vote-- to do something.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.820
So anybody like
to guess what they

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.190
voted to do on the 19th
of October, 1993 that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.900
might be tangentially
relevant to finance

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.570
and quantitative finance?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.510
Anyone here from HMC is
not allowed to answer.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.160
Anybody-- any guesses?

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.970
Any ideas at all coming
to people's minds?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.470
AUDIENCE: Was it
Gramm-Leach-Bliley?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.424
STEPHEN BLYTHE: No.

00:03:20.424 --> 00:03:22.340
AUDIENCE: Commodity
Futures Modernization Act?

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.880
STEPHEN BLYTHE:
No, but good guess.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.380
But actually, that is actually
too related to finance,

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.880
actually.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.979
This is actually--
wasn't actually

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.520
directly financially
related, so that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.850
was related to [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.330
Anybody else think about?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.640
What does Congress usually do?

00:03:42.104 --> 00:03:43.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.679
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.345
STEPHEN BLYTHE: No,
no ideas whatsoever?

00:03:58.727 --> 00:04:00.560
What do you think
Congress did 20 years ago?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.544
They voted to do something.

00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:04.960
OK, well, what
Congress do usually

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.293
is they cut money for something.

00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:10.070
So they voted to cut
financing to something.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.240
So what did they
cut financing to?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.694
Anybody guess?

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:16.110
I know this isn't
business school.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.100
In business school, it would
be, like, right, you're failed.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100
No class participation--
you failed.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.190
You've got to say something
in business school.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.270
So I know it's not
business school.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.686
But anyway-- and I don't teach
in business school, either.

00:04:25.686 --> 00:04:27.570
But this is
actually-- these round

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.310
desks make me think
of business school

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.010
and striding into the
middle of the room,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.630
and saying OK, come on.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.710
Fortunately, I don't have names,
otherwise I'd pick on you.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.784
No, no guesses-- no
guesses whatsoever?

00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.950
I've got to take this up
the road to Harvard Square,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.800
and say I've taught at MIT.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.140
No one had any guesses with
this question-- one guess,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.910
actually, the gentleman here.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.140
What did they cancel the
financing for in 1993?

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.050
I'll say it was the
Superconducting Super

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.210
Collider underneath Texas
just south of Dallas.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.505
So $2 billion had been
spent on the Super Collider.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:08.350
And the budget had
expanded from, I think,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.300
$6 to $11 billion.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.680
So they, by canceling, had
a $9 billion dollar savings.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.990
This is 20 years
ago-- almost exactly.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.440
And as a result of that--
one result of that-- was,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.390
of course, the academic
job market for physicists

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.700
collapsed overnight.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.360
And two of my roommates
were theoretical physicists

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.470
at Harvard.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.990
And they basically realized
their job prospects in academia

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.960
had vaporized
instantaneously that day.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.530
And both of them,
within six months,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.820
had found jobs with
Goldman Sachs in New York.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.340
And they catalyzed they--
they and the cohort--

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.740
they're called the
Superconducting Super Collider

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.940
generation.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.230
If you ever wondered why people
like myself and like Jake got

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.680
PhDs in quantitative subjects
around the turn of-- around

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.070
1990 to 1993-- all ended
up in a financial path,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.630
part of it is due to Congress
cancelling the Superconducting

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.254
Super Collider.

00:06:02.254 --> 00:06:04.720
Because this cohort
catalyzed this growth

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.310
in quantitative finance.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.680
Actually, they created a
field-- financial engineering--

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.730
which you are all somewhat
interested in by taking

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.970
this class.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.770
And they also created a career
path-- quantitative analyst,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.790
or quant, which really
did not exist before 1993.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.485
And that growth of
mathematical finance,

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.360
financial engineering,
quantitative finance--

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.900
however you want
to look at it-- was

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.460
basically exponential
from 1993 up

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.610
until 2008 and the financial
crisis exactly five years ago,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.840
funnily enough.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.160
And since then, it's been
a little bit rockier.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.450
So if you're actually
interested in this aftermath

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.140
of the physics funding-- what's
interesting is the Large Hadron

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.980
Collider, which you might know
is up and running in Geneva

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.720
and just found the
Higgs Boson, has sort of

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.280
reversed the trend somewhat.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.990
So there used to
be a whole cohort

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.260
of people going into
finance instead of physics.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.360
Now, because finance has this
somewhat pejorative nature

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.780
to it-- people don't
like bankers generally,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.170
and they kind of like physicists
who find the Higgs Boson

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.690
and get a Nobel Prize--
maybe we're getting reversal.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.190
But anyway, we're
still in finance.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.640
I've, as Jake mentioned,
well, I did mention,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.170
I was originally in academics.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.360
I was actually a mathematics
faculty member in London

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.570
when I got my PhD-- I
got my PhD from Harvard.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.164
And in 1993, I was an academic.

00:07:23.164 --> 00:07:25.080
And all my friends-- I
saw them go to finance.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.940
So I followed them, spent
a career in New York,

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.120
and then came back
to Harvard in 2006

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.790
to run a part of the endowment.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.580
And I started teaching.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.745
So just as a plug--
for those of you

00:07:37.745 --> 00:07:39.870
interested in mathematical
finance and applications

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.320
of mathematics finance, I
teach a course at Harvard.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.740
It's an upper level
undergraduate course

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.310
called Applied Quantitative
Finance, which of course you

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.770
can cross-register for.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.130
And today is also the
one-week anniversary

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.820
of the publication of my book.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.029
So if you're interested in
what my course is about,

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:00.070
you can just buy my book.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.612
It's only $30.

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:02.320
And I'll sign it.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.500
It's first edition,
first printing,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.410
first impression
book, Introduction

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.270
to Quantitative Finance.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.890
And that is what the course is.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.240
It's quite distilled.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.470
When this book came out, I
thought, that's really thin.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.639
This is three years
of my life's work.

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:18.930
It's come out-- it's very thin.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.513
But I like to think
it's like whiskey.

00:08:20.513 --> 00:08:23.140
It's well distilled,
and highly potent,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.400
and you have to sip it,
and take it bit by bit.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.910
Anyway, that is the
book of my class.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:35.090
And the genesis of
the class was really

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.162
that, when I've
been on Wall Street,

00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:38.870
and I was a colleague
of Jake's at Morgan

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:46.460
Stanley in this rapidly growing
quantitative finance field,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.870
we encountered on the trading
desk in the late 1990s

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.820
and the early 2000s problems
from the real economy-- things

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.050
that we had to trade.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.880
We were-- things that were
coming to us on the trading

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.200
desk that required subtle
understanding of the underlying

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.980
theory.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.929
So that we, in essence, we
built theoretical framework

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:11.470
to solve the problems
that were given

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.480
to us by the financial markets.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.150
So that period, especially
around the turn of the century,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.750
there's a big growth in
derivatives markets, which--

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:25.460
options, futures,
forwards, et cetera, swaps.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.426
And we needed to build
theoretical tools

00:09:27.426 --> 00:09:28.050
to tackle them.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.640
And that's really what the
course was evolved out of,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.090
to build the appropriate
theoretical framework,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.040
motivated by the
problems we encountered.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.694
Why I enthuse
about the subject--

00:09:40.694 --> 00:09:42.360
and I really like
teaching the subject--

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.052
is that there is an impression
that qualitative finance is

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:49.720
a very arcane and contrived
subject-- just a whole

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.799
bunch of PhDs on Wall Street
coming up with crazy ideas.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.340
And they need
complicated mathematics

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.620
that's just complicated
for the sake of complexity.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.570
And the theory is just
sort of a contrived theory.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.400
But in fact, at the
heart of Wall Street

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.275
is that the real economy
demands some of these products

00:10:05.275 --> 00:10:06.150
by supply and demand.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.960
There are actual,
real participants

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.790
in the financial markets who
want to trade derivatives.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.500
And therefore, in order
to understand them,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.708
you need to develop a theory.

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:15.420
So it's actually driven
by real examples.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.860
That's one part.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.320
The other part is that
the theory that comes out

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.810
of it, and in particular the
approach I take here, I think

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.234
is just very elegant.

00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:25.400
OK, so there's some subtlety
and elegance and beauty

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.410
to the underlying
theory that comes out

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.870
of addressing real problems.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.830
This course, and the way
that I teach finance,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.340
is very probability centric.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.220
You probably realize from the
lectures you've seen already

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.350
in this class, there are
many different approaches,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.350
many different methods that are
used in finance-- stochastic

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.640
calculus, partial differential
equations, simulation,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.170
and so on.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.140
The classical derivation
of Black-Scholes

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.700
is, well, it's the
solution of the PDE.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.374
OK, that has appealed to people.

00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:00.790
In fact, this is
why in some ways,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.414
quantitative finance
is a broad church,

00:11:02.414 --> 00:11:05.280
because whether you're a
physicist, or probabilist,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.910
or a chemical engineer, all
the techniques you learn

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.652
can be applied.

00:11:09.652 --> 00:11:10.860
You know stochastic calculus.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.610
You know differential equations.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.900
They can be applied.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.940
But the path that I
take in this class

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.770
is very much through the
probabilistic route, which

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.580
is my background as
a probabilist, as

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.800
an academic, or a
statistician as an academic.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.905
And this is, in particular,
I think, a very elegant path

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.770
to understand finance,
and the linkage

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.480
between derivative
products-- which

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.910
might seem contrived-- and
probability distributions,

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.250
which is sort of natural
things for probabilists.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.810
So this, what we're going
to talk about today,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.340
is really this
link, which I call

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:52.870
option-probability duality.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:58.660
Which, in essence, in the
simplest form, is just saying,

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.970
option prices-- they're just
probability distributions.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.199
Therefore, these
complicated derivatives

00:12:03.199 --> 00:12:04.990
that people talk about--
all these options,

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.906
these financial engineers,
these quants, these

00:12:06.906 --> 00:12:09.130
exotics-- we're really just
talking about probability

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.713
distributions.

00:12:09.713 --> 00:12:12.680
We can go between them--
option prices, probabilities,

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.600
and distributions-- back and
forth in a very elegant way.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.180
What I love about this
subject in particular

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:22.070
is that to get to that point
where we see this duality does

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:27.310
not need a whole framework
and infrastructure

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.679
of complicated definitions,
or formulae, or option pricing

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:33.470
formulae, or so on.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.080
So that's what I'm going to
try and do in this hour or so,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.750
is introduce this concept
of option price, probability

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.380
duality.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.974
And show how the
natural-- so there's

00:12:42.974 --> 00:12:44.390
a natural duality
that can be seen

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.860
in a number of different ways.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.870
OK, so we're going to need
a few definitions that

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.137
should be familiar to you.

00:12:52.137 --> 00:12:53.595
We're going to
define three assets.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.306
We have a call option,
which we know about,

00:13:00.306 --> 00:13:06.659
a zero-coupon bond--
called a zed cee bee.

00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:08.950
This is the one thing I
haven't become Americanized on.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.400
I still call this zed.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.410
It's a-- other
things I've become--

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.480
and then a digital option.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.830
OK, all right, so what are they?

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.880
Well, they're all going to
be defined by their payouts

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.260
at maturity.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.180
OK, so we're going to have
some maturity capital T,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.700
and some underlying asset, S,
the stock, with some price S_T.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.770
OK, so we know that the call
option has payout at T--

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.260
So that's called
payout at T. So T is

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.090
some fixed time in the future.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.930
We will change in the
future to some fixed time.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:53.940
This is simply the max
of S_T minus K and 0.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.830
That's a call option.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.021
You can go through the right
to buy, et cetera, et cetera.

00:14:00.021 --> 00:14:01.770
But it's clear it's
just value at maturity

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.530
is just the max of
S_T minus K and 0.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.450
The zero-coupon
bond with maturity T

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.840
is just something that's
worth 1 at time T.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.181
So that's just payout one.

00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:16.680
That's definition--
so you can think

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.760
of these all as definitions.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.220
And then the digital
option is just

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:31.760
the indicator function of S_T
being greater than K. So here,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.170
T is the maturity.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.055
K is the strike.

00:14:36.055 --> 00:14:41.510
So T maturity, K is strike.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.920
And these are three assets.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.540
So this is, in some sense,
the payout function.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.650
All derivative
products can be defined

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.150
in terms of a function--
not all of them.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:56.170
Many derivative products
can be defined just

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.620
as a function of S_T.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.870
And here are three functions
of S_T. [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:06.320
And then I'm just going to get
notation for the price at t

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.760
less than or equal to T.
We can think about little t

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.600
as current time
today, or we can think

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.460
of some future time
between now and capital

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:18.350
T. I'm just going to
introduce notation.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.760
Every different finance book
uses different notation, so

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:27.990
just C for call price,
with strike K, at little t

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.100
with maturity big T.
OK, just that notation.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.160
The zero-coupon bond--
the price at little t--

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.810
let's call that Z. That's
the price of little t.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:44.110
And the digital--
we'll just call that D.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.042
So this is what we're
going to set this up.

00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:50.000
Actually, you could have
a whole lecture on why

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.930
notation-- different notation.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.690
K and capital T are
actually embedded

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.410
in the terms of the contract.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.050
Little t is in my calendar time.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.350
So you might think why
don't you put K and capital

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.714
T somewhere else?

00:16:01.714 --> 00:16:03.880
Well, when you get actually
to modeling derivatives,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.920
you like to be moving both
maturity and a forward time

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.740
and calendar time.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.281
That's why I just
write it like that.

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:12.440
But there's no-- so
C sub K, little t,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.380
big T is the price
at time of little t

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.410
of a call with maturity
capital T and strike K.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.100
Black-Scholes and other
option pricing formula

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:28.380
are all about determining
this-- for t less than T.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.190
Because clearly we know
that the price at maturity

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.250
is simply the payout.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.200
I mean, that's, again,
just the definition.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.130
So that's trivial.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.280
But we want to find out what
the price is at little t.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.990
So that's the whole path
of finance-- Black-Scholes

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.130
and other option
pricing methodology

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.631
is working out this.

00:16:49.631 --> 00:16:51.880
But we're actually going to
go down a different route.

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:55.480
So what we're
going to do-- we're

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.520
going to construct a portfolio.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:07.020
So consider as a
portfolio of what?

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.660
We're going to
consist of two calls.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:17.770
OK, we're going to have lambda
calls with strike K. OK,

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.020
so this is the amount holding.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.119
And everything is going to
be with maturity capital T.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.810
So lambda calls with
strike K, and maturity T,

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:32.740
and minus lambda calls with
strike K plus 1 over lambda.

00:17:35.852 --> 00:17:37.310
We'll just consider
that portfolio.

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.960
It consists of two options.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:48.620
All right, well, this
price at T-- that's easy.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.200
We just write it
in terms of lambda

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.660
times the price of the
call with strike K,

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:06.390
minus lambda call with strike
K plus 1 over lambda-- just

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.230
by definition.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.920
This is price at T.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.670
OK, well, let's look at
its payout at time capital

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.495
T graphically.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.250
So we know about call options.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.130
The payout function is just the
hockey stick shape, clearly.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.840
That's confusing to people
from the UK, because in the UK,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.322
hockey means field
hockey, not ice hockey.

00:18:32.322 --> 00:18:34.530
And of course, the hockey
stick shape in field hockey

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.405
looks very different.

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:38.160
Anyway, that's-- you understand
what the payout of a call is.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.860
Clearly, this payout function
of a call looks like this.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:51.280
Well, putting this
payout of lambda calls

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.030
of strike K minus
lambda calls of strike K

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.105
plus 1 over lambda--
let's assume lambda

00:18:55.105 --> 00:18:57.230
is positive for the time being.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.750
What's it look like?

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:06.000
Well, 0 below K, is flat
above K plus 1 over lambda.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.820
It has slope lambda,
and has value 1 here.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.230
You should be able
to see that easily.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.690
So that's the payout.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.670
This is called call spread--
just the spread between two

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.390
calls, and has this
payout function.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.590
OK, so a natural
thing to do here,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.020
it being a mathematics
class, let's take limits.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.635
Just let lambda
tend to infinity.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.260
Well, then, this becomes
the partial derivative

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.010
of the call price with respect
to K, or the negative of it.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.535
So this tends to minus.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:59.950
OK, let's just-- so that's that.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.350
And then this, of course
as lambda goes to infinity,

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.730
this stays at 1.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:13.510
So this tends to payout
function that looks like that.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.010
OK?

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.420
This is easy calculus.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.740
This is just by inspection.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:28.140
OK, so this, clearly, is
the payout of the digital.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.120
Of the-- strictly
a digital call,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.010
but that's called
the digital option.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.190
Just as a note, here
it's, just greater than.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.570
You might think, OK, it
doesn't matter if it's

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.330
greater than or equal to.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.490
Well, in practice, the chance
of something equalling a number

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.960
exactly is 0-- I mean, if it's
a continuous distribution.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.532
In theory, I should
say, the chance

00:21:03.532 --> 00:21:05.240
of something actually
nailing the strike,

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.490
actually being equal to K,
is 0, so it doesn't really

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.750
matter whether you define
this as greater than,

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.530
or greater than or equal to.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.970
But in practice, of course,
finance is in discrete time,

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.884
because you don't quote things
to a million decimal places.

00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:19.300
So certain assets,
actually, which

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.430
are quoted only in eighths
or 16ths or 32nds or 64ths,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:24.931
this matters,
actually, whether it's

00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:27.096
defined as greater than or
greater than or equal to.

00:21:27.096 --> 00:21:29.320
But theoretically, it
doesn't make any difference.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:38.120
OK, so we've got the call
spread tending to the digital.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:46.450
All right, so this tends to--
so the limit of this call

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:52.730
spread-- of this price of the
call spread-- is the digital.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:22:04.880
And so we know that because
this is the price at t.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.670
This is the payout at capital
T. The price of the digital

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.590
must equal just the partial
derivative with respect

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.150
to strike of the call price.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:21.490
So that's just a nice, little
result. Where does this

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.280
bring in probability?

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.520
So this is the next.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.830
OK, so this is where
we'll make one assumption.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.520
And it's actually a very
important and fundamental

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.855
assumption.

00:22:37.855 --> 00:22:39.230
And it's fundamental
because it's

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.080
called The Fundamental
Theorem of Finance,

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.690
or the Fundamental
Theorem of Asset Prices.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.795
So I call this FTAP--
Fundamental Theorem

00:22:51.795 --> 00:22:52.503
of Asset Pricing.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.500
By this theorem, which we
are going to assume here,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:06.530
the intuitive answer is correct,
meaning that prices today

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.290
are expected values.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.580
It's the expectation
of a future payout.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:26.399
So by FTAP, the price
at t is expected payout

00:23:26.399 --> 00:23:31.365
at time capital T,
suitably discounted.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.050
So there's both something
very straightforward here,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.130
and something very deep.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.530
If you think about
how much would

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.700
you pay for a contract
that gives you

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.940
$1 if an event happens-- in
this case, the event being

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.850
stock being greater
than K at maturity.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.620
You would intuitively
think that's related

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.270
to the probability of
the event happening.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.610
How much will you
pay to see the dollar

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:04.660
if a coin comes up heads?

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.820
You'd pay a half, probably.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.480
It's very, very intuitive.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.550
But the deepness
is, this actually

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:20.370
holds under a particular
probability distribution.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.050
I'm not going to
go into that here,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:27.640
but by the fundamental
theorem, this is true.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.602
So I can write, in the
case of the digital,

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:39.680
the digital price
equals the discounted--

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.430
and we'll explain why we want
to put the zero-coupon bond

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.394
price here-- that's the present
value of a dollar at time t.

00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:49.560
It's just a discount factor.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.420
It's very trivial,
but it's written

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.260
in terms of an asset price--
times the expected value

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.400
of the payout.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:11.200
So either you take this as
this makes a lot of sense--

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.030
the discounted expected
payout-- or you can say,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.030
I don't understand this.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.280
I want to find out about the
Fundamental Theorem Asset

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.170
Pricing, which we will
prove in my class.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.440
But this intuitively
makes sense.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.630
The key here is that the
expected value actually

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.480
has to be taken out under
the appropriate distribution,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.320
called the risk-neutral
distribution.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:38.660
But this formula holds--
in fact, strictly.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.730
I'll write this
is just for-- what

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:48.400
holds is the price at
time little t divided

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:55.130
by zero-coupon bond is a
martingale-- for those of you

00:25:55.130 --> 00:26:00.112
into probability theory.

00:26:00.112 --> 00:26:02.070
This gets probabilists
very excited, of course,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.230
because they love martingales.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.490
Everyone in probability
theory loves martingales-- lot

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.770
of theorems about martingales.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:12.740
And you'll see, of course that
this is actually a restatement

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:18.000
of this assertion.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.080
Because Z, capital
T, capital T is 1.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.280
So this statement here
is simply a re-expression

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.640
of this martingale condition.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.917
So I'll just pause here.

00:26:29.917 --> 00:26:31.500
Just from a probability
point of view,

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.833
when I learned probability,
it was under David Williams,

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:36.840
who wrote the book
Probability With Martingales,

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.930
which is a wonderful book.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.679
And I thought martingale
is a great thing.

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:40.810
So I was sort of happy.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:42.470
It took me about
seven or eight years

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.982
of being in finance
to realize there

00:26:43.982 --> 00:26:45.940
are a whole lot of
martingales floating around.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.210
Because this actual
approach-- this formalization

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.930
of asset pricing
really only became

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.770
embraced on the trade floor
around the early 2000's, even

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.650
though the underlying
theory was always there--

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.450
this idea of these martingales.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:06.730
Anyway, so this is--
and this, of course,

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:14.225
is simply-- the expected value
of the indicator function

00:27:14.225 --> 00:27:16.430
is just the probability
of the event.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:17.870
OK.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.810
All right, so now
I've won by intuition.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:26.590
Just here's the probability
of the payout occurring.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.937
I've priced the digital.

00:27:27.937 --> 00:27:29.520
I've also priced the
digital by taking

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.389
the limit of call spreads.

00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:32.930
So now I'm just
going to equate them.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.760
So by equating these two
prices for the digital,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.790
I simply get that the derivative
of the call price with respect

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:57.410
to strike equals the discounted
probability of the stock being

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:02.620
above K. I've just reorganized
a little bit, take 1 minus.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.520
So I get the probability
that-- well, I can clearly

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.320
reorganize again
and get-- all right,

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.420
so if I want to simply get
the cumulative distribution

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.840
function, it's
just 1 minus this.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.930
So divide here, take 1 minus.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.880
OK, so I get the cumulative
distribution function

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:31.000
for the stock price at T is
equal to 1 plus dC by dK times

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.580
1 over Z. I'm just rearranging.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.200
So here now is the cumulative
distribution function.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.440
Clearly, I just need
to differentiate again

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.670
to get the probability
density function.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:49.687
So here's where the
notation gets kind of messy,

00:28:49.687 --> 00:28:51.520
but clearly the probability
density function

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:59.500
of-- f for my random
variable S sub T--

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.452
so the density of-- express that
as-- I always-- probabilists,

00:29:03.452 --> 00:29:04.910
whenever they talk
about densities,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.290
they always want to say f of x.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.010
And it's the same with me.

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:07.600
That's f of x.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.214
Here's the density is
simply just the next,

00:29:10.214 --> 00:29:11.130
the second derivative.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:12.700
We'll take the
derivative of this.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.130
It's the second derivative of
the call price with respect

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:22.570
to strike, evaluated
at little x.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.680
All right, so what
we've done here

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.000
is start off with
simple definition

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.930
of three assets, price to
digital in two different ways.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.720
And now we have a
rather elegant linkage

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.940
between call prices--
C-- and the density

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.790
of the random variable that
is the underlying stock

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:54.960
price at capital T. OK,
so we've established

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:02.050
one side of the duality, which
is given the set of call prices

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:10.720
for all K, I can then
uniquely determine the density

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.303
of the underlying asset.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.490
So you might think, OK,
this is kind of nice.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.430
How does this actually
work in practice?

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.450
Do we actually think in
terms of probability trading?

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.600
We just said that call options
are equivalent to probability

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.140
density functions.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.310
Well, actually,
there's a very neat way

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.810
of accessing this
density function

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.380
through another
portfolio of options.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.650
OK, so this is actually
where we get-- to me

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.220
it's the practical relevance
of some of this theory.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.306
So let me just show you that.

00:30:56.306 --> 00:30:58.180
So we're going to consider
another portfolio.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:06.230
So here we consider
portfolio as follows--

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.120
it's actually going to be the
difference between two call

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.070
spreads.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:20.990
So lambda calls with strike
K minus 1 over lambda.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:31.340
Minus 2 lambda
calls with strike K,

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:38.714
and lambda calls with strike
K plus 1 over lambda-- again,

00:31:38.714 --> 00:31:39.380
lambda positive.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.670
OK, why are we doing this?

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.910
Let's just stop for
a bit of intuition.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:53.180
Here we see in the call spread
the discrete approximation

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:58.032
to the first derivative of call
price with respect to strike.

00:31:58.032 --> 00:31:59.990
So clearly, if I want to
approximate the second

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:04.230
derivative, I'm going to take
the difference between two call

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:05.835
spreads appropriately scaled.

00:32:05.835 --> 00:32:07.960
You're now going to have
to have a little-- there's

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.590
got to be another lambda
coming in here at some point.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.970
This is just the difference
between two call spreads,

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.590
so that's the difference
between two approximations

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.590
of the first derivative.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.215
So I'm going to have to scale by
lambda in order to approximate

00:32:21.215 --> 00:32:22.660
the second derivative.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.070
So this is actually
called a call butterfly.

00:32:32.304 --> 00:32:34.220
And this is a beautiful
thing for two reasons.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.370
One is they actually trade
a lot-- surprisingly.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.965
This is not a contrived
thing I just made up.

00:32:39.965 --> 00:32:42.340
A, it trades a lot, so you
can actually trade this thing.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.320
The second is you
can kind of imagine

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.240
the right scaling of
this call butterfly

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.450
is going to approximate
the second derivative,

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:55.960
and that's approximating
the density function.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.611
So this is a traded object that
will approximate the density

00:33:01.611 --> 00:33:02.110
function.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.194
Yeah, you have a question?

00:33:03.194 --> 00:33:04.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.370
In the real world,
you cannot really--

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.130
the strike distance cannot
really go to infinitely small,

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.745
so they have some [INAUDIBLE]
way how to approximate that?

00:33:12.745 --> 00:33:14.680
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yeah,
so that's a good point.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.860
Yeah, so the question
is how, in practice, we

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.690
can't go infinitely
small, which is true.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.460
But we can go pretty small.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.860
So in interest
rates, we might be

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:31.820
able to trade a
150, 160, 170 call

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.640
butterfly or equivalent--
10 basis points wide.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.350
That's a-- it's a
reasonable approximation

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.330
to the probability of
being in that interval.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.870
So these are all, I mean,
you make a good point.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.950
In fact, all of finance
is discrete, in my view.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:48.010
So continuous-time finance
is done in continuous time

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.600
because the theory
is much more elegant.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.540
But in practice, it's
discrete in time and space.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:59.370
You can only trade finitely
often in a day, and so on.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:01.865
I won't going into the detail,
but you can see the price.

00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:03.240
Let me just write
down the first.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:07.090
The price of this I have just
expressed as the difference

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.550
between two call spreads.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:15.710
So it's lambda times the call
spread from 1 minus lambda

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:30.010
to K, so K, 1 minus lambda
to K, minus the call spread

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.020
from K to K plus 1 over lambda.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.020
OK, so the difference
between two call

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:46.638
spreads-- we'll call this--
this is the butterfly.

00:34:46.638 --> 00:34:48.429
We're just going to
use temporary notation,

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:52.469
call that B, B for butterfly.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.795
So the price B, and
then you get confused.

00:34:54.795 --> 00:34:58.812
It's B centered at
K with width lambda.

00:34:58.812 --> 00:35:00.770
No one ever uses this
notation outside this one

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.300
section of my class,
so that's why,

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.120
but it's just handy for this.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.487
So that is-- the
butterfly price is

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:08.570
equal to the difference
in these two call spreads.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.150
What I want to do
is, I want to take

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.930
limits of this, suitably scaled,
to get the second derivative.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:22.220
And if you just take
lambda times B_K of lambda,

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.810
t, T is indeed,
approximately-- if I

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:31.725
take limits is exactly-- the
second derivative of call

00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:32.225
price.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.630
OK, so here's how I'm
accessing the second derivative

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.911
through a portfolio
of traded options.

00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:42.410
All right?

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.820
And so the price of
this butterfly, B,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.960
if I just reorganize and
substitute-- so I get

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:58.560
B_K-- for large lambda, i.e.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.180
a small interval--
is approximately 1

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:09.950
over lambda times the
density function-- actually,

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:22.130
evaluated at K. So I have
obtained this density function

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.410
by this traded portfolio.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.451
And to your point about we're
not getting infinitely small.

00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:27.450
That's absolutely right.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.366
But if you think about
what the density-- when

00:36:29.366 --> 00:36:33.450
you learn about density
functions for the first time,

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.430
you say the density function
at x times a small interval

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.650
is the probability of being
in that small interval.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.700
All right, so when we
think about the density

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:50.370
function f of x, if you have
a small interval of delta x,

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:54.030
then clearly the probability
of being in this interval

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:59.020
is approximately
f of x, delta x.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.349
In the limit, that is true.

00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:02.140
So what we're showing
here, if you actually

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.237
think about what interval
we're looking at,

00:37:04.237 --> 00:37:06.320
we're actually looking at
in this call butterfly--

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.340
if you were actually
to draw it out,

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:17.430
this call butterfly
looks like that around K.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.060
It actually-- it's
a little triangle.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.434
It's not actually a rectangle,
but it's a little triangle

00:37:21.434 --> 00:37:23.550
of width 2 over lambda.

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:31.490
OK, so it is actually-- this
is the area of this triangle--

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.870
2 over lambda times
1/2 times f of x.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.150
And that's actually this, right?

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:41.700
So this has width 2 over lambda.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.710
OK, so in fact, we've
got here exactly

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.600
an approximate--
exactly approximation,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.780
that doesn't sound right.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.020
But it's entirely analogous
to the approximation

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.110
of the probability of
being a small interval.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:57.640
Here is the probability
of being in this interval

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:04.900
here-- just the area
under that is exactly

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.230
1 over lambda f of x.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.890
So here is actually something
that people do do, is they say,

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:16.380
OK, I will look at the price of
this butterfly, which gives me

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.010
the probability
of this underlying

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:23.270
random variable
ending up around K.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.850
I'll make a judgment whether
I agree with that probability

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:28.620
or not.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.300
And if I think that
probability is higher

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:38.260
than this price implies,
then I'll do a trade.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.030
I'll buy it.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.990
I'll buy that butterfly.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:48.122
So there is actually an
active market in butterflies,

00:38:48.122 --> 00:38:49.580
and so I think an
active trading in

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:54.340
probabilities-- probabilities
of the underlying variable being

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.700
at K at maturity.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.770
So OK, so that's the
first linkage here.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.280
Both-- the density is
the second derivative,

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.080
and the second
derivative is essentially

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.790
a portfolio of traded options.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:15.822
And none of this is dependent
on the actual price of the call

00:39:15.822 --> 00:39:18.231
option, in the sense that
this holds regardless.

00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:20.730
Clearly, this is a function of
the price of the call option,

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:24.660
but I don't need any
model for the option price

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.850
to hold, in order for these
relationships to hold.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.350
So these are model-independent
relationships, clearly.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:39.130
If you were to put the
Black-Scholes formula into C--

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:41.140
Black-Scholes formula
of the call price--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.420
and take the second derivative
with respect to K, which

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.115
would be a mess, you'll end up
with a log-normal distribution.

00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:51.365
Because that's what actually
the Black-Scholes formula

00:39:51.365 --> 00:39:52.823
is, is expected
value of the payout

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:54.320
under a log-normal distribution.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.660
And that will hold.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.226
So this will hold for that.

00:39:57.226 --> 00:39:59.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.184
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yes.

00:40:01.184 --> 00:40:03.184
AUDIENCE: The last
[INAUDIBLE] So left-hand side

00:40:03.184 --> 00:40:06.470
depends on the small t.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.964
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yes, it does.

00:40:07.964 --> 00:40:08.880
AUDIENCE: But the
right-hand side does not.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.900
What's the role of that?

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.941
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yeah,
that's a really good point.

00:40:11.941 --> 00:40:13.250
I've been loose in my notation.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.050
So here what is it?

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.540
It's actually the conditional
distribution of S capital

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.780
T, given S little t.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.510
So this is the
conditional distribution,

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.810
given that we're currently
at time little t with price S

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:29.930
little t for the distribution
at time capital T.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.110
So that's where it comes in.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.110
That's absolutely right.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:37.540
So in fact, this
expected value strictly

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:42.190
should be conditional on S_t.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.300
This probability
is a probability

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:48.070
conditional on S_t-- absolutely.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.610
And in fact, this
martingale condition

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:56.840
is-- the martingales
with respect to S_t.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.782
So that's where the
little t comes in.

00:40:58.782 --> 00:40:59.698
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.730
STEPHEN BLYTHE:
Here, yes, sorry.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:11.740
That's 1 over Z. So it's
just a constant here.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:14.520
This number, especially
because interest rates

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:18.474
are so low in US, so this
number is so close to 1

00:41:18.474 --> 00:41:19.890
that you always
forget about that.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.320
Not when we're trading,
but when you, oh well, this

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.870
is just a-- if you just think
about which one is-- this

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.570
is a quantity that's
in the future.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:34.460
It's call prices, so
that's how you kind of go.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.870
All right, so that's
the first bit.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.890
So when I was an undergraduate,
actually, learning probability,

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.190
one thing I learned
about probability

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.940
was from my probability
lecturer, who said,

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.010
the attention span of
students is no more than about

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.820
40 minutes.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:56.780
So there's no point lecturing
continuously for 40 minutes,

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.110
because people will just start
switching off after 40 minutes.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.125
So rather than wait, just have
a break and waste the time,

00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:04.500
the lecturer said,
I'm just going

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.510
to give you some random
information in the break,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.120
and then we'll go
back to probability.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.014
So I learned that
from 25 years ago.

00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:12.180
I can't remember-- I actually
remember the material.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.450
I can't remember any
of the random material.

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.908
So that's what I
do in my lectures,

00:42:14.908 --> 00:42:17.290
is I break them up, and
talk about something random.

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.680
So I thought I'd do that
here as well, with some--

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.090
not completely random.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.740
So this is somewhat applicable,
this being a math class.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:28.547
So how many of you are math
concentrators or applied math

00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:29.130
concentrators?

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.930
One, two-- a lot, applied
math concentrators--

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:36.424
especially for the applied
math concentrators,

00:42:36.424 --> 00:42:37.840
going straight to
the conclusion--

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.270
your entire syllabus
was generated

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.270
at Cambridge University.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.520
That's the conclusion.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.450
So anyway, here's the story.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:49.670
So back in the 19th century, the
Cambridge Mathematics degree--

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.810
the undergraduate
Mathematics degree--

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:55.430
was the most prestigious
degree in the world.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.130
In fact, it was actually the
first undergraduate degree

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:02.350
with a written examination
was Cambridge Mathematics.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:06.190
So they have a lot to
be responsible for.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.770
And each year,
people took the exam.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:11.640
And they were ranked.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.850
And that ranking was published
in the Times of London--

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.207
so the national newspaper.

00:43:16.207 --> 00:43:18.040
And the people who got
first-class degrees--

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.950
so summa degrees-- in
Cambridge Mathematics

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.920
were called wranglers, and still
are called wranglers, actually.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.545
And the reason they're
called wranglers

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:27.770
was from way back
in the 17th century

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.937
where, before they had
exams-- or 18th century,

00:43:29.937 --> 00:43:32.620
I should say, before they had
exams-- instead of writing down

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.350
exam, you have to
argue, or dispute,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.020
or wrangle with your professor
to get to pass the class.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.800
So that's where
wrangler comes from.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.822
So these people who got
the first-class degree

00:43:42.822 --> 00:43:44.530
are called wranglers,
and they're ranked.

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:46.390
And basically, the
senior wrangler

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.420
was a very famous person in
the UK in the 19th century.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.410
And a lot of them turned
out to be quite successful.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.900
So here are a few wranglers.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:44:01.180
I've just got this one-- I can't
reach that, but [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.400
So some of you might
recognize-- and I just

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.680
want to tell you a quick
story about one of them.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:18.210
OK, so let's start
1841, senior wrangler

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.690
was George Stokes-- so
basic fluid dynamics--

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.094
the whole of fluid dynamics--
that's George Stokes.

00:44:31.216 --> 00:44:32.986
1854, second
wrangler-- this is--

00:44:32.986 --> 00:44:34.110
who was the first wrangler?

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.670
The second wrangler was James
Maxwell, so electrodynamics,

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.195
Maxwell equations.

00:44:39.195 --> 00:44:39.945
He was the second.

00:44:39.945 --> 00:44:44.090
And I can't quite work
out who was the first.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:50.450
1880, the second wrangler was
J.J. Thompson, so electrons,

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:55.190
atomic physics, that comes
out of-- he was only second.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:57.890
1865, senior wrangler
Lord Rayleigh.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.350
So he was the sky is blue.

00:45:03.322 --> 00:45:05.090
He was first.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.570
So they're a pretty good bunch.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.290
So the story--
the best of 1845--

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.920
I'm going back--
the second wrangler

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.971
was Lord Kelvin, so absolute
zero, amongst other things,

00:45:18.971 --> 00:45:19.470
of course.

00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.900
But absolute zero-- he
was second wrangler.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.930
And the great
story about him, he

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.020
was the most talented
mathematician of his--

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.040
of the decade.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.030
And he was such a lock
for senior wrangler

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.755
that-- and I actually
read the biography,

00:45:31.755 --> 00:45:34.390
so this is a sort
of true statement--

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:37.800
that he sent his servant
to the Senate House where

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.680
these things are being read out,
and with a request, "Tell me

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.120
who is second wrangler."

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.720
And the servant came
back, and said, you, sir.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.150
And because he was such a
lock to be first wrangler.

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.370
And in fact, what
happened was a question

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:55.880
on the mathematical
exam was a theorem

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.440
that he had proved two years
before in the Cambridge

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.730
Mathematical Journal.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.570
So his theorem was
set on the exam.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:05.040
Because he had not
memorized it, so he

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.890
had to reprove it,
whereas the person who

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:10.610
became senior wrangler
had memorized the proof,

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:11.860
and was able to regenerate it.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.609
In those days, there
was a lot of cramming

00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:14.850
to be done in these exams.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.250
So the guy who-- Stephen
Parkinson was senior wrangler.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.870
He went on to be
FRS, and eminent.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.350
But he wasn't-- so anyway,
so here's the applied math

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:25.477
syllabus.

00:46:25.477 --> 00:46:27.560
Here's a couple of other
ones which I really like.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:35.090
In 1904, John Maynard
Keynes was at 12th wrangler.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.181
Now, I can tell the
story either way,

00:46:37.181 --> 00:46:39.430
depending on whether I'm in
an audience of economists,

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.804
or an audience of
mathematicians.

00:46:40.804 --> 00:46:43.120
Since I'm in an audience
of mathematicians,

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.500
I like to say the
greatest economist was

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.190
so poor at mathematics, he only
managed to be 12th wrangler.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.770
There are 11 better
mathematicians

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.380
in the UK in that year.

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.587
So he was obviously
not that great.

00:46:54.587 --> 00:46:56.420
If I was talking to
economists, I would say,

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:59.050
this guy is so brilliant that
his main field was economics,

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.540
and yet as part time, he's
able to be the 12th best

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.050
mathematician in the UK.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:11.860
So last one I wanted to talk
about-- 1879-- here's a quiz.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.900
This one you have to
have some answers for.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:21.180
OK, so 1980 something-- I can't
remember what it is-- so here's

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.880
one, here's two, here's three.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.420
I'm going to give
you one and two.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.615
You've got to fill in three.

00:47:27.615 --> 00:47:29.990
You probably aren't going to
be able to get this one yet,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:37.100
but this is-- Andrew Alan,
senior wrangler, George Walker,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:43.090
second wrangler, and number
three is the question.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:56.050
That's the question-- 1980,
Hakeem Olajuwon, Sam Bowie,

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:57.620
question mark--
who's question mark?

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.350
Do we know which sport
these people play?

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.850
AUDIENCE: That one's
Michael Jordan.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.974
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yes, right.

00:48:05.974 --> 00:48:09.490
There we go, that's
Michael Jordan-- exactly.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.000
This question could go on
forever in the UK because they

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.900
don't-- so Michael
Jordan, famously,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.370
was only picked third in the
NBA draft in 1984, was that--

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.497
four or five,
something like that.

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:21.330
So Hakeem Olajuwon was
actually pretty good,

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.780
but Sam Bowie was a total bust.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.290
But he was third.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.700
So in 1879, in the Cambridge
Mathematics Tripos,

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.250
these two people you never heard
of, who were first and second.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.550
And the person who came third,
you've probably heard of him.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.940
This is more of a
statistics thing.

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.974
People know about correlation?

00:48:41.974 --> 00:48:43.890
What's the correlation--
who's the correlation

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.065
coefficient named after?

00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:46.815
AUDIENCE: Pearson.

00:48:46.815 --> 00:48:48.856
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Pearson,
you've got Karl Pearson.

00:48:48.856 --> 00:48:53.584
So Karl Pearson was the
third wrangler in 1879.

00:48:53.584 --> 00:48:55.000
And the founder
of statistics-- he

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.874
founded the first ever
statistics department,

00:48:56.874 --> 00:48:59.140
and obviously
invented correlation

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.786
with Gould-- Gould and Pearson.

00:49:00.786 --> 00:49:02.410
Anyway, he was only
the third wrangler.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.600
And unfortunately, these
people have very common names,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.920
so I have no idea what
they went on to do.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.170
To Google these people
is not very effective.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:16.090
Anyway, so that's the story
of Cambridge Mathematics--

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:18.860
lots of good stuff.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.310
All right, so in
the last half hour,

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:41.160
I just want to go the other
way from-- so the other way--

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.020
we went from option
prices to probability.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.970
Let's go from probability
to option price.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.510
We sort of already
have, actually.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:49.500
This is what the
Fundamental Theorem does.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.770
If we're thinking--
if we take on trust

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:53.230
that the Fundamental
Theorem holds,

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:58.402
namely option prices today are
the discounted expected payout

00:49:58.402 --> 00:49:59.940
at maturity.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.450
OK, let's take that on trust.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.690
Then we're going from
probability distribution

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.231
to option price in
the following way.

00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:08.730
So let's actually state the
Fundamental Theorem, FTAP.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:17.800
OK, so I'm going to go
general derivative D

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.820
is-- D, digital D, derivative.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:35.190
It's-- so derivative
with payout at T.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.950
So this could be
the digital payout.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.241
It could be call option payout.

00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:40.880
It could be one.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:50.190
And price-- OK, so
often, we actually

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.850
think about payout function
as just a simple function

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.870
of the stock price.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:58.765
But this notation is useful
when we think about the price

00:50:58.765 --> 00:51:01.170
as being martingales.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:05.040
Then what is FTAP?

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:13.270
D-- the ratio of the price
to the zero coupon bond

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.000
is equal to-- is a martingale.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.210
In other words,
its expected value

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.880
under the special distribution,
risk-neutral distribution,

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.860
of the payout at maturity.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.680
And to you point, it's
conditional on S_t.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.120
So this is the proper statement.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.460
So this is the Fundamental
Theorem of Asset Prices.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.080
In words, it's
saying this ratio is

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:39.510
a martingale with
respect to the stock

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.980
price under the
risk-neutral distribution.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.670
That's the statement of
the Fundamental Theorem.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:52.600
This is actually rather neat
to prove in the binomial tree,

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.460
two-state world.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.920
It's very, very difficult
to prove in continuous time.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.270
This is Harrison
and Kreps in 1979.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.250
It's the proof that, however
many times you look at it,

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:06.010
you're only probably going to
get through two or three pages

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.390
before thinking,
OK, that's hard.

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.390
But it was done.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:12.160
So this is, you can
imagine continuous time,

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.740
infinite amount of trading,
infinite states of the world.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:18.130
OK, so now this,
of course, is 1.

00:52:21.196 --> 00:52:22.070
And this can come up.

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:23.620
These are known
at time little t.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.270
So if I'm thinking at-- if
I'm at current time little t,

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:30.150
therefore, the
derivative price is

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.490
what we had before--
the expected payout.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.430
OK, so this is rather
a nice expression.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:44.541
And now we can actually just
write down what this is.

00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:50.500
This is the expected value of a
function of a random variable.

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.305
So this is just
the integral of g

00:52:56.305 --> 00:53:03.030
of x, f of x, dx, where
this is the density

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.030
of the random variable
at time capital T,

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:07.630
conditional on being at S_t.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.970
So this is conditional at S_t.

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:14.452
So this is a restatement
of the Fundamental Theorem.

00:53:14.452 --> 00:53:16.410
So this is essentially
the Fundamental Theorem.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:19.080
And this is a
intuition made good,

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.515
or intuition made
real-- expected payouts.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.497
This is sometimes
called LOTUS-- the lure

00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:27.830
of the unconscious statistician.

00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:33.010
Just the expected value of g of
x is integral g of x, f of x.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.890
That's not immediate from the
definition of expected value.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:40.350
You should really work
out the density of g of x.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:44.020
And then integral of x--
the density of g of x dx,

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.780
but it turns out to be this.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.820
So that's a very
nice, nice result.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:54.240
OK, so here is now a way of
going from density to price.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:58.376
If I put in the call
option payout for g,

00:53:58.376 --> 00:54:03.350
and I have the density, I
can then derive the price C.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:09.170
So If you like, the way I go
from density to probability

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:11.600
distribution to option
price is exactly

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.990
the Fundamental Theorem.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:15.682
The route I take is the
Fundamental Theorem.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.880
OK, so FTAP, the Fundamental
Theorem of Asset Pricing,

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.230
means I can going from
the probability density

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:37.930
to the price of a derivative,
for any derivative.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:43.000
All right, OK, so now we
can go either way-- density

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.712
to derivative or call
price to density.

00:54:48.712 --> 00:54:49.920
You might say, hang on a sec.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.560
We've only gone from--
we need the call

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.810
prices to get the density.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:59.480
Well, of course, we can go
via an intermediate step.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.920
So to get from the call price to
an arbitrary derivative price,

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:06.450
I just go via the density.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:14.520
So in particular-- this
is restating-- knowledge

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:26.710
of all the call prices
for all K determines

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.580
this derivative
payout for any g.

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:35.726
So if I know all calls,
I know the density.

00:55:35.726 --> 00:55:37.100
And then if I know
the density, I

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.090
know an arbitrary
derivative price.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:41.040
It's obvious as we stated here.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.095
But what this is saying
is, the call options often

00:55:44.095 --> 00:55:46.890
are introduced as this--
why are they important--

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.620
are the spanning set of
all derivative prices.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:56:02.479
So calls span-- call prices
span all derivative prices.

00:56:02.479 --> 00:56:04.770
And they are a particular
type of derivative-- the ones

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:09.355
that are determined exactly
by their payout at maturity.

00:56:09.355 --> 00:56:11.855
One can imagine other things
that are a function of the path

00:56:11.855 --> 00:56:12.435
or whatever.

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.580
But this is a particular
derivative price.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:19.860
European derivative prices
are determined by calls.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:23.970
OK, so that's kind of nice--
sort of obvious, elegant.

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:28.890
There's two other ways of
looking at this, though.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:42.190
If I think about my function
g-- so consider function g-- OK,

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:47.330
so that determines
my derivative.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.450
So it determines,
defines the derivative

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.760
by its payout at maturity.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.270
Let's just graph it.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:57.190
OK, so it might
look-- let's just

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:59.290
assume first it's
piecewise linear,

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:07.352
so it looks like--
so suppose this is g.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:15.750
Well you can kind of
see I can replicate

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:21.870
this portfolio, or this option,
by a portfolio of calls--

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.410
in fact, a linear
combination of calls.

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:28.040
Right, I have no calls,
but if this is say K_1,

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:37.260
this is K_2, K_3,
K_4, K_5, et cetera.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:41.065
You can see what the
portfolio of calls

00:57:41.065 --> 00:57:43.770
will be in order to replicate
this payout at maturity.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.670
There'll be a certain amount
of calls with strike K_1,

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.750
so that the slope is right,
minus a certain amount of K_2

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.480
to get this slope, plus
a certain about of K_3,

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.370
minus K_4, minus K_5,
plus K_6, et cetera.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:56.880
So, in this case,
if the piecewise

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:13.860
linear g, replicating portfolio
of calls, it's obvious.

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:22.610
So if I can replicate the
payout exactly at maturity,

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:26.830
the price at time little
t of this derivative

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:31.220
must be the price at little t
of the replicating portfolio.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.955
That's actually a-- I'll do
that early on in my class,

00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:39.250
and of the 100 people, everyone
says, OK, that makes sense.

00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:42.879
And someone says, does that
always have to be the case?

00:58:42.879 --> 00:58:44.920
And it's actually a really,
really good question.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.680
Here, I was about to
just hand wave over it.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.530
Is it the case that if I
have one derivative contract

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:57.770
with this payout at maturity,
and I have a linear combination

00:58:57.770 --> 00:59:01.340
of calls with the identical
payout at maturity,

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:05.610
capital T, must these
two portfolios have

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:07.470
the same value at little t?

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:14.424
Well, one would think
so, because they're

00:59:14.424 --> 00:59:15.840
both the same at
maturity, so they

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.006
must both be the same thing.

00:59:17.006 --> 00:59:18.620
They're just
constructed differently.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:20.240
And the assumption
of no arbitrage--

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.150
which underpins everything, in
some sense, what we're doing--

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:27.370
would allow you to say
yes, indeed, that is true.

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:30.860
And in fact, it's actually the
fundamental of finance, right?

00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.030
If two things are worth a
dollar in a year's time,

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:36.409
they're going to be
worth the same today.

00:59:36.409 --> 00:59:37.450
That's what we're saying.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.030
If you can match the portfolio
at t, that is actually

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:44.970
the definition of-- it follows
immediately from no arbitrage.

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:51.230
What has been interesting in
finance, especially since 2008,

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:57.470
is that that-- this
assumption-- has broken down.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:01.060
In other words, I can
hold a portfolio of things

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:05.220
when aggregated have
exactly this payout,

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.840
against an option with
exactly this payout,

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:13.171
and be paid for that.

01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:15.670
And this is actually really--
it's a very fascinating thing,

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:18.630
to think about actually, the
dynamics of financial markets

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.030
when arbitrage can break down.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:23.160
What is the main theme
here is that when

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:29.520
capital T is a long way
in the future-- 10 years,

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.120
20 years-- there's
nothing to stop

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.230
the price of the option and
the replicating portfolio

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.240
going arbitrarily wide,
other than people believing

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.560
that it has to be equal.

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:46.060
The only way you can guarantee
the two things to be equal

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:52.060
is by holding it until capital
T-- for 10 years, 20 years.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.420
In the meantime,
those prices can move.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.000
Empirically, they've been shown
to move away from each other.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.670
So there's actually a deep
economic question here.

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:09.950
So if there is the presence
of arbitrage in the markets,

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.969
then arbitrage can
be arbitrarily big.

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:14.260
Because you're saying there
aren't enough-- there's not

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.230
enough capital, or that's
not enough risk capital,

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:21.200
for people to come in and
say, OK, these two things

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.720
have to be worth the
same in 10 year's time.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.889
Therefore, I'm prepared to buy
one $1 cheaper than the other.

01:01:28.889 --> 01:01:31.180
It's actually a question
really relevant to the Harvard

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:31.679
endowment.

01:01:31.679 --> 01:01:32.910
We're a long-term investor.

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:35.310
You say, why doesn't
the Harvard endowment,

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:38.646
if these two things
are $1 apart,

01:01:38.646 --> 01:01:40.020
buy the things
that's $1 cheaper,

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.976
and just hold them 10
years, make the dollar?

01:01:41.976 --> 01:01:43.490
Well, we'd like
to, but if we think

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:45.260
they're going to be $1 apart,
and they're going to go to $10

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.790
apart, we don't want to
buy them at $1 apart.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.316
We want to buy
them at $10 apart.

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.570
I mean, yes, we're a
long-term investor,

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.357
but we care about our annual
returns, or five-year returns.

01:01:54.357 --> 01:01:55.690
Suppose this is a 20-year trade.

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:58.900
This is very prevalent when
these things are 20 years out.

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:01.630
Anyway, it's a whole-- this
is-- it's a little bit-- it's

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:03.100
a foundational issue.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.600
It's this thing
where it could shake

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.849
the foundational underpinnings
of quantitative finance

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:09.400
if you don't allow this
replicating portfolio to have

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.182
the same price as
the actual option.

01:02:11.182 --> 01:02:13.390
But mathematically, you can
see you can replicate it,

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.200
certainly at capital
T, and therefore

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.280
the price at time little t is
just the linear combination

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.690
of call prices.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:20.830
OK, so let's assume that.

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:23.531
And then obviously,
continuous function

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.030
can be arbitrarily
well approximated

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.750
by piecewise linear function.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:33.270
Therefore, any
function at time--

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:37.300
any function of this
form-- a derivative

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.809
when compared to that
form can be replicated

01:02:40.809 --> 01:02:42.100
by a portfolio of call options.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:45.270
So we can sort of hand
wave to kind of say,

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:50.710
this must be true-- the
calls are a spanning set.

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.690
There's another way to
look at it, which is-- I

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:56.960
just-- like from calculus, where
we can actually make explicit

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.740
what this spanning-- what
this portfolio of calls looks

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.550
like in the arbitrary case.

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.535
So let me just do that.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:12.940
So you can sort of see, there
must be a linear combination

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:15.800
by this for a piecewise linear.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.140
Therefore in the limit,
any continuous function

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.510
must be able to be
replicated by calls.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.720
How many of each?

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:33.860
Well, there's actually a
very, very simple result.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.060
That is as follows--
and, well, let's just

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.040
write down an exact Taylor
series to the second order.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:47.130
So this is-- so for any
function with second derivative,

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:52.659
let's just write down a Taylor
series-- the first two terms.

01:03:52.659 --> 01:03:54.450
And let's put the second
term-- we can just

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:58.740
do an exact
second-order term, so 0

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:08.310
to infinity x minus c plus
g double prime of c dc.

01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:11.560
c is my dummy variable.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.817
Actually, I've gone
to plus notation.

01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:15.025
Here's the max of this and 0.

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:20.470
OK, that's an exact
Taylor series,

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:22.370
true for any-- it's
not an approximation.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.950
That's exact.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.600
You just integrate the
right-hand side by parts

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.950
if you want to verify it.

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:28.210
Maybe it's obvious
to you, but I'm

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.404
so used to just doing
non-exact Taylor series.

01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:31.570
So this is the second order.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:35.190
So this holds for any g exactly.

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:37.720
And now I'm just going to
make one little change, which

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.855
sort of might make obvious
what we're trying to do.

01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:42.230
I'm just going to take this
dummy variable c, which we're

01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:48.500
integrating over from 0 to
infinity, and just call it K.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.694
We can certainly do that.

01:04:50.694 --> 01:04:52.860
All right, this now looks
like the payout of a call.

01:04:56.304 --> 01:04:57.720
It's the payout
of the call price.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.620
Now, I don't want
to be integrating.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.010
Remember, if I want to
actually get the call price,

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.870
I take the expected
value of this.

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:10.970
I integrate x over x with
respect to its density.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:14.670
This is g of a
payout function of x.

01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.607
Here I'm integrating
over K, so I'm

01:05:17.607 --> 01:05:18.940
doing something a bit different.

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:22.470
But this is the
call option payout.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:23.230
So this holds.

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:26.200
It's a linear
equation, obviously.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:30.260
And of course, expectation
is a linear operator.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.165
So I'm just going to take,
well, what are the two steps?

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.790
First of all, I'm
just going to replace

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:42.060
x with my random variable
S sub T. So that I can do.

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:48.850
This also holds.

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.100
And formally, of course, S
sub T is a random variable,

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.516
so it's a function from the
sample space of the real line.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:56.170
But this holds for every
point on the sample space.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:58.310
So I can write
down this equation

01:05:58.310 --> 01:05:59.351
between random variables.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.220
Here it's just the
integral over dK.

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.180
So that holds.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.090
Now I'm going to take
the expectation operator.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:27.470
So take discounted expected
value, of each side.

01:06:32.546 --> 01:06:34.670
So in other words, what is
my operator [INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:41.696
It looks like Z(t, T),
expected value of, given S_t.

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:42.196
All right?

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:48.630
OK, so this one is a
discounted expected value.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.094
That's the price.

01:06:55.470 --> 01:07:01.410
So this becomes price of
the derivative with payout

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:03.567
at maturity g.

01:07:03.567 --> 01:07:04.900
All right, what do we have here?

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.570
Well, first we've
got a constant.

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:17.768
So we've got a constant times--
OK, so that's a constant.

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:27.440
OK, now we've got the
discounted expected stock price.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.020
A little bit of
thought on the terms

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.686
of the Fundamental
Theorem will show you

01:07:30.686 --> 01:07:33.745
that the discounted expected
stock price under this operator

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:35.336
is the current stock price.

01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:40.930
It's actually non-trivial, but
just think of the stock itself

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:43.520
as a derivative,
with the payout S,

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:45.950
and apply the
Fundamental Theorem.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:49.220
This has to be the case,
because a replicating portfolio

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:52.800
of the stock is just a
holding of the stock.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.580
Plus-- and then we
just take the integral.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:05.910
So the expectation inside the
integral-- OK, so now I've got

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:08.455
discounted expected
payout of this.

01:08:08.455 --> 01:08:10.490
And the discounted
expected payout of this

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:21.930
is just the call
price, with strike K.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.689
OK, so I really
like this formula.

01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:28.399
In some sense, there's nothing
too complicated about how

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.250
to derive it.

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:36.250
But it says explicitly now,
how do I replicate an arbitrary

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:40.990
derivative product with payout
g of x or g of S at maturity?

01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.810
Well, it's clear.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:48.399
I replicate it by g(0)
zero-coupon bonds.

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:52.650
So I have g(0) of
zero coupon bonds.

01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:54.170
That's this.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:59.450
I have g prime zero of
stock-- that's this.

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:02.270
And I have this linear
combination of calls.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.779
So there-- this kind
of makes sense, right?

01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:18.870
You want the zero-coupon
bond amount is just

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:21.229
the intercept of g.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.960
The number of stocks is
just the slope of g at 0.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:28.882
And then I have this linear
combination of call prices.

01:09:28.882 --> 01:09:32.490
I've just proved that by
taking this, and taking

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.160
expected values.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:44.399
So this is sort of looking at
the duality of option prices

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.899
and probabilities
in different ways.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:49.160
But then, also how
calls span everything.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.000
So the calls, in some sense,
are the primitive information.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.240
Once I know all
call option prices,

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.890
I know the probability
distribution exactly.

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:03.300
So there are a couple of sort
of interesting further questions

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.600
you might want to pose.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.880
We seem to have
done everything here

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:14.140
with regard to the
distribution at time capital T.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:14.880
And that's true.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.754
I know all the calls.

01:10:15.754 --> 01:10:18.735
I know the distribution
at time capital T.

01:10:18.735 --> 01:10:19.610
I know all the calls.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:24.810
I know the price of any option
with a payout defined solely

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.470
by a function at capital T.

01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:30.590
But I said nothing
about the path that

01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:34.300
takes the stock from
today until capital T.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.170
So I'm just going to leave you
with two things to think about.

01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:41.500
Actually, it's one
thing to think about.

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.920
Two people thought about a lot.

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:54.170
And it's the following
question, which now we'll

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.860
start transitioning into
stochastic calculus,

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.900
and stochastic
processes a little bit.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:03.982
So we know-- let's
just imagine two times.

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:22.190
So suppose we know-- so we
know the set of all call prices

01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:32.190
with maturity T_1, for all
K, and the set of all call

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:41.560
prices with maturity
T_2 for all K.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.810
OK, so then we know
the distribution.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:45.960
Well, there are
two distributions.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.597
We know the distribution
of T_1 given S_t,

01:11:48.597 --> 01:12:00.970
and-- but do we know
the distribution

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:03.930
of the stock at T_2 given T_1?

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:23.250
More of a general point--
suppose I know this for all T.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.800
Let's put T_0 here.

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.365
OK, I know all option prices of
all maturities and all strikes.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:52.990
Can I determine the stochastic
process for S_T over this time?

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:56.920
Is the underlying stochastic
process for the stock price

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.500
fully determined by
knowing all call option

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.250
prices for all strikes
and all maturities?

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.320
The marginal distributions or
the conditional distributions

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.980
for all maturities
are determined,

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:12.416
because we know that here.

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:13.790
Well, you'll
probably see this is

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:16.030
a rephrasing of a
finite-dimensional problem

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:17.802
from probability.

01:13:17.802 --> 01:13:18.510
The answer is no.

01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:26.890
And the reason to
think about is,

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:29.500
if I know all the--
my intuition for this

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:34.000
is if I know all the
distributions that--

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.900
think about just a denser
and denser grid of times

01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:39.400
that I know the distribution
of-- getting closer and closer.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:44.757
I can still allow the stock to
flip instantaneously quickly.

01:13:44.757 --> 01:13:47.090
Imagine they're all essentially
symmetric distributions,

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.048
and they're all roughly
the same expanding out.

01:13:49.048 --> 01:13:54.060
I can imagine the stock
flipping discontinuously

01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:56.220
over an arbitrarily
small time interval.

01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:00.930
So without a constraint on the
continuity of this process,

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.190
or mathematical constraints
on this process,

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:07.870
you can't determine the
actual process for the stock,

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:11.920
even given all the option
prices-- call option prices.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.386
So there are two--
so Emanuel Derman,

01:14:15.386 --> 01:14:20.390
who was at Goldman Sachs,
now at Columbia-- and Bruno

01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:24.530
Dupire-- who's, I think,
still at Bloomberg--

01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:27.360
this is the early '90s--
basically determined

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.665
the conditions that you need.

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:30.680
And the basic conditions
are that just the stock

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.412
has to be a diffusion process.

01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:36.100
If it is a diffusion
process-- the random term is

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.130
Brownian motion-- then it is,
actually, fully determined.

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:41.690
And it's a really
nice, elegant result.

01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:44.360
So this is what gets
mathematically quite

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.740
nice, and a little tricky.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.530
But there's a practical
implication of this,

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:58.770
as well, which is in practice,
I will know a finite subset

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:01.260
of call options.

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:04.510
Those prices will be
available to me in the market.

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:06.750
So they will be given.

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:11.400
So one thing I know
for sure is that even

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.690
with a very densely set
of call option prices,

01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:18.330
there will be some
other derivative prices

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:21.840
whose price is not
exactly determined

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.810
by that set of calls.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.660
Because in particular, I
know that the set of calls

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.050
does not determine the
underlying stochastic process,

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:30.050
even if I knew all of them.

01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:33.140
So that's a very important
thing for traders to understand,

01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:36.690
is that even if I know a lot
of market information-- so I'm

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:39.690
given here are the
prices of a large number

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.060
of European options, European
call options I can trade--

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.940
there may be a complex or
nonstandard derivative product,

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:49.160
whose price is not
determined uniquely, simply

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.680
by knowing those options.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.155
And that is one
of the challenges

01:15:52.155 --> 01:15:55.730
for some of the quant groups.

01:15:55.730 --> 01:16:00.190
So anyway, with that, that
is all I wanted to convey.

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.660
I'm happy to take
some questions.

01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.474
And thank you for your time.

01:16:04.474 --> 01:16:05.473
Thank you for having me.

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:06.952
I appreciate it.

01:16:06.952 --> 01:16:13.854
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:13.854 --> 01:16:16.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have-- I was just

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.950
wondering, so you the call,
or the set of all calls

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.797
basically spans the space of
all possible payouts, right?

01:16:23.797 --> 01:16:24.630
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yes.

01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:26.005
AUDIENCE: So I
was just wondering

01:16:26.005 --> 01:16:30.700
if maybe if we could change,
and select some other such basis

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.457
for spanning it?

01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:34.040
Instead of call,
maybe some other kind

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:39.260
of basic payoff that could
still span the same thing,

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.190
and maybe it's more easily
tradable, or something?

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:44.820
STEPHEN BLYTHE: Yeah, that's
a good-- there must be many,

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:48.060
if I can-- but this,
given that this

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:54.140
is the simplest expansion
of the function g,

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.650
an arbitrary function g,
and the second term comes in

01:16:56.650 --> 01:17:01.300
with this call payout,
gives us this elegance.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.507
Of course, if I know
all the digitals,

01:17:04.507 --> 01:17:06.340
I know the cumulative
distribution function,

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.550
and therefore, I
know the density.

01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:09.050
So I mean, the
digitals do the same.

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.784
And in fact,
Arrow-Debreu securities,

01:17:10.784 --> 01:17:13.200
which is building blocks, which
is something that pays off

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.200
one in a particular
state, sample state,

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.508
also are building blocks.

01:17:18.508 --> 01:17:20.047
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:20.047 --> 01:17:21.630
STEPHEN BLYTHE: I
mean, sometimes, you

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:23.440
could think about an
arbitrary basis that

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:27.160
will span-- an arbitrary
basis of functions that will

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.560
span any continuous function.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.709
And sometimes, you can do it
in any polynomial expansion.

01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:33.500
If I have a price and
any of those payouts,

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.356
and I've got my spanning set.

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:36.730
But this is the
most elegant one.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.464
Yeah, next question there.

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:44.713
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the last [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:44.713 --> 01:17:45.295
mentioned.

01:17:45.295 --> 01:17:50.225
[INAUDIBLE] because
market's incomplete,

01:17:50.225 --> 01:17:54.255
so you can not sort
of use call option

01:17:54.255 --> 01:17:57.412
to replicate the stock itself.

01:17:57.412 --> 01:17:59.120
STEPHEN BLYTHE: You
can use a call option

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.467
to replicate a stock.

01:18:02.467 --> 01:18:03.800
As long as you have zero-coupon.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.580
You can see from here, I can
just reorganize everything here

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.640
to zero-coupon bond
stock, and a set of calls

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.880
will span anything-- with
maturity T. What they're

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.080
sort of saying is, if I
have this strange process

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:21.360
with jumps, and flips,
and discontinuities,

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.320
then the market is incomplete,
I guess is what this is saying.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.860
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah,
so [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.130
is due to the incompleteness.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:28.546
STEPHEN BLYTHE:
Yeah, in the sense

01:18:28.546 --> 01:18:31.700
of most finance-- in fact,
all continuous-time finance

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.660
will assume there's
some diffusion

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:38.540
process for-- some
process for stock,

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.530
which has some Brownian motion.

01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:43.030
There's some function
here, and some

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.070
function for the drift term.

01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:48.890
In that case, then all the
call prices do determine.

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:52.986
If you think there's some
exogenous flipping parameter--

01:18:52.986 --> 01:18:54.110
that's my intuition for it.

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:56.110
So there's some-- that's
why this is incomplete.

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:57.235
So this will not determine.

01:18:57.235 --> 01:18:59.443
So in particular, I could
know all these call prices.

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:01.900
Then I could determine a
particular derivative product.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.680
It could be the
number of times that

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.170
in an arbitrarily
small interval,

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:06.904
the stock flips this many times.

01:19:06.904 --> 01:19:08.820
I mean, there's some--
you can create whatever

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.319
you like for a
derivative that would

01:19:10.319 --> 01:19:11.846
be incomplete for these calls.

01:19:11.846 --> 01:19:14.220
AUDIENCE: So in this case, go
back to a previous question

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:17.200
as we just mentioned-- the
second-order derivative

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.295
of a call option with
respect to a strike

01:19:20.295 --> 01:19:22.510
is [INAUDIBLE]
risk-neutral density.

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:26.555
So in this case, it was not--
that risk-neutral density,

01:19:26.555 --> 01:19:28.630
or a particular
instance of that,

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.089
rather, is not
uniquely determined.

01:19:30.089 --> 01:19:31.921
STEPHEN BLYTHE: No, the
risk-neutral density

01:19:31.921 --> 01:19:32.930
is uniquely determined.

01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:35.670
The stochastic process
for S_t over all time

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:38.220
is not uniquely determined.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:42.530
So this is uniquely determined
by call option prices.

01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:48.814
That is uniquely determined.

01:19:48.814 --> 01:19:50.480
But knowing the
conditional distribution

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:55.760
of S capital T given S
little t doesn't determine

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.064
the process of the stock price.

01:19:57.064 --> 01:19:59.355
To get there-- I can think
of infinitely many processes

01:19:59.355 --> 01:20:03.580
of the stock price that can
give rise to this distribution.

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.824
That's what's not determined.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.540
The terminal distribution
is uniquely determined

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.653
by the call option
prices-- nothing else.

01:20:13.653 --> 01:20:15.920
AUDIENCE: So in this case,
if we take Z over theta,

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:19.401
so we'll get a particular
risk-neutral density

01:20:19.401 --> 01:20:20.590
for each particular stock?

01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:21.881
STEPHEN BLYTHE: That's correct.

01:20:25.465 --> 01:20:26.590
Right, thank you very much.

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.140
Appreciate it.
