PETER CARR: So, I welcome
comments or questions

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.480
at any point during this talk.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.730
We have an hour and a half,
and I have only 50 slides.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.630
So we should be OK.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.000
So, this is joint
work with Jiming Yu,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360
who's a colleague of mine in
my group at Morgan Stanley.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.900
I head up the global
market modeling

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.930
team at Morgan Stanley.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.510
It's a group of about 70
PhDs, mostly, spread around

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.140
the world.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.690
There's about 30
of us in New York,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.540
some in London, quite a few
Budapest, and a few in Beijing.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.370
The title of this talk
is Can We Recover?

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.970
And it's meant as
a triple entendre.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.020
So, it could refer to either
the systemic risk arising

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.740
from the credit crisis, or the
main result in a recent paper

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.880
by a professor here at MIT named
Steve Ross in the Sloan School,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.210
or it could actually be the
academic and practitioner

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.910
reaction to this
result. So, it's really

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.520
about two and three.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.765
So, it's not about can we
recover from the crisis.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.160
There's a professor at Sloan
School named Stephen Ross.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.870
And he's very well-known
in academic finance.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.060
Your professor was kind
enough to mention that I won

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.380
Financial Engineer of the Year.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.510
And that was two years ago.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.140
I was like the 20th winner.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.740
He was the second winner.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.550
The first winner was another
MIT professor, Bob Merton.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.030
So anyway, he wrote a
paper a couple years ago,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.300
and it's only now
about to be published.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360
So this is like typical
in academic circles.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.290
It takes a long time
for a paper to come out.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.440
And this paper is coming
out in Journal of Finance.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.040
That's what JF stands for.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.530
And Journal of Finance
is the main journal

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.060
for the academic
finance community.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.120
And the title of the paper
is The Recovery Theorem.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.480
And that's also the title of
the theorem one in his paper.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.810
And that theorem
one we'll go over.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.360
And it gives a sufficient set
of conditions under which,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.930
what Professor Ross calls
"natural probabilities,"

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.780
at a point in time
can be determined

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.905
from-- OK mathematically,
from exact knowledge

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:03.030
of Arrow-Debreu security
prices, which you probably

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.071
don't know what they are.

00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:06.990
But less mathematically,
we'll just

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.580
say from market
prices of derivatives.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.190
OK, so derivatives
you've heard of,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.770
I'm sure-- things like options,
for example, on stocks or stock

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.340
indices, could be on currencies.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.760
So, imagine that you
look at Bloomberg.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.600
Bloomberg publishes a
whole bunch of prices.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.480
And the idea is that you
take this information,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.290
and from it you're learning
what the market believes

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.610
are the probabilities
concerning the future.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.960
And so, if the option is
on S&amp;P 500 stock index,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.350
then you're learning
from options prices what

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.950
the market believes
are the likelihoods

00:03:49.950 --> 00:04:03.810
of various possible
levels for the S&amp;P 500.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.460
So, we take this information on
Bloomberg and, truth be told,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.710
we use it along with
some assumptions

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.720
to extract these implied
market probabilities.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.510
So, I want to tell you
what those assumptions are.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.160
And so, the actual
output of this analysis

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.390
is a probability
transition matrix.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.500
Or, if you do it
in continuous time,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.550
you'd call it a-- in
continuous state space,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.700
you'd call it a transition
probability density function.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.370
So the key word there
is "transition."

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.940
And what transition
means is you're

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.840
getting not only the
probabilities going

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.830
from, say, the current S&amp;P level
to any one of several levels,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.330
but even the
probabilities of going

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.720
from some other level than
we're presently at today

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.287
to that range of levels.

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:06.870
You could say, for
example, the market

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.320
believes that given
that we're here now

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.700
with S&amp;P at, say, 1,500,
that the probability of more

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.165
than doubling is one
half, for example--

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:23.290
which would be really high.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.070
But you know, I'm just
picking numbers randomly here.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.530
And you can even say that if
S&amp;P were to drop instantaneously

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.240
to half its level, that
the probability of more

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.930
than doubling from there
is, say, one-third.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.125
So, you can answer
questions like that.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.140
That's The output of
this type of thinking.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.320
So there'll be three
probability measures

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.700
that we can be thinking about.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.160
And we'll call them
P, Q, and R. And I'd

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.510
like to tell you what
each of them means.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.600
So P stands for physical
probability measures.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600
So the P is for physical.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.490
And think of that as
the actual objective

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:21.230
reality of future states
for, say, S&amp;P 500.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:28.160
So let's say God knows that,
for example, the probability

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.690
that S&amp;P is up by the end
of the year is one half.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.050
And we, unfortunately, not
being God, don't know that.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.690
But let's say the
philosophy is that.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.790
There is some sort of
true probability of S&amp;P

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.350
being up at the end of the year.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.840
And let's say I used a half.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.960
Maybe it's 60%.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.690
If it is 60%, then
the probability

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.190
of S&amp;P being down at the
end of the year is 40%.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:07.430
And the point is P
is meant to indicate

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.200
the frequencies with which
S&amp;P 500 in my example

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.230
takes on various values.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.730
Now, there's another
probability measure

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.770
that people in derivatives spend
a lot of time working with.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.490
And that's called risk-neutral
probability measure,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.020
and it's often
denoted by a letter Q.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.149
So we'll denote it
by Q. And the concept

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:30.690
of a risk-neutral
probability measure

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.670
was also actually proposed
by Steve Ross many years ago.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:47.540
And it's called risk
neutral because when you're

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:53.720
working with it, if you
think about how fast prices

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.480
appreciate over time,
then they grow randomly.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.330
But on average, under this
risk-neutral measure Q,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.250
the grow at the same rate as
your bank balance would grow.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.150
So your bank balance,
let's say, nowadays

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.100
is growing at best
at the rate of 1%.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:20.760
And when you look at how
fast, historically, stocks

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.060
have grown, it's actually much
higher, on average, than 1%.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.020
It's more like about 9%.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.669
So we would call the
difference between 9% and 1%--

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.559
we call that 8%
differential risk premium.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:42.434
And let me just pretend
there's no dividends

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:46.080
to keep life simple
when I say this.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.470
So now, this
risk-neutral measure

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.744
is kind of a
fictitious probability

00:08:54.744 --> 00:08:56.160
measure in the
sense that it's not

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.890
describing the actual
probabilities or frequencies

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.140
of transitions, it's
more a device, or a tool,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.930
or a trick that's handy.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.800
And one of its properties that
causes it to earn the name

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.770
risk-neutral probability measure
is that when you look at how

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.680
fast, say, S&amp;P grows on
average under this risk-neutral

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.460
probability measure Q, it would
be growing nowadays at 1%--

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.050
so the same as your bank
balance is growing at.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.860
So the word
risk-neutral is meant

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.510
to indicate that the growth
rate under this measure

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:43.920
is consistent with investors in
the economy being risk-neutral,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.500
meaning that they require
no premium for bearing risk.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.910
Now there's a third
probability measure

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.360
that we're going to be talking
about today that actually you

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.860
won't find any literature on.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.150
And we're going to call it R.
It seems like a natural letter

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.280
to pick, having already
gone through P and Q.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.550
And you can think
of the R as standing

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.417
for recovered
probability measure.

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:19.250
And it's going to be
the probability measure

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.710
that we get from market prices
as I was talking about earlier.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:31.690
And the operational
meaning of this R measure

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.110
is it's capturing the market's
beliefs regarding the future.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.530
But we allow for the possibility
that the market could be wrong.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.980
So we're applying this
to say houses and housing

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.180
prices in, say,
2005-- it may well

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.160
be that if we
looked at Bloomberg

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.280
and got prices of
mortgage-backed securities,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.430
that we would extract an
R probability measure that

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.990
says housing prices
are going to continue

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.310
on their incessant
upward trajectory.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.950
And, you know,
we're going to keep

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.520
growing at the rate
of, say, 15% a year

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.450
each year for the next 10
years, or something like that.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:17.650
So, that could be what the
market's beliefs were back

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.390
in 2005.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.520
And we know now that
those beliefs were wrong,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.580
if that was what the
market was inferring.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.150
So, I want to allow for at least
the theoretical possibility

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.290
that the market could be wrong.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.530
And so, that's why I'm
drawing a distinction,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.140
let's say, between the
R probability measure

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.870
that captures the market's
beliefs and the P probability

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.250
measure that captures
physical reality.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.040
So now, there's a lot of people
in finance who simply cannot

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.440
accept the possibility that
the market could be wrong.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.680
And for those people--
the sort of true believers

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.385
in market efficiency--
they are free to set R

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:57.210
to P every time they
see an R. But I want

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.730
to allow for the possibility
that what we recover

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.600
is not physical probabilities,
but simply the market beliefs.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.800
And anyway, it's
kind of semantics.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.250
It's good semantics if the
probability measure we recover

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.350
is the one Ross
said we should get.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.200
R stands for Ross.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.400
So Ross calls the
probability measure

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.530
that we recover-- he calls them
natural probability measures.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.686
And well, let's
say, that suggests

00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.060
that the risk-neutral
probability

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.839
measures are unnatural, which
I think is fair actually.

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:40.630
Because when you hear
the word probability,

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.350
you tend to think
about frequencies

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.112
with which events occur.

00:12:44.112 --> 00:12:45.820
And the risk-neutral
probability measures

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.502
do not give you the frequencies
with which events occur.

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.460
What the risk-neutral
probability measures give

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:57.530
you is instead prices of
so-called Arrow-Debreu

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.810
securities.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.530
So, let me give you a
sense of what that means.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.460
So say I tell you that the
risk-neutral probability of S&amp;P

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.930
500 being up at the
end of the year is 40%.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.280
Then how should
you interpret that?

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.510
Well, you should simply
interpret it as this.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.830
Imagine that you
can agree now to buy

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.190
a security that pays $1
just if S&amp;P 500 is up

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.130
at the end of the year.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.150
And usually when you
and I buy things,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.650
we buy them in a spot market.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.600
So we pay now for things.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.410
But sometimes your
credit is good,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.000
and you can actually
agree now to pay later.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.270
So, we're going to be thinking
that you're agreeing now

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.440
to pay later some
fixed amount in return

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.550
for the security that's going
to pay $1 just if S&amp;P 500 is up

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.030
at the end of the year.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.940
And if I tell you that the
risk-neutral probability of S&amp;P

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:08.190
500 being up by the end
of the year is $0.40,

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.980
what that means financially is
that you agree now to pay $0.40

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.180
at the end of the
year for the security.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.660
So, you can imagine there'd
be another security that

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:33.140
pays $1 just if S&amp;P 500 is
down by the end of the year.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:41.455
And the only possible price
that that security could have

00:14:41.455 --> 00:14:45.740
in an arbitrage-free
world would be $0.60.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.520
Because if you were to
buy both securities,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.330
then you get paid a
total of $0.40 and $0.60.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.270
So you're agreeing now to pay
$1 at the end of the year.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.460
And then having both
securities, either S&amp;P is up,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.930
or S&amp;P is down.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:05.820
And so, you collect $1 from
one of them and not the other.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:13.840
So if, for example, the one
paying if S&amp;P is up cost $0.40,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.585
while the one paying if S&amp;P
is down only cost $0.50,

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:18.960
then there would
be an arbitrage,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.350
which we would buy
both securities,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.650
agree now to pay $0.90.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:25.140
And then get $1 for sure
at the end of the period.

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.230
So we'd be up $0.10 by
the end of the year.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.730
Question--

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.688
AUDIENCE: These are
similar to digital options?

00:15:29.688 --> 00:15:31.080
PETER CARR: Yes.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.439
It's more than similar.

00:15:32.439 --> 00:15:33.480
They are digital options.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:33.980
Yeah.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.477
So, that's right.

00:15:38.477 --> 00:15:40.310
So, that's another term,
which I'll actually

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.880
use on the next slide.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.550
So, that's exactly right.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.860
So, digital options is
just too good a term.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.124
So economists, in order to
obfuscate and look smart,

00:15:49.124 --> 00:15:50.540
call them Arrow-Debreu
securities.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.170
So, continuing with
the obfuscation,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.310
I want to tell you about a world
with a representative agent.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.850
So, economists
are fond of trying

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.450
to formally model the market.

00:16:19.722 --> 00:16:21.450
You read the newspaper.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.360
Every day, you'll read
something like market

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.840
thought that stocks were no
longer a good investment.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.840
So there was a sell-off.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.350
Market is a nice,
short word to capture

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:35.810
what people are thinking.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.760
And so economists, rather
than say the market,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.400
will say there's a world where
the representative agent--

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.930
So this representative agent
is a fictitious investor

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:51.570
who has all the mathematical
properties that we

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.055
give an investor, such
as utility, function,

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:57.190
and an endowment, and so on.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.930
And what makes this
particular investor

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.550
a representative agent is
that this agent sort of

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.680
finds that current
prices are such that it's

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:16.010
optimal to hold exactly what's
available in the amount that

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.569
is available.

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:28.650
So if what's on offer is,
let's say, some Google shares,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.410
and some Apple shares,
and some IBM shares.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:36.070
And if we take the total
market cap of Google,

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.370
total market cap of Apple,
total market cap of IBM,

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.420
and, let's say, Apple's biggest.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.720
I don't actually know whether
Google's bigger or IBM,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.650
but let's say it's
Google, and then IBM.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.674
So let's just say Apple's
biggest, then Google, then IBM.

00:17:53.674 --> 00:17:55.090
Well, this investor
would actually

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.100
find that it's optimal
for him to have

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.292
most of his money in
Apple, second most

00:17:59.292 --> 00:18:01.000
of his money in Google,
third most amount

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.280
of his money in IBM, that's
the representative agent.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.250
So, he's acting in the way
the whole economy is acting.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:19.540
Well, I've been working in
Wall Street now since 1996.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.022
I have yet to hear
a trader tell me

00:18:21.022 --> 00:18:22.230
about a representative agent.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.780
Anyway, so although I
understand what the words mean,

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.840
and even the math, I wanted to
present this material in a way

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.770
that, let's say, at least
quantitative traders

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.450
could understand it.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.420
So I tried to get away
from representative agents

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.830
and present these
ideas in the language

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.670
that at least quants on Wall
Street are familiar with.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.590
So, I won't be talking about
a representative agent,

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:04.320
and I will be talking instead
about something that's probably

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.010
not too familiar to you, but
at least quants have heard of.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.770
And that would be something
called numeraire portfolio.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.670
And it also goes by other names.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.180
Another name is growth
optimal portfolio.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.940
And it even has a
third name, which

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.590
is called natural numeraire.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.530
And these are three
different phrases

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.290
that all describe the
same mathematical object.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:32.050
And this mathematical object
is a portfolio-- and more

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:35.310
precisely, it's the
value of a portfolio

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.430
that has some nice properties.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.010
So the growth optimal
portfolio indicates

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.810
one of its properties.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:48.030
This portfolio has a
very nice property,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.250
which is that in the
long run-- meaning

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:57.590
over an infinite horizon-- the
growth rate of this portfolio

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.430
is, first of all, random.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.020
But second, if you take the
mean of that random growth rate,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.515
that mean is actually
the largest possible

00:20:06.515 --> 00:20:07.390
among all portfolios.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.500
So, starting with Kelly in
1956, this particular portfolio

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.830
with the largest mean growth
rate over an infinite horizon

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.760
receives a lot of attention.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.080
It's actually quite humorous,
some of this attention

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.650
that it's received.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.730
So, Kelly was a physicist
who worked at Bell Labs.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:41.140
And he was actually a colleague
of Shannon's at Bell Labs.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.110
So Shannon did his
seminal work at Bell Labs,

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.700
but actually came
here after that.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:57.390
And his ideas really caught
on-- and especially, I'd say,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.059
started the field of
information science,

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:01.100
we'll call it-- whatever.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.990
But Kelly was applying
these ideas to finance.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.870
And certain financial economists
were less than enthused

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.350
about the application
information of theory

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.820
to finance.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.670
So, in particular, there was a
financial economist here named

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.590
Paul Samuelson who
championed, I guess,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:30.000
the opposition to this
Kelly criterion it's called.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.427
And so, I'll just tell
you a short story.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.260
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.750
PETER CARR: Yeah.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.630
AUDIENCE: If I could
just interject--

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.910
PETER CARR: Yeah, sure.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.105
AUDIENCE: We had mentioned
in an earlier class

00:21:41.105 --> 00:21:42.920
the book Fortune's Formula.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.200
And this book goes into a lot
of background and storytelling

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.980
about this whole
era and exchanges.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:51.980
PETER CARR: That's true.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.440
It's a fantastic book.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.380
I read it.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.827
I loved it.

00:21:55.827 --> 00:21:57.910
Especially if you're at
MIT, you should definitely

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.550
read this book.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.860
It talks about a lot of MIT
professors, some of whom

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.870
are still here, like Bob Merton.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.246
It's a quick, easy read.

00:22:10.246 --> 00:22:12.370
You don't even have to have
a background in finance

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.161
to really enjoy it.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.580
So you can read about
the story I'm going

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.850
to tell you now in that book.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.184
So the story is Samuelson
grew a little tired, I guess,

00:22:25.184 --> 00:22:27.600
with trying to explain to these
dumb information theorists

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.490
that this Kelly criterion
was not so great.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.116
So he published an
article in a journal

00:22:33.116 --> 00:22:34.740
called Journal of
Banking and Finance--

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.940
that's actually a finance
journal-- where he explained

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.930
why it wasn't necessarily
such a good idea

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.080
to hold this portfolio.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.490
And in this article, every word
he used was of one syllable,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.740
except the very last
word of the article,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:59.550
where he managed to say
that he has-- I can't even

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.560
do it in one syllable--
OK, so just ignore

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.790
my multi-syllabic words.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.090
But anyway, he
says, I have managed

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:15.100
to write an article with all
words with just one syllable,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.847
except for this last syllable--
OK, I lost it-- sorry.

00:23:20.847 --> 00:23:22.430
But anyway, the last
word in his thing

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.340
was syllable itself, which is
multi-syllabic-- or whatever.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.950
So anyway, it was
kind of insane.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.300
So, let's move on.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.060
So this talk-- it has six parts.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.740
And we have an hour to go.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.010
So let's say we'll try to
spend 10 minutes on each.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.006
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:48.300
PETER CARR: Yes.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.660
Well, that's a good question.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.080
So, it does have
risk, first of all.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.540
It does have a lot of risk.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.480
It's not the riskiest, though.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:11.090
So some risk does not carry
with it expected return.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.270
And so that's why it's not
the riskiest-- but it's risky.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.310
So Samuelson's objections
were precisely what

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:23.490
you're getting at, that this
is a fairly risky strategy.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.631
So, I'm glad you
brought that up.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.480
OK.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.740
So there's six
parts to the talk.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.698
I'm going to go over what
Arrow-Debreu security

00:24:34.698 --> 00:24:38.100
prices are-- so again, they're
digital options prices--

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.210
and their connection
to market beliefs.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.360
I'll talk about this
Ross recovery theorem.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.960
So in Ross's paper, which
you can get on SSRN,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:54.510
he does everything in a setting
that's called finite state

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.540
Markov chains.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.640
And so that's
mathematically simpler

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.750
than what we use in practice.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.760
And I totally agree that
when you try and introduce

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.360
something, you do it in the
simplest mathematical setting.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.070
So now that he's
done that, I wanted

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.040
to do it in a more
familiar setting, which

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.040
is a diffusion setting.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.104
A diffusion has an uncountably
infinite number of states.

00:25:20.104 --> 00:25:21.520
And I still want
to keep things as

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.090
simple as possible while
going beyond finite state

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:24.760
Markov chains.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.020
So I work in a univariate
diffusion setting.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.770
So there's only one
source of uncertainty,

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.240
which is the same as in Ross.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:37.250
And our technique is
to get these results.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.440
It's based on something
called change of numeraire.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.590
So numeraire is a
technical term, actually,

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:47.160
that describes an asset whose
value is always positive.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:55.540
So there are securities whose
values can have either sign.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.460
So, swaps are a
classical example.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.070
So a swap is a security which
at inception has zero value,

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.990
actually.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.140
And then the moment after
inception, the world changes,

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.570
and the swap value
either becomes positive

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.550
or becomes negative.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.200
So a swap would not
be eligible to be

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.500
a numeraire because
of that property

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.020
that its value is real.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.030
On the other hand,
if you take a stock,

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:28.700
its price is always
positive-- well,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:37.560
that's debatable actually-- so
let's say let's not do stock.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.400
Let's do a treasury bond.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.230
A treasury bond-- US
Treasury bond-- its price

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.910
is always positive.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.100
The reason I want to
shy away from stocks

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.430
is because we take Lehman
Brothers stock, for example.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.770
It's price was positive,
then became zero.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.520
And actually, because
Lehman's price

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.654
became zero, Lehman's share
you could not be a numeraire.

00:27:01.654 --> 00:27:04.070
So when I say that the numeraire
value has to be positive,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.111
I mean strictly positive.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.164
And so anyway, there's
this literature

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:12.580
about how to change
numeraire, how

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.020
to go from one asset
with positive value

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.520
to another asset
with positive value.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.780
And it's useful
for understanding

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.960
how this Ross recovery works.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.910
So, we apply it when we have
a so-called time-homogeneous

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.500
diffusion-- and I'll tell
you what that means--

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.000
over a bounded state space.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.530
So bounded state space
means that the set

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.400
of values that the
diffusion can take

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.090
is in some finite interval.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.730
So if you're thinking about the
uncertainty being, for example,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:53.170
S&amp;P 500, then the natural
lower bound for S&amp;P 500

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:54.950
would be zero.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.090
And you have to accept that
there's a finite upper bound

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.050
in order to apply our results.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.310
Now you know, personally,
I have no problem

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:08.120
saying the S&amp;P 500 is
bounded above by 20 trillion.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.190
OK, but some economists
have actually said

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.280
this is ridiculous.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.540
and challenged my
work, and stuff

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.540
like that for that assumption.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.300
So, because of those challenges.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.890
I have actually been
trying to extend

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.470
our work to an unbounded
state space, where, let's say,

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.210
the largest possible value
for S&amp;P 500 would be infinity.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:37.280
And I've found, actually,
that it's not that easy.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.600
And so sometimes, I can make it
work, and sometimes I cannot.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.740
So, when we get there, I'll
explain some examples that work

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.310
and some examples that don't.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.950
So this last section is kind of
incomplete, this sixth section.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.080
And so, basically, I've
got examples that fail,

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.770
examples that succeed.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.640
But I don't have
a general theory.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.100
So there'll be
different assumptions

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.410
in different parts of the talk.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.529
But within a section,
there's only one set

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:04.570
of assumptions operating,

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.510
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.260
PETER CARR: Yeah.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.417
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the value
of anything is [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:11.417 --> 00:29:12.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:15.004 --> 00:29:16.670
PETER CARR: That's
been my response too.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.462
So the universe is bounded.

00:29:18.462 --> 00:29:19.920
And it's growing,
but it's bounded.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.410
So, I agree.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.100
You know, I'm on
your side on this.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.270
I'm just telling you
what I've been told.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.140
Yeah.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.650
So, I'm working on it anyway,
just so they can shut up.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.770
But, anyway--

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.602
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I have some comments

00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:38.900
on the issue of the numeraire.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.620
You'll tell me
how connected this

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.930
is-- but with the
Kelly criterion, one

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.880
of the origins of that
is if you have a gambling

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.720
opportunity where
it's favorable,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.650
how much of your bankroll
should you bet on that gamble?

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:59.860
And basically, the
Kelly criterion

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.610
tells you what proportion
of your bankroll

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.990
you should invest at all times.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:04.570
You should never bet everything.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.080
And if you do bet everything,
you lose everything,

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.670
and you're done.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:14.630
So, the issue with the
numeraire portfolio and never

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.690
being able to go down
to zero, in the sense

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.680
that you can never go bankrupt.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.530
And so, assumptions of
being able to always

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.850
rebalance your portfolio--

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.820
PETER CARR: So, just
give you a flavor

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:34.600
of what this numeraire
portfolio is--

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.160
you're betting a constant
fraction of your wealth

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.995
in every security.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.220
So let's just keep it simple.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.170
There's only two securities.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.480
One is risky, and
the other's riskless.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.700
And so you might be betting
putting 40% of your wealth

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.410
in the risky one, and 60%
then in the riskless one.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.100
And that's when you start.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.180
So you have $100, and you
put $40 in the risky one,

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.040
and $60 in the riskless one.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:07.440
And then, time moves forward.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.500
And let's say the price
of the risky one changes.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.780
Then when you revalue
using the new price,

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:23.930
it's unlikely that 40% of your
wealth is in the risky one.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.000
So in fact, if the price
went up of the risky one,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.520
you'll have more than 40% of
your wealth in that risky one.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.660
So you need to sell
some of that risky one.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.180
And then the money you get,
you put into the riskless one.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.650
And so, every time
the price changes,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.940
you need to trade,
theoretically, in order

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.940
to maintain a constant fraction
of 40% of your wealth invested

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.010
in this risky asset.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.430
So we assume zero transactions
cost when we do this analysis.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.360
Because there are positive
transactions cost.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.710
One should take
that into account.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.460
And there is literature
on how to do that.

00:32:12.749 --> 00:32:14.790
So, I won't be formally
entertaining transactions

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.610
cost in this talk.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.620
There's work here at MIT,
actually, on doing that.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.810
For the question of
how should you invest,

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.330
it feels like it's a
complication that won't change

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.350
anything qualitative about--
it'd definitely change

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:43.060
how frequently you trade,
but it wouldn't, let's say,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.900
it's unclear how it would
change your initial investment

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.930
across bets.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.860
So, let's begin with part one.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.350
So we have the digital options,
or also called binary options.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.610
That's another term.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:06.610
And they trade, actually, in FX
markets-- so foreign exchange.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:10.540
And they pay one unit
of some currencies,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.587
so say dollar-- If
an event comes true.

00:33:15.587 --> 00:33:17.670
So it might be that you're
looking at dollar/euro.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:22.260
And if by the end of the
year, dollar/euro exceeds 2,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.394
then you get $1.

00:33:23.394 --> 00:33:24.310
Otherwise, you get $0.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.780
So there would be a
price in the FX markets.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.740
And it would be a spot
price typically-- so meaning

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.012
you have to pay now for it.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:46.620
Let's let A, for arrow, be the
price today of such a security.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.970
And the subscripts
on A are j given i.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.450
So, the idea is that you
can think of yourself

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.180
as in a finite-state setting.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.150
There's various
discrete levels of say,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.310
dollar/euro that we have
that can be possible today.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.760
And there's also various
discrete levels for dollar/euro

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.200
by the end of the year.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.989
And i indicates
the state we're in.

00:34:10.989 --> 00:34:14.100
So maybe dollar euro is
$2 per euro right now.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:21.030
And j indicates the
state we can go to.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.989
Maybe we can go to $3 per euro.

00:34:29.315 --> 00:34:34.250
So in my example, A_(3|2) would
be the price of an Arrow-Debreu

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:39.323
security, given that the current
dollar euro exchange rate is $2

00:34:39.323 --> 00:34:45.300
per euro, and it pays $1 just if
dollar/euro transitions from $2

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.130
per euro to $3 per euro.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:04.420
So the idea is we
have discrete states.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.300
And let's say these
are values that

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.390
are possible at the
end of the year.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.710
And the example I just
went through-- you're

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:20.290
getting $1 just if it's $3 per
euro at the end of the year.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.440
So the height of that
vertical line is one.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.360
Now, I'll just
comment that this is

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.510
a slightly exotic option,
in the sense that--

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:40.670
let's call it exotic.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:42.960
It's slightly exotic.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.570
So in contrast with exotics,
there's this term "vanilla."

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.480
OK, and it actually indicates
a flavor of ice cream.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.610
So, we have this
terminology which

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:54.500
you get used to after awhile.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.041
And you can't understand when
you talk to a man on the street

00:35:57.041 --> 00:36:00.100
why they don't understand
what a vanilla option is.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:09.960
So a vanilla option is a
payoff that looks like this--

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.250
so it's a hockey stick payoff.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.580
And that's the payoff
from a call option.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:21.930
And it turns that there is a
portfolio involving options

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.830
at three different
strikes that can perfectly

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:28.830
replicate the payoff to
this Arrow-Debreu security.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:33.900
And so, here is a payoff from
a single option struck at two.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:40.480
And I'll just say that if
I had changed the strike

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.533
to, say, be three, then
it would look like that.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.460
Now, you can combine
options in your portfolio.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.410
So you could, for example,
buy a call struck at two.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:00.570
And then you can furthermore
sell two calls struck at three.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.350
So if you sell, on top of that,
two calls struck at three,

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.710
you end up creating a
portfolio that goes like this.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.960
And so, they can go
negative in value.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:19.240
So if you not only buy
one call struck at two,

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.340
sell two calls struck at
three, but furthermore,

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.040
buy one call struck
at four, then you

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.390
end up with this payoff,
which the payoff is called

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:30.640
a butterfly spread payoff.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.405
Because the picture is meant
to remind you of a butterfly.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:42.970
And notice that if the only
possible values for the FX rate

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.600
were $1 per euro or $2 per
euro, or $3 or $4, or $5,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.110
if that were the world.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:53.650
Then notice that when you
formed that portfolio,

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.150
the only positive payoff
you can get from it

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.970
is $1 just if dollar euros at 3.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.840
You can synthesize a
Arrow-Debreu security

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.880
using a butterfly spread.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.260
So, this was pointed
out many years ago.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.040
So even if the FX
market were, let's say,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.920
not directly giving us the
prices of digital options,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.630
we could from vanilla options
extract the implicit price

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.370
of a digital.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.380
And what you would learn
from vanilla options

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:42.040
is what the market is charging
for the digital, given

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.920
that, let's say, we're
presently at $2 per euro.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.360
And what you would not
learn from these options

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.660
prices is what the
price of the security

00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:00.430
will be should we today
have the exchange rate

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.625
change to some other value.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.890
However, you can
make assumptions

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.970
as have what the
options prices will be

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.145
were today's exchange
rate different.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.745
So, that's commonly
done in practice.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.860
So a common assumption,
for example,

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.980
is that the probability
of transitioning

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:35.090
from two to three-- so moving
up by half-- so you're moving up

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:39.010
by half of two to
three-- is the same

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.160
if you were at any other level.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.000
So for example, if
you were at four,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.636
then the probability
of going to six

00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:48.010
would be whatever
the probability

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.080
is of going from two to three.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.510
Because if you're at four,
the probability of going up

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:56.990
by half of four to six--
that's the assumption.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:59.400
OK, so that's
called sticky delta,

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.720
and it's a common assumption.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.450
So if you make that
assumption, then you

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:08.400
can take the information
at just today's level.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.950
And like, let's say, you know
all the digitals from two,

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:16.480
and you can make
that assumption.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.090
Let's say the probability
of a given percentage change

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.430
is invariant to
the starting level.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:28.452
And then you can,
from that, figure out

00:40:28.452 --> 00:40:30.910
what the probability of going
from four-- a different level

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:33.980
than we're at today-- is to
all these different levels.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.640
So you can go from a
vector bit of information

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.310
that the market is
giving you to a matrix.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.420
And that matrix is
called transition matrix.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:49.020
And so, we're going
to, in this talk,

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.500
assume that somebody's
made such an assumption.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.120
And so, you actually
know this matrix.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.510
So you actually know,
as a starting point,

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.440
what the prices are of these
Arrow-Debreu securities

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.900
or binary options
starting from any level

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:06.960
and going to any level.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:24.800
I think in order to get
through my whole talk,

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.915
I'm going to skip these slides.

00:41:26.915 --> 00:41:28.290
Because they're
kind of like just

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.270
being very precise about
what some terms mean

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.540
that aren't going
to be that important

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.520
for the overall story.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.065
So OK, let's go to this slide.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:47.570
So we think of there being just
a single source of uncertainty

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.680
X, which could be dollar/euro.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:54.550
And we imagine that we have this
matrix of Arrow-Debreu security

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.060
prices.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.580
We know every number
in this matrix.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:04.750
And we ask what does the market
believe about transitions

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.010
from any place to any place?

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.020
What does the market
believe is the frequency

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.110
of these transitions?

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:14.860
Now, suppose that
the number that's

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.260
indicating the price of the
Arrow-Debreu security going

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:24.130
from two to three-- suppose
that number is, say, 0.1.

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.830
Now what does it mean?

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:30.920
It just means that you pay $0.10
today for security paying $1

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.480
just if you go
from two to three.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.280
That's all it means.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.890
Now you can ask what is the
frequency with which you

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:41.190
go from two to three?

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.700
It need not be 10%.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:50.450
There's at least two reasons
why the $0.10 price could differ

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:54.400
from the probability of going
from where you are to where you

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.680
get paid.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:00.030
One such reason is simply
time value of money.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:04.650
So if you were to buy all
these Arrow-Debreu securities,

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.420
the one paying off--
one for every state,

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:13.500
you'll find that the
total cost is less than 1,

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.000
even though the
payoff, for sure,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.652
is one from the portfolio.

00:43:18.652 --> 00:43:20.860
And that's simply because
of the time value of money.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.640
So when you put $1
in the bank today,

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.130
you actually get
more than $1 back

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.960
when you pull out at
the end of the year.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.680
And if you do the
inverse problem--

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.305
how much do you have
to put in the bank

00:43:36.305 --> 00:43:38.880
today in order to have $1
at the end of the year?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.030
It might be $0.95.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.780
So that's called
time value of money.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.740
And so, just the fact
that you have to pay now

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.990
for the Arrow-Debreu security.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:54.160
And you only get paid off
at the end of the year.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:44:03.090
That causes this price
of $0.10 to be lower.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.200
So that's just
discounting for time.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.660
The interest rates are positive.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.070
So that's one effect.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:15.130
Now there's another effect,
which is called risk aversion.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:25.940
So risk aversion is the thought
that even if the interest rate

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.392
was 0, to abstract away from
the effect I just described,

00:44:31.392 --> 00:44:37.780
that it still may be the
case that a $0.10 price paid

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.600
for an Arrow-Debreu security
transitioning from two to three

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.321
is different from the
probability of such

00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:45.320
a transition, the real-world
probability of such

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.260
a transition.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:55.350
Because, for example, it may
be quite desirable to get money

00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:01.420
in that state, in which case
$0.10 is over the real-world

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.500
probability.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.980
Or it could be the opposite that
maybe it's not desirable to get

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.930
money in that state, in
which case $0.10 is under

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.055
the real-world probability.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:23.760
So give you a more
concrete example--

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.860
let's say something that is
maybe a little closer to home

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.920
is-- let's say this
is S&amp;P 500, and I

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.540
know the values are very
different than the numbers I've

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.140
indicated here-- but
let's just forget

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.181
about the actual numbers.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.880
So the point is let's suppose
that it's equally likely,

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.890
in terms of true probabilities,
to go from two to three

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:49.550
as it is to go from two to one.

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.320
So we have two
Arrow-Debreu securities.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:53.240
One struck at one.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.150
The other struck at three.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.840
And I'm telling you
that it's equally likely

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.080
that you go up by one as
it is to go down by one.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.080
Now you can ask the
question does it necessarily

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.140
mean that the prices of
these securities that pay $1

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.260
are the same?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.020
And the answer is
no, not necessarily.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.760
And actually, the sort
of standard thinking

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.880
in financial academic
circles is that for S&amp;P 500,

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:24.680
it would cost more to buy this
Arrow-Debreu security than it

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.360
would cost to buy that
one, even though everyone

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.470
agrees that it's equally likely
to get paid from each of them.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:36.850
And the reason that it's
thought to cost more

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.310
to buy this one
than it is to buy

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:42.110
that one is because this
one has an insurance value.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.520
So the thinking is that on
average, people are long

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.160
the stocks in the stock
market, and that that

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.340
means that they're really
upset when the stocks fall.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.660
And so they really
like this one that

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:59.390
ends up paying should the stock
market fall from two to one,

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:03.320
whereas this one, while
it's nice to get money,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.900
let's say you're already
fairly wealthy from the fact

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.590
that you're owning stocks
and the stock market went up.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.110
So you'll pay a positive
amount for this security,

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:15.240
but not as much as
you pay for this one.

00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:20.490
So that's called risk aversion.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.270
So what we want to do is
go from the prices that

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.660
are contaminated, let's say,
by time value of money effects

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.970
and by risk aversion effects.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.420
And we want to cleanse
them of that contamination

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.130
and try to extract what
the market believes

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.680
are the frequencies
of the future states.

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:47.370
So I'll tell you that this
was thought to be impossible

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.710
before the Ross
paper, and in fact,

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.440
without making assumptions,
it is impossible.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.640
So all Ross did is make
some assumptions that

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.880
are thought to be fairly
mild by some, including me.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.600
And so he essentially,
in essence,

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.330
showed the power of
some assumptions.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.920
That's one way of
thinking about it.

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.440
So again, let's denote by
R the recovered probability

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.030
measure which will
tell us the market

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.910
beliefs about the
frequencies future state.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.060
And we don't know
R when we start.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:31.050
What we do know is these
Arrow-Debreu security prices,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.280
I'm assuming.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.840
And we'll denote
those by A for Arrow.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.717
So what Ross's paper does
is it says, you know A.

00:48:42.717 --> 00:48:45.050
And if you're willing to make
the following assumptions,

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:47.280
then you'll know R. So
what are the assumptions?

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.780
Well, before I tell
you assumptions,

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.240
I have to tell you some
terminology so that you

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.670
understand the assumptions.

00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.660
So he'll work with a pricing
matrix A, which we've actually

00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.800
been going through.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.530
So that's the Arrow-Debreu
security prices

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:05.315
index by starting state
and final state, which

00:49:05.315 --> 00:49:08.500
we'll call x is starting
state, y is final state.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.970
Then there'll be
the desired output

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:14.100
from this analysis, which
he calls natural probability

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.320
transition matrix.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.310
So these are the markets
beliefs for every starting value

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.180
x and for every final value y.

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.180
And then there'll be something
called pricing kernel,

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:28.610
which is literally the ratio
of these Arrow-Debreu security

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:35.140
prices to these output
natural probabilities.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.790
So, if you want to get
an understanding of what

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.290
this pricing kernel
is, you can think of it

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:46.220
as an attempt to
capture the effects

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:50.100
from time value of money
and from risk aversion.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.050
So think of it as
a normalization.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.970
You start with A,
and A is actually

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.170
affected by three things.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:00.940
It's affected by the
unknown real world

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.466
probabilities-- or at least
markets beliefs of them.

00:50:04.466 --> 00:50:06.530
A is also affected
by a second thing,

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.200
which is time value of money.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.300
And A is affected by a third
thing, which is risk aversion.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:15.760
So if we take A and
divide by P, then we're

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.320
normalizing for the first
effect, the frequencies.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.200
And so we're left with
just the combined effect

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.110
from time value of money
and from risk aversion.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:34.870
And so, let's say, if interest
rate were zero and people

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:40.990
were risk neutral, then we would
actually expect A to equal P.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:42.775
And so this ratio
would be just constant.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.630
So Ross talks about a world
with a representative investor.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:51:01.650
And essentially, this is an
assumption-- this equation

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.590
you're seeing here.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:10.070
It's an assumption on
the form that a function

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:11.170
of two variables takes.

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:14.600
So phi, first of all,
is a positive function.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.760
So phi is positive, as opposed
to-- so phi cannot take

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.680
negative values because
both A and P are positive.

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:27.130
And phi is a function of
two variables-- x and y.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.850
And what this assumption
is doing is it's saying,

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.520
well, let's put structure
on this function phi

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.450
because it'll help us to find
it if we put the structure.

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:39.380
So this is the first key
assumption actually--

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:44.210
that the function of two
variables x and y actually

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:47.680
has the form on the right,
which, for a moment,

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.764
just ignore the
delta for a moment.

00:51:49.764 --> 00:51:51.930
And then you can see that
what you have on the right

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.570
if you ignore delta, if
you think of delta as one,

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.840
is you have a function of y.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.000
And then you have the
same function of x.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.489
So it's written in a convoluted
way with this U prime, and c,

00:52:02.489 --> 00:52:03.280
and all that stuff.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.340
But if delta's one, then you
have a fraction whose numerator

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.190
is a function of y
and whose denominator

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.710
is the same function, but of x.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.590
In essence, what that
does is it reduces

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:23.950
the dimensionality of the thing
we're searching for by a lot.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.170
So we started by searching for
a function phi of two variables.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.970
And we, by this assumption,
reduced the search

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:31.840
to a function of
one variable, which

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.030
is, say, the function
in the numerator, which

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.988
is the same as the function
in the denominator.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.170
So, now let's bring back delta.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.460
And delta's a scalar here,
and it's a positive scalar.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.970
And so we need to
search for that as well.

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.080
So in the end, we
reduce the search

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:54.850
to a function of one
variable and a scalar delta.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:59.700
So the economic meaning
of, first of all,

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.550
the function of
one variable is--

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.930
it's called marginal utility.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:07.410
And it's meant to indicate
how much happiness you

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:11.210
get from each additional
unit of consumption.

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:14.250
So it's the typical--
what we think

00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:22.420
it looks like as a function of
c-- U prime as a function of c

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.180
is thought to typically
look like that.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.760
So it's positive, meaning
every unit of consumption

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.840
makes you happy.

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.750
And it's actually
declining, meaning

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.366
the first unit of consumption
makes you real happy.

00:53:34.366 --> 00:53:35.740
Then the next unit
of consumption

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.310
still brings some happiness,
but not as much, and so on.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.870
So that's the kind of
function we're looking for.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.990
U prime as a function of c.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:50.520
He won't actually find U
prime as a function of c.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:56.840
He'll find the composition of
U prime with a function c of y.

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.030
Keep that in mind.

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:06.710
Then, there's that delta.

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.260
And that's, again,
a positive scalar.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.540
And it's meant to capture
time value of money.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:21.497
And so, that's like the y is the
state at the end of the period.

00:54:21.497 --> 00:54:23.580
And x is the state at the
beginning of the period.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.230
And so, that's why delta's
associated with the numerator,

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.790
not the denominator.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.020
So delta would be
a number like 0.9.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:35.340
And that indicates how
much discount you give to,

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.890
let's say happiness received
in the future, rather than now.

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:50.380
Now, here's a quote from Ross's
paper that is his Theorem 1.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.150
That's called the
recovery theorem.

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:56.480
And the only thing is
I changed the letters

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.840
to conform with the
letters I'm using,

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.224
rather than the ones he used.

00:55:00.224 --> 00:55:01.890
And that's because
his choice of letters

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:06.520
is completely unnatural
to me and most people.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.440
So I don't even want to
tell you what he used.

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.980
So anyway, whereas I tried to
choose letters that make sense.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.160
So I used A for Debreu--

00:55:20.381 --> 00:55:21.880
So anyway, he says,
you have a world

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:23.046
with a representative agent.

00:55:23.046 --> 00:55:28.630
So that's actually
this restriction

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.130
that we talked about
on the last slide.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:34.750
And then he says, if the
pricing matrix-- which

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.980
is the Arrow-Debreu security
prices-- is positive--

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.640
which means that
all entries in it

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.020
are strictly above
zero-- or irreducible--

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.060
which means that some
entries have zeros,

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.700
with the rest being
positive, and there's

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.990
some structure, which we
need not get into where

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:56.840
the zeros are-- then there
exists a unique solution

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:01.880
of the problem of finding
P, which P is actually

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.750
market beliefs.

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:05.630
And I've been
calling that R often.

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:08.160
So anyway, I slipped a
bit there and called it P.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.950
So anyway, that's market
beliefs about the frequencies

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.170
of future states.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.600
He'll also get as
an output the delta,

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.590
which is the positive scalar
telling you the market's time

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:20.380
value of money.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.010
And finally, this
pricing kernel phi,

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:35.397
which is the ratio
of A to P. So,

00:56:35.397 --> 00:56:37.980
what you're supposed to realize,
even though he didn't say it,

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:42.107
is that as a result-- well, OK.

00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:43.190
So he did say it actually.

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.230
You're finding P. I think
that's the main thing.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:54.440
He's actually saying, if
you make these assumptions,

00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:03.370
surprisingly, there's only one
possible real world or market

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.909
beliefs that are
consistent with the data

00:57:06.909 --> 00:57:07.950
and the assumptions made.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.240
To give you a sense of what
the importance of this result

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.260
is-- so prior to
his paper-- I mean,

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.300
people have been
interested in trying

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:25.560
to infer from market prices
what the market believes.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:27.860
But they always
thought that you had

00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:34.300
to supply some parameters that
capture market risk aversion.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.100
So for example,
common approach is

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.520
to assume that you have a
representative investor.

00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:42.210
And that they have
a particular type

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:45.420
of utility function called
constant relative risk

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.280
aversion.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.375
And there's a parameter
in that utility function.

00:57:48.375 --> 00:57:50.750
And you had to specify the
numerical value that parameter

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:57.800
takes before you could learn the
market's beliefs from prices.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.130
And no one ever felt
very comfortable

00:58:00.130 --> 00:58:02.270
specifying that parameter.

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:10.300
So what Ross essentially did
is he managed to essentially do

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:15.080
the identification
non-parametrically, where

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.330
you don't have to
supply any parameters.

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:25.040
And so you essentially just
have to buy his assumptions.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:31.480
You don't have to do any work to
actually go from market prices

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:33.070
to market's beliefs.

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:42.160
OK, so let's skip these remarks.

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:45.290
Yeah.

00:58:45.290 --> 00:58:49.170
AUDIENCE: Can you
elaborate on the fact

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.460
that risk aversion
does enter in?

00:58:55.032 --> 00:58:55.740
PETER CARR: Yeah.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:57.350
So the exact
statement is you don't

00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:02.440
have to supply a
parameter that describes

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.910
the amount of the
market's risk aversion.

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:11.060
Rather you have to
accept this assumption--

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.030
and I'll show you--
this assumption

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:16.230
about the structure of phi.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:21.200
OK, so if you just accept that
this function of two variables

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:26.220
doesn't have the full
amount of degrees of freedom

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.670
that an arbitrary function
two variables has,

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.140
it has a reduced
number of degrees

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.880
of freedom implicit on
the right-hand side.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:38.140
So remembering
that x is actually

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.730
just a vector of finite
length and so is y,

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.460
then think of the left-hand side
as having degrees of freedom n

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.400
squared.

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.310
And on the right-hand
side, you're

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:54.070
looking for the numerator
function is just

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:56.060
a vector of length n.

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.600
And the denominator function
is the same function, so

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.570
the same vector.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.140
And then there's
also this delta.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.330
So let's say on
the left-hand side,

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.450
you're describing something
that without restriction is

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:10.880
of order n squared.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.410
So let's say n is 10, so it
has 100 degrees of freedom.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.890
And on the right-hand
side, you're

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:20.140
describing a vector of length
10 along with a scalar--

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.800
so 11 degrees of freedom.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.370
So you have to
accept that you're

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:26.890
willing to before you
place any restriction,

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:28.290
it's 100 degrees of freedom.

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.540
Now you make your restriction.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.040
It's 11.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.540
You have to accept that.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:39.255
And if you do, then he'll
tell you the 11 entries.

01:00:39.255 --> 01:00:39.780
That's it.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.321
So you don't have
to supply anything.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.310
So I haven't told you
how we'll find them.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.672
That's probably what you're
asking-- how the hell

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:47.590
will you get to 11?

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:48.960
OK, so I haven't shown you that.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.460
Yes?

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:52.750
AUDIENCE: Just really
quickly, the c change

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.200
as a function of
time and spot price?

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.880
PETER CARR: c is not
a function of time,

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.710
to answer your question.

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:08.910
And then, the argument
of c could be a price.

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:11.150
It's allowed to be a price.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.710
OK?

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:16.620
So, that's how you
should think of it.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.670
So there's a lot of time
homogeneity in everything

01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:20.540
he does here.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.000
So he'll never let anything
depend on time, actually,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.030
to answer your question.

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:36.930
So, I still haven't
shown you how he did it.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.320
He uses Perron-Frobenius
theorem.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.710
I don't actually have
slides on how you actually

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.990
calculate the 11 entries.

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:49.960
So I think I just have to
refer you to the paper.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.860
But he relies on
something called

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.250
Perron-Frobenius theorem.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:02:00.010
And I'm going to show
you how we-- my co-author

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:08.040
and I-- actually
calculate the analog

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.750
of that 11-dimensional unknown.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.670
So we're going to work in
a continuous setting, where

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:19.520
instead of looking for
a vector and a scalar,

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.080
we're going to look for
a function, and a scalar,

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.970
and a function of one variable.

01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:31.120
So you'll get a sense of
how to do it from ours.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.130
And essentially, if you
discretize what we do,

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:34.088
you'll get what he did.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.220
Let's forget these remarks,
and let's forget these.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:45.410
And so now, we'll
get into some theory

01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:46.910
about changing numeraire.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:53.095
So this is a backdrop to how
my co-author and I proceed.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.720
So again, a numeraire is
a portfolio whose value

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.790
is always strictly positive.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:08.986
And there is a
well-developed theory

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:11.360
in derivatives pricing about
how to change the numeraire.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.500
We're going to use that theory
to understand what Ross did.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.590
So we start with an economy
with a so-called money market

01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:25.620
account.

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.650
And so that's a
theoretical construct

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:34.900
that's pretty familiar to most
of us, and it's a bank account.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.160
So we're going to be working
now in continuous time.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.830
So imagine that time, which is
continuous, is on this axis.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:43.710
And then we're
sitting here today,

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.580
and we put some
money into the bank.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.160
And being poor,
we only put $1 in.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:55.400
So then we ask, looking forward,
how will this money in our bank

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.660
change?

01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:01.680
Well, they do still pay
a positive interest rate,

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.030
and it's awfully small,
but it's positive.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:05.920
And so it'll go up.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.680
And they change
the rate actually.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:12.290
So now, maybe it's 0.5%,
but next week, Chase

01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:15.980
might decide to give you 1%, in
which case it goes up faster.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.940
And then they might the
week after give you 2%,

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.705
it goes up faster.

01:04:18.705 --> 01:04:20.530
Then they might go back to 0.5%.

01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:24.150
So that's one possible path
for your money market account

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.060
balance.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:27.950
And we don't know the future.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:30.811
We know how much we're getting
over this first little bit

01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:31.310
of time.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:33.510
But they could
actually decide to pay

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:37.051
less over the second period,
and then the third, or something

01:04:37.051 --> 01:04:37.550
like that.

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:40.899
OK, so it's increasing
and it's random.

01:04:40.899 --> 01:04:42.690
So that's the money
market account balance.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:48.660
It's considered as an
increasing, random process.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.835
And actually, there's
nothing in the math that

01:04:50.835 --> 01:04:55.260
requires it to be increasing
if some really cheap bank--

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.480
like Bank of America
tried this actually--

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.100
charge a negative rate.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.164
Then it would actually go
down with a negative rate.

01:05:03.164 --> 01:05:04.330
But it wouldn't go negative.

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:06.280
So it's still counts
as a numeraire.

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.760
So anyway, that's
allowed, as an aside.

01:05:14.439 --> 01:05:16.230
OK, so we've got this
money market account.

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:23.610
So the growth rate is called
r, and that's just real-valued.

01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:25.480
And then we also
have risky asset.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.060
So we'll have a total
of n risky assets.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.690
And then we're
going to say there's

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:35.985
no arbitrage between the n risky
assets and the one money market

01:05:35.985 --> 01:05:36.485
account.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:46.030
The idea is that we look
at Bloomberg's prices

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.570
for these n plus 1 assets,
we're able to extract

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.670
the Arrow-Debreu
security prices.

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:52.390
That's the idea.

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:59.960
What I'm assuming is that
what we're extracting

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.330
is consistent with the idea
that the uncertainty that's

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:07.070
driving everything here
is a diffusion, meaning

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:15.620
that the uncertainty has sample
paths that are continuous,

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.300
but they're allowed
to be fairly jagged.

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.520
So diffusions actually
have continuous but

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.820
non-differentiable sample paths.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.600
And we're going to assume that.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.930
So this is a common assumption.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:32.130
This basically got
its start here at MIT.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:37.750
And diffusions were first
used in a finance context

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.090
back in 1965 when both
Samuelson and McKean were here.

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:43.640
So McKean is a probabilist.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:47.940
He's now at NYU where I
teach, and he's still active.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.680
And diffusions are widely used.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.380
So they really got
a big boost in 1973

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.897
when Black-Scholes and
Merton, who were all here,

01:06:58.897 --> 01:07:01.480
used the diffusion to describe
the price of a stock underlying

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.570
an option.

01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:06.440
And since then, they've
just been used extensively

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.580
in finance.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.440
So Merton, who's
here, really, I'd say,

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.730
pioneered the use
of them in finance.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.210
So there's this
uncertainty X is probably

01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:37.300
mysterious to you,
hence the name X.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.180
So it's like, you
get to choose what

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.380
it is, is kind of the idea.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.400
So this is theory.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.990
And it's not trying to be
overly specific so that you can

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:50.310
apply it in different contexts.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:52.920
But you'd like to know at
least some examples, I'm sure.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.940
So one example would be X
is the level of S&amp;P 500.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:02.470
A different example would be X
is actually an interest rate.

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:05.650
So let's say the
benchmark 30 year yield.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.710
X could instead be a
shorter-term interest rate,

01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:18.200
something called OIS--
overnight index swap-- is

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.540
a possible choice for x.

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:25.120
When I apply Ross's
stuff, that's

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:28.340
how I choose X, as a
short-term interest rate.

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:36.350
In general, let's say I
developed a theory that

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.410
says the short-rate
of some function of X.

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.300
And when I actually
apply it, the function

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.200
is the identity map.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:56.520
The mathematics says that
if there's no arbitrage,

01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.063
then there exists-- as
we're assuming-- then

01:09:00.063 --> 01:09:02.229
there exists this so-called
risk-neutral probability

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:06.890
measure that I talked about
earlier and denoted by Q.

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:09.600
It's related but not equal
to the Arrow-Debreu security

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.439
prices.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:14.700
So if you were to just
imagine that instead

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.620
of buying these Arrow-Debreu
security prices in a spot

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.350
market, if you instead bought
them in a forward market

01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:23.050
where you actually
pay when they mature,

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:27.310
then those Arrow-Debreu security
prices in the forward market

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:31.609
would be Q. So Q and
A are really close.

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:36.392
So the measure A need
not integrate to one,

01:09:36.392 --> 01:09:38.350
and that's just due to
the time value of money,

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:39.935
and that's because you're
paying in the spot market.

01:09:39.935 --> 01:09:41.590
If you're actually paying
in the forward market,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:43.881
then you don't have to worry
about time value of money.

01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:46.422
And so then, the measure
Q does integrate to one.

01:09:46.422 --> 01:09:48.380
So that's why we call it
a probability measure.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.570
Under this
probability measure Q,

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:59.290
the expected return on all
assets is the risk-free rate.

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:02.910
So that's what that actually
says, although you're probably

01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:05.350
not seeing that this is
literally the expected

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:08.340
return-- well more precisely,
it's expected price change.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.810
So the expected
price change is--

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.462
what that means is
expected price change is

01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:13.920
the risk-free rate
times the price.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:16.510
That's what that says.

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:18.550
So if you divide both
sides by the spot price

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.290
when it's positive, then
you'll get the expected return

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.170
is equal to risk-free rate.

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.280
And we're doing things
in continuous time here.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.960
So we're working
with diffusions.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.420
And you may or may not
have been introduced

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.260
to diffusions at this stage
in your mathematical career.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.590
But mathematically, one
way to describe diffusion

01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:39.500
is via the
infinitesimal generator.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.750
So this is a
differential operator

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:46.620
that's first order in time,
second order in space.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.090
And let's just say this is
formally how mathematicians

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:53.250
think about this type of thing.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:56.370
What I've drawn here is a
single sample path of diffusion.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.830
There's definitely possibility
of other sample paths.

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:00.788
These actually are an
infinite number of paths.

01:11:00.788 --> 01:11:04.760
But they're all continuous
and nowhere differentiable.

01:11:22.454 --> 01:11:24.120
I want to just kind
of give you a flavor

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:27.350
of how you change numeraires.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.850
So we started with the
numeraire being the money

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:31.530
market account-- this guy.

01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:33.289
And the idea is
we're going to switch

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.330
to a different numeraire.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.790
What we're mainly
interested in figuring out

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:58.960
is what are the drifts of assets
when we measure their values

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.530
in a different numeraire.

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:04.480
So I've kind of given you a
sense of what this is about.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:11.250
So you could hold IBM, and
every time you get a gain,

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.790
you could put that gain in
your local bank-- Chase--

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:18.660
and see how fast your
bank balance grows

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:23.130
as you're putting all your
gains in IBM in the bank.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:28.630
And you'll get a certain
growth rate from that strategy.

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:30.980
Now, you could try a
different strategy where

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.670
you take your gains from IBM.

01:12:32.670 --> 01:12:36.600
And you actually ship them off
over to a British bank, which

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.000
is denominated in
pounds, and see how fast

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.960
that bank balance grows.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.160
And there's no reason that
the two bank balances--

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.800
the American one and
the British one--

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.580
need to grow at the same rate.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:51.940
Because they're denominated
in different currencies.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.410
So we're basically
interested to know,

01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:57.540
given that we know
how fast, let's say,

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.830
the American bank
balance would grow,

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:01.940
we want to know how
fast the British bank

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.380
balance would grow.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:07.130
And what affects the growth
rate of the British bank balance

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:09.770
is the covariance,
actually, between

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:15.450
the dollar/pound
exchange rate and IBM.

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.510
So remember, we're
investing in IBM

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:20.030
and we're putting gains
in either an American bank

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:22.340
or a British bank.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.550
So IBM stock prices in dollars.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:28.110
And so there's no issues
with putting IBM's gains

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:30.400
in an American bank.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.960
But there's actually
a subtle effect

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.490
that happens when you put IBM's
gains in a British bank, which

01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:37.830
the subtle effect is there's
this random exchange rate

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:39.240
dollars per pound.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.730
And suppose that there's some
correlation, for whatever

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:49.440
reason, between dollars
per pound and IBM.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.450
So suppose the correlation's
the following form--

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:54.780
every time IBM
goes up, the dollar

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.540
gets weaker against the pound.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.800
So in other words, what happens
is IBM goes up, you go hooray,

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.910
I'm rich.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:04.370
I got all these dollars.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:07.660
I'm going to go put them
in a British bank account.

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:16.280
But suppose, unluckily for
you, every time IBM goes up,

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.180
the dollar weakens
against the pound.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:25.500
And so, you cannot buy so
many pounds as a result.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:28.780
So contrast that with the
opposite situation where

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.170
when IBM goes up, the dollar
strengthens as opposed

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:32.310
to weakens.

01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:35.220
Then you can buy lots and lots
of pounds with your IBM gains.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:40.600
So the correlation between
the dollar pound exchange

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.510
rate and IBM affects how
fast your British bank

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:45.980
balance would grow.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.950
And that's actually
like the key point.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.840
So this would be
well-known to anybody--

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.090
especially an FX client.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:12.000
So what we're
actually going to do

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.550
is find a numeraire
such that the growth

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:21.080
rate of the balance
in that numeraire

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.030
is actually the real-world
drift of the underlying.

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:30.200
So the idea is let's
say that I told you

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.660
at the beginning of this
talk that historically stocks

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:34.340
grow at 9% on average.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.900
Our starting point here
in this part of the talk

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:45.680
is that we're starting from this
risk-neutral measure Q, which,

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.220
by definition, is the property
that stocks would grow only

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:49.720
at 1%.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:54.390
So what we're
actually going to do

01:15:54.390 --> 01:16:00.980
is go find some numeraire
which will be correlated

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:08.890
with the stocks, such
that when we put our stock

01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:13.590
gains in that numeraire,
we end up growing at 9%,

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:14.215
rather than 1%.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:25.060
That's the way we
think about things.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.136
And the key is to find
that numeraire that

01:16:28.136 --> 01:16:28.885
has that property.

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.450
I'm going to go
fast now-- there's

01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:40.130
a paper by John Long where he
shows that that numeraire that

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:45.130
converts a risk-free growth rate
into the real-world growth rate

01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:46.390
always exists.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.890
And he gave it a name, and he
called it numeraire portfolio.

01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:51.250
It has another name--
growth optimal portfolio--

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:52.670
that Kelly was talking about.

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:06.670
So there's a reference if you're
interested in following up

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:09.280
on this material.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.434
So the theory says
that there always

01:17:17.434 --> 01:17:19.100
exists this numeraire
called John Long's

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.170
numeraire portfolio,
such that if you park

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:25.530
your gains in this
numeraire, you end up growing

01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:27.210
at the real-world drift.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:31.180
And so, let's say
all we got to do

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.460
to find that real-world drift is
go find this special numeraire.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:43.140
So this part of the talk is
about making some assumptions

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.340
that lead to an identification
of that particular numeraire--

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.260
John Long's numeraire.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.180
We're going to continue
to work with diffusions.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:03.090
And now we're going to also
impose time homogeneity

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:04.610
like Ross was doing.

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:07.500
So let's say when I was just
talking about numeraire,

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.400
I was allowing
time inhomogeneity.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.160
But now we're going to
go time homogeneous.

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.430
I haven't really been
introducing the notation,

01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:19.760
but a(x, t) is the diffusion
coefficient of the state

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.940
variable x.

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.330
And now it's just being assumed
to be a function of x only.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:27.180
So b^Q(x, t) was the
drift coefficient of x.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:29.570
And now it's a
function of x only.

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:32.820
r(x, t) was the function
linking the short interest rate

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.030
to the state variable x.

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:36.310
And now, it's a
function of x only.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:40.025
And finally, sigma_L(x, t)
was the volatility of John

01:18:40.025 --> 01:18:41.195
Long's numeraire portfolio.

01:18:41.195 --> 01:18:42.820
And again, that's a
function of x only.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.330
So anyway, another
assumption that we're

01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:51.110
going to impose now in order
to determine uniquely what

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.460
this numeraire
portfolio value is

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:57.850
is to require that the diffusion
that's driving everything

01:18:57.850 --> 01:18:59.510
live in a bounded interval.

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:04.140
So essentially, the
sample paths all

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.600
have to be bounded below
by some constant, which

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.240
could be negative,
and have to be

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.170
bounded above by some constant,
which again could be negative.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.010
We make all those
assumptions, and we move on.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:23.140
And so in the end, what
have we been assuming?

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:27.029
So we're assuming that there's a
single source of uncertainty X.

01:19:27.029 --> 01:19:28.820
And that it's a
time-homogeneous diffusion.

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.950
So that's this
middle equation here.

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:34.790
And so that says changes in
X have a predictable part,

01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:36.680
which is b^Q(X) dt.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.300
And they have an unpredictable
part, which is a of X dW.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.530
So W there is standard
Brownian motion.

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.950
And since I'm big
on mnemonics, you

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:49.950
might ask why does W stand
for standard Brownian motion?

01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:52.080
And that's because
W actually stands

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.572
for Wiener process--
Norbert Wiener being an MIT

01:19:54.572 --> 01:19:55.155
mathematician.

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:03.920
And the W is a standard
notation for this kind of thing.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.360
As an aside, when Bob Merton was
here working out all this stuff

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.190
for the first time
in the late '60s,

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:16.650
he knew the standard notation
for standard Brownian motion

01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:18.920
was W. But it turns
out in finance,

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:22.380
the standard notation
for wealth is also W.

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.460
And he wanted to work on
stochastic wealth dynamics.

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.200
And so he had to choose should
I use the letter W for wealth,

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.790
or should I use the letter
W for Wiener process?

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:33.090
And he chose W for
wealth, which meant

01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:35.730
he had to pick a different
letter for Wiener process.

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:40.000
And so he actually
chose the letter Z.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.017
And you'll have to
ask him why he chose

01:20:42.017 --> 01:20:44.600
that letter, because it doesn't
stand for anything as far as I

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:48.290
know, except that actually
the sample paths of a Wiener

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.770
process look very jagged,
so if you turn your head,

01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:59.570
you might be able to see a Z.

01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:01.860
So another assumption
is that we're

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.590
going to restrict the possible
dynamics of the numeraire

01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:06.140
portfolio's value.

01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.910
So we're going to let
L denote the value

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:10.140
of this numeraire portfolio.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.910
And the mnemonic here
is that John Long

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:17.030
invented this concept, so
we're calling it L for Long.

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:19.380
Now it's unfortunate that
the inventor of this concept

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:20.540
was named Long, actually.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:24.310
Because in finance, the
word "long" indicates

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:30.935
that for a security with
a non-negative payoff,

01:21:30.935 --> 01:21:32.310
if you're long,
then you're going

01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:33.604
to be receiving that payoff.

01:21:33.604 --> 01:21:36.020
As you pay money now, you're
going to receive that payoff.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.650
It's the opposite
of short, where

01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.750
if you're short a security
with a non-negative payoff,

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:43.060
then actually you get
money now and you have

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:47.000
to deliver that payoff later.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.620
So as it happens, this
numeraire portfolio

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.010
has multiple positions in it.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.510
And the signs of
the positions are

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:59.190
allowed to be real-- so
positives and negatives.

01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:02.140
So it's kind of a misnomer.

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.592
I say Long's
numeraire portfolio,

01:22:03.592 --> 01:22:05.300
and everyone thinks
the positions in them

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:06.136
are all positive.

01:22:06.136 --> 01:22:07.760
It's not true-- so
they're real-valued.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.810
The kind of problem
here is that we've

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:18.460
put the structure on
the value L, John Long's

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:32.690
numeraire portfolio, namely
that L is a continuous process,

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:37.452
but it's not quite a
diffusion in itself.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:41.550
The only thing you can say
is that the pair X and L

01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:44.179
are a bivariate diffusion.

01:22:44.179 --> 01:22:45.720
If you bring this
L over to the side,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:50.160
you can see the coefficients
for dL depend on L and X--

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:53.230
and same thing with
the volatility part.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:56.770
So anyway, we place
the structure.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:23:02.290
And the idea is that we know,
from looking at Bloomberg,

01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:06.950
what the risk-neutral drift
of X is-- that's b^Q(X).

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:08.160
We know that function.

01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.150
We know what the diffusion
coefficient of X is.

01:23:10.150 --> 01:23:11.830
That's the function A of X.

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:14.250
We know what the
risk-neutral drift of L

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.820
is-- that's that
function r of X.

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:20.387
But we don't know the
volatility of John Long's

01:23:20.387 --> 01:23:21.220
numeraire portfolio.

01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.540
That's the function
sigma_L of X.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:27.740
And if only we could find
it, we would actually

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:32.520
know how to determine
the real-world drift.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.810
And remember I was saying
if IBM and you could

01:23:38.810 --> 01:23:43.320
put an American bank
account, and let's say there

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.660
was certain growth rate there.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.660
And then if instead you
were putting those gains

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.320
in a British bank account,
you'd achieve a different growth

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.220
rate.

01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:58.070
And I was stressing that the
correlation of dollar/pound

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:01.310
with IBM was important for
determining that growth rate.

01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:03.370
And I stand by that.

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.070
When you're in a
one-factor world,

01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:07.280
that correlation
can only be one.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.290
And so that's what's
happening here.

01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:12.500
We're in a one-factor world,
and that correlation is one.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:18.550
And the other thing that
affects the growth rate, though,

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:21.340
of your British
bank account balance

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.710
is actually the volatility
of the exchange rate.

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:27.060
So what actually matters
is the covariance

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.940
between the British
exchange rate and IBM.

01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:33.260
That covariance depends
on both the correlation

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:39.415
and the volatility
of the FX rate.

01:24:39.415 --> 01:24:41.540
So you can think of the FX
rate as here John Long's

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.820
numeraire portfolio.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.546
And so that sigma_L
is sort of the key.

01:24:46.546 --> 01:24:48.920
It's like we've set things up
so we know the correlation,

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.840
but we still don't
know the covariance.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.340
And that's what's
actually relevant.

01:24:53.340 --> 01:24:54.940
So as soon as we
get the sigma_L,

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.023
we'll know the covariance.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.000
So we'll be in shape.

01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:05.279
So we got to find that
volatility function sigma_L.

01:25:05.279 --> 01:25:06.945
And now I know many
of you have classes,

01:25:06.945 --> 01:25:08.790
so I'm going to have
to start moving.

01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:11.840
AUDIENCE: Now, Peter,
people will have access

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.563
to these slides afterwards.

01:25:13.563 --> 01:25:16.477
And so, I'm just seeing you've
got another 15 slides left.

01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:18.060
PETER CARR: Yes,
well actually, you'll

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.185
be glad to know that five
of those are disclaimers.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.970
If I could move along--

01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:27.020
AUDIENCE: But the
point is to what--

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:28.870
PETER CARR: The key
is towards the end.

01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:30.100
Yes, absolutely.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:30.810
We're very close.

01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:31.310
OK.

01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:34.160
So I'll be done in two minutes.

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.155
So basically,
where we are now is

01:25:36.155 --> 01:25:37.780
we're going to make
one more assumption

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.821
that the value of John
Long's numeraire portfolio

01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:41.929
is a function of X and
D. OK then, let's say

01:25:41.929 --> 01:25:43.220
we've made all our assumptions.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:46.310
And where it goes is
that the assumptions

01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:49.310
imply that this
value function splits

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:51.300
into an unknown
positive function of x,

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:53.500
and an unknown positive
function of time.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.990
And when you kind
of further analyze,

01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:00.150
you find that the
unknown function of time

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:02.000
is an exponential
function of time.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.050
And the unknown function of x
solves an ordinary differential

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:11.000
equation of this kind.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.510
So this is called a
Sturm-Liouville problem.

01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:16.415
And it turns out that
Sturm and Liouville

01:26:16.415 --> 01:26:18.915
were the only mathematicians
I've mentioned in this talk who

01:26:18.915 --> 01:26:20.150
were not at MIT.

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:24.300
And they actually
solved this problem.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.400
And one of the
things they show is

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.170
that when you're searching
for functions pi and scalars

01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:34.320
lambda that solve
this problem, there's

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.580
only one solution that delivers
you a positive function pi.

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.240
And so this is how
you get uniqueness.

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:47.690
Remember I was
saying back with 11--

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:50.680
so we're searching for like
a 10-vector and a scalar.

01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.340
Now the 10 vector is a function.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:56.320
And that function is pi,
and the scalar's lambda.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.072
So the point is is
that the math implies

01:26:58.072 --> 01:26:59.780
there's a unique
solution to the problem.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:02.640
So we learn the volatility
of the numeraire portfolio

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.240
in the end.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.690
And then we learn the
drifts of everything

01:27:05.690 --> 01:27:08.280
you want to know under
the market's beliefs.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.230
So that's the gist of it.

01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:13.720
So then there's been
work on trying to extend

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.210
to unbounded intervals.

01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.750
And basically, in the
famous Black-Scholes model,

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:24.010
this effort fails, whereas
in the less famous but still

01:27:24.010 --> 01:27:28.000
important Cox-Ingersoll-Ross
model, this effort succeeds.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.270
So the sort of
punchline is that when

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:36.040
it comes to unbounded state
space, the theory's open.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.090
So if there's a grad
student in the room who

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:40.660
wants a good dissertation
problem, this is it.

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.160
OK.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.410
So that's all I
wanted to say today.

01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:44.960
Thanks.
