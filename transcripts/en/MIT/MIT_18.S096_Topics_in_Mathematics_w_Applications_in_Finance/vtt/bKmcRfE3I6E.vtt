00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.620
PROFESSOR: Our last class
Yi is running from his home

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.390
in New Jersey due to snow.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650
So he couldn't fly in.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.270
But actually, now
I'm learning a lot.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.980
It's a good way to run
the classes going forward.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.270
I think.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.030
We may employ it next year.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.650
So Yi will present CV
modeling for about an hour.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.850
And then Jake, Peter and myself,
we will do concluding remarks.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.730
We will be happy to answer
any questions on the projects

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.915
or any questions whatsoever.

00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:11.420
All Right?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.690
So Yi, please.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.060
Thank you.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.550
YI TANG: OK.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.590
I'm here.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.070
Hi everyone.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.300
Sorry I couldn't make it in
person because of the snow.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.160
And I'm happy to
have this opportunity

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.230
to discuss with you
guys counterparty credit

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.240
risks as a part of our
enterprise-level derivatives

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.000
modeling.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.970
I run a Cross Asset Modeling
Group at Morgan Stanley.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.940
And hopefully you
will see why it's

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.350
called Cross Asset Modeling.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.190
OK, counterparty credit
risk exists mainly

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.600
in OTC derivatives.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.580
We have an OTC derivative trade.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.350
Sometimes you owe your
counterparty money.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.850
Sometimes your counterparty
owes you money.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.090
If your counterparty owes you
money, on the payment date,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.630
your counterparty
may actually default,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440
and therefore, either
will not pay you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.150
the full amount it owes you.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.270
The default event includes
bankruptcy, failure to pay

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.520
and a few other events.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.310
So obviously, we
have a default risk.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.810
If our counterparty
defaults, we would

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.320
lose part of our receivable.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.580
However, the question is before
the counterparty defaults,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.970
do have any other risks?

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.800
Imagine you have a case where
your counterparty will pay you

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.920
in 10 years.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.010
So he doesn't need
to pay you anything.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.240
Then the question
is are you concerned

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.440
about counterparty risks or not?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.330
Well, the question is yes,
as many of you probably know,

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.550
it's the mark-to-market
risk due to the likelihood

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.450
of a counterparty
future default.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.190
It is like the
counterparty spike widens,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.700
even though you do not need a
payment from you counterparty.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.580
If you were to sell,
a derivative trade

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.120
to someone, then someone may
actually worry about that.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.380
So therefore the
mark-to-market will

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.270
become lower if the
counterparty is spread wider.

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:53.410
This is similar to a corporate
bond in terms of economics.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.140
You own a bond on the
coupon payments date,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.820
or on the principal date,
the counterparty can default.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.800
Of course, they can
default in between also.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.620
But in terms of
terminology, this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.310
is not called counterparty risk.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.080
This is called issue risk.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.579
So here comes the important
concept credit valuation

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.370
adjustment.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.270
As we know the
counterparty is a risk.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.000
Whenever there's a risk, we
could put a price on that risk.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.590
Credit valuation
adjustment, CVA,

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.690
essentially is the price of
a counterparty credit risk.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.940
Mainly mark-to-market
risks, of course,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.820
include default risk too.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.100
It is an adjustment to the
price of mark-to-market

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.830
from a counterparty-default-free
model, the broker quote.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.490
So people know,
there's a broker quote.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.990
The broker doesn't know
the counterparty risk.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.760
A lot of our trade models do
not know the counterparty risk

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.050
either, mainly because
of we're holding it back,

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.200
which I will talk
about in a minute.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.980
Therefore, there is
a need to actually

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.640
have a separate
price of CVA to be

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.680
added to the price
for mark-to-market

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.070
from counterparty
default free model

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.220
to get a true economic price.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.340
In contrast, in terms of
a bond, typically there's

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.520
no need for CVA because it is
priced in the market already.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.370
And CVA not only has important
mark-to-market implications,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.880
it is also a part of
our Basel III capital.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.840
Not only change your valuation,
but could impact your return

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.930
on capital.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.070
Because of a CVA risk,
the capital requirements

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.530
typically is higher.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.750
So you may have a bigger
denominator in this return RE,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.170
return on capital
or return on equity.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.120
CVA risk, as you may know, has
been a very important risk,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.860
especially since
the crisis in 2008.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.790
During the crisis, a significant
financial loss actually

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.270
is coming from CVA loss,
meaning mark-to-market loss

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.060
due to counterparties'
future default.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.600
And this loss turned
out to be actually

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.700
higher than the
actual default loss

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.600
than the actual
counterparty default.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.120
Again, coming back
to our question,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.720
how do we think in terms
of pricing a derivatives

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:14.330
and price the CVA together
with the derivatives.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.950
First of all, it adds
some portfolio effect

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.460
the counterparty can
trade multiple trades.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.540
And the default
loss or default risk

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.330
can be different depending
on the portfolio.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.790
And when people use a
trade-level derivatives model,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.150
which is by default what people
would call a derivatives model,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.690
typically you price each
trade, price one trade at time.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.380
And then you aggregate the
mark-to-market together

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.550
to get a portfolio valuation.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.720
So when you price
one trade, you do not

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.360
need to know there may
be another trade facing

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.700
the same counterparty.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.450
But for CVA or counterparty
risk, this is not true.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.250
We'll go over some
examples soon.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.690
This is the one
application of what

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.390
I call enterprise-level
derivatives,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.100
essentially focusing on
modeling the non-linear effects,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.815
non-linear risks in a
derivatives portfolio.

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:19.735
Here's a couple of examples.

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:24.120
Hopefully, it will help you
guys to gain some intuition

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.310
on the counterparty
risks and CVA.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.440
Suppose you have an OTC
derivatives trade, for instance

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.820
like an IR swap.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.130
It could be a
portfolio of trades.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.870
Let's make it simple.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.530
Let's assume the trade
PV was 0 on day one.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.890
Of course, we assume
we don't know anything

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.090
about the counterparty
credit risk.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.140
We don't know
anything about CVA.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.260
This is just to show how
CVA is recognized by people.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.340
So to start with
again, the trade PV

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:10.640
was 0 on day one, which is
true for a lot of co-op trades.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:18.020
And then the trade PV became
$100 million dollars later on.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.440
And then your counterparty
defaults with 50% recovery.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.755
And you'll get paid
$50 million of cash.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.350
OK, so $100 million
times 50% recovery.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.150
If the counterparty
doesn't default,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.100
you eventually would
get $100 million.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:47.720
Now he defaults, you get
half of it, $50 million.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.600
The question is have you
made $50 million dollars

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.320
or have you lost $50 million
over the life of the trade.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.740
Anyone have any ideas?

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.820
Can people raise your
hand if you think

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.170
you have made $50 million?

00:10:13.114 --> 00:10:14.900
Can I see the
people in the class?

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.270
I couldn't see anyone.

00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:22.440
PROFESSOR: How do I raise this?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.240
YI TANG: OK, no one thinks
you made the $50 million.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.250
So I guess then,
did you all think

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.805
you have lost $50 million?

00:10:32.354 --> 00:10:34.020
Can people raise their
hand if you think

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.440
you have lost $50 million?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.930
OK, I see people.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.430
Some people did not
raise your hand.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.440
That means you are
thinking you are flat?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:51.440
Or maybe you want to
save your opinion later?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.620
OK, so this is a common
question I normally

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.020
ask in my presentation.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.270
And I typically get two answers.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.770
Some people think
they've made $50 million.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.390
Some people think
they've lost $50 million.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:15.610
And there was one case, someone
said OK, you know they're flat.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.990
Now, this would look like
a new interesting situation

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.260
where no one thinks
you made $50 million.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:30.550
I mean, come on, you have $50
million of cash in the door.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.480
And they don't think you
have made $50 million.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.500
You have a $0 from day one.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.750
Now, you have $50 million.

00:11:41.433 --> 00:11:43.830
OK?

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.640
All right, anyway
so for those of you

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.806
who think you have lost
money-- I don't know if it's

00:11:48.806 --> 00:11:53.440
a good idea [? Ronny-- ?]
can someone tell us why do

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.740
you think you lost $50 million?

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.810
You went from 0 to
positive $50 million.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.720
Why do you think you
lost $50 million?

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.165
Are we equipped to allow
people to answer questions?

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
if someone presses a button

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.840
in front of them.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.556
YI TANG: OK, so people choose
not to voice your opinion?

00:12:25.556 --> 00:12:28.210
AUDIENCE: It is because
you have to pay to swap

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.060
and you have to pay
$100 million to someone

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.850
on the other side of trade?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.100
YI TANG: OK, very good.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.520
So essentially, you
are saying hedging.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.380
That was what you
are trying to get to?

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.810
So you have a swap
as 0 and you have

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.326
an offsetting swap as a hedge.

00:12:45.326 --> 00:12:47.269
Is that what you
are trying to say?

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.810
AUDIENCE: No.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.780
I'm saying that if you're
the intermediary for a swap,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.990
then you have to pay $100
million on the other end.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.715
So if you're receiving 50 and
paying 100, you have a loss.

00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:57.590
YI TANG: That's good.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.930
Right, so intermediary is right.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.060
And that's similar to
a hedge situation also.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.340
So that's correct.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.060
That's the basically
the reason for a dealer.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.330
Essentially, we are
required to hedge.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.640
We're very tight on the limit.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.740
We actually would
lose $50 million

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.770
maybe on the hedge fund.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.910
When our trade went from 0
to a positive $100 million,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.760
our hedge would have gone from
to 0 to negative $100 million.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:38.650
In fact, we receive only half
of what we need to receive.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.390
And yet, we have to pay
the full amount that we

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.860
need to pay on the hedge side.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.900
Essentially, we
lost $50 million.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.590
But that's where the CVA
and CV trading, CV risk

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.430
management would come in.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.460
Again, CVA is the price of
a counterparty credit risk.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.420
And you know, if you hedge,
the underlying trader

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.500
or whoever trades swap, if
you hedge with the CV desk.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.130
Theoretically, you
will be made whole

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:18.043
on a counterparty default. So
you would receive $50 million

00:14:18.043 --> 00:14:20.750
from counterparty,
and theoretically you

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.110
receive $50 million
from the CV's desk

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.314
if you hedge with CV desk.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:34.050
Now, the second part is
how do we quantify CVA.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.038
How much is the CVA?

00:14:37.038 --> 00:14:39.320
CV on the receivable,
which we typically

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.100
charge to the
counterparty, essentially

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.740
is given by this formula.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.010
MPE means mean
positive exposure,

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.150
meaning only our receivable
sides when the counterparty

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.660
owes us money, and times
the counterparty CDS par

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.480
spread, times duration.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.880
The wider the spread
the more likely

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.200
the counterparty will
default, the more we

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.290
need to charge on the CVA.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.870
And the same thing is
true for the duration.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.790
The longer the
duration of trade is,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.490
there's more time
for the counterparty

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.480
to default so we charge more.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.800
Very importantly,
there's a negative sign.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.890
Because CVA on the receivable
side, is our liability.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.890
It's what we charge
our counterparty.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.230
And there are some
theoretical articles,

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.350
they don't include
the sign, that's

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.720
OK for theoretical purposes.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.810
But practically, if
you miss the sign

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.333
things will get very confusing.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.095
Now, here is more
accurate formula for CVA.

00:15:49.095 --> 00:15:53.670
You know how the MPE
side, on the asset side.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.320
So we can see to start
with, there's an indicator

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.040
function where this capital T is
the final maturity of the trade

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.260
or counterparty portfolio.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:11.160
This tau is the counterparty's
default time, first default

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.170
time.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:21.540
And if the tau is greater
than this capital T,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.490
essentially that means
a default happens

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:26.940
after the counterparty
portfolio matures.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.690
And therefore, we don't
have counterparty risk.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.660
So that's what this
indicator is about.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.670
If the counterparty defaults
before the maturity,

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:41.100
that's when we will have
counterparty credit risk.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:48.410
And there's a future evaluation
of the counterparty portfolio

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.680
right before the
counterparty default.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:55.710
And this is how much collateral
we hold against this portfolio.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.200
So the net receivable,
the net amount,

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.849
where the future value is
greater than the collateral,

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:10.770
is our sort of
exposure, how much

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.780
the counterparty would owe us.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.540
And this 1 minus R essentially
is the discount rate.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.880
So 1 minus R times the
exposure essentially

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.790
is the future loss
given default.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.170
And beta essentially is a
normal mock money market

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.700
account for defaulting,
and this is the expectation

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.440
in the risk-neutral measure.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.835
It looks simple.

00:17:38.835 --> 00:17:44.220
But if you get to the details,
it's actually very complex

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.595
maybe because the
portfolio effect

00:17:46.595 --> 00:17:50.030
and this option-like payoff.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:53.470
If you recognize this
positive sign here,

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.740
essentially you recognize
this is like options.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:05.034
And so again, here is about some
details of non-linear portfolio

00:18:05.034 --> 00:18:06.690
effects.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.940
First of all, we talk
about offsetting trades.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.155
In the previous example,
you have one trade

00:18:15.155 --> 00:18:17.410
and went from 0 to $100 million.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.560
Counterparty defaults, you get
paid $50 million, essentially,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.670
you lost $50 million.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.850
But what if you have
another trade facing

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.200
the same counterparty?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.080
Well, that's offsetting.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.490
When the first trade went
from 0 to $100 million,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.620
the offsetting trade can go
from 0 to negative $100 million.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.560
And therefore if the
counterparty were to default,

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.230
you're going to have
a 0 default loss.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.740
That's just one example
of portfolio effects

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.450
because I'm offsetting trades.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.370
So therefore, in
order to price CVA,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.970
you've got to know all
the trades you have

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.860
facing the same counterparty.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.630
This is very different
from a trade-level model

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.460
where you only need to
know one trade at a time.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.840
There's also
asymmetry of handling

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:16.350
of the receivable, meaning
assets versus the payable,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.360
meaning liabilities.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:27.100
And that's where the
option-like payoff comes about.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.810
Typically, roughly
speaking, if we

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.290
have a receivable
from our counterparty,

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.900
if the counterparty
were to default we're

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.680
going to receive
a fraction of it.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.100
So we would incur default loss.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.880
However, if we have a
payable to our counterparty,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.165
if the counterparty
were to default,

00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:56.250
we more or less need
to pay the full amount.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.930
We don't have a
default gain, per se.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:04.140
So this asymmetry is the reason
for this option-like payoff

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.290
we just saw previously.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.530
And as you know,
a counterparty can

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:14.850
trade many derivative
instruments

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.340
across many assets, such as
interest rate, FX, credit,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.040
equities, a lot of
time also commodities

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.110
and sometimes also mortgage.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:30.330
And then my group is
responsible for the modeling

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:34.775
of the underlying
exposure for CVA

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:38.280
for capital as well
as for liquidity,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.960
because multiple
assets are involved

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.950
and we need to
model cross assets.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.980
So therefore, we named our
group Cross Asset Modeling.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.300
Furthermore, it is not only we
have option-like payoff, which

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.840
is non-linear, we have
an option essentially

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:02.710
on a basket of a cross
asset derivative trades.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:08.980
And the modeling becomes
even more difficult.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:23.120
So that's when the
enterprise-level will come in.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.970
And the enterprise-level
model, which

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.260
we'll touch upon
even more later on,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:34.450
will need to leverage
trade-level derivative models,

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.090
and therefore, will
need to do a lot

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.850
of martingale-related
stuff, martingale testing,

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:45.040
resampling, interpolation.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.320
So here's a little bit more
information on the CVA.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.900
We have talked about
assets or MPE CVA,

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.360
essentially for our
assets or receivable.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.940
In this formula, we
have discussed already

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.610
the first one.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:10.380
There is also, theoretically,
a liability CVA.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:17.070
Essentially, it is the CV
on the payable side, when

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:27.930
the bank or when us having
a likelihood of default.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.300
And this is a benefit
for us, all right.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.402
So the formula is
fairly symmetric, as you

00:22:35.402 --> 00:22:40.170
can recognize, except the
default time or default

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:45.550
event is not for the
counterparty but for us.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.490
OK?

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:52.000
And then the positive sign
here became negative sign,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.817
essential to indicate this is
a payable negative liability

00:22:56.817 --> 00:22:57.317
to us.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.440
This is an interesting
discussion first to default.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.300
We talked about how if the
counterparty were to default,

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:19.120
we more or less pay the
counterparty full amount.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.230
So argument can be used
on the receivable side.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:30.480
So if we have a receivable, and
if we were to default first,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.670
roughly speaking
the counterparty

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:37.830
would pay us close
to the full amount.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.575
And there, some people start
to think about OK, when

00:23:40.575 --> 00:23:44.740
we price CVA, we've got to
know, among counterparty

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.800
and ourselves, which
one is first to default.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.920
But my argument is that we
do not need to consider that.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.960
And I have some
reference for you guys

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:03.320
to take a look if you are
interested in this topic,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.220
but I'm not going to
spend much time because we

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.715
have lots to go over.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.950
Now, here's another example.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:19.090
You have a trade, same
as the previous trade.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.440
The trade PV was 0 on
day one, and the trade PV

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.100
becomes $100 million later on.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.526
This time of course
the counterparty risk

00:24:31.526 --> 00:24:34.992
are properly hedged.

00:24:34.992 --> 00:24:40.410
Then the question is do
you have any other risks.

00:24:45.503 --> 00:24:49.340
Does anyone want to try to tell
us do you see any other risks?

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.480
There are actually
several categories of risk

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.580
we will have.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.610
I wonder if anyone
would like to try

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.420
to share with us your opinion.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.370
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.730
Yes?

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.257
AUDIENCE: Some form
of interest rate risk.

00:25:23.257 --> 00:25:24.840
YI TANG: Interest
rate risk, OK, fine.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.340
OK fine, this is a market risk.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.570
Yes, you're right there
is interest rate risk,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.260
but I did mention here that
the market risks are properly

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.870
hedged.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:37.860
So that means this interest
rate risk of the trade

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.250
will be handled by the hedge.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.132
What other risks?

00:25:41.132 --> 00:25:42.590
AUDIENCE: Is there
a key man risks?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.390
So if the trader that made
the trade leaves and doesn't

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.280
know about the--

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.905
YI TANG: Ah, OK

00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:48.760
AUDIENCE: --portfolio?

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.180
YI TANG: That's a good point.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.340
Yeah, there is a risk like that.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.690
Yeah.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.600
Any other risks?

00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:00.430
OK.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.760
Let's go over this then.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:14.800
I claim there is a cash
flow liquidity funding risk.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.930
OK?

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.475
Our trade is not collateralized.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:29.080
And then I claim we need funding
for uncollateralized derivative

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:35.840
receivables, meaning we are
about to receive $100 million

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.040
in the future.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.170
We don't have it now.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:47.540
And I claim we actually need
to come up with cash for it

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.945
in many cases, in most
cases, not every trade.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.070
Anyone have any idea of why when
you are about to receive money,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:01.855
you actually need to
come up with money?

00:27:08.014 --> 00:27:13.270
This comes back to the hedge
argument similar to CVA.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:17.605
Essentially, if you
were to hedge your trade

00:27:17.605 --> 00:27:20.877
with futures or
with another dealer

00:27:20.877 --> 00:27:23.750
which are typically
collateralized.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:27.500
That means when you are about
to receive $100 million,

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.750
essentially you are about to
pay $30 million on your hedge.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:37.060
In fact, you had to be futures
that maybe mark to market, that

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.720
means you need to
actually really come up

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.170
with $100 million cash.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.140
The same is true for
collateralized trades.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.390
And there that's
where the risk is.

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.890
Because when you need to
come up with this money

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.210
and you don't have it,
what are you going to do?

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.080
You may end up like Lehman.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.330
And there's also a
contingent on the liquidity

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:09.650
risk, meaning how much liquidity
risk is dependent on the market

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.810
conditions, how much
interest rates changed,

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.585
how much other market risk
factor changes like that.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.132
And depending on the
market condition,

00:28:22.132 --> 00:28:25.290
the liquidity may
be quite different

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.050
and you may not know beforehand.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.220
So that's the another challenge.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.630
[INAUDIBLE] If you turn
the argument around,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.590
applying the argument
to the payable

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.240
and if you have
uncollateralized payable,

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.130
essentially you would have a
funding or liquidity benefit.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.490
So one interesting thing to
manage this liquidity risk

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:54.240
essentially is to use
uncollateralized payable

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.330
funding benefits
to partially hedge

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.260
the funding risk in
uncollateralized derivatives

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.670
receivables.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.510
There are a lot of other
risks, for instance, tail risk

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:09.710
and equity capital risks.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:20.330
Now here is one more example I'd
like to go over with you guys

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.270
on the application of CVA.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:29.190
This is about studying put
options or put spreads.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.720
If you trade stocks
yourself, you

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.240
may have thought
about this problem.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:38.550
I mean, either you can
buy the stock outright

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:44.682
or you sell put possibly
with a strike lower

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:45.640
than the current price.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:54.290
With that, you more or
less have a similar payout.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.340
Some people may
argue OK, if you see

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:00.290
put, if your stock comes down,
you're going to lose money.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.970
But you're going to lose
money if you were to hold

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.590
the stock outright also.

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.750
One of these strategies
that if you sell

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:11.250
put, if the stock
is not put to you,

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:15.410
and you're not participating
the up side when the stock

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.970
price increases significantly
then you are not

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.690
going to capture that price.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.570
But of course, one
thing people can do

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.730
is [? you continue to ?]
sell put so they

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.790
become like an income trade.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.300
So it's an interesting strategy.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:37.480
Some people say that selling
put is like name your own price

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.320
and get paid for trying it.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:55.430
And that's why we have this
famous trade, Warren Buffett,

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:00.130
Berkshire, sold long dated puts
on four leading stock indices,

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.910
in US, UK, Europe,
and Japan, collected

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:09.610
about four billion premium
without posting collateral.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:14.980
Without posting collateral,
that was very important.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.010
This is something I
actually was very involved

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.190
in one of my previous jobs.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:25.860
This happened about, I
think, around 2005, 2006.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.040
It's one of the biggest trades.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:35.450
And I was told when I
was involved with this,

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:43.160
this was one of the biggest
cash outflow in the derivatives

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.360
trades at that time,
because Warren Buffett

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:50.510
collected the premium
without posting collateral.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.590
If he had agreed
to post collateral

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.390
during the crisis
of 2008, he's going

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.220
to post many billions of
dollars of collateral.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.890
And one reason he had more
cash than other people was

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.248
he's very careful
[INAUDIBLE] and I

00:32:12.248 --> 00:32:14.550
think I put a reference
if you are interested

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.522
and then you can essentially
see the [INAUDIBLE] link

00:32:18.522 --> 00:32:19.022
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.440
And what's interesting
is that, there

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:33.580
were quite a few dealers who
are interested in this trade,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.090
but they know the size.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.795
And in a long-dated
equity option,

00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:43.090
it is not easy to handle,
but I think a lot of people

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.040
were able to handle.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:54.090
To me, some people were not able
to trade or enter this trade,

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.610
not because they could not
handle the equity risk.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:02.360
It's they could not
handle the CVA compounded.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.200
First of all, we
know there's a CVA.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.930
Essentially, we bought this
option from Warren Buffett.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.550
Eventually, he may need
to pay and at that time,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:17.210
he may default. So that's
a regular CVA risk.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.920
But this is also
a wrong-way risk,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.820
meaning a more severe risk.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:32.330
You can imagine when
the market sells off,

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:38.100
Warren Buffet would
actually owe us more money.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.910
Do you think in that scenario he
will be more likely to default

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.730
or less likely to default?

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.260
He'll be more likely
to default. That's

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.910
where the term
wrong-way risk comes in.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.320
When your counterparty owes
you more and more money,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:59.500
that's when he's more
likely to default.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.290
And that's even harder to model.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.220
And there's a
liquidity funding risk

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.850
which can also be wrong-way,
because as a dealer

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.510
you may need to come up
with a billion or two cash

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.860
to pay Berkshire.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.219
Where do you get the money from?

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.040
Typically, people
need to issue a debt

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.760
to fund in a [? sine ?] secure
way and essentially, you'll

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.870
pay for quite a
spread on your debt.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:37.969
That is essentially the cost
of your liquidity of funding.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.389
So what we did was,
essentially, we

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:46.290
charged Warren Buffett
CVA and wrong-way CVA,

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:50.840
charge of the funding costs,
some wrong-way funding costs.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.719
Another challenge, of course,
is that some dealers, I suspect,

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.370
they could've priced
CVA, but they do not

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:02.900
have a good CV trading
desk risk management

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.740
to deliver risk management
of CVA and funding.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.750
Once you have this
position at hand,

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.666
you have counterparty risks.

00:35:13.666 --> 00:35:17.640
But how do you hedge it?

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:23.400
You charge Warren Buffet x
million dollars for the CVA.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:29.200
If you don't do anything,
when their spread widens,

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.780
you're going to have
a lot more CVA loss.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.250
So you need to risk manage that.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.600
Of course, you can do
that with any hedge.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:47.870
But at any hedge, if we
drill down to details,

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.150
you suffer a fair
amount of gap risk.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.050
It's not like a bond.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.210
If you own a bond, you
can buy a CDS protection

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.160
on the same bond.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.840
More or less, you are hedged
for a while in a static way.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.860
But for a CVA, it's not.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.940
The reason for that is the
exposure can change over time.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.700
One thing we tried at
the time, essentially

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.395
we sort of structured
like a credit-linked note

00:36:17.395 --> 00:36:19.510
type of trade.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.580
Essentially, you go to
people who own or would

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.080
like to buy Berkshire's bond.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.140
Essentially, you
should tell them OK,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:31.590
we have a credit asset
similar to Berkshire's bond.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.940
If you feel comfortable with
owning Berkshire's bond,

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:42.030
you may consider our asset
which pays more coupon.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.000
And the reason we were
able to pay more coupon

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.600
is we were able to charge
Berkshire a lot of money.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.750
And there's also a tranched
portfolio protection

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:55.300
thing that's involved,
but I'm going

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.910
to skip that for
the sake of time.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:03.220
So then the question is the
we charged a lot of the money

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.950
from Berkshire.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.430
Why would he want
to do this trade?

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.270
What would they think?

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.240
So here's my guess.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.670
As you know, they have
an insurance business.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.970
Then they wanted to explore
other ways to sell insurance.

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.050
So selling puts essentially
is spreading insurance

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.375
on the equity market.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:34.550
They sold like 10,
15 year maturity

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.530
puts at below their spots.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.460
So then people can
think, OK, what's

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:47.260
the likelihood of a
stock price coming down

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.275
to below the current
stock in 10, 15 years.

00:37:50.275 --> 00:37:53.720
Well, it happens, but
it's not very likely.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.480
And they do have a
day one cash inflow.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.150
So essentially, I think one
way Berkshire was thinking

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.351
is that they thought
low funding costs.

00:38:04.351 --> 00:38:06.620
If you read Warren
Buffett's paper,

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.580
essentially he's saying
it's like 1% interest rate

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:15.400
on a 10 year cash, or
something like that.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.880
And it's very important to
manage your liquidity well.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:25.400
They do not have any cash
flow until the trade matures.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:31.680
So that's how they avoided the
cash flow drain during 2008,

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.440
even though they did suffer
unrealized mark-to-market loss.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.550
But what's interesting is
that during 2008, 2009,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.740
Berkshire did explore
the feasibility

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.230
of posting collateral.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:52.794
This started with no
collateral posting.

00:38:52.794 --> 00:38:54.460
But then they wanted
to post collateral.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.130
They actually approached some
of the dealers saying oh, I

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.150
want to post some collateral.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.990
Why is that?

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.190
There's no free lunch.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.990
So what happened was they were
smart not to post collateral,

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.340
but during the crisis
their spread widened.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.350
Everyone's spread widened.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.840
So Berkshire's spread widened.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.070
Then Warren Buffett
owed more money.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.270
So guess what?

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.940
The CVA hedging would
require the dealer

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:30.029
to buy more and more
protection on Berkshire.

00:39:30.029 --> 00:39:31.570
When you buy more
and more protection

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:37.110
on someone, that will
actually drive that person's,

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.270
that entity's, credit
spread even wider.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.860
So Berkshire essentially saw
their credit spread widening

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:52.370
a lot more than they had hoped
for, than they had anticipated.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.900
And later on, they found out
it was due to CVA hedging,

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.350
CVA risk management.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.500
That actually affected
their bond issuance.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.110
When you have a high credit
spread from CDS market,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.910
essentially the cash
market may actually

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.300
question may actually follow.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.560
And whoever would like
to buy Berkshire's bond

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.900
would think twice.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.600
OK, if I have to buy
this bond, if I ever

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.940
have to buy credit
protection, it's

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.270
going to cost me a lot more
money because of the spread

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.970
widening.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.520
So therefore, I'm going
to demand higher coupon

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.752
on Berkshire's bond, and that
drives their funding cost high.

00:40:33.752 --> 00:40:36.242
So they explored in
different to post collateral.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.396
Another thing of course is a
very interesting thing to ask.

00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:44.580
Berkshire thinks
they're making money

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.090
and the dealer
thinks they're making

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.630
money, which is probably true.

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:55.580
But then the question
is, who is losing money

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.980
or who will lose money.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.230
Anyone has any ideas?

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.590
I think there's probably
a lot of answers to this.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.880
My view is that essentially
whoever needs to hedge,

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:23.190
whoever need to buy put.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:31.080
If the market doesn't decline as
much as much as you hoped for,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.180
essentially you'll
pay for put premium

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.765
and do not get the benefits.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.180
Here's an interesting
CV conundrum.

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.870
Now, hopefully by
this time, you guys

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:51.345
fully appreciate the CVA
risks and the impact of CVA.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.880
In terms of risk itself,
in terms of magnitude,

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.330
as I mentioned earlier
being the crisis,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.670
2008 crisis, which
[? killed ?] among easily

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.420
billions of dollars loss for
some of the firms due to CVA,

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:15.910
and that's more than
the actual default loss.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.950
Now given you know
the CVA, so if you

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:22.130
trade with counterparty
A, naturally you'll say

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.370
you want to think OK,
I want buy protection

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:31.330
to hedge my CVA risk, to
buy credit protection on A,

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:37.830
from counterparty B. If you
trade with counterparty B,

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:43.920
you would have CVA
against counterparty B.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.015
You would have a credit
risk against counterparty B.

00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:49.280
So what are you going to do?

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:57.160
If you just follow
the simple thinking,

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.980
essentially you may
think oh OK, maybe I

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:07.480
should buy credit protection
on B from counterparty C.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.740
But if you were to do that, then
you have to continue on that.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.260
It becomes an infinite series.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.730
Infinite series are OK
I'll say theoretically,

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:24.676
but in practice I
feel it's going to be

00:43:24.676 --> 00:43:25.800
very challenging to handle.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.470
So what would be
a simple strategy

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:37.850
to actually terminate this
infinite series quickly?

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.640
Yeah this also has theoretical
implications for CVA pricing.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.270
Sometimes we say, OK, arbitrage
pricing is really replication,

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.430
use hedge instruments.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.840
Now, you have to use an infinite
number of hedge instruments.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.040
That's going to impact your
[? replication ?] modeling.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:16.860
So the way we would
do it practically

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:21.380
is to buy credit protection
on A from counterparty B fully

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.180
collateralized,
typically from a dealer.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:30.370
So however much money you owe
from counterparty B right away,

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.110
they're going to
post collateral.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.120
In a way, it's more or less
similar to a futures context

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.510
settling.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:41.730
That minimized the
counterparty risk [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.950
So you can cut off this
infinite series easily.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.770
Here, I'd like to
touch upon what

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:59.740
I call enterprise-level
derivatives modeling.

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.770
We mentioned trade-level
derivatives models.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.940
That is essentially, is
just a regular model.

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:11.890
When people talk about
derivatives model,

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.940
usually people talk
about trade-level models.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.830
Essentially, you model
each trade independently.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.700
Your model is price,
mark-to-market

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.000
or its Greeks sensitivity.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.200
Then when you have a
portfolio of these trades,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.530
essentially you
can just aggregate

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:35.640
their PV, their Greeks,
through linear aggregation.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.880
Then essentially you get
the PV of the portfolio.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.160
But as we have
seen already, that

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.280
doesn't capture the
complete picture.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:57.290
There are additional risks
that require further modeling.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.870
One is non-linear
portfolio risks.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:08.090
So essentially, these risks
cannot be like a linear

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:13.890
aggregation of the risks of
each of the component trades

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.340
in the portfolio.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.170
The example we have
gone through is CVA,

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.170
funding is of similar
nature, capital liquidity

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.920
are also examples.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.680
The key to handle
this situation is

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:34.200
to be able to model
all the trades

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.600
in the market and the market
risk factors of a portfolio

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.890
consistently so that you
can handle the offsetting

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:42.520
trades properly.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:50.180
Of course, we need to
leverage the trade-level model

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:54.330
essentially to price each
individual trade as of today,

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:55.622
as of a future date.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:02.177
What's interesting is
that there's also feedback

00:47:02.177 --> 00:47:03.260
to the trade-level models.

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.030
For instance, when we
price a cancellable

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.180
swap of a very public trade.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:16.420
Now this cancellable swap we
trade with a counterparty,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.360
let's say assumed
uncollateralized,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:25.900
we trade with a counterparty
that's close to default.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.730
You know the trade-level
model doesn't

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:31.410
know about this
counterparty, about default.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:36.650
The trade-level will give
you independent, the exercise

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:41.350
boundaries, when do you need
to cancel the swap, independent

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.970
of the counterparty
credit quality.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:49.310
That invites a question,
when the counterparty is

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:53.930
close to default, even if your
model says OK, you should not

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:59.092
exercise based on the
market conditions,

00:47:59.092 --> 00:48:02.710
but shouldn't we consider the
counterparty condition, credit

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.200
condition.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.860
If the counterparty
were close to default,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:11.220
if you cancel the swap
sooner essentially you'll

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:17.420
eliminate or reduce
the counterparty risk.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.820
This is actually interesting
application and feedback

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:28.430
between a trade-level model and
the enterprise-level models.

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.920
So what we did was, in
some of my previous jobs,

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:37.870
what we did was actually figure
out the counterparty risk

00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:40.550
in these trades,
the major trades.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.920
Then essentially, we just
tell the underlying trader,

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.190
if you were to
cancel this trade,

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:51.090
we have a benefit because
we're going to reduce

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.930
the CVA or even zero out CVA.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.950
So the CV trader would be able
to pay the underlying trader.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.080
So therefore, the
underlying model actually

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.890
can take this as
input rather than

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:11.280
as part of the exercise
condition modeling,

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.680
knowing if you cancel
earlier you potentially

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.746
can get additional benefits.

00:49:16.746 --> 00:49:19.596
This model may eventually
be able to tell

00:49:19.596 --> 00:49:26.180
you to handle the risks more
properly, market risks together

00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.070
with counterparty risks.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:34.870
This is roughly the
scope and the application

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.730
of the enterprise-level model.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.230
This is actually a fairly
significant modelling effort

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:51.620
as well as significant
infrastructure and data effort.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.782
Essentially, it
requires a fair amount

00:49:53.782 --> 00:49:57.180
of martingale testing,
martingale resampling,

00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.930
martingale interpolation
and the martingale modeling.

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:07.180
The reason for that is
you have a trade model,

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:14.450
and each trade model can model
a particular trade accurately,

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:20.290
and there's certain market
modeling, simulations

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:25.470
of the underlying
market or great PDE.

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:30.750
But when you put a portfolio
of trades together,

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:35.290
now the methodology you use for
modeling one trade accurately

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:40.540
may not necessarily be the
methodology you need to model

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.422
all the trades accurately.

00:50:43.422 --> 00:50:46.310
Some of these require PDE
and some require simulations,

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:48.160
but you need to
put them together.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.610
Typically, we use simulation.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.700
And that introduced
numerical inaccuracies.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.255
And the martingale
testing will tell

00:50:55.255 --> 00:50:58.240
us are we introducing
a lot of errors,

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.180
martingale resampling
essentially

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.100
would allow us to
correct the errors.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.960
As you know, the
martingale is a foundation

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.760
of the arbitrage pricing.

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.030
Essentially,
martingale resampling

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:18.110
will actually be able to enforce
the martingale conditions

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.900
in the numerical procedure,
not only theoretically.

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:24.630
Martingale
interpolation modeling

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:29.835
are other important interesting
aspects if we have time we can

00:51:29.835 --> 00:51:39.960
[INAUDIBLE] There are
different approaches

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.340
for how to do it
in a systematic way

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:47.620
and still remain
additional ways.

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:51.770
I'd like to quickly go
over some of the examples

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.870
of martingale and
martingale measures.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:52:00.920
I may need to go through this
quite quickly due to the time

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.950
limitations.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:06.350
But hopefully, you guys have
learned all these already.

00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:09.680
This will hopefully be more
like a review for you guys.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.620
So essentially, we are
talking about a few examples.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.950
What's the martingale
measure for forward price,

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:18.810
forward LIBOR, forward
price, forward FX rate,

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:20.660
forward CDS par coupon.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:26.710
I would hope you guys would
know the first few already.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.600
The for CDS par
coupon in my view

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.650
is actually fairly challenging.

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:35.540
For simplicity, I'm not
considering the collateral

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.470
discounting explicitly.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:46.190
That adds additional challenges
but still we can address that.

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:52.890
So under the risk
neutral measure,

00:52:52.890 --> 00:53:00.810
essentially for
this Y of t being

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:05.480
the price of a traded asset
with no intermediate cash flow.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:13.740
Essentially, that is y_T
over beta(t) is a martingale.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.380
This is essentially the
Harrison-Pliska martingale

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.560
no-arbitrage theorem.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.000
It says for two traded assets
with no intermediate cash

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.590
flows, satisfying
technical conditions,

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.900
the ratio is a martingale.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.740
There's a probability
measure corresponding

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.580
to the numeraire asset.

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.400
Therefore, naturally
we have this composite.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.770
The forward
arbitrage-free measure

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:48.890
essentially corresponding to a
numeraire of zero-coupon bonds.

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:54.595
Naturally, we can
find this Y_t and P(t,

00:53:54.595 --> 00:53:58.050
T) ratio is a martingale.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.650
Again, it's just a ratio
of two traded assets

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:06.440
with no intermediate cash flow.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.930
From the definition
of the forward price,

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.580
essentially the forward
price is a martingale

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.300
under the forward measure.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.340
Forward LIBOR-- this is the
forward LIBOR-- essentially,

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.720
it's a ratio of two
zero-coupon bonds.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.440
So naturally, we know
it's a martingale under

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.020
of the numeraire asset.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.830
So essentially it's a forward
measure up to the payment

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.370
on the forward LIBOR.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.750
So this is the
martingale condition.

00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:42.920
Similarly, we can do this
argument of the forward swap

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.420
rate.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:53.540
Essentially, a
forward swap rate is,

00:54:53.540 --> 00:55:00.430
we can start with, like
an annuity numeraire.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:03.240
And since the forward swap
rate, you essentially know,

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.210
is the difference of
two zero-coupon bonds

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:08.780
divided by annuity.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.580
And therefore we
can conclude based

00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:17.280
on Harrison-Pliska theorem the
forward swap rate essentially

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.380
is the martingale under
the annuity measure,

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.390
with this annuity
as the numeraire.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:33.520
The same argument goes
for the forward FX rate.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.280
Mainly the idea is or the
pattern you probably have seen

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:42.230
is, for any quantity you see
if you can find two assets

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:47.560
and then use these two
asset ratio to represent

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.200
this in a quantity.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:56.980
So the forward FX essentially
is a ratio like this.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.560
This is nothing more than
the interest rate parity.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:10.760
From the spot you
grow both [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.190
You start with spot, you
grow the domestic currency

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.590
and then you grow
the foreign currency.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.430
You get FX forwards.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:22.260
And FX forward is a
martingale measure

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.530
under the domestic
forward measure.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:40.120
This is a simple technique to do
change of probability measure.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:46.380
It's roughly how I remember
change of probability measure

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.710
and Radon-Nikodym derivatives.

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:54.120
You essentially start
with, again, martingale,

00:56:54.120 --> 00:57:04.900
assuming this is martingale
under a particular measure

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.820
corresponding to
the numeraire asset.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:11.090
And then this quantity
is also a martingale

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:13.490
under a different
measure corresponding

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:19.110
to a different numeraire asset.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:24.530
One key point is when you change
probability measure essentially

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:26.960
you change the
numeraire corresponding

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.430
to the probability measure.

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.330
And therefore essentially
the important thing

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:42.910
is we know the PV or the
mark-to-market, of a traded

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:44.640
security is measure-independent.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.350
It doesn't matter
what mathematics

00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:53.710
you use if the traded
security is going

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:55.950
to match the market price.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:58:01.080
And therefore, you can
price this security

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:05.470
under one measure
or one numeraire.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.130
And then you can price
again with another measure,

00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:11.750
another numeraire.

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:13.890
They've got to be the same.

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:17.080
Then naturally, you see
this simple equation

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.250
as the starting point to
do the change of measure.

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:25.530
If you just simply change the
variables, then essentially

00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:29.810
you get your change
of measure as well as

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:31.730
Radon-Nikodym derivative.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:34.140
And if you worked
on the BGM model,

00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:38.370
you'll probably recognize
this change of measure

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:42.860
which is used for the BGM
model under the old measure.

00:58:45.930 --> 00:58:50.470
Now here's the subtlety,
credit derivatives.

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:55.310
Naturally, people would think
OK, since the forward swap

00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:59.570
rate is a martingale
under the annuity

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:06.390
measure, naturally people would
think OK, then forward CDS par

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.762
rate, it's like a
forward swap rate.

00:59:09.762 --> 00:59:18.200
It's got to be a martingale
under the risky annuity

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.470
measure.

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:25.820
So that's quite intuitive
except there's one problem.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:31.630
If the reference
credit entity has

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:35.860
zero recovery upon
default. Then,

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:40.090
this risky annuity
could have a 0.

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.470
And now we're
talking about we want

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:48.370
to use something that could
be 0 as our numeraire.

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:54.510
How do we resolve the
technical mathematical problem.

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.314
So that actually
very interesting.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.990
Schönbucher was the first person
who published a paper on this

01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:07.590
model.

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:10.120
I was just trying to
do some work myself

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.230
when I was working on BGM model.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:17.770
I thought oh, it would've been
nice to expand the BGM model

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:21.470
to the credit derivatives.

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.740
But then immediately I
stumbled with this difficulty

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.600
where when the
recovery is 0, you're

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.760
going to have a 0
in your numeraire,

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.080
in your risky annuity.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:45.070
So Schönbucher, essentially,
his idea was let's focus

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:51.980
on survival measures, meaning we
have a difficulty if a default

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.520
happens and the recovery is 0.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.598
Now his idea is let's
forget about that state.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.490
Let's not worry about that.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.520
One immediate
question people will

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.740
ask, if that's the
case, the probability

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.280
measure, physical
probability measure

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.820
or risk-neutral
probability measure,

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.880
and this survival probability
measure are not equivalent

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.050
because the survival probability
measure knows nothing

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.710
about the default event.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.170
So they are not equivalent.

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:43.070
That's, essentially,
you actually

01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.160
transform one mathematical
difficulty to another one.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.190
Luckily, the second
one turns out

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.370
to be actually easier to solve.

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:58.270
So the starting point is again
using Harrison-Pliska theorem.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.220
Essentially, you
just need to identify

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:07.980
like a numeraire asset,
and the denominator assets.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:12.650
You identify two assets.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:17.700
You make a ratio and then
those are a martingale.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.770
So essentially this is forward
swap rate and forward annuity.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:37.160
If we have this indicator of
the default time of j-th credit

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.450
name, greater than this
t, essentially this

01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:45.025
is like the premium leg of CDS.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.190
That's a traded asset.

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:52.120
So therefore, we have a
martingale [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.500
like this.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.650
The subtlety as you
probably can envision

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:00.541
is going to come in when we
do the change of probability

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:01.040
measures.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:12.360
OK, so we have talked
about how are we

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:20.780
going to find the martingale
measure of a CDS par coupon

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:24.730
or forward CDS par rate.

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:27.950
This is a starting point
of martingale model.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.510
Essentially, for
any quantity you

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:36.170
want to model you try to
find its martingale measure.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:38.040
Once you find this
martingale measure,

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.290
you can do a martingale
representation.

01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:45.080
And then often times you need
to a change of a probability

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.040
measure.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.480
So that all the term
structure functions,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.790
a consequence of a
variables are modeled

01:03:51.790 --> 01:03:55.410
in a consistent
probability measure.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:58.550
So finding the martingale
measure is the first point.

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:07.170
Survival probability
measure, essentially, he just

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:09.130
defined this with.

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:14.350
You can define this
Radon-Nikodym derivative.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:19.355
Once you define
that essentially--

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:25.210
if you remember the
previous formula--

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:29.421
you will have a martingale
condition like this.

01:04:29.421 --> 01:04:41.080
[INAUDIBLE] The
probability measures

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.610
are not equivalent
anymore, but yet they

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:52.320
can still do change of
probability measure.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.650
You need to
separately model what

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:58.380
going to happen when
the default happens

01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.830
if you want to use this model.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:09.365
Now, I'd like to move onto
the second part, martingale,

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:10.740
martingale testing
and martingale

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.090
resampling and interpolation.

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:15.465
Martingale testing essentially
given the previously model

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:17.500
formula's conditions.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.340
Those are, by the
way, just examples.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.070
There are a lot more.

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.020
Essentially, you
know that's what

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.020
it should be
theoretically you just

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.610
test in your numerical
implementation

01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:32.080
and see if those
conditions are satisfied.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.210
That's the martingale test.

01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:37.735
Martingale resampling is we
know most likely if you were

01:05:37.735 --> 01:05:40.460
to test, we're going to fail.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:44.030
This is not necessarily
for enterprise-level models

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:47.300
but even for trade-level
derivatives models.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.780
A lot of times, I think the
martingale conditions are not

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.900
exactly satisfied.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:59.100
So one way to do that, is
to correct that, correct

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:00.810
this error.

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:04.190
The rationale is
essentially because

01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:07.990
of a numerical approximations.

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.960
Whatever quantity
we model essentially

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.030
is not a true quantity.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:15.000
The true quantity
we model essentially

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.410
is some function of what
we have in our model.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:23.710
So therefore, you expect
a certain function.

01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:26.180
Sometimes you can have a
linear, log-linear function.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:34.890
This X_0 is what we
have in our model,

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:40.690
and then X is what
we need to satisfy

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:43.060
the martingale condition.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.380
Essentially, in this
[? Purdue ?] case

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.420
is very simple.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.320
You first of all,
use the mean and then

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:50.900
you would adjust the deviation.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:56.290
So therefore, given any
quantity X_0, you can have,

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:59.340
you can force it to
be any given mean.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.830
This mean, in our case,
will be determined

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.645
by the martingale condition.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:13.820
The next interesting thing
is martingale interpolation.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.197
Oh, I have a typo here.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.095
Sometimes you have an interest
rate model, for instance,

01:07:23.095 --> 01:07:25.350
you model LIBOR.

01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:28.995
Your LIBOR, you can
have different tenors.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.639
When you have a yield curve,
you know, at any given time,

01:07:35.639 --> 01:07:36.680
there's a term structure.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.140
In the model, a
lot of times we can

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:44.290
model a few selected points.

01:07:44.290 --> 01:07:48.410
But what if your model
requires a term structure,

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.720
a term that not in your model.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.510
So what people normally
do is you do martingale,

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.290
you do interpolation.

01:07:58.290 --> 01:08:02.425
So you have a 1-year LIBOR
and you have a 5-year liable.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.455
And then you need a 3-years.

01:08:08.455 --> 01:08:09.080
What do you do?

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.930
You interpolate, for instance.

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:14.950
But interpolation
doesn't automatically

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:19.819
guarantee martingale
relationships.

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:23.560
The martingale
interpolation has a goal

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.750
of automatically satisfying
the martingale relationships,

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:33.750
so we're particular
with our interpolating.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:40.198
Actually, it turns out
to be a [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:45.180
The starting point is the
martingale condition that I

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.229
wrote out on the slide.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:52.550
Essentially, this s and
t are the calendar time.

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:56.490
And this capital T is really
like a term structure.

01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:00.080
You have a 1-year rate, 2-year
rate, 5-year interest rate,

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.203
those term structures.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:09.600
How do we interpolate such
that after interpolation

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.319
the corresponding martingale
relationships are satisfied.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.750
So here's what we do.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:21.069
We start with, let's
say, capital T_1.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:29.069
Capital T_1, that's
a point we model.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:32.899
We assume that one is
properly martingale resampled

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:34.859
and satisfies the
martingale condition.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:44.979
This is a martingale
for T capital 2.

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:49.240
That also satisfies the
corresponding martingale

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.149
conditions.

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:53.170
Our goal is to figure out T_3.

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:59.612
How do you do interpolation
for the term T_3

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:06.830
such that this T_3 will
satisfy its own corresponding

01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:08.660
martingale condition.

01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:11.600
If you do simple linear
interpolation using

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:19.100
T as independent
variable, essentially, you

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.230
are not going to achieve that.

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:28.830
So the key is we need the choose
the proper independent variable

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:30.350
for the interpolation.

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:36.695
Essentially, it's the previous
time or time 0 quantity.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.540
So time s is before time t.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.080
Imagine time s will be 0.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:49.190
So using the
corresponding quantities

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:53.020
at time 0 as the
independent variable,

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.540
essentially, you
can achieve that.

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:57.600
It's still linear
interpolation, it's

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.870
just to use a different
independent variable.

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.280
Essentially, you can
show that very easily.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.510
This is just simple algebra.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.630
If you take the expectation,
this one being martingale,

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:13.950
this little t will become s.

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.490
Then if you do expectation
here, the little t

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.910
will become little s.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:24.970
And therefore if you combine
these two, a lot of terms

01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:28.460
will actually cancel.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:34.440
Essentially, you will be
left with this martingale

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:44.280
at time s and T_3, meaning
this is the martingale target

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.850
of this particular term.

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:51.830
And that turns out to be the
expectation of this quantity.

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:55.000
So it's a very simple
linear-- simple algebra.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.640
You guys can figure
it out if you want to.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:04.380
So this one
essentially guarantees

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.190
the interpolated
quantity automatically

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.810
satisfies all the conditions
of the martingale target.

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:13.000
Of course, you need to
know the martingale target.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.330
If you don't know,
that's a different story.

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:17.760
Then you need to
do something else.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.480
Specifically, time
0, for instance,

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.550
is what the market tells us.

01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:27.565
Often time we do a
big time assumption.

01:12:27.565 --> 01:12:33.880
So whatever assumption on time 0
you make, in you dynamic model,

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:38.790
you automatically satisfy the
needed martingale condition.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.860
This is just a
brief introduction

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.705
of how we do the
martingale modeling.

01:12:56.490 --> 01:13:00.120
This LIBOR market model,
as you guys probably

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.380
have learned already,
there's different forms

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.540
of BGM as the initial form.

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:11.840
And then Jamshidian
came with another form.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.230
And in terms of a
general martingale

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.920
model, what we'll
do typically is

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.320
we start to find the
martingale quantity.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.770
And we know a forward
LIBOR is a martingale

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:32.440
in its own forward measure.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.890
Then we know we can use
martingale representation.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:42.350
Under certain
technical conditions,

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:47.990
the diffusion process can be
represented by Brownian motion.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.850
Then we can assume
log-normal just for example.

01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:52.910
We don't have to,
we can use CEV,

01:13:52.910 --> 01:13:56.870
we can use [INAUDIBLE]
stochastic volatility.

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:59.000
The starting point
is martingale,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.460
identifying the
martingale measure

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.780
and then perform
martingale representation.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:08.605
Essentially, you get this
stochastic differential

01:14:08.605 --> 01:14:10.670
equation.

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:15.820
They need to change measure
or change numeraire.

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.480
Because this one essentially
says for particular LIBOR,

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.240
you have a Brownian motion
and a different measure.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.440
So that has limited usage.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.270
A lot of the derivative
trade, IR trade

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:33.215
essentially, it's [INAUDIBLE]
the entire yield curve.

01:14:33.215 --> 01:14:35.340
So you need to make sure
you model the entire yield

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.200
curve consistently.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.760
So therefore you have to
change the probability measure

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:49.460
so that everything is specified
in the same common measure.

01:14:53.454 --> 01:14:55.370
Of course, you can have
a choice which one you

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:59.490
want to use as common measure.

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:03.020
Through a simple
change of numeraire,

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.900
essentially, we can get a
stochastic equation like this.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.550
We have a Brownian motion.

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:39.270
Right, we have a Brownian motion
with a correlation like this.

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:54.580
So this is essentially a
market model in a general form,

01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:00.850
with full dimensionality
meaning one Brownian motion

01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:03.724
per term of a LIBOR.

01:16:03.724 --> 01:16:05.140
So that's the full
dimensionality.

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:05.723
PROFESSOR: Yi?

01:16:05.723 --> 01:16:09.490
YI TANG: And then you
need to do-- Yeah, hi.

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:14.470
PROFESSOR: Can you wrap up
because we need a bit of time

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:15.169
for questions.

01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:16.460
YI TANG: Oh you need me to end.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:21.010
It's all right I can
actually wrap up now.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.950
If you want to.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.930
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:28.680
OK, any conclusions?

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.070
YI TANG: Well, OK.

01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:34.130
The conclusion is
the following thing.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:37.850
There is a need for
enterprise-level models

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:40.190
to handle non-linear
portfolio effects

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:43.740
and we need to leverage
our trade-level models.

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:47.600
By doing so we do employ
martingale testing,

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.880
martingale resampling,
interpolation.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:54.670
And not only we
need that for CVA,

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:58.230
but we also need that for
funding liquidity capital risks

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.580
which are very critical risks.

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:04.010
And people have started
paying more and more attention

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:09.020
to these risks, especially
since after the crisis.

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:11.170
Because of time
limits, I'm not going

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:13.020
to be able to finish
another example.

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:18.220
But if you like, you can take a
look on page 22 of the slides.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:21.090
Hopefully, Vasily can
still get it to you guys.

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:22.860
Thank you guys.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.126
PROFESSOR: Thank you Yi.

01:17:26.126 --> 01:17:28.890
We will publish the slides
probably later tonight

01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:32.360
so please take a look.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.960
So to wrap up, let me see.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.442
I want to bring up,

01:17:37.442 --> 01:17:38.400
PROFESSOR 2: That's OK.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.330
Probably if it's the course
website, that's fine.

01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:47.500
PROFESSOR: I did add
a few topics which

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.990
were used last year for
final paper for interest

01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:53.250
in the document which
is on the website.

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:56.340
So take a look.

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:05.060
Basically, the themes there were
mostly Black-Scholes or more

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.290
advanced models or manipulation
of Black-Scholes equation.

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:12.260
There was a very interesting
work on statistical analysis

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.730
of commodity data.

01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:20.030
So if somebody's up for it,
that would be very interesting.

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:29.200
And there were a few numerical
and Monte Carlo projects.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:32.180
So any questions?

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.702
PROFESSOR 2: Yeah,
so actually we

01:18:34.702 --> 01:18:36.410
were planning to give
you a bit more time

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.460
to ask your questions.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:41.050
But since we have
five minutes, I

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:45.320
think maybe I'd like to ask
you to just think about what

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.540
we learned this term.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.950
So Peter can add
on what we think

01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:54.340
in on the mathematics and
also those applications,

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:58.940
and in conjunction while you're
doing the final paper, just

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.340
focusing on the new things
you think that you learned

01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:07.520
and what did you like to
explore in the next stage

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.610
of your research.

01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:12.750
So I think probably we
don't have a lot of time

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:14.782
for lots of questions.

01:19:14.782 --> 01:19:16.240
But if you have
any questions, this

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.615
will be a good
opportunity to ask

01:19:17.615 --> 01:19:19.480
about the paper or the course.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.243
Peter you want to
make some comments?

01:19:21.243 --> 01:19:22.010
PETER: Sure.

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.810
I'd just like say that
I think this course was

01:19:24.810 --> 01:19:28.230
a very challenging course
for most of you and that was,

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.260
I guess, our intention.

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.610
And I really respect all
the hard work and effort

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:34.310
everyone put into the class.

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.910
And in terms of
the final paper, we

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:40.630
will be looking
at your background

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:45.850
and look for insights
that demonstrate what

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:47.340
you've learned in the course.

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.404
And I've already
reviewed several papers.

01:19:51.404 --> 01:19:52.820
I'm very pleased
with the results.

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.130
So I think everyone's
done a great job.

01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:59.490
This course, I
think, is intended

01:19:59.490 --> 01:20:01.170
to provide you with
the foundations

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:04.280
of the math for the financial
applications as well

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:09.540
as an excellent introduction and
exposure to those applications.

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:14.090
I think you'll find this
course valuable over the course

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:17.310
of your careers,
and look forward

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:22.460
to contributing
insights with questions

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.960
you might have
following the course.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:26.540
I'm sure the other
faculty feel the same way.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:30.579
We want to be a good resource
for you now and afterwards.

01:20:30.579 --> 01:20:31.870
PROFESSOR: Very, very well put.

01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:35.240
So please feel
free to contact us.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.320
And please stay in touch.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.720
All the contact details
are on the website.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.970
We plan to have a repeat
of this class next year.

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:49.440
So please, tell your friend
or stop by next year,

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.780
which will be the next fall.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.820
It will not be exactly the same.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.120
We will try to make
it slightly different,

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.260
but it will be close.

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.410
PROFESSOR 2: If you have
any suggested topics,

01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:02.410
you feel you haven't
been exposed to

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:06.640
and would like to know more,
send us email if you can.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.750
I think one of the
values of this class

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:12.276
is we can bring in
pretty much everyone

01:21:12.276 --> 01:21:14.960
from the frontier
in this industry

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.460
to give you some insights
of what's going on.

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.120
PROFESSOR: Please take
a review on the website,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:22.930
this is important.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.734
And that's all.

01:21:27.734 --> 01:21:28.400
PROFESSOR 2: OK.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:30.650
Thank you for your
participation this semester.

01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:32.450
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:35.200
PROFESSOR: And thank
Yi for the pleasure.
