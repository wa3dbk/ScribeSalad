00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.903
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Today's
topic is portfolio theory.

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:32.360
An it's really one of the most
important topics in finance.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.650
We're going to go through the
historical theory of portfolio

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.560
optimization, beginning
with Markowitz Mean-Variance

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.170
Optimization, where we
look at portfolios in terms

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.670
of their performance
characteristics

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.490
as determined by the mean return
and the volatility returns.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.560
This analysis gets extended
by looking at also investing

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.590
with a risk-free asset.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.080
The initial theory
on portfolio analysis

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.370
didn't consider
investing in cash,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.510
but just investing
in risky assets.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.310
The problem changes
quite dramatically when

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.950
we add the risk-free asset.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.660
Then the topic of utility
theory, von Neumann-Morgenstern

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.360
utility theory, in
statistical decision theory,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.710
we are trying to make
decisions under uncertainty

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.450
in a rational way.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.850
And von Neumann and Morgenstern
developed a expected utility

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.640
hypothesis for rational
decision making.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.450
And that's really very
important motivator

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
for decision analysis generally
and portfolio selection

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.350
in particular.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.500
So we'll go through that.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.240
Then we'll turn to portfolio
optimization constraints.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.015
There are realistic issues
when you have-- well,

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.460
there's how much money
you have to invest,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.930
how much capital you have
to invest, whether you could

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.715
short securities or not,
whether there are sort

00:01:59.715 --> 00:02:02.190
of limits in capacity
of different assets

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.200
you might want to trade.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.610
Those can come into play
and affect the solutions.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.900
All of these methods
are driven by estimates

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.160
of how well we
expect assets to do,

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
so estimating returns
or estimating alphas,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.470
and also estimating the
volatilities and correlations

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.130
amongst the assets
were trading in.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.120
Most of the theory we'll
talk about today deals

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.740
with estimates-- well,
with the problem where

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.480
we're assuming basically
certainty in terms

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.800
of understanding those
underlying return

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.330
characteristics, the means,
variances, correlations.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.520
But when we have to estimate
those that raises problems.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.020
And finally, we'll
finish up talking

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.630
about some alternative
risk measures, which

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.240
extend the
straightforward mean--

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.195
or simple
mean-variance analysis.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.060
Now the mean-variance analysis
is a single-period analysis.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.020
What we want to do is
consider investing our capital

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.160
in some assets.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.300
And we want to do so
for just a single period

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.760
and do so optimally.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.880
So in terms of notation,
we'll consider risky assets

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.050
indexed by i, 1 through m.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.970
Single-period returns will
be a multivariate vector

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.870
of those returns.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.520
The mean and covariance
of these assets

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.793
are represented in vector of
returns and covariance matrix

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.410
of squared volatilities,
the variances

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930
of the assets along
the diagonals,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.810
and the covariances
on the off-diagonals.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.840
A portfolio will be represented
as basically a weighting

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.340
of our investment
in these m assets.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.780
So we'll have a vector w,
consisting of w_1 up to w_m.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.380
I'm giving the relative
weights and absolute weights

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.830
of those investments.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.110
We'll assume that we have one
unit of capital to invest.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.579
So the sum of these
weights equals 1.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.060
And the portfolio return
has expected return

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.420
given by the expectation
of this linear combination

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.990
of the returns, which is simply
the same linear combination

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.040
of the underlying expectations.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.310
And the variance
of the portfolio

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.950
is given by the variance
of the weighted average

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.510
of the individual
returns, which is

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.190
given by this quadratic form
in the covariance matrix.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.350
So we've gone through this--
or you understand, I think,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.070
these calculations from our
discussion in time series.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.170
And that's quite simple.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.310
Now before going into
the theory for this,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.430
let's look at the problem.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.280
Let's look at the
portfolio analysis problem

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.460
in a very simplified setting.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.880
So we're just going
to consider two assets

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.770
and talk about optimal
portfolios investing

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.370
in these two assets.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.410
So m equals 2.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.616
The first asset has
return R_1 with mean 0.15.

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.725
Now I'm going to think of
this as annualized return, so

00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:33.820
a 15% annualized return
and a volatility of 25%.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.070
The second asset has
expected return of 20%

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.340
and a volatility
of 30%, sigma_2.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.320
These assets are
possibly correlated.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.080
We'll let rho denote the
correlation between the two.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.660
And a portfolio-- basically
all the portfolios

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.810
we could invest in, so
long as we are limited

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.520
to a unit of capital
and no shorting,

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.360
are given by portfolios
indexed by w,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.790
basically the amount of money
we invest in the second asset.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.620
So R_w is w R_2
plus 1 minus w R_1.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.780
That's the return
on the portfolio

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.770
that invest in those
proportions in the two assets.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.380
The expected return is
this linear combination,

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.540
which is given in matrix
form in the previous page--

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.310
or in the lecture notes.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.120
And the variance, our
squared volatility is what?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.670
It's 1 minus omega
squared times the variance

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.520
of R_1 plus w squared
times the variance of R_2.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.760
Then we have a covariance
term that comes into play.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.030
Now the mean-variance analysis
that Markowitz addressed

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.205
basically looks at the
feasible portfolio set.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.890
We simplify things
by saying let's focus

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.770
just on the volatility or
variance and the expected

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.810
return of our portfolio.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.420
So we can define the
feasible portfolio

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.770
set as the collection
of volatility return

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.820
pairs for all the assets--
or for all the portfolios.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.980
And well, what is pi
star, that collection?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.050
Basically what's the universe
of possible portfolios

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.069
we could construct?

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.360
In this two dimensional case
it's going to very simple.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.270
In multidimensional cases
it's more complicated.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.250
But what portfolios are optimal?

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.450
Sub-optimal?

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.690
How do we choose or identify
a particular portfolio

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.700
to invest in?

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.270
How's that choice made?

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.990
And is there any special
structure to these portfolios?

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.490
What you'll see in
the lecture today

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.490
is that the Markowitz theory
and extensions of that

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.520
provide really elegant
answers to these questions.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.190
But let's understand
basically what's going on just

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.150
with this two-asset case.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.800
And what I'm going to do
here is just simulate 500

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.200
weekly returns with different
values of the correlation

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.010
between the two assets.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.320
And we want to examine
the cumulative returns

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:26.955
of each asset.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.980
The asset returns in terms
of their means, volatilities,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.580
and correlations,
a plot of pi star,

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.330
and the cumulative
returns of each asset

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.900
with a minimum
variance portfolio.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:47.450
So let me just highlight
here that what we want here

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:54.210
is to be plotting sigma_omega
verses alpha_omega.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.300
And we have two assets.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:09.660
We have basically sigma_1
and alpha_1 corresponds

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.660
to our first asset.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:17.910
Sigma_2 and alpha_2 corresponds
to our second asset.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:31.040
So this point here
corresponds to w equals 0.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:39.150
And the other corresponds to
w equals 1, so R_1 and R_2.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.810
Now, what's going
to happen when we

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:47.060
combine assets in a portfolio?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:54.705
Well, let's take a
look at the simulation.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:18.210
OK, here is a graph
of the simulated asset

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:27.570
returns with basically a mean
returns given by 15%, 25%,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.520
volatility is 20 to 30, and
with an asset correlation of 0.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.400
So here's just a scatter
plot of the weekly returns.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.586
There's basically no
apparent correlation there.

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:40.210
There actually is a
sample correlation,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:44.580
because a sample from
these distributions

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.080
won't have perfectly
0 correlation.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.390
On top, we have graphs of the
cumulative returns of the two

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.200
individual assets.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.890
Rather obviously,
the higher graph

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.760
corresponds to the asset
with higher return, which

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.750
is asset 2.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.350
And the green
corresponds to asset 1.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.860
The graph on the
right, top right,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.820
is the graph of the
feasible set as we allocate

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.020
between asset 1 and asset 2.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:28.380
And so by the
simulation, this curve

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.430
corresponds to the
feasible set of portfolios.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:41.220
And what's really remarkable
is that we can get basically

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.180
a reduction in the
volatility of the portfolio

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.310
without compromising,
and in fact improving,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.250
the return the portfolio.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.260
So if we invest fully in
asset 1, we're at this point.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:06.470
As we increase-- as we start
allocating towards asset 2,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.120
not only does the return of
asset of the portfolio go up,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.360
but volatility goes down.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.650
And let's see, in this
simulation, what I've done

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:26.345
is also plotted the return of
the portfolio corresponding

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.345
to the minimum variance.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.890
So let's just look
the minimum variance

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:42.020
portfolio for a minute.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.040
We have sigma squared
w is equal to 1

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.790
minus w squared plus w
squared sigma_2 squared--

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.580
this is sigma 1 squared.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.520
And then plus 0 in
the case there's

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.160
no correlation between
the two assets.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:06.720
If we want to minimize
this portfolio volatility,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.150
we can take the derivative of
that with respect to the weight

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.770
and set that equal to 0.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.940
So what's that equal to?

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:26.560
Well, it's-- let's see,
did I do this right?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:40.080
Actually just with the
previous notes-- sorry,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.600
R_1 is equal to 0.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:48.340
OK, so we have 2, 1 minus w
sigma_1 squared times minus 1,

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.260
plus 2 w sigma_2
squared is equal to 0.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:09.680
And so solving this, we get
w is equal to-- well, let's

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.670
see, you get 1 over
sigma_1 squared-- sorry,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.740
1 over sigma_2 squared
divided by 1 over sigma_1

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.290
squared plus 1 over
sigma_2 squared.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.800
If you solve this
out, you basically

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.250
get a weighting on the different
assets, which weights them

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.200
inversely proportional to
their squared volatility.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.390
And with this
graph here, you can

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:43.760
see that the blue graph is a bit
closer to asset 1 than to asset

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.050
2's cumulative return.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.470
That corresponds to giving to a
slightly higher weight to asset

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.970
1, because 1 over
sigma_1 squared

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.840
is bigger than 1
over sigma_2 squared.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.190
Well, let's look at
what happens if we

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.630
consider negative correlations
between the two assets.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.590
Well, actually, OK,
before we do that,

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.630
if you were going to choose
one of these portfolios

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.550
for investing, are
there any portfolios

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.840
that you wouldn't invest in?

00:15:23.928 --> 00:15:27.757
And are any of these
portfolios sub-optimal

00:15:27.757 --> 00:15:28.840
in terms of mean-variance?

00:15:31.684 --> 00:15:33.110
AUDIENCE: w1.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.380
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Well,
w1 is certainly infeasible

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.915
because we can increase
its mean and we

00:15:39.915 --> 00:15:42.280
can decrease it's volatility.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.270
So actually all of
these points here

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.060
are really sub-optimal
portfolios.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.690
And from the minimum
variance portfolio,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.530
which is basically getting
us the vertical tangent, all

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.255
the points from here up
to the asset 2, fully

00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:08.440
investing in asset
2 are feasible.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.650
And none of these portfolios
dominates the other.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.175
Basically it's a trade-off
between return and volatility.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.890
OK, so that's a really important
point that there really

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:28.470
are portfolios that you can
just disregard considering

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.840
that there are definite-- well,
when there's zero correlation,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.430
there is a benefit to
diversifying across these two

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.700
assets.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.830
So if you have an asset
and you are considering

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.070
pooling that asset with
another in your portfolio,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.900
if those are fully
uncorrelated, then

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.540
you should be able to
improve your portfolio

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.720
by adding some allocation
to that second asset.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:06.250
Let's look at the a more
negative correlation

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.960
between the two
assets of minus 0.4.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.160
Here, you'll see that
there's basically

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.300
a tilt, negative tilt, to
the scatter plot of returns.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.310
And with the portfolios
of two assets,

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.319
basically, the feasible
set, that feasible set

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:31.910
is actually stretching
further to the left.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.880
So with a negative correlation
between the assets,

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.960
we're actually able to reduce
the volatility even more,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.930
if that's what is
our preference.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:52.830
If we go up here to minus 0.8,
it gets even more exaggerated.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.160
Now what's going to
happen if we have

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.330
a correlation of negative
1 between these two assets?

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.315
AUDIENCE: The
portfolio can have 0?

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.690
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Yes, then
a portfolio of the two assets

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.880
can have zero variability.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:14.550
So indeed with the
hedging strategies,

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.150
one often is considering
investing in assets consisting

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:22.910
of perhaps an underlying
security and some derivative

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.520
on that.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.740
And that derivative,
if it's a future say,

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.140
could have basically a
negative 1 correlation.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.230
So you could essentially
hedge out the volatility

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.320
almost perfectly.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.900
So that special case actually
does exist quite frequently

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.120
and is exploited.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.070
But it falls out just
from the simple analysis

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.570
of this simple simulation.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:51.530
OK, let's also look at the going
to increase in the correlation.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.030
Yes.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.960
AUDIENCE: So if the volatility
of the whole portfolio

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.630
is zero, does that it mean
it will always be constant?

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.750
It will be--

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.460
PETER KEMPTHORNE:
Does that mean what?

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.001
AUDIENCE: So would
that mean since it

00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.100
has zero variance it will
actually be constant over time?

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.165
The whole portfolio?

00:19:07.165 --> 00:19:11.500
PETER KEMPTHORNE: OK, I mean,
if it has zero variance,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.970
it should be constant.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:18.825
Zero variance means that over--
that its value is a constant.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.320
AUDIENCE: Is it a
good idea to do that?

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.110
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Well, in
terms of the markets nothing

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.940
has zero-- almost nothing
has zero volatility.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:45.300
And so indeed-- but in the
pricing theory that Choongbum

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.890
will be discussing in
subsequent lectures,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.690
if we have basically a portfolio
which has no volatility,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.040
then its return should
be equal to whatever

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.320
a risk-free rate ought to be.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.000
And so this particular
portfolio out

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.030
to be structured
so that it achieves

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:08.310
a return equal to a risk-free
rate, barring transaction costs

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:10.280
and frictions and all
that kind of thing.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.940
But yeah.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:21.800
OK, so if we increase the
correlation from 0 to 0.4,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.130
well, we still get a benefit
of diversification but less.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.240
We're basically not able to
lower the variance as much.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:39.570
And it's even more exaggerated
with a correlation a 0.8.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:45.402
Now, in looking
at the simulation,

00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:47.110
one thing I want to
highlight to you now,

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.500
which will come
up later, is here

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:55.000
I've simulated returns according
to Gaussian distributions

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.610
with these means,
volatilities, and correlations.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:03.006
And in the lower left panel,
I give the sample statistics.

00:21:03.006 --> 00:21:04.380
Basically, the
maximum likelihood

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.140
estimate for all the parameters.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.720
And what you'll see is that
these sample estimates differ

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.730
quite a bit from--
well, they differ

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.950
from the theoretical parameters.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.540
In this case, the sample
volatility is almost exactly

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.950
on point for the first asset.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.760
It's a bit below
0.287 for the second.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.380
The sample mean is 0.21, which
is a bit high for the first.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.060
And it's 0.321, which is also
a bit high for the second.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.440
Let's just go back and look
at a couple of the others,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:47.440
because it can get--
OK, well here's

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:55.880
one where the sample
means are 0.144 and 0.343.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.500
And so those are actually quite
different from the population

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.450
parameters.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.160
And at least, the second asset
has a much higher sample mean.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.410
So it's important to note
that sample estimates can

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:14.095
have a certain amount
of variability.

00:22:14.095 --> 00:22:17.360
It turns out that there's
less variability in estimating

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.620
covariances and correlations,
if the assumptions hold,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.880
and greater variability
in the sample means.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.610
So at the end of the
day we really need

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.260
to be very sensitive to
what estimates we use

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.110
and how much uncertainty
there is those.

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:42.530
OK, let's go back to
the lecture notes now.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.100
View, screen, all right.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.740
All right, so we've
just gone through how

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.100
we are evaluating different
portfolios in terms

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:20.130
of the pair of the-- basically
the mean of the portfolio

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.780
and the squared volatility
of the portfolio.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.290
Higher expected returns
are obviously desirable.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:28.690
Low volatility is desirable.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.320
And so what Markowitz
did was to pose

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.830
this is a quadratic
programming problem, where

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:45.250
what we want to do is minimize
the squared volatility

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:49.380
of the portfolio subject
to a constraint on the mean

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.180
of the portfolio and considering
that we're fully invested.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:24:01.280
So this mathematical problem is
a standard convex optimization

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.370
problem, a quadratic programming
problem, which is very simple.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.500
And we solve it by
defining a Lagrangian.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.600
Basically, we take our objective
function of the volatility.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.439
And we want to minimize that.

00:24:16.439 --> 00:24:17.980
We're going to use
a half factor just

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.370
to simplify the computations.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:24.630
And then we add Lagrangians
for different constraints

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.880
of the problem.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.840
So we have lambda_0 times
alpha_0 minus w prime alpha.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.210
We want the mean
return, w prime alpha,

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.510
to be constrained to
equal alpha naught.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.360
And we also want the sum
of the weights, w prime 1_m

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.140
to equal 1.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.640
And the first-order
conditions of the Lagrangian

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.340
basically give us
those two constraints

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.756
for differentiating with respect
to lambda_1 and lambda_2.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.510
The initial
first-order condition

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.410
with respect to the
portfolio weights

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.380
basically allows us to
solve for those weights.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.460
Now, this first-order
condition is

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.910
going to solve our
problem, because if we

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:20.020
take the second-order
derivative of this Lagrangian,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.640
it's going to be sigma.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:34.930
So let me just point out if
we take d squared L by dw dw

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:40.540
prime, that's equal to our
covariance matrix sigma.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.660
And that is a positive definite
or positive semi-definite

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.160
matrix.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.000
So we indeed are
minimizing the problem.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.965
So this is just a generalization
of basically a parabola

00:25:53.965 --> 00:25:55.420
in multi-dimensions.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.370
And we're trying
to minimize that.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.300
Well, what's the
solution to this?

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.850
Well, first we can solve
for w, the weights,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.230
in terms of lambda_1
and lambda_2.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.840
So we take the first equation
of the first-order conditions

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:17.970
and basically pre-multiply
by sigma inverse across.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.570
And we get w_0 is equal to
lambda_1 sigma inverse alpha

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:26.170
plus lambda_2 sigma
inverse the unit vector,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.055
or vector of units.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.440
And then we can just solve
for lambda_1 and lambda_2

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:41.340
by plugging this w_0 solution
into the second two equations.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.410
And these two equations for the
second and third first-order

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:52.035
conditions is just a very
simple set of linear equations.

00:26:52.035 --> 00:27:01.930
We basically have alpha_0 1
is equal to some matrix times

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.960
[lambda_1, lambda_2].

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.460
And that matrix,
a, b, c, is given

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.390
by alpha prime sigma inverse
alpha for the a element.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.200
And the b and c elements are
those corresponding elements.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.305
So this solves the problem.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.170
And the variance of the optimal
portfolio with a given return

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:32.110
can also be solved
by just substituting

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.830
in these solutions.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.840
So we get that for
a given alpha_0,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.400
our target return,
the squared volatility

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.530
of that optimal portfolio
is this has that form.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.840
Now, what's that form?

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.280
It's essentially a
parabola in alpha_0.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:04.860
OK, so when we're looking
at-- is there an eraser?

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.970
here it is-- when we're
looking at this graph

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.140
here in the
two-dimensional case,

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.260
then there's
basically a parabola.

00:28:16.876 --> 00:28:18.250
I can't draw
parabolas very well.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.790
But there's a parabola
between those two points

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.000
that characterizes the thing.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.590
And in multi-dimensional--
multiple assets,

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.746
it's just a multivariate
extension of that.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:45.080
This particular problem can also
be looked at in two other ways.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.460
Before we're looking at
minimizing the variance,

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.570
subject to a constraint
on the expected return.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.170
We can also say,
well, let's maximize

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.000
the return, subject to a
constraint on the volatility.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.220
And that problem basically
has the same Lagrangian.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:12.920
And we can also consider just
maximizing a weighted average

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:19.840
of the return and have
a negative multiple

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:27.500
on the variance and consider
maximizing that expression.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:33.150
This turns out to be the risk
aversion optimization, where

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:42.360
we basically are penalizing
portfolios w for how

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.770
much variance they have.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.490
And the lambda factor
tells us how much penalty

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.840
to associate per variance unit.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:59.110
And these are all
equivalent problems being

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:02.530
solved by the same Lagrangian.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:09.570
And from these problems we can
define the efficient frontier,

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.710
which is the collection of
all possible solutions, where

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:20.440
we range the target
return amongst values that

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.960
are feasible and the
volatility amongst values

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.550
that are feasible as well.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:31.560
So the efficient frontier
will just trace these.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:41.620
And in our two-variable
case, our two-asset case--

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.120
we have sigma and alpha.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.670
We have two assets.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.930
It's basically a
parabola like that.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:55.870
If we have another two assets
that we're investing with,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.600
then if we consider the
two-asset portfolios of just

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.540
these two assets,
there's basically

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.870
another parabola there.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.520
And as we consider different
other assets in the mix,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.250
we basically get
all these parabolas

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.390
of two-asset portfolios.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.230
And then combinations of
those two-asset portfolio

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:20.650
gives us our feasible set.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.190
And so at the end of
the day, we basically

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:30.450
have a convex set of all
feasible assets, which

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.970
define the efficient frontier.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.090
And the efficient
frontier is always

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:43.620
going to be basically the
top side of that curve.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:55.600
Well, let's see, the
next topic considers

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.117
adding basically a risk-free
asset to invest in.

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:00.700
The problem as it's
been stated so far

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.770
says we want to be fully
invested across our m assets.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:07.900
And what are the
optimal portfolios?

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:15.700
Well, what if we want to invest
some of our money, our capital,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.810
just in cash?

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.790
Or not invest our full
capital and invest

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.800
the rest in the portfolio?

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:31.660
So if we consider adding
a risk-free asset,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.740
then this is an asset.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.430
We'll call it the 0th asset.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.320
It has, say, some
expected return or not.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.050
It's risk free.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.520
So that's a constant.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.630
It has zero variance.

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.160
And if we're investing as well
in that possible risky asset,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.270
then we can basically
consider investing w weights

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:56.520
in the risky asset
and 1 minus w times

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:01.590
the unit vector in
the risk-free asset.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.545
And let's see, I want
to draw this graph here.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.550
Let's see.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:21.420
OK, suppose we have
two assets where

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.660
this is the efficient set.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.870
And we consider now allowing
for a risk-free asset

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.330
to be invested in as well.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:37.690
Well, that risk-free asset
is basically this point here.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:46.540
And it has mean
r_0 and variance 0.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:53.840
Now, if we combine this asset
with any of these portfolios,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.530
what's the feasible
set going to be?

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:04.010
Well, we can basically
invest some money

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:07.220
in the risk-free asset
and some in asset 2.

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.179
So we can get any
point along this line.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:18.780
Basically, if we invest
in the risk-free asset--

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.760
if we invest some
fraction in asset 2

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.100
and the remainder in
the risk-free asset,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:33.150
then our expected return
is the linear line

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.760
between r_0 and alpha_2.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.500
And the volatility of
a weighted average--

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.530
of a fraction of asset
2 has a volatility

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:52.050
given by whatever that weight
is times the volatility.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:35:05.430
So this point here corresponds
to, say, w times sigma_2

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:15.860
for its volatility and r_0
plus w times alpha_2 minus r_0.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.750
Now the dramatic thing
is that we actually

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:31.310
are able to achieve an
improvement over points

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.630
on the efficient frontier, such
as, say, the minimum variance

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.258
portfolio.

00:35:38.258 --> 00:35:42.030
And if we consider
the fraction here,

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:46.400
we have a higher return
and a lower variance

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.590
than the minimum
variance portfolio

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.760
that we considered before.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.890
And so investing in
the risk-free asset

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.980
does sort of enlarge
our opportunity

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.190
space quite dramatically.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.130
And there are some very special
results that come from this.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.580
So let's go through
the mathematics

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.420
for solving this problem.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.000
And in the lecture
notes, I'm going

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.020
to go over this pretty
quickly-- really,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.730
when you go through
it slowly you'll say,

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:22.070
oh, this is very
straightforward and logical.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.240
So we're basically going to
minimize the volatility subject

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.510
to the constraint that the
return is equal to alpha_0.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:36.780
We define the Lagrangian and
do the first-order conditions,

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.210
solve those.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:44.010
And if we solve those, we
get-- basically lambda_1

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.520
has this nice form here.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.890
And this is obtained by
just very simple equation

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.120
solving of those two
first-order conditions.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:01.860
And if we have m
assets available

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:08.710
when we look at the
solution, then we

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:13.480
get an optimal
portfolio that has

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.420
a w_0 vector given by this
solution and a lambda_1

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.440
given by this solution.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.610
Now w_0 is the proportion
or is the allocation

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:24.620
to the risky assets.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:35.120
What varies depending on our
target return alpha_naught,

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:43.090
is simply this lambda_1
Lagrangian multiplier.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:48.010
Basically, alpha_0,
our target return,

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.900
only affects the
value of lambda_1.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.520
And our weights
across the risky asset

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:03.080
is a simple multiple of a fixed
vector of relative weights.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.740
And this fixed vector
of relative weights

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.450
is the inverse of a covariance
matrix across the assets

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.590
times alpha minus 1_m R_0.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:23.200
And so what we
have is a portfolio

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:29.950
that basically invests in the
risky assets in the same way.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.860
The only thing that
differs is how much weight

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:35.520
we give to that
particular portfolio.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:40.129
As we increase lambda_1,
then we give more allocation

00:38:40.129 --> 00:38:41.420
to this fixed vector of weight.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.580
So we invest proportionally
in the assets.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.460
And we just scale how
much that overall factor

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.815
is to achieve different
levels of return.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.530
OK, we can get nice, closed-form
expressions for the portfolio

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:08.590
variance just as an extension
of the two-asset case.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.160
Basically the portfolio
variance is a parabola

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.520
in the target return.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:20.660
And so as we increase
our target return,

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.220
we have to increase our
portfolio variability.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.135
There is that trade-off when
we use optimal portfolios.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:40.890
And if we consider the fully
invested optimal portfolio,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:48.000
well, the fully invested
portfolio-- and that's

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.560
nothing in cash,
invest everything

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.960
in the risky
assets-- we actually

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.350
are going to call that
the market portfolio.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.650
And the expressions
here give us the weights

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:06.030
for that market portfolio.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:13.054
And this may look a
little complicated

00:40:13.054 --> 00:40:14.220
in terms of the expressions.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.730
But it's actually quite
simple closed-form expressions

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:21.165
for the expected
return and the variance

00:40:21.165 --> 00:40:22.165
of the market portfolio.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:37.540
And what's happening with
this is we have-- basically,

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:43.300
for the risky assets we
have some efficient or set

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:47.770
of feasible portfolios,
which is all in this range.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:55.430
And then with our risky asset,
we could be investing here.

00:40:55.430 --> 00:41:03.720
And so the optimal
portfolio, in the case

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.120
where we can invest in
the risk-free asset,

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.930
will basically
correspond to sort

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:18.420
of maximizing the mean
return across all portfolios.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.880
So it's actually
going to correspond

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:30.840
to the simple tangent line,
which basically crosses

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:35.780
the market portfolio, which is
the fully invested portfolio.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:50.860
Now, this structure
of the problem

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.760
is actually incredibly powerful.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.830
And there's an important
paper by Tobin,

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:02.540
which states that basically
every portfolio is going

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.870
to-- under these assumptions
for the investment problem--

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.080
every optimal portfolio
invests in a combination

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.840
of the risk-free asset
and the market portfolio.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:25.600
So regardless how much
risk you want to take,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.970
the optimal portfolio
is essentially the same.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.240
It just depends on
how much capital

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.880
you're going to put into
that optimal portfolio.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.510
And so all of the
optimal portfolios

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.320
will invest in the
same risky assets

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.510
as the market portfolio
in same proportions.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.570
And the only difference
is their total weight.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:53.350
Now, plugging in the expressions
for the different Lagrange

00:42:53.350 --> 00:43:00.510
multipliers for a given
portfolio, P, with return--

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.870
and we get that expression.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:05.060
So let me just summarize that.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.140
So suppose we want
the portfolio P such

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:17.660
that the expectation of
our P is equal to alpha_0,

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:42.950
then this portfolio R_P is
going to equal-- basically, it's

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.210
going to invest in the
risk-free asset with 1

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:59.240
minus 1 transpose w_m
plus w_m transpose--

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.250
I'm sorry, w_m times the
return of the market.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:10.840
And the actual weights are
given by this expression

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:19.162
here, which gives us the
expression that I was just

00:44:19.162 --> 00:44:20.162
writing up on the board.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:30.280
We have the expected return
is r_0 plus w_m times market

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.840
return minus r_0.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.510
And the volatility,
sigma squared P,

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.740
is simply the square of
the weight in the market

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.960
times the market volatility.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:54.260
This leads to the definition
of basically the capital market

00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:05.100
line, which is essentially
this line here.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:11.860
This is our capital market line
for the portfolio optimization.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.510
And the structure
of this line is such

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:19.880
that this point for the
market portfolio that

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.070
has volatility given by the
market portfolio's volatility

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:29.860
sigma_m and the return
on the market alpha_m,

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:34.120
or expected value of R_m.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:48.060
And the slope of this line
is given by alpha_m minus r_0

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.480
over sigma_m.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:59.730
And points along the line
are given by r_0 plus sigma_p

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:00.810
times this factor.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:06.930
So this is the
expected value of R_p

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:11.740
is any optimal
portfolio has return

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:18.260
equal to the risk-free
rate plus a multiple

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.090
of the return per risk
of the market portfolio.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:33.820
This term here is called
the price of market risk.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.402
Yes?

00:46:34.402 --> 00:46:36.360
AUDIENCE: Is that the
same as the Sharpe ratio?

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.070
PETER KEMPTHORNE: It's
close to the Sharpe ratio.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:46.550
The Sharpe ratio is--
yes, this is the Sharpe

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.425
ratio for the market portfolio.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:59.540
And so, if we want to
invest in the market,

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.660
our decision is
reduced to how much

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.770
risk are we willing to take.

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:07.970
And the compensation for taking
extra risk is extra return.

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.350
And we achieve that by
essentially investing

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:14.490
in the same portfolio, only we
change the scale at which we're

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:15.700
investing in that portfolio.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.515
So far we've been
considering sort

00:47:27.515 --> 00:47:33.500
of points between being
fully invested in the market

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.570
or fully invested in cash.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:41.960
If we are able to borrow
money at the risk-free rate,

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.175
then we can basically
allocate additional weights

00:47:45.175 --> 00:47:49.360
to the market
portfolio and achieve

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:54.920
points that are beyond--
have higher return,

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.850
higher volatility than
the market portfolio.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.900
We can basically
lever the strategy

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:05.030
by borrowing money and investing
that in this market portfolio.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:14.880
So the efficient frontier,
if we can borrow risklessly,

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.430
would just be the capital
market line extended.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.050
Here's a listing
of the papers that

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:27.450
go through sort of the
classical foundations for this.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.712
These are all
accessible on the web.

00:48:29.712 --> 00:48:31.920
And I encourage you to
actually look at these papers,

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.110
because the arguments
are very straightforward.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:41.660
The motivation and background
is interesting to read.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.310
Virtually everyone on this page
actually has a Nobel Prize,

00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.900
except Lintner, I think he
died before they gave the Nobel

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.060
Prize to Markowitz and
Sharpe, but he certainly

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.035
would've been
included in this case.

00:48:55.035 --> 00:48:57.194
AUDIENCE: And the latest one.

00:48:57.194 --> 00:48:58.360
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Pardon me?

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.310
AUDIENCE: The latest.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.476
PETER KEMPTHORNE: And the
latest one, yes, yes, Fama

00:49:01.476 --> 00:49:04.110
was just awarded,
what, two weeks ago.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:17.410
All right, let's move on to
von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:17.910
Theory.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.070
Now, in the Markowitz
mean-variance analysis

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.110
we sort of reduced
all portfolios

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:31.850
to the properties of what's
their expected return

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.805
and what's their variance or
volatility of the returns.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:43.450
Under what circumstances would
that be a really good decision

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:47.930
to be making for how to
do portfolio optimization,

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.950
portfolio allocations?

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:54.180
Well, the von
Neumann-Morgenstern theory

00:49:54.180 --> 00:50:00.480
is a theory which
motivates making decisions

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:06.120
under uncertainty, where
you should specify a utility

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:12.090
function for your
wealth, and you

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.430
should engage in decisions
that maximize the expected

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.540
utility of your wealth.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:26.120
And the theory is
really very powerful

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:33.870
in that when you're making
decisions under uncertainty,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:37.210
there are sort of rational
things you should do.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.440
If you like higher
return, the decision

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.880
should be consistent
with preferring outcomes

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:49.930
with higher returns.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.200
If you don't like
variability, then you

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.270
should be preferring
returns that

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:58.990
have the same expected return,
that have lower volatility.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:01.700
But depending on how your
utility function is defined,

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.460
you may get different outcomes.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:10.209
And so to set up this problem,
let's just consider the problem

00:51:10.209 --> 00:51:11.250
that Markowitz addressed.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:13.160
You have a one-period
investment.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.790
You start with
initial wealth W_0.

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.360
You're going to
choose a portfolio P.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.490
And the wealth
after one period is

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:24.650
simply going to be 1 plus
the return on that portfolio,

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:29.280
giving terminal wealth W.
And our utility function

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.930
is going to be some quantitative
measure of the outcome, what's

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:34.100
the value to the investor.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:38.490
And we'd simply want to
compute the expected volatility

00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:40.800
of different strategies
and find the strategy that

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.515
maximizes the expected utility.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:51.120
What are the basic properties
of utility functions?

00:51:51.120 --> 00:52:01.420
Well, if we graph over
wealth, our utility of wealth,

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.160
starting at W_0,
our initial wealth,

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:14.790
if we have greater
wealth, presumably we'll

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.220
have greater utility.

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:23.230
So the slope of the utility
function should be increasing.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.300
Perhaps as we get
more and more wealthy,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.870
the marginal benefit
of additional wealth

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:33.530
isn't quite as much as
it was when we were poor.

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:38.100
And so perhaps the curve
for the utility function

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.970
should taper off a bit.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.320
OK, these conditions
would correspond

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:47.090
to the first derivative
being increasing always

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:49.875
and the second derivative
being less than 0 perhaps.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.260
There are definitions
in the literature

00:52:55.260 --> 00:53:00.380
of risk aversion, absolute risk
aversion, and relative risk

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.760
aversion.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.475
And these are
simple functions of

00:53:04.475 --> 00:53:06.850
the first and second derivatives
of the utility function.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.860
To see where these
come into play,

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:13.850
let's assume the utility
function is a smooth function

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:18.550
and consider a Taylor series
approximation of that.

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:21.800
So if we consider expanding
the utility function

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.690
about some base wealth
W star, then it's

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:30.230
simply equal to
that value of W star

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.940
plus first derivative
times W minus W star

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.270
plus 1/2 the second derivative
times the squared deviation

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:39.375
of the wealth from W star.

00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:44.500
And if we take
expectations of this,

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.430
and if W star is
the actual expected

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:54.230
wealth of the random variable,
then this expected utility

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:57.900
is actually proportional
to the expected

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:03.090
wealth minus 1/2 lambda times
the variance of the wealth.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:08.800
So sort of to a second order
of approximation, this expected

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:14.520
utility is a function
which is looking

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.305
at expected return minus a
multiple of the volatility

00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:20.990
of that return, or
the wealth if we're

00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.220
considering it on that scale.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:30.740
So there are various
different utility functions

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.020
that economists
have worked with.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.474
And basically the kinds of
functions they work with

00:54:38.474 --> 00:54:40.515
are all the simple functions
we as mathematicians

00:54:40.515 --> 00:54:43.300
know about, linear functions,
quadratic functions,

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:46.780
exponential functions, power
functions, and log functions.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.820
So these are just the
first ones to come

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.990
to mind for economists perhaps.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.100
But there's actually
some rich theory

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:02.130
in terms of sort of investment
choice with different utility

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:05.480
functions of these types.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:09.870
And there is some interesting
work there in the economics

00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.590
literature.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:16.200
One thing that is
to be pointed out

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:19.760
is that with quadratic
utility, then

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:22.320
if we consider the
expected utility

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.780
under quadratic utility,
that is the expected utility

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.150
function that only
depends on expected

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:31.310
wealth and the variance of
the wealth, which depends only

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.160
on the expected return and
the variance of the return

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.290
of the portfolio.

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:41.870
So if we are working with a
quadratic utility function,

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:45.210
then this mean-variance
analysis is the right thing

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:48.390
to be doing under the
von Neumann-Morgenstern

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:52.010
expected utility theory.

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:58.080
So doing that is a good
decision under that

00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.810
if that's the utility function.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:04.220
Now when is that solution
not to be preferred?

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.950
Well, really it's
not be preferred

00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:11.160
if you have a different
utility function possibly.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.300
And maybe the utility
function should

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.580
be adding some penalties
for skewness or kurtosis.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.160
And that's being ignored here.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:25.620
So extensions can be looked at.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:32.920
An interesting mathematical fact
is that under the assumption,

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.730
or should I say the
imagination, that returns

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:42.180
are Gaussian distributed, then
the sort of means and variances

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.100
of portfolios
completely characterize

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.510
all the distributions
of portfolios of assets,

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:51.500
if the underlying assets
are Gaussian distributions.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.430
So a mean-variance
analysis is actually

00:56:54.430 --> 00:57:00.140
optimal under non-quadratic
utility functions,

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.680
if the underlying assets
are Gaussian distributions,

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.570
because only the means
and variances are

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:11.090
going to characterize
the optimal portfolios

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:12.500
and properties of those.

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:16.360
And I guess, the
stochastic dominance

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.820
of functions of these
variables will generally

00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.800
apply when there's that
corresponding stochastic

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:26.510
dominance in terms of
their means and variances.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:30.160
Anyway, this kind of
theory can get involved.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:35.760
It allows us to extend the basic
model that we consider here.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:40.090
Let's turn then to the topic
of the portfolio constraints.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.800
So far, in looking
at this problem,

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.660
we haven't made any
constraints on the problem.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:52.000
We just want to maximize return,
minimize variance, and consider

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.360
trade-offs between those.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:00.174
With practical portfolio
optimization problems,

00:58:00.174 --> 00:58:02.340
there are different constraints
that come into play.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:08.010
Portfolios that are long
only constrain the weights

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:10.710
to only be positive.

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:14.250
There can be
holding constraints,

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:20.210
which it may be that we don't
want the amount of a given

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.800
asset to be too big.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.400
There's the equity
strategies, you

00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.770
don't want to be
holding-- if you

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:32.210
have a sort of medium-frequency
trading strategy in equities,

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:35.180
you don't want to be holding
much more than the trading

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:39.240
volume of a few hours or
maybe a day in the asset,

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.380
because if you happen
to have to sell it,

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:47.100
there really won't be
liquidity to trade that.

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.600
But we can add--

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.800
There's a simple linear
constraints on the holdings.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:53.300
There could be
turnover constraints.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:05.270
If we're considering basically
adjusting our portfolio

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:09.962
from one period
to the next, there

00:59:09.962 --> 00:59:11.920
are limits in terms of
how much we can actually

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:15.180
trade of the different assets.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.720
There can be benchmark
exposure constraints.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:22.280
Suppose we want to invest
in a portfolio that's

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:30.040
very much like there's a
market index, say, the S&amp;P 500.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.660
But we want to try and do
better than the S&amp;P 500.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:42.120
But we want to protect ourselves
from basically not being

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:46.540
very close to the benchmark
if our bets, basically,

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:48.670
an allocation, are wrong.

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:55.210
Then one basically can
control how different

00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:59.790
from the benchmark
allocation we are limit,

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:04.910
then limit that departure
so we can basically

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:08.260
limit how far from the benchmark
weights we want our portfolio

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.140
to be.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.690
And this is useful basically
for considering strategies

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:19.430
that do as well or better than
particular benchmark indices.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.650
Related to this is our
tracking error constraints.

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:31.180
In addition to basically not
having allocation weights that

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:35.540
depart much from the
benchmark weights,

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.980
we can consider how
much variation is there

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:44.790
in our portfolio compared
with an underlying benchmark.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:48.770
And we can consider tracking
error between our portfolio

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.660
P and the underlying benchmark
and measure that tracking error

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.000
in terms of variability,
that difference,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.149
and want to control that.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:04.970
There are also risk
factor constraints.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:08.080
In equity markets there
are many different factors

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.610
that affect returns.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:19.040
And these factors can be
identified empirically

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.690
and controlled for by
limiting the exposure

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:28.030
to different factors
in the portfolio.

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:33.570
We'll see this in next lecture.

01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:36.980
But basically if there
are underlying factors

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:42.890
f, which-- basically a
return on the asset i

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:49.470
can be explained by sort of an
idiosyncratic alpha for that

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:54.360
asset, plus certain
correlations with market factors

01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.550
f, and then a residual
innovation epsilon.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:08.550
And so the returns on these
assets can be explained perhaps

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:15.480
50% by underlying market forces,
and given by the underlying

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.160
factors f_(j, t), which
are constant across i.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.440
So these are affecting all
the stocks with different

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.430
coefficients beta_(i,k).

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:27.060
And in our portfolio,
we may want

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.580
to limit the exposure
to a given factor.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.780
And with many
strategies, you actually

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:39.410
want to neutralize the portfolio
to those market risk factors.

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:41.390
So we can actually
constrain our weights

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:46.575
to have zero exposure across
these different market factors.

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:56.450
There are other constraints,
minimum transaction size--

01:02:56.450 --> 01:03:00.120
generally it's the case
that trades in equities

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.680
are in 100 share units,
although that's changing.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.880
There can be minimum
holding sizes.

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.990
And there's also
integer constraints

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:13.260
that can be applied.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.750
If you're trading assets that
have sort of large values,

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:22.857
then these integer constraints
actually come into play.

01:03:22.857 --> 01:03:24.690
If you're trading Google
stock, and how much

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:26.120
is Google stock worth now?

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.237
AUDIENCE: $800.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:28.820
PETER KEMPTHORNE:
Something like that.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.997
So compare that with Ford, which
is like $50, or I don't know,

01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:36.760
but there's orders of
magnitude difference.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.036
So integer constraints
can come into play.

01:03:39.036 --> 01:03:40.660
If you're dealing in
a very large size,

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.660
then these things don't
really have much impact.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:48.650
But they can with
smaller portfolios.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:51.620
Now, all of these
different constraints

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.950
can be expressed as linear
and quadratic constraints

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:55.600
on the weights.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:02.030
So the set-up for the
portfolio optimization problem

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.040
can be the same as
before, except we

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.040
add in these
additional constraints.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.134
So we basically add in
additional Lagrange multipliers

01:04:10.134 --> 01:04:11.550
times these
particular constraints

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.300
with their linear quadratic.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.060
And we can implement the
portfolio optimization problem

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.450
that way.

01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:24.050
Let me turn to an example.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:54.040
Let's go-- OK, I want to
go through an example.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:16.400
of-- OK, I want to consider US
sector exchange-traded funds

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.130
between 2009 and last week.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:26.100
Basically, exchange-traded
funds allow

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.580
you to invest in equity markets
with sort of single assets

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.615
that represent
different sectors.

01:05:33.615 --> 01:05:34.990
The ones that are
considered here

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:38.770
are basically
spider-traded funds,

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:43.220
which invest in the different
major industrial sectors

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:47.230
of the US market,
ranging from materials,

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.400
health care, consumer
staples, down

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.650
to technology and utilities.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:02.490
Here is a graph of
the cumulative returns

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:09.690
of these nine different
exchange-traded funds

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:17.040
and over the period from
2009 up through last week.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.210
And what one can
see is basically

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:22.700
they perform differently.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:26.060
And what I'd like to do
is just examines what

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:30.110
would have been an
optimal allocation

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.980
across these exchange-traded
funds over this period.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.910
So basically looking
back at the data

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:43.690
and seeing how our
portfolio analysis

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:49.630
tools would result in particular
application allocations.

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.370
So we can look at the
risk versus return

01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.890
annualized of these.

01:06:54.890 --> 01:07:09.610
Let's see-- this is-- I
guess that good enough.

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.300
Anyway, what you can see
is a volatility range

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.510
between 0 and 30.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:19.630
Annualized want return
between 0 and 25.

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:23.880
We have the different
sectors in this plot.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:27.970
So this is our
feasible set-- this

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:32.060
is the plot of return versus
volatility for these nine

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.840
exchange-traded funds.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:35.820
This happens to be utilities.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.680
There's financials over there.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.450
Here's consumer staples.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:41.970
Very top is a consumer
discretionary.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.880
Let's see, I applied a
mean-variance optimization

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.740
to this problem,
assuming that there's

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:06.240
a constraint of 30% of
the capital per asset.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.970
So we don't want to
invest more than 30%

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:12.080
of the capital in any
single exchange-traded fund.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:23.160
And this graph here shows how,
as we vary our target return

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.340
from sort of the
minimum value up

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.899
to the maximum value for
being fully invested,

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:31.390
how much of the capital
we're going to invest

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:34.005
in the different sectors.

01:08:34.005 --> 01:08:35.880
So what you can see is
this yellow one, which

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.910
is consumer staples, is coming
in with a really high weight.

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:45.910
And the green is
energy-- let's see,

01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:49.229
I think it's energy--
that is the next one.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:52.529
And orange is health.

01:08:52.529 --> 01:09:02.170
And what's important
to see is that when

01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:07.130
we're looking at sort of the
lower range of the returns,

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:10.790
basically expecting returns
above the risk-free rate that's

01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:15.810
very low, then the
relative proportion

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:18.029
investment in the different
assets is the same.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.660
Basically, these allocations
are slowly scaling up,

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:21.714
just linearly.

01:09:21.714 --> 01:09:24.529
And that corresponds
to investing

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:30.240
in the optimal portfolio without
constraints with a fixed value.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.760
But once we hit the 30%
then that constraint

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.189
starts to be active.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:37.689
And we can't invest
anymore in that.

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:41.160
So we have to add more
to other securities.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:49.300
And so basically more is given
to the consumers discretionary

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.200
and the other.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.760
Now actually here's another
graph of the same data,

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.400
just stacking the allocation.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:02.220
So we consider ranging from how
are we investing our capital.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:05.860
This dark red is how much
money we invest in cash.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.240
And then these
colored lines indicate

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:10.920
by their vertical
length how much

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:15.120
we're investing in the
different exchange traded funds.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:20.190
So basically as
the constraints get

01:10:20.190 --> 01:10:24.110
hit, the portfolio
sort of change

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:26.230
in terms of their
overall structure.

01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:32.160
And what can happen
is-- actually

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.720
as we're trying to achieve
more and more return,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.010
well, there may
not be assets that

01:10:38.010 --> 01:10:40.390
provide that additional
return, or there

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:43.610
may be a very few assets
that provide that return.

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:47.910
And so in this case,
technology stocks

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.820
are coming in as
we're trying to get

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:54.050
really high levels of return
in our optimal portfolios.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:58.880
And so if we really
want that higher return,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.840
that's going to
come at higher risk.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.490
And we actually
are de-allocating

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:11.560
some from the consumer staples
and consumer discretionary

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.970
at that point.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:27.000
OK, here's a graph of the
efficient frontier as estimated

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.520
with the data.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.900
And what you can see is
that these portfolios,

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.090
optimal portfolios,
yield improvements

01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:39.820
over each of the individual
exchange-traded funds,

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.930
in terms of having higher
return with lower risk.

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:52.990
And if we consider just a
target return of 10%-- OK,

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:54.960
there's the portfolio.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.350
I've graphed here
sort of in solid blue

01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:02.620
what the optimal portfolio
with a 10% volatility.

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.450
That's the solid
blue line there.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:14.370
So these are the results with
this 30% capital constraint.

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:16.540
Now how is this
problem going to change

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.811
if we reduce the capital
constraint from 30% per asset

01:12:20.811 --> 01:12:21.310
to 15%?

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:31.582
Who can comment on
what will change?

01:12:31.582 --> 01:12:33.037
AUDIENCE: I'm a little confused.

01:12:33.037 --> 01:12:35.120
Could you put a constraint
on the risk-free asset.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.203
Could you do that as well?

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.570
PETER KEMPTHORNE: Well, the
risk-free asset has no risk.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:50.122
And so putting a
constraint-- well,

01:12:50.122 --> 01:12:52.080
you could put a constraint
on it in terms of it

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.010
not going negative and it
not being greater than one.

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.430
So in fact that is a constraint.

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:58.138
Those are constraints
being imposed here.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:09.150
But, I guess, in some-- well,
there are, like I guess,

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:11.960
endowments, say, that have
investment policies that

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.480
say that they want a certain
fraction assets invested

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.210
in risky assets and not in cash.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:23.190
So that is a
realistic constraint

01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:25.510
in certain circumstances.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:30.890
And this is just highlighting
how the allocations vary

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:32.950
across the risky
asset if we only

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:37.000
have very simple constraints
on the cash investment.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.030
Well, the question
I want to focus on

01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:44.542
is what happens if we make
the maximum allocation

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:45.500
constraint more severe.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.580
So it's 15% instead of 30%.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:55.030
Then what's going to happen is
these capital constraints are

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.820
going to start hitting sooner.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:03.320
So we have to allocate to the
other exchange traded funds.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.937
So let me show you how that
works out with the same graph.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:24.500
Let's see-- OK, let me just
close that and then we go here.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.120
OK, this shows with
a 15% allocation,

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.270
how the allocations vary.

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:39.890
And I'll be posting this
on the course website.

01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:44.950
But it turns out the efficient
frontier is actually lower.

01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:48.390
Basically, for higher
returns, we actually

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:51.571
can't get those higher
returns by getting

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:52.820
the biggest bang for the buck.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.480
We don't want to allocate
too much to those higher

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.620
return, higher risk securities.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:03.070
And so the optimal, the
efficient frontier as estimated

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.520
basically slopes down.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:15.840
Now, with this
particular example

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.230
of these exchange-traded
funds and how

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:23.210
you allocate across those,
this provides some insight

01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:26.990
into portfolio optimization.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.700
It's not really a
realistic setting,

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.310
because we're
looking over the past

01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:33.860
and using the actual
sample performance

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.820
to define these portfolios.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:42.680
Let me just highlight an
example of applying these kinds

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:51.440
of methods with a-- is it here?

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:51.980
Yep, OK.

01:16:04.642 --> 01:16:07.077
Is that the right graph?

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:16.170
OK, suppose we
consider not investing

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.860
in exchange-traded funds.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.310
But we are a hedge fund.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:24.390
And we have sector
pricing models

01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:26.910
across all these
different sectors.

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:31.320
And what we can do is
consider going long/short

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.470
in these sectors.

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:38.330
And in fact, we consider sort
of a market-neutral strategy,

01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:44.920
sector by sector, and
consider investing sector

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.700
by sector in these different
sector-based models.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.460
OK, here's a graph of
different multi-factor pricing

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.940
models for trading
market-neutral programs

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.790
within each of the nine
industrial sectors,

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:04.840
the same ones corresponding
to the exchange-traded funds.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:08.720
And because these strategies
are market-neutral,

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.080
the sort of total
returns over-- this

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:18.340
is a five-year period--
are rather modest, namely

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:26.530
sort of 60% for some of the
models, 20% for other models

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:30.660
What's particularly
relevant with these models

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:35.400
though is that they tend
to be less correlated.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:41.900
And the diversification
benefits can be rather dramatic.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:47.010
And so here is a graph of
the optimal allocations

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:51.720
across these different
sector market-neutral models.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.040
And we can see
that this red model

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:55.860
is getting a lot of weight.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:18:00.140
That actually is
the utility sector.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:13.210
And then these other models
are industrials and energy.

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:29.070
And so if we consider
investing in these,

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:33.580
we can actually achieve a
target volatility of 10%--

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.370
we're going to achieve
this solid blue line--

01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:39.090
as the portfolio strategy.

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:43.250
And one can see how by combining
these assets together--

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.190
these assets are different
market-neutral trading

01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:49.660
models-- we have to get
quite a bit of benefit

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.830
from the portfolio optimization.

01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:56.000
And the greater benefit in
the portfolio optimization

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.114
is because these strategies tend
to have much lower correlations

01:19:02.114 --> 01:19:02.780
with each other.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:22.821
Let's go back now, finish up
with-- how do we go back here?

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.288
Where's my red dot?

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:15.650
OK, just to finish up the
discussion, with these methods

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:18.300
it's important to highlight
that what we've been using

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.690
were estimated returns,
estimated volatilities,

01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:21.830
and correlations.

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:27.720
And these estimates can have
a huge impact on the results.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.310
There's basically choices
of estimation period.

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:32.540
There's estimation error.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:37.790
Different techniques can
modulate these issues.

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:40.090
Exponential moving
average are often applied.

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:44.590
Having dynamic factor
models is used.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:46.494
Basically, rather than
using sample estimates

01:20:46.494 --> 01:20:47.910
of the variance/covariance
matrix,

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:52.120
using factor models to estimate
the variance-covariance matrix

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:59.450
results in more precise
inputs to the optimization.

01:20:59.450 --> 01:21:03.834
And finally, just with
different risk measures--

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:05.625
we've been focusing on
portfolio volatility

01:21:05.625 --> 01:21:10.180
and minimizing that-- the
methodologies can be extended

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:13.010
to have different
measures of risk--

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:17.330
mean absolute deviation, for
example, or semi-variance.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.230
In terms of the motivation
for squared volatility

01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:29.100
and minimizing that, you'll
recall that in likelihood

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.746
analysis of Gaussian
distributions,

01:21:31.746 --> 01:21:33.620
the sort of squared
deviations from the means

01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.390
are characterizing variability.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:40.870
Well, if we focus on mean
absolute deviation, then

01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:44.440
probability distributions
where the distributions relate

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:47.072
to the absolute deviation
from the mean characterizing

01:21:47.072 --> 01:21:49.720
the distribution
might be appropriate.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.460
And indeed, distributions
with heavier tails,

01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.000
like exponential
distributions, are

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.410
appropriate when we consider
mean absolute deviation.

01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:02.840
So some alternate
risk measures are

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.260
appropriate when the
volatility measure

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:09.710
itself isn't necessarily
appropriate because

01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:12.400
of the distributional
assumptions.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.860
Semi-variance was introduced
actually by Markowitz,

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:18.590
where you're interested in
controlling the downside risk

01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:20.140
as opposed to the upside risk.

01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:25.540
There's value-at-risk
measures which

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:30.280
are now completely standard
in portfolio management

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:38.700
and management of risky assets,
where one is actually-- well,

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:40.335
this is introduced
by Ken Abbott in one

01:22:40.335 --> 01:22:42.270
of the first few lectures.

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:46.600
Value at risk is
a very simple idea

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:51.850
of characterizing
what outcome is

01:22:51.850 --> 01:22:54.940
sort of the threshold
of extreme, at say

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:58.840
the 5% level or the 1%
level, and to basically keep

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.520
and monitor the value at risk.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:03.390
So if we had a risk
that was basically

01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:06.610
in the worst 5%
or 1% of the time.

01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:08.130
What is that level?

01:23:08.130 --> 01:23:10.600
That's the value at risk.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:17.130
That as a nice risk measure is
simple to define and reasonably

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:19.400
simple to estimate.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.950
But it doesn't characterize sort
of what the potential exposure

01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.680
is if you exceed that.

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.060
And there are
extensions of that.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.730
The conditional
value at risk which

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:32.480
is looking at the
expected loss given

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:35.230
that you exceed the
value at risk threshold.

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:40.040
And this method is
now-- I think it's

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:47.950
been going to be incorporated
into regulatory requirements

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:50.180
for banks in terms of
how they measure risk.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.950
Right now, I believe it's
almost all value at risk.

01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:56.670
Extensions like this
conditional value at risk

01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:00.900
is definitely going
to be applied.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:04.220
And in the discussion of
different risk measures,

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:05.840
there's literature
talking about what

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.630
are appropriate risk measures
and how do we define those.

01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:13.010
Well, it really depends
on what your assets are

01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:20.190
and if your assets are simply
simple investments in stocks

01:24:20.190 --> 01:24:25.720
or bonds, sort of cash
assets or cash instruments,

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.530
then value at risk
is quite reasonable.

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:30.890
If you're investing
in derivatives,

01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:36.135
which have non-linear payoffs,
then things get complicated.

01:24:36.135 --> 01:24:42.900
And so things need to be handled
on a case by case basis there.

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.174
But if you're interested
in risk analysis,

01:24:45.174 --> 01:24:47.340
there's a whole discussion
on coherent risk measures

01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:50.479
that you can look into.

01:24:50.479 --> 01:24:51.520
That's quite interesting.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.720
OK, let's stop there.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.570
Thank you.
