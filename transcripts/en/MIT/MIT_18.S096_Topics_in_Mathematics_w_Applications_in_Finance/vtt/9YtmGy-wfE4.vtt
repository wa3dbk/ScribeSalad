00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.110
PROFESSOR: So let's begin.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.600
Today, I'm going to
review linear algebra.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.740
So I'm assuming that you
already took some linear algebra

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.390
course.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.160
And I'm going to just review
the relevant content that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.460
will appear again and again
throughout the course.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.070
But do interrupt me if some
concepts are not clear,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.150
if you don't remember some
concept from linear algebra.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.910
I hope you do.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.470
But please let me know.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.450
I just don't know.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.850
You have very different
background knowledge.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.390
So it's hard to tune
to one special group.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.590
So I tailored this
lecture notes so that it's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.800
a review for those who took
the most basic linear algebra

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.970
course.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.660
So if you already
have that experience,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.580
and don't understand it, please
feel free to interrupt me.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.570
So I'm going to start by
talking about matrices.

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:24.180
A matrix, in a very
simple form, is just

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.820
a collection of numbers.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.620
For example
[1, 2, 3; 2, 3, 4;  4, 5, 10].

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.490
You can pick any number of
rows, any number of columns.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.680
You just write down
numbers in a square format.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.320
And that's the matrix.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.810
What's special about it?

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.480
So what kind of data can
you arrange in a matrix?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.840
So I'll take an example,
which looks relevant to us.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.850
So for example, we can index the
rows by stocks, by companies,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.590
like Apple.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.350
Morgan Stanley should be
there, and then Google.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.765
And then maybe we can
index the column by dates.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.920
I'll say July 1st, October
1st, September 1st.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.930
And the numbers, you can
pick whatever data you want.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.630
But probably the
sensible data will

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.310
be the stock price on that day.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.750
I don't know for example
400, 500, and 5,000.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930
That would be great.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.950
So these kind of data,
that's just the matrix.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.230
So defining a matrix
is really simple.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.870
But why is it so powerful?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.080
So that's an application
point of view,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.980
just as a collection of data.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.610
But from a theoretical
point of view,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:10.860
a matrix, an m by n
matrix, is an operator.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.960
It defines a linear
transformation.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.250
A defines a linear
transformation

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.660
from the vector space,
n-dimensional vector

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.779
space to the m-dimensional
vector space.

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.528
That sounds a lot more
abstract than this.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.730
So for example, let's just
take a very small example.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:39.540
If I use a 2 by 2
matrix, [2, 0;  0, 3].

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.589
Then [2, 0; 0, 3] times, let's
say [1, 1] is just [2, 3].

00:03:53.122 --> 00:03:54.400
Does that makes sense?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.060
It's just matrix multiplication.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.860
So now try to combine
the point of view.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.500
What does it mean to have a
linear transformation defined

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.690
by a data set?

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.370
And things start
to get confusing.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.040
What is it?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.790
Why does a data set define
a linear transformation?

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.500
And does it have any
sensible meaning?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.209
So that's a good question
to have in mind today.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.410
And try to remember
this question.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.040
Because today I'll
try to really develop

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.530
a theory of eigenvalues and
eigenvectors in a purely

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.860
theoretical language.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.140
But it can still be
applied to these data sets,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.030
and give very
important properties

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.130
and very important quantities.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.030
You can get some useful
information out of it.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.640
Try to make sense out
of why it happens.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.830
So that will be the goal today,
to really treat linear algebra

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.120
as a theoretical thing.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.816
But remember that there's some
data set, like really data set

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:05.315
underlying.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.522
This doesn't go up.

00:05:09.522 --> 00:05:13.230
That was a bad choice
for my first board.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.730
Sorry.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:30.880
So the most important concepts
for us are the eigenvalues

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.390
and eigenvectors
of a matrix, which

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:47.740
is defined as a real number,
lambda, and vector v,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:06:02.250
is an eigenvalue, and
eigenvector of a matrix A,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:09.120
if A times v is equal to
lambda times V. We also

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:17.925
say that v is an eigenvector
corresponding to lambda.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.570
So remember eigenvalues
and eigenvectors always

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.580
come in pairs.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.710
And they are defined by the
property that A*v = lambda*v.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.860
First question, does all
matrix have eigenvalues

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.604
and eigenvectors?

00:06:41.508 --> 00:06:43.930
Nope?

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.620
So Av-- It looks like this
is a very strange equation

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.700
to satisfy.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.640
But if you change it in this
form, (A - lambda I)v = 0.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.040
That still looks strange.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.480
But at least you
understand that-- it's

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.810
an only if, this can happen
only if this can happen.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:16.610
Happens only if A - lambda
I does not have full rank.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:24.065
So determinant of (A - lambda I)
is equal to 0, if and only if,

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:24.680
in fact.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.913
So now comes a very
interesting observation.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:45.400
det(A - lambda I) is a
polynomial of degree n.

00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:49.481
I made a mistake.

00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:52.645
I should have said, this is
only for n by n matrices.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.520
This is only for
square matrices.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.630
Sorry.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.430
It's a polynomial of degree n.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.444
That means it has a solution.

00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:11.435
It has to give n
in terms of lambda.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.110
So it has a solution.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.430
It might be a complex number.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.215
I'm really sorry.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:28.790
I'm nervous in
front of the video.

00:08:32.974 --> 00:08:35.935
I understand why you were saying
that is doesn't necessarily

00:08:35.935 --> 00:08:37.530
exist.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.330
Let me repeat.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.640
I made a few mistakes here.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.510
So let me repeat here.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:49.650
For n by n matrix A, a complex
number lambda, and the vector

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.189
v, is an eigenvalue
and eigenvector

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:54.480
if it satisfies this condition.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.780
It doesn't have to be real.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.500
Sorry about that.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.880
And now if we
rephrase it this way,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.130
because this is a
polynomial, it always

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.620
has at least one solution.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.670
That was just a side point.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.970
Very theoretical.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.330
So we see that there
always exists at least one

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.455
eigenvalue and eigenvector.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.230
Now we saw its existence, what
is the geometrical meaning

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.208
of it?

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.220
Now let's go back to the linear
transformation point of view.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.990
So suppose A is a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:58.510
Then A takes the vector in R^3
and transforms it into another

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.320
vector in R^3.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.160
But if you have this
relation, what's

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.350
going to happen is
A, when applied to v,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.160
it will just scale the vector
v. If this was the original v,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.590
A of v will just be
lambda times this vector.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.440
That will be our Av, which
is equal to lambda v.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.160
So eigenvectors are
those special vectors

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.870
which when applied this
linear transformation just

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:39.620
get scaled by some amount, where
that amount is exactly lambda.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.860
So what we established so
far, what we recall so far

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.650
is every n by n matrix has
at least one such direction.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.830
There is some vector where the
linear transformation defined

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.005
by A just scales that vector.

00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.630
Which is quite
interesting, if you ever

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.830
thought about it before.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.110
There's no reason such
vector should exist.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.640
Of course I'm
lying a little bit.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.445
Because these might
be complex vectors.

00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:10.410
But at least in the
complex world it's true.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:19.070
So if you think about
this, this is very helpful.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:23.520
It gives you the vectors-- from
these vectors' point of view,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.590
this linear transformation
is really easy to understand.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.000
That's why eigenvalues and
eigenvector are so good.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.970
It breaks down the
linear transformation

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.420
into really simple operations.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.110
Let me formalize that
a little bit more.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:50.110
So in an extreme case a
matrix, an n by n matrix A,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:58.370
we call it
diagonalizable, if there

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:06.800
exists an orthonormal
matrix, I'll

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:20.920
call what it is, U, such that
A is equal to U times D times U

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:33.540
inverse for a diagonal matrix D.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.754
Let me iterate through
this a little bit.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.140
What is an orthonormal matrix?

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.530
It's a matrix defined by the
relation U times U transposed

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.480
is equal to the identity.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.330
What is a diagonal matrix?

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.090
It's a matrix whose
nonzero entries are all

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.192
on the diagonal.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.626
All the rest are zero.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.800
Why is it so good to
have this decomposition?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.270
What does it mean to have an
orthonormal matrix like this?

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:16.140
It means basically I'll just
explain what's happening.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.720
If that happens, if a
matrix is diagonalizable,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.805
if this A is
diagonalizable, there

00:13:20.805 --> 00:13:28.560
will be three directions,
v_1, v_2, v_3,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.570
such that when you apply this
A, v_1 scales by some lambda_1.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.240
v_2 scales by some lambda_2.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.244
And v_3 scales by some lambda_3.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.410
So we can completely understand
the transformation A,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.980
just in terms of
these three vectors.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:05.610
So this, the stuff here will
be the most important things

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.250
you'll use in linear algebra
throughout this course.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.390
So let me repeat
it really slowly.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.730
So an eigenvalue and eigenvector
is defined by this relation.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.660
We know that there are at least
one eigenvalue for each matrix,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.310
and there is an eigenvector
corresponding to it.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.570
And eigenvectors have
this geometrical meaning

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.930
where-- a vector
is an eigenvector,

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.780
if the linear
transformation defined

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.300
by A just scales that vector.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.670
So for our setting,
the real good matrices

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.430
are the matrices which
can be broken down

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.190
into these directions.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.180
And those directions
are defined by this U.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.020
And D defines how
much it will scale.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:15:02.110
So in this case U will
be our v_1, v_2, v_3.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:07.887
And D will be our lambda_1,
lambda_2, lambda_3 all 0.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.890
Any questions so far?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.650
So that is abstract.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.650
Now remember the question
I posed in the beginning.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:33.500
So remember that matrix where we
had stocks and dates and stock

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.520
prices in the entries?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:40.145
What will an eigenvector
of that matrix mean?

00:15:40.145 --> 00:15:41.736
What will an eigenvalue mean?

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:46.620
So try to think
about that question.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.750
It's not like it will have
some physical counterpart.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.600
But there's some really
interesting things

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.380
going on there.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.510
The bad news is that not all
matrices are diagonalizable.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.460
If a matrix is diagonalizable,
it's really easy

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.600
to understand what it does.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.950
Because it really breaks down
into these three directions,

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.005
if it's a 3 by 3.

00:16:24.005 --> 00:16:27.280
If it's an n by n, it breaks
down into n directions.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.090
Unfortunately, not all
matrices are diagonalizable.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.970
But there is a
very special class

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.330
of matrices which are
always diagonalizable.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.640
And fortunately we
will see those matrices

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.340
throughout the course.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.260
Most of the matrices,
n by n matrices,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.070
we will study, fall
into this category.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:17:01.970
So an n by n matrix
A is symmetric

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.550
if A is equal to A transpose.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:10.000
Before proceeding,
please raise your hand

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.900
if you're familiar with
all the concepts so far.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.400
OK.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.180
Good feeling.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.609
So a matrix is symmetric if
it's equal to its transpose.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:27.710
A transpose is obtained
by taking the mirror

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.225
image across the diagonal.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:44.720
And then it is known that
all symmetric matrices

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.117
are diagonalizable.

00:17:47.117 --> 00:17:50.817
Ah, I've made another mistake.

00:17:50.817 --> 00:17:51.400
Orthonormally.

00:17:55.558 --> 00:18:06.970
So with this I missed matrices
orthonormally diagonalizable.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:13.190
So it's diagonalizable if
we drop this condition,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.790
and replace it
with an invertible.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.300
So symmetric matrices
are really good.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.920
And fortunately most of the n
by n matrices that we will study

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.880
are symmetric.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.640
Just by the nature of
it, it will be symmetric.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.030
The one I gave as an
example is not symmetric.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.536
It's not symmetric.

00:18:44.536 --> 00:18:49.770
But I will address
that issue in a minute.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:19:00.326
And another important
thing is symmetric matrices

00:19:00.326 --> 00:19:03.128
have real eigenvalues.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.950
So really this geometrical
picture just the--

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.891
for symmetric
matrices, this picture

00:19:18.891 --> 00:19:20.807
is really the picture
you should have in mind.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:36.870
So proof of Theorem 2.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:58.610
Suppose lambda is an eigenvalue
with eigenvector v. Then

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.190
by definition we have this.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.710
Now multiply v
transposed on both sides.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:20.150
It is lambda times the norm v.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:34.732
Now take the complex
conjugate-- Real symmetric.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:47.540
And then first A conjugate,
we have v^T A^T v,

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.965
and then take the
conjugate of it.

00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:57.020
Then we get lambda...

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:19.490
v. And this side is
equal to v^T A^T v.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:27.760
But because A is real symmetric,
we see that A is equal

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.860
to the conjugate of
complex conjugate of A.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.760
So this expression and this
expression is the same.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.730
The right side should
also be the same.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.136
That means lambda is equal
to the conjugate of lambda.

00:21:43.136 --> 00:21:44.780
So lambda has to be a real.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.660
So Theorem 1 is a little
bit more complicated,

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.490
and it involves more
advanced concepts

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:13.500
like basis and linear
subspace, and so on.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.210
And those concepts
are not really

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.440
important for this class.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.910
So I'll just skip the proof.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.900
But it's really important to
remember these two theorems.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.760
Wherever you see
a symmetric matrix

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.900
you should really feel like
you have control on it.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.730
Because you can diagonalize it.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.052
And moreover, all
eigenvalues are real,

00:22:38.052 --> 00:22:40.562
and you have really good
control on symmetric matrices.

00:22:44.891 --> 00:22:48.050
That's good.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.170
That was when
everything went well.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.140
We can diagonalize it.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.760
So, so far we saw that if
for a symmetric matrix,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.090
we can diagonalize it.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.450
It's really easy to understand.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.330
But what about general matrices?

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.590
In general, not all matrices are
diagonalizable, first of all.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.910
But sometimes we still want
to decomposition like this.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:53.590
So diagonalization was A equals
U times D times U inverse.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.500
But we want something similar.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.280
We want to understand.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:15.020
So our goal, we want to
still understand the matrix,

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:22.945
give a matrix A through simple
operations, such as scaling.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.800
When the matrix was a
diagonalizable matrix this

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.554
was done, this was possible.

00:24:33.554 --> 00:24:35.470
Unfortunately, it's not
always diagonalizable.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.530
So we have to do something else.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.780
So that's what I
want to talk about.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.860
And luckily the
good news is there

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.600
is a nice tool we can
use for all matrices,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.360
even those slightly weaker,
in fact, a little bit more

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.760
weaker than this
diagonalization.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.580
But still it distills some
very important information

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.407
of the matrix.

00:25:03.407 --> 00:25:05.240
So it's called singular
value decomposition.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.350
So this will be our second
tool of understanding matrices.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.880
It's very similar to
this diagonalization,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.210
or in other words I call this
eigenvalue decomposition.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400
But it has a slightly
different form.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.310
So what is its form?

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.770
So theorem.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.874
Let A be an m by n matrix.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:26:12.400
Then there always exists
orthonormal matrices

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:25.530
U and V such that A is
equal to U times sigma times

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.340
V transpose.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:36.880
For some diagonal matrix sigma.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.980
Let me parse through the
theorem a little bit more.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.670
Whenever you're
given a matrix, it

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.060
doesn't even have to be
a square matrix anymore.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.040
It can be non-symmetric.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.400
So whenever we're given an
m by n matrix, in general,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.110
there always exists
two matrices, U and V,

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.510
which are orthonormal,
such that A

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.380
can be decomposed as U times
sigma times V transposed, where

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.290
sigma is a diagonal matrix.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.340
But now the size of the
matrix are important

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.740
so U is an m by n matrix,
sigma is an m by n matrix,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.910
and V is an n by n matrix.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:21.010
That just denotes the size,
the dimensions of the matrix.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:25.130
So what does it mean for an
m by n matrix to be diagonal?

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.410
It just means the same thing.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.640
So only the (i,i) entries
are allowed to be nonzero.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.650
So that was just
a bunch of words.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.110
So let me rephrase this.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:56.170
So let me compare now eigenvalue
decomposition, with singular

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.060
value decomposition.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:03.370
So this is EVD, what
we just saw before.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.290
It only-- SVD.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.259
This only works for
n by n matrices,

00:28:09.259 --> 00:28:10.300
which are diagonalizable.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.793
SVD works for all
general m by n matrices.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.830
However, this is powerful.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.950
Because it gives you one frame.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:41.508
So v_1 with a v_2, v_3 for which
A acts as a scaling operator.

00:28:41.508 --> 00:28:44.030
Kind of like that.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.972
That's what A does,
A does, A does.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.120
That's because these U on
the both sides are equal.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.766
However, for singular
value decomposition,

00:28:57.766 --> 00:29:00.106
this is called singular
value decomposition.

00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:01.330
I just erased It.

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.480
What you have instead
is first of all,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.670
the spaces are different.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:22.358
If you take a vector in
R^m, and bring it to R^n,

00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:25.690
apply this operation A. What's
going to happen here is there

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.790
will be one frame in here,
and one frame in here.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:36.430
So there will be vectors
v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4 like this.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:44.300
And there will be vectors
u_1, u_2, u_3 like this here.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.420
And what's going to happen
is when you take v_1,

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.800
A will take v_1 to u_1
and scale it a little bit

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.290
according to that diagonal.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.420
A will take v_2 to
u_2, it will scale it.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.990
It'll take v_3 to u_3, scale it.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.620
Wait a minute.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.100
But for v_4, we don't have u_4.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.070
What's going to happen is this
is just going to disappear.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.510
u_4, when applied
A, will disappear.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:13.930
So I know it's a very
vague explanation,

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:18.320
but this geometric picture,
try to compare them.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.200
A diagonalization,
eigenvalue decomposition,

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.350
works within its frame, so
it's very, very powerful.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:29.480
You just have some directions
and you scale those directions.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.450
But the singular
value composition

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:34.840
it's applicable to a more
general class of matrices,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.750
but it's rather more restricted.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.750
You have two frames, one
for the original space, one

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.400
for the target space.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.320
And what the linear
transformation does is,

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.240
it just sends one
vector to another vector

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.770
and scales it a little bit.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.149
So now is another
good time to go back

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.690
to that matrix in
the very beginning.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:22.714
So remember that example where
we had a vector of companies,

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:27.604
and dates, and the
entry was stock prices.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.000
So if it's an n by
n matrix, you can

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.940
try to apply both
eigenvalue decomposition,

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.080
and singular value
decomposition.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.230
But what will be more sensible
is singular value decomposition

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.210
in this case.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.130
I won't explain why, and
what's happening here.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:56.170
Peter will probably.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.100
You will come to it later.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.540
But just try to do some
imagining before listening

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.190
what's really happening
in real world.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.380
So try to use your own
imagination, your own language

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.240
to express.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.950
See what happens for
this matrix, what

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.430
this decomposition is doing.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:24.060
It just looks like
totally nonsense.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:26.630
Why does this have
even a geometry?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.160
Why does it define a linear
transformation and so on?

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.590
It's just a beautiful
theory, which just

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.990
gives many useful information.

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:38.750
I can't really emphasize more.

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:42.540
Because-- emphasize
enough, because really

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:46.010
this is just universal, being
used in all science, these.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.260
I think the eigenvalue
decomposition, and the singular

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.070
value decomposition.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.560
Not just for this
course, but pretty much

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.620
it's safe to say in
every engineering,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.620
you'll encounter
one of the forms.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:05.560
So let me talk about the
proof of the singular value

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.880
decomposition.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.120
And I will show you an
example of what singular value

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.410
decomposition does for some
example matrix, the matrix

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.760
that I chose.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.665
Proof of singular
value decomposition,

00:33:25.665 --> 00:33:26.540
which is interesting.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.123
It relies on eigenvalue
decomposition.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:57.125
So given a matrix A, consider
the eigenvalues of A times

00:33:57.125 --> 00:33:58.280
A transpose.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:17.024
Oh, A transpose A. First
observation: that's

00:34:17.024 --> 00:34:17.815
a symmetric matrix.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.210
So if you remember, it
will have real eigenvalues,

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.210
and it's diagonalizable.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:51.356
So A^T of A has eigenvalues
lambda_1, lambda_2,

00:34:51.356 --> 00:34:57.326
up to, it's an n by n
matrix, so lambda_n.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:09.387
And corresponding eigenvectors
v_1, v_2, up to v_n.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:18.110
And so for convenience, I
will cut it at lambda_r,

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.150
and assume all rest is 0.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.690
So there might be
none which are 0.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:26.570
In that case we use
all the eigenvalues.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.850
But I only am interested
in nonzero eigenvalues.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.010
So I'll say up to
lambda_r, they're nonzero.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.710
Afterwards it's 0.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.960
It's just a notational choice.

00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:41.950
And now I'm just
going to make a claim

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:44.250
that they're all positive.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.300
This part is kind
of just believe me.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.400
Then if that's the case, we
can rewrite the eigenvalues.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:06.610
Rewrite eigenvalues as
sigma_1^2, sigma_2^2,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.946
sigma_r^2, and 0.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.530
That was my first step.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.856
My second step,
that was step one,

00:36:21.856 --> 00:36:30.770
step two is to define
u_1 as A*v_1 / sigma_1,

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.400
u_2 as A*v_2 / sigma_2.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.950
And u_r as A*V_r / sigma_r.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:49.240
And then u times r+1
as-- up to u times m,

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:56.390
as complete the
above into a basis.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.080
So for those who
don't understand,

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.700
just think of we pick u_1
up to u_r first, and then

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.750
arbitrarily pick the rest.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:14.890
And you'll see why I only care
about the nonzero eigenvalues.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:19.500
Because I have to divide by
sigmas, the sigma values.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.330
And if it's zero, I
can't do the division.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.510
So that's why I identified
those which are not zero.

00:37:26.817 --> 00:37:27.650
And then we're done.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.685
So it doesn't look at
all like we're done.

00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:41.410
But I'm going to let my U be
this, u_1, u_2, up to u_n.

00:37:44.012 --> 00:37:45.988
Sorry, it has to be n.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:57.110
My V I will pick as
v_1, v_2, up to v_r.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:00.660
And then v_(r+1) up to v_n.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.130
So this again just
complete into a basis.

00:38:15.575 --> 00:38:16.700
Now let's see what happens.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.772
So A times U transpose
times V. Oh, ah.

00:38:33.772 --> 00:38:35.060
That's why it's a problem.

00:38:39.137 --> 00:38:43.440
You have to do U times
A times V transpose.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.290
So I would write V
is n, and this is m.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.160
Ah yes, so U times A
times V transpose here.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:31.080
That will be u_1, u_2, u_m.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:37.865
A. V transpose will be v_1
transpose, v_2 transpose,

00:39:37.865 --> 00:39:39.350
to v_n transpose.

00:40:03.605 --> 00:40:05.085
I messed up something.

00:40:05.085 --> 00:40:05.585
Sorry.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.772
Oh, that's the
form I want, right?

00:40:18.772 --> 00:40:20.550
Yeah.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.760
So I have to transpose
U and V there.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.755
OK, sorry.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.110
Thank you.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.810
Thank you for the correction.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:31.620
I know this looks
different from that.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:36.380
But I mean if you flip the
definition it will be the same.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.240
So I'll just not--
stop making mistakes.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.200
Do you have a question?

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.170
So, yeah.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.670
Thank you.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.530
Yeah.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.000
That will make more sense.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.740
Thank you very much.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.603
And then you're going
to have u_1 transpose up

00:41:01.603 --> 00:41:04.460
to u_n transpose.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.300
A times V, because of
the definition of V,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.670
will be lambda_1 of v_1.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:13.990
A times v_2 will
be lambda_2 of v_2.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:19.010
Up to lambda_r of v_r,
and the rest will be zero.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.428
These all define the columns.

00:41:33.874 --> 00:41:47.200
Now let's do a few computations.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.680
So u_1^T times lambda_1 v_1.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.050
u_1^T, and lambda_1 v_1.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:59.140
When you take the dot product,
what you're going to get is

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:05.441
v_1^T A transpose
of v_1 lambda_1.

00:42:13.393 --> 00:42:14.884
I'm missing something.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.900
Ah, sorry about that.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.921
This is not right.

00:42:29.921 --> 00:42:30.855
These are As.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:47.800
I defined the eigenvalues
for A transpose A.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.140
Then that's u_1 transpose
times sigma_1 times u_1.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.760
That will be sigma_1.

00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:01.960
And then if you look at the
second entry, u_1 transpose

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:11.370
times A v_2, you get u_1
transpose times sigma_2 of u_2.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:18.430
But I claim that
this is equal to 0.

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:20.340
So why is that the case?

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.082
u_1 transpose is
equal to V_1 transpose

00:43:23.082 --> 00:43:26.316
A transpose over sigma_1.

00:43:26.316 --> 00:43:28.160
And we have sigma_2.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.876
u_2 is equal to A
times v_2 over sigma_2.

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:35.650
So those two cancel.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:42.230
And we have v_1^T A^T
A v_2 over sigma_1.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:45.680
But v_1 and v_2 are two
different eigenvectors

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.160
of this matrix.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.570
At the beginning we can have an
orthonormal decomposition of A

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:59.240
transpose A. That means v_1^T
times v_2 times that has to be

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.222
equal to zero.

00:44:00.222 --> 00:44:03.140
Because that's an eigenvalue.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:09.658
We have v_1^T times
lambda_2 v_2 over sigma_1.

00:44:09.658 --> 00:44:14.495
So we have lambda_2 over
sigma_1 times v_1 transpose v_2.

00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:18.410
These two are
orthogonal so give 0.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.760
So if you do the
computation, what

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.560
you're going to have
is sigma_1, sigma_2

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.547
on the diagonal, up to
sigma_r, and then 0, 0 rest.

00:44:28.547 --> 00:44:32.450
And 0 the rest.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.630
Sorry for the confusion.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.190
Actually the process
is quite simple.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.880
I was just lost in the
computation in the middle.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.550
So process is first
look at A transpose A.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.450
Find the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:53.070
And using those, they
define the matrix V.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.580
And you can define the
matrix U by applying A times

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.280
V over sigma.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.860
Each of those will
define the entries of U.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.900
The reason I wanted to
go through this proof

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.490
is because this gives you a
process of finding a singular

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:09.830
value decomposition.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.920
It was a little
bit painful for me.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.070
But if you have a matrix
there's just these simple steps

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.600
you can follow to find the
singular value decomposition.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.460
So look at this matrix, find its
eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.020
Just arrange it
in the right way.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.490
Of course, the right
way needs some practice

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.980
to be done correctly.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.350
But once you do that, you
just obtain a singular value

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.750
composition.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.674
And really I can't explain
how powerful it is.

00:45:39.674 --> 00:45:41.340
You will only later
see it in the course

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.720
how powerful this
decomposition will be.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.850
And only then you'll
more appreciate

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.900
how good it is to have
this decomposition,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.100
and be able to
compute it so simply.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.598
So let's try to do it by hand.

00:45:56.598 --> 00:45:58.133
Yes?

00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:00.007
STUDENT: So when you
compute the [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:05.155 --> 00:46:05.780
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.613
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.490
PROFESSOR: It would have
to be orthonormal, yeah.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.927
It should be orthonormal.

00:46:13.927 --> 00:46:15.364
These should be orthonormal.

00:46:18.238 --> 00:46:18.970
These also.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.480
And that's a good point,
because that can be annoying

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.920
when you want to do it by hand.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.530
Actually this decomposition.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.800
You have to do some Gram-Schmidt
process or something like that.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.085
What I mean by
hand, I don't really

00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:41.000
mean by hand, other than
when you're doing homework.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.030
Because you can use
the computer to do it.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.690
And in fact, if you
use computer there

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.314
are much better algorithms
than this that are known,

00:46:49.314 --> 00:46:51.730
which can do this a lot more
quickly and more efficiently.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.077
So let's try to do it by hand.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:16.280
So let A be this matrix:
[3, 2  2; 2, 3, -2].

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.785
And we want to make the
eigenvalue decomposition

00:47:19.785 --> 00:47:22.080
of this.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.800
A transpose A, we
have to compute that,

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.180
is [3, 2, 2; 2, 3, -2].

00:47:39.044 --> 00:47:52.824
And you will get [13, 12, 2; 12,
 13, -2; 2, -2, 8].

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:12.672
And let me just say that the
eigenvalues are 0, 9, and 25.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:20.900
So in this algorithm,
sigma_1^2 will be 25.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.660
Sigma_2^2 squared will be 9.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.250
And sigma_3^2 squared will be 0.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.140
So we can take sigma_1
to be 5, sigma_2 to be 3,

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.230
sigma_3 to be 0.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.650
Now we have to find the
corresponding eigenvectors

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.840
to find the singular
value decomposition.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.260
And I'll just do one
just to remind you

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.120
how to find an eigenvector.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:56.345
So A transpose A,
minus 25I is equal to,

00:48:56.345 --> 00:48:59.010
if you subtract 25
from these entries,

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:09.784
you're going to get [-12, 12, 2;
 12, -12, -2; 2, -2, -13].

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.110
And then you have to
find the vector which

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:22.060
annihilates this matrix.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:27.213
And that will be, I can take one
of those vectors to be just 1

00:49:27.213 --> 00:49:31.493
over square root of 2, 1
over square root of two, 0,

00:49:31.493 --> 00:49:32.475
after normalizing.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.260
And then just do it
for other vectors.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:52.130
You find v_2 to be 1 over
square root 18, negative 1

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:57.744
over square root 18,
4 over square root 18.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:19.020
Now then find v_3 to be the
one that annihilates this.

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:20.880
But I'll just say it's x, y, z.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.250
This will not be important.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:25.270
I'll explain why it's
not that important.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:44.810
Then our v as written
above, actually

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:45.950
there it was transposed.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:47.305
So I will transpose it.

00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:49.165
That will be 1 over
square root of 2,

00:50:49.165 --> 00:50:53.350
1 over square root of 2, 0.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.660
v_2 is that.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.610
So we can write 1 over
square root 18, negative 1

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:03.835
over square root 18,
4 over square root 18.

00:51:03.835 --> 00:51:06.210
And here just write x, y, z.

00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:17.210
And U will be defined
as u_1 and u_2,

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:21.600
where u_1 is A times
v_1 over sigma_1.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:26.610
u_2 is A times v_2 over sigma_2.

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:30.150
So multiply A by this
vector, divide by sigma_1

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:34.415
to get U. I already did
the computation for you.

00:51:34.415 --> 00:51:44.810
It's going to be-- and
this is going to be-- yes?

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:46.320
STUDENT: How did you get v_1?

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.870
PROFESSOR: v_1?

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:50.980
So if you did the computation
right in the beginning to get

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:58.560
the eigenvalues, then A^T
A - 25I, this has to be--

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.850
has to not have full rank.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.770
So there has to be a vector v,
which when multiplied by this

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:06.260
gives [0, 0, 0] vector.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:13.670
And then you say [a, b, c]
and set it equal to [0, 0, 0].

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:17.041
And just solve the system
of linear equations.

00:52:17.041 --> 00:52:18.290
There will be several of them.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.840
For example, we can
take [1, 1,  0] as well.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:25.170
But I just normalized
it to have [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:27.350
So there's a lot
of work involved

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.550
if you want to do it by hand,
even though you can do it.

00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:32.630
You have to find eigenvalues,
find eigenvectors.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.270
In this case, you have
to find three of them.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.340
And then you have to do
more work, and more work.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.610
But it can be done.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:44.320
And we are done now.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:52.020
So now this decomposes A into
U sigma V transformation.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:57.770
So U is given as [1 over square
root 2, 1 over square root 2;

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:02.320
1 over square root 2, minus
1 over square root 2].

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:07.716
Sigma was 5, 3, 0.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:15.490
And V is this.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.834
So V transpose is just
transpose of that.

00:53:18.834 --> 00:53:22.790
I'll just write it like
that, where V is that.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:25.200
So we have this decomposition.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.370
And so let me actually write
it, because I want to show you

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.996
why x, y, z is not important.

00:53:33.272 --> 00:53:37.010
1 over square root 2,
1 over square root 2,

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:43.250
0; 1 over square root 18,
minus 1 over square root 18,

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:46.190
4 over square root 18; x, y, z.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:52.410
The reason I'm
saying this is not

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:56.980
important is because I can just
drop-- oh what did I do here?

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.700
It has to be 2 by 3.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.370
I can just drop this column,
and drop this column together.

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:08.517
It has to be that form.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.160
Drop this and drop
this altogether.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.870
So the message here is that
the eigenvectors corresponding

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:38.340
to eigenvalue zero
are not important.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.640
The only relevant ones
are nonzero eigenvalues.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.290
So drop this, and drop this.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.120
That will save you
some computation.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.297
So let me state a different
form of singular value

00:54:50.297 --> 00:54:50.880
decomposition.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.760
So this works in general.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.940
There's a corollary.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.075
We get a simplified form of SVD.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:16.046
Where A becomes equal to U
times sigma times V transpose.

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:21.260
And A was an m by n matrix.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.220
U is still an m by m matrix.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:27.320
But now sigma is
also m by m matrix.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.752
This only works when m is
less than or equal to n.

00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.985
And V is a m by n matrix.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.400
So the proof is
exactly the same.

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:44.460
And the last step is just
to drop the irrelevant

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:46.590
information.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:48.810
So I will not write
down why it works.

00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.830
But you can see if
you go through it,

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:54.280
you'll see that
dropping this part

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.210
just corresponds to
exactly that information.

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.660
So that's the reduced form.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.200
So let's see.

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.650
In the beginning
we had A. I erased

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.690
A. A was the 2 by 3
matrix in the beginning.

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:11.550
And we obtained the
decomposition into 2

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:15.400
by 2, 2 by 2, and 2 by 3 matrix.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:18.670
If we didn't delete the
fifth column and fifth row,

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.320
we would have obtained a 2
by 2, times 2 by 3, times 3

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.080
by 3 matrix.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.572
But now we can simplify
it by removing those.

00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:33.020
And it might not look that
much different on this board.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.080
Because I just erased one row.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.920
But many matrices that you'll
see in real application

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.350
have a lot lower rank than the
number of columns and rows.

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:49.510
So if r is a lot more smaller
than both m and n, then

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.650
this part really--
it's not obvious here.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.400
But if m and n has
a big gap here,

00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:00.600
really the number of
columns that you're saving,

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:01.560
it can be enormous.

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.940
So to illustrate an
example, look at this.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.665
Now look at the
stock prices, where

00:57:12.665 --> 00:57:18.770
you have companies and dates.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:21.850
Previously I just gave an
example of a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.990
But it's more sensible
to have dates, a lot

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:26.950
more dates than companies.

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:31.820
So let's say you recorded
365 days of a year,

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.890
even though the market is
not open all days, and just

00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:38.130
like five companies.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:41.340
If you did a decomposition this
this, you'll have a 5 by 5,

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:45.840
5 by 365, 365 by 365 here.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.888
But now in the reduced form,
you're saving a lot of space.

00:57:51.726 --> 00:57:53.100
So if you just
look at the board,

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.940
it doesn't look like
it's so powerful.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.130
But in fact it is.

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.290
So that's the reduced form.

00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:00.930
And that will be the
form that you'll see most

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:02.510
of the time, this reduced form.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.400
So I made lot of mistakes today.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:13.840
I have one more topic, but
a totally irrelevant topic.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.614
So any questions before I
move on to the next topic?

00:58:22.594 --> 00:58:23.255
Yes?

00:58:23.255 --> 00:58:24.088
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:30.295 --> 00:58:31.795
PROFESSOR: Can you
press the button?

00:58:47.792 --> 00:58:48.625
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.640
PROFESSOR: Oh, so in
this data, what it means.

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.770
You're asking what the
eigenvectors will mean over

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.280
this data?

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:10.960
It will give you some stocks.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:14.820
It will give you
like the correlation.

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.610
So each eigenvector
will give you

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:20.990
a group of companies that
are correlated somehow.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.550
It measures their
correlation with each other.

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:26.880
So I don't have a
very good explanation

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.280
what its physical meaning is.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.040
Maybe you can give
just a little bit more.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.050
GUEST SPEAKER: Possibly.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.870
We will get into this
in later lectures.

00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:41.280
But in the singular
value decomposition,

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:45.640
what you want to think of is
these orthonormal matrices

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:50.500
are really defining a new basis,
sort of an orthogonal basis.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.890
So you're taking the
original coordinate system,

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:55.030
then you're rotating it.

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:57.440
And without changing
or stretching

00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:58.410
or squeezing the data.

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.370
You're just rotating the axes.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:03.160
So an orthonormal
matrix gives you

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.310
the cosines of the
new coordinate system

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:07.880
with respect to the old one.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.002
And so the singular
value decomposition

01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:13.360
then is simply sort
of rotating the data

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.020
into a different orientation.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:23.980
And the orthonormal basis
that you're transforming to,

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:28.330
is essentially the coordinates
of the original data

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:29.930
in the transformed system.

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:34.910
So as Choongbum was
commenting, you're essentially

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.360
looking at a representation
of the original data

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:43.480
points in a linearly
transformed space,

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.820
and the correlations
between different stocks,

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:51.990
say, is represented by how those
points are oriented in the new,

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:53.870
in the transformed space.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.720
PROFESSOR: So you'll have to see
real data to really make sense

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.220
out of it.

01:01:03.812 --> 01:01:07.430
But another way to think of
it is where it comes from.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.202
So all this singular
value decomposition,

01:01:09.202 --> 01:01:10.660
if you remember
the proof, it comes

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.850
from eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of A transpose A.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:19.970
Now if you look at A
transpose A, or I'll just say

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:22.460
it's A times A transposed.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.950
It's pretty much the same.

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:26.530
If you look at A
times A transpose,

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.425
you're going to get
an m by n matrix.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:36.432
And it'll be indexed
both by these companies.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.910
And the numbers
here will represent

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.540
how much the
companies are related

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.250
to each other, how
much correlation they

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:48.690
have between each other.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:51.770
So by looking at the
eigenvectors of this matrix,

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:54.950
you're looking at the
correlation between these stock

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.290
prices, let's say, these
company stock prices.

01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:01.390
And that information is
represented inside the singular

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.190
value decomposition.

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:06.610
But again, it's a lot
better to understand

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:09.250
if you have real
numbers and real data,

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.880
which you will have later.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.031
So please be excited and wait.

01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:18.530
You're going to see
some cool stuff.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:30.120
So that was all for eigenvalue
decomposition and singular

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.650
value decomposition.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.300
And the last thing I
want to mention today

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.970
is something called
Perron-Frobenius theorem.

01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:43.130
This one even looks a lot
more theoretical than the ones

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.320
I showed you.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.080
But surprisingly a few
years ago, Steve Ross,

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.550
he's a faculty in the
business school here,

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.830
found a very interesting result
called Steve Ross recovery

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:01.250
theorem that makes
use of this theorem,

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.870
makes use of
Perron-Frobenius theorem

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:06.410
that I will tell you today.

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:08.790
Unfortunately you will
only see a lecture

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:11.710
on Steve Ross recovery
theorem towards the end

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:13.730
of the semester.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.560
So I will try to recall
what it is later.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.110
But since we're talking
about linear algebra today,

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:22.540
let me introduce the theorem.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.040
This is called Perron-Frobenius.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.470
And you really won't believe
that it has any applications

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.955
in finance because it
just looks so theoretical.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.830
I'm just stating a
really weak form.

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.940
Weak form.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:54.330
Let A be an n by n symmetric
matrix, whose entries are all

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.360
positive, with positive entries.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:10.910
Then there are a few
properties that they have.

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:14.790
First there exists
an eigenvalue,

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:20.610
there exists a largest
eigenvalue, lambda_0, such

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:24.960
that lambda is
less than lambda_0.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:31.182
Well that's true for
all other lambda.

01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:34.560
So this statement is really
easy for symmetric matrix.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.709
So forget about-- you
can drop symmetric,

01:04:36.709 --> 01:04:39.000
but I'm just stated it,
because I'm going to prove only

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.410
for this weak case.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:44.550
Just think about the statement
when it's not symmetric.

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:48.730
So if you have an n by n matrix
whose entries are all positive,

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:53.290
then there exists an eigenvalue,
lambda_0, a real eigenvalue

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:59.170
such that the absolute value
of all of other eigenvalues

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:02.860
are strictly smaller
than this eigenvalue.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.540
So remember that if it's
not a symmetric matrix,

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:08.100
they can be complex values.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.500
This is saying that there's
a unique eigenvalue which

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.790
has largest absolute value, and
moreover, it's a real number.

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:23.260
Second part, there
exists an eigenvector,

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:34.810
a positive eigenvector
with positive entries,

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:40.120
corresponding to lambda 0.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.660
So the eigenvector
corresponding to this lambda 0

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.690
has positive entries.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:51.320
And the third part
is lambda_0 is

01:05:51.320 --> 01:06:05.060
an eigenvalue of multiplicity 1,
for those who know what it is.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.070
So this really is
a unique eigenvalue

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.580
with a unique eigenvector,
which has positive entries.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:14.361
And it's larger, really
larger than other eigenvalues.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.660
So from the mathematician
point of view,

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.040
this has many applications.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.060
It's probability theory.

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.290
My main research area
is combinatorics,

01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:27.090
discrete mathematics.

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:30.080
It's also used in there.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.790
So from the theoretical
point of view,

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:35.470
this has been used
in many contexts.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.990
It's not a standard theorem
taught in linear algebra.

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:42.990
So I don't think probably most
of you haven't seen it before.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:47.420
But it's a well known
result, with many uses,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.070
theoretical uses.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:54.700
But you also see one use
in, later, as I mentioned,

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.921
in finance, which
is quite surprising.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.320
So let me just give you some
feeling of why it happens.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.300
I won't give you the full
detail of the proof, but just

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.590
a very brief description.

01:07:16.257 --> 01:07:26.214
Sketch when A is symmetric, just
a simple case, A is symmetric.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:38.540
In this case, this
statement, if you look at it.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.650
First of all A has
real eigenvalues.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:59.530
I'll say it's lambda_1,
lambda_2, up to lambda_n.

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.790
And at some point, I'll
say up to lambda_i,

01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:04.510
it's greater than
zero, pass to where

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:06.670
this is smaller than zero.

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.170
There are some
positive eigenvalues.

01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.490
There are some
negative eigenvalues.

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:13.775
So that's observation one.

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:22.090
Things are more easy to control,
because they are all real.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:25.590
The first statement says that--
maybe I should have indexed it

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:27.384
as lambda_0.

01:08:27.384 --> 01:08:30.729
I'll just call this
lambda 0 instead.

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:34.180
This lambda_0 is in fact
larger in absolute value

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:35.630
than lambda_n.

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:42.010
That's the content
of the first bullet.

01:08:42.010 --> 01:08:45.640
So if they all have all
positive entries, then

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.790
the positive, largest
positive eigenvalue

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:58.529
dominates the smallest negative
eigenvalue, which yeah.

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:01.310
So why is that the case?

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:02.920
First of all, to
see that you have

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.610
to go through different steps.

01:09:05.610 --> 01:09:06.859
So we go into observation two.

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:11.950
Lambda_1, so look at lambda_1.

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:21.234
lambda_1 has an eigenvector
with positive entries.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:29.880
Why is that the case?

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.939
That's because if
you look at A times v

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:49.185
equals lambda times v. If
v-- let me state it this way.

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:54.135
Lambda_0 is the maximum
of all lambda, lambda_0.

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.535
That's not entirely correct.

01:10:03.535 --> 01:10:04.035
Lambda_1.

01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:09.975
Sorry about that.

01:10:09.975 --> 01:10:14.610
So If you look at this, if
v has non-positive entries,

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:23.750
if it has a negative entry,
if v has a negative entry,

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:24.970
then flip it.

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:34.346
Flip the sign, and in this
way obtain new vector v prime.

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:43.070
Since A has positive entries,
A has positive entries.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:49.960
What we conclude
is that A times v

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:58.590
prime will be larger than A
times v. You have to look.

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.810
Think about, because it
has positive entries,

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:02.820
if it had some negative
part somewhere,

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.120
the magnitude will decrease.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.120
So if you flip the sign it
should increase the magnitude.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.720
And this cannot happen.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.330
This shouldn't happen.

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:14.452
This should not happen.

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.945
That's where the positive
entries part is used.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:29.330
If you have positive
entries, then it should have,

01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:32.620
the eigenvector should have
positive entries as well.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:38.420
So I will not work through
the details of the rest.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.830
I will post it on
the lecture notes.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:44.369
But really this
theorem, in fact,

01:11:44.369 --> 01:11:46.410
can be stated in a lot
more generality than this.

01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:47.950
I'm stating only
a very weak form.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.630
It doesn't have to have
all positive entries.

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:53.690
It has to only be something
called irreducible,

01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:56.640
which is a concept from
probability theory,

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.630
from Markov chains.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:04.810
But here we will only
use it in this setting.

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.070
So I will review it later,
before it's really being used.

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:11.220
But just remember that how
these positive entries kick

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.950
into this kind of
statement, where

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:16.290
there is an eigenvalue,
largest eigenvalue, why

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:21.380
there has to be a vector
which is all positive entries.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.590
Those will all come
into play later.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.272
So I think that's it for today.

01:12:27.272 --> 01:12:28.855
If you have any last
minute questions?

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.650
If not, I will see
you on Thursday.
