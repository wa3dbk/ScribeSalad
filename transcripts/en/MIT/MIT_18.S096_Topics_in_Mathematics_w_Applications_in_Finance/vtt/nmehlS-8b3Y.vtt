00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.180
PROFESSOR: So what I would
like to discuss today

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.970
is just touch upon
what kind of problems

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.460
the quantitative analysts
are solving in the commodity

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.550
world, the problems
that are somewhat

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.800
different from
the other markets.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.590
And I'm sure you have the
whole year of lectures here

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.420
from people in
different markets.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.160
And you will judge for yourself
that the models we're building

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.200
are somewhat, if not
completely, different.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.970
So this is my goal
today is just for you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.590
to have some taste of what kind
of models we're looking at.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.330
So let's start.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:37.350
Let's start with the following
abstract from the Dow Jones

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.440
publication, the
dispatch which announced

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.730
in 2009 that the Trafigura--
which is the biggest

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.920
trader, one of the biggest
commodity and energy trader--

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.720
is potentially on track to
post its best results ever

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.490
in fiscal 2009 on lower oil
prices and contango markets.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.650
Remember, 2008, just the year
before that, the oil prices

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.720
shot to the highest possible
level, to $159 per barrel.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.680
And a lot of people
blamed the traders

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.730
for the high oil prices.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.540
And yet, in 2008, when the
prices dropped-- in 2009,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.620
I'm sorry, next
year-- when the prices

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.590
dropped to $30 per barrel, as
you remember, to the lowest

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.100
possible level that
we remember, Trafigura

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.330
is about to make the
biggest profit ever.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.280
So it sounds like
a contradiction.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.150
So they're making money on the
low oil prices and contango.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.850
And contango, which I have to
explain to you what it is-- I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.520
assume that everybody here knows
what the futures contract is.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.420
If not, just let me
know, and I will explain.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.440
It's very simple concept, so
don't be shy and just tell me.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.320
So I would like to
show you how Trafigura

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.350
will make the record
profit in the year

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.590
when the prices are at
the record low level,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.950
but they are in contango.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.160
So this is the graph
of futures contracts,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.040
futures prices, oil futures
prices on January 15, 2009.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.330
Futures contract is
simply the contract

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.270
that allows you to
buy today-- let's

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.390
say, in January--
the barrel of oil

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.050
for delivery in
some future time.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.720
That's all.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.430
You always know
what the price will

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.570
be by looking into Wall Street
Journal, Section C. Open,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.640
you will see.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.980
If you want to have
delivery in August,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.350
the price will be around, what?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.040
$55?

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.200
If you want delivery on February
of next year-- so February,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.510
2010-- the price will be $60.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.555
If you want delivery now,
the price will be $35.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:24.930
So if you want to
buy, basically,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.180
the spot price--
for your knowledge,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.510
there is no spot price, as such.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.580
And whatever you see on
CNBC, for example, on TV,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.700
when they give you
the spot price of oil,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.280
it's the price of the first
future contract-- so this one--

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.560
of the nearby, the most
nearby futures contract.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.960
So as you can see,
this is the curve.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.130
And recall that the curve is
in contango if the prices are

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.940
monotone increasing.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.160
If they are decreasing,
it's called backwardation.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.710
That's all.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.340
So just a useful
term for you to know.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.940
So at that time, January
15th, the prices indeed

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.140
were monotone increasing.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.430
They're going from
$35 to February

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.450
and to $60 in February.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.780
So this is February of 2009.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.110
This is February of 2010.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.300
And we can see the prices
were going from $35 to $60.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.970
So let's now see how
Trafigura made money.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.980
Can you guess, by the way?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.812
Yes.

00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:28.728
AUDIENCE: They borrowed
money, bought the spot

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.579
and then sold the
futures contract?

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.370
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.830
So that's precisely
what they've done.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.202
What is needed for that, though?

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:39.474
There's one little
thing that's required.

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:43.360
AUDIENCE: Low interest rates
and ability to buy the spot?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.200
PROFESSOR: This price
is the ability to buy.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.591
But you need a little bit more.

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:50.090
You need--

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.317
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:53.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.170
PROFESSOR: No, no, you lock in.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.950
You bought at $35.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.220
AUDIENCE: Storage.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.970
PROFESSOR: Storage--
you need the storage.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.800
You need to be able to wait one
year, because you already sold

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.110
at $60 next year, in February.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.040
So you locked in
a massive profit

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.450
of-- so this is your strategy.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.640
Just borrow 35.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.480
Buy one barrel.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.120
Store it.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.720
Then immediately sell,
so short means just go

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.710
and sell the one barrel
for next year at $60.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.340
So you have-- you
made $25-- I'm sorry,

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.680
you made $25 just on commodity.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.940
You have to-- on February,
you will get this-- February

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.140
next year you will get this $25.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.600
You'll pay the interest, which
will be maybe, let's say 10%.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.590
So it will be $3.5.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.410
So you made total profit $21.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.120
If, like Trafigura, you have 50,
60 million barrels of storage,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.590
you can easily
calculate how much money

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.570
they have without any risk they
made in this particular year.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.350
So whenever you hear that
traders are benefiting

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.990
from the high prices, it's not.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.370
Actually, if the same situations
existed in the high prices,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.100
then the interest would
be substantially lower.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.480
They could drop
their profit by 50%,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.087
if, let's say, the same
where the prices $125

00:07:21.087 --> 00:07:23.231
to $135 to $160.

00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:23.730
Right?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.750
You would have the
enormous interest payment.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.740
So in reality, you
need the low prices,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.636
but you would like
to have a contango.

00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:33.670
You really don't care,
price is low or high.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:42.380
So to summarize,
we need to have--

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.840
I mean, just a little thing
here-- that the strategy works

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.640
like a charm.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.330
The only thing you
need is storage.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:57.010
OK, let me now
invert the question.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.510
Let me ask you this
question-- let's

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.690
say we have the same curve.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:07.870
We are on January
1st, 2009, and we

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.680
are asked to get the storage.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.650
You want to have your bosses
calling you and saying,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.000
I mean, I need
storage, oil storage

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.940
from August to December.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:28.450
So in August, we have the price
is, what, $55, in December $58.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.260
You go and get me--
here's your credit card.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.990
Just go and get it.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.600
Well, storage is usually--
you get it at the auctions.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.740
So a lot of people come to
the auction, and they'll bid.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.370
So now you're going with the
boss's credit card, right?

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.310
And you have the
following dilemma--

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:56.280
if you borrow too little,
you will never get it.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.940
If you bid too much, you'll have
the winner's curse-- namely,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.640
you will never be able
to recover the money

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.700
that you paid for that storage.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.270
So you have to have-- before you
bid, you have to have a plan.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.580
How do you-- or strategy--
how do you recover the money

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.390
that you pay for the storage
through some foolproof,

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.560
riskless activity-- some
strategy like Trafigura.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.710
Remember, they have
the riskless strategy.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.240
They lock in the profit.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.970
They can go to sleep for
a year, and then vacation,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.140
and then come back and
get this profit back.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.010
How do you-- in this
particular case, you have,

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.070
whenever you bid
something, you also

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.270
have to have a plan
in mind how to recover

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.090
this money and even more, to
get a little bit of profit.

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.350
So my question to you-- you
need storage from August

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.190
to December.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.240
How much would you bid?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.310
These are the prices.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.930
If you need more prices,
they're all here.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.930
So you need the storage
from August to December.

00:10:18.654 --> 00:10:21.195
AUDIENCE: Do the same thing?

00:10:21.195 --> 00:10:23.010
Do the same thing
they did before?

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.218
PROFESSOR: So how much would
you bid for the storage?

00:10:25.218 --> 00:10:28.400
You don't have the storage, so
you have to-- when you get it,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.050
then you do what we
did before, because

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.340
before what we did was assume
that we already have it.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.670
Right now, you don't, but if
you win it, you will have it.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.670
But if you win it, you
have to have the strategy

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.815
how to recover this money.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.220
Yes?

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.470
AUDIENCE: Depends on how
much profit you want to make.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.060
PROFESSOR: Well, it's
not, because remember,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.081
you are competing
against other people.

00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:03.580
Right?

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.730
So if you become too greedy,
they will outbid you.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.790
So let's say bid
one penny, right?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:17.020
Assuming that you'll make--
so it should be-- what

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.940
is the highest you can bid?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.335
AUDIENCE: $3?

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:23.200
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.924
You say $3.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:31.544
All right, give me the
strategy that recovers that $3.

00:11:31.544 --> 00:11:35.030
AUDIENCE: But we do
the same process.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.130
We borrow money, buy--

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.630
PROFESSOR: You don't
have to borrow,

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.880
because it's futures contract.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.940
You don't need-- you
just go long the August.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.740
So buy August, using
the futures contract,

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.160
and sell December using
the futures contract.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.770
You don't even need
to borrow money.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.250
You will need to borrow, maybe,
when you get to August, right?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.280
Then when you have to pay $55,
then you'll borrow, right?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.570
So you bid $3, you recovered $3.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.220
No profits.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.690
So most likely, you
will bid $2.99, right?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.200
That's the highest
probably, can go.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.601
You have to give yourself at
least a penny of a profit,

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:13.100
right?

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.860
AUDIENCE: The interest.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.706
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:15.872
AUDIENCE: Also the interest.

00:12:15.872 --> 00:12:18.320
PROFESSOR: Let's forget
about interest for a moment,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.237
just for simplicity.

00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:22.570
In reality, of course, you
never should forget about it,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.610
but in order not to make our
discussions too complicated,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.300
no interest.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:35.030
So you're basically will be at
$2.99, it seems to me, right?

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.130
You get a penny of profit,
and you have a strategy

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.227
if you get the storage.

00:12:39.227 --> 00:12:40.060
You know what to do.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.480
You immediately go buy August.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.430
Using futures contract, buy
August, and sell December,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.170
locking in $3.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.670
Pay $2.99, if you manage
to win, if everybody is not

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.140
as smart as you
are, and just bid--

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.330
or maybe they want
bigger profit.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.570
You will win the storage.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.670
You will lock in.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.870
OK, and everybody agrees, right?

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.010
This is actually a
standard strategy.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.280
People use it all the time.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.900
That's what I would
call-- that's what

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.820
the trader would do.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:18.220
That's kind of the trader, so
a business guy would do that.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.520
This is a common strategy--
was very, very common,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.540
let's say in the '90s.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.910
What the quant will
do-- and that's

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.290
where the added value of the
quant is to the organization--

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.030
they will do something
completely different.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.770
What they will do-- they
will, on January 1st,

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.430
they will sell something that
is called August-December spread

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.220
option.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.100
You heard the word
option, right?

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.390
Option is characterized by
the payout at expiration.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.020
So we have expiration.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.140
We have the payout.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.410
This is not your typical
options, not like IBM option.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:58.750
This is something different.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:04.730
The payout is determined at
the expiration, which is,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.261
let's say, July 31st, right
before the beginning of August,

00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:08.760
right?

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.130
You will look again at
the Wall Street Journal

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:20.140
and look at the December and
August prices on July 31st.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.450
And if the difference
is positive--

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.700
this little plus sign means
that if it's positive--

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.560
than you pay to the owner of
the option this difference.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.910
If it's negative, you pay zero.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.710
You're more familiar with the
options where one of this thing

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.842
is just a fixed strike.

00:14:39.842 --> 00:14:41.050
It's called the fixed strike.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.350
Here, there's no strike.

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.860
It simply the difference between
December and August contract.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.527
But it's a
two-dimensional object,

00:14:49.527 --> 00:14:51.610
so it's a little bit more
complicated to value it.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.780
But there is a whole methodology
developed, the same way

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.780
for the regular options.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.890
This is for the spread options.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:03.990
So the quant will sell this
spread option on August 1st.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.000
Why is it better?

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.670
Well, first of all, we have
to discuss how much will I

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.920
get for this option?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:25.600
When I sold it, I give it to
you just for you to be confident

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.760
that I'm not trying to deceive
you or anything like that.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.760
You will get-- this
is the formula that

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.630
is used to compute the
value of that option.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:39.500
And when I substituted all the
parameters that are necessary,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.240
I get that the value
of the option is 447.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.890
So I immediately, on
January 1st, got 447.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.250
Everybody else is
going ready to bid $3.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.050
I have in my pocket 447.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.880
I can bid, let's say, 420.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.350
Right?

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.272
Guaranteed if I know that
everybody else is bidding $30,

00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:07.230
I will win the storage.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.230
Plus my profit margin
is not a penny anymore.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.520
My profit margin
is $0.27, right?

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.195
If I can do even 410, even
increase my profit margin

00:16:19.195 --> 00:16:22.090
if I really want to be greedy
in this particular case.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.690
But clearly, I can
have a bigger margin.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.660
I can have a bigger-- you
can guess, by the way,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.785
without even looking
at the formula, why

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:37.750
the value of this option
was the payout like this--

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:38.800
was this payout.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.845
Why is it bigger than $3?

00:16:40.845 --> 00:16:41.970
It's always bigger than $3.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.220
AUDIENCE: Discount?

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.970
PROFESSOR: No, forget about,
again, interest rates.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.360
It's not the discount.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.370
What is the-- on January 1st,
what is the intrinsic value?

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.860
If there's no
volatility at all, then

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.980
the intrinsic value
of the options-- so

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.560
at zero volatility,
the value of the option

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.284
is exactly the difference
between December and August

00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:06.650
on January 1st, which is $3.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.369
So $3 is the intrinsic
value of that option.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.520
And we all know that
the value of the option

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.569
is greater than the intrinsic
value if there is a volatility.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.490
Because there is a volatility,
the value is greater than $3.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.910
And actually, it's
substantially greater than $3,

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.750
because the volatility in the
energy markets is very high.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.250
It's much, much
higher than what you

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:33.150
see in the interest rates, or FX
or equities-- indices, I mean.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.650
Yes?

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:35.066
AUDIENCE: So you're
getting money

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:37.110
from taking on more
risk, basically?

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.790
PROFESSOR: Let's--
we'll get to that.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.140
You are asking exactly
the correct question,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.620
because yes, I am proud.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.330
I got 447.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.250
I paid 420.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.690
I mean, I was bidding 420.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.670
Of course I won.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.700
I got my storage.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.960
I bring it back home.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.310
Now let's see what kind
of risk I brought home.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.560
I have $0.27 in my pocket left.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.710
That's my profit.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.130
But now let's
assume on July 31st,

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.710
let's say December
price goes to $80

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:20.350
and the August
price goes to $55.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.930
I sold this option.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:27.630
How much do I owe on July
31st-- option is exercised.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.050
How much do I owe to
the owner of the option

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.995
if December, on July
31st, 80 and August is 55?

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.420
Yes, $25.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:48.610
I have only $0.27
in my pocket, right?

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.910
So what do I do?

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.950
That's my risk, as
you're telling me.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.470
This is a risk that
all of a sudden,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:19:00.180
I owe astronomical
amount of money

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.550
to the person to whom
I sold this option.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.620
So what do I do?

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.680
Do I run to Venezuela or
what, I'm interested to know.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.712
Where?

00:19:12.712 --> 00:19:13.295
Can you guess?

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.930
Remember, I have storage.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.350
And on July 31st, the
August price is $55,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.400
and the December is $80.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.910
So you already told me what
to do in this situation.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.290
That's what traders would do.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.180
They will buy immediately
the August at $55,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.570
immediately sell December,
because I have the storage.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.540
Now I can extract this $25
using my physical asset.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.040
So this is the beauty of the
physical or real options--

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.220
that I can, by doing
certain things,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.410
I can extract the
payout of the option.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.770
So I'm completely protected.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.500
So it seems to me that my
storage and that spread option

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.240
is the same thing.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.790
Because I'm fully
hedged with my storage.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.080
Right, is that clear?

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.090
Do you understand how I managed
to escape terrible predicament?

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.590
Yes?

00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:22.640
AUDIENCE: What happens
when the value of what

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.090
you have in storage
falls greater than what

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.530
you received from the auction?

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.730
PROFESSOR: But it's
an auction, right?

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.260
So I received 447.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.270
Everybody bids $3 or
$2.99 and then 420.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.600
There's no value of the
storage, except for the value

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.120
what people are bidding for.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.790
So if my bid is the
highest, that's it.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.947
I received it.

00:20:49.947 --> 00:20:52.530
So is that your question, or are
you asking me something else?

00:20:55.868 --> 00:20:57.696
AUDIENCE: I want to
visualize the payoff.

00:20:57.696 --> 00:20:59.070
It's when the--

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.736
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're
talking about what

00:21:00.736 --> 00:21:03.730
happens if vice versa, December
not goes to $80, but to $20,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.710
right?

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.150
And this one still
remains at $55.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:12.890
I do nothing, because the payout
of the option is equal to zero,

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.370
because the difference
is negative.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.470
So I owe nothing to the
owner of the option,

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.180
and I do nothing
with my storage.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.280
It's a fully hedged proposition.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:30.400
So the storage and this
option is one and the same.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.430
OK?

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.920
Any questions?

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:40.150
So conceptually, we're
on the same page, right?

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:45.070
OK, so that was of
course of the caricature

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.365
of the real situation.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:58.010
So reality is somewhat more
complicated, as always.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.300
In reality, let's say I
go and bid for two years.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.830
I need the storage
for two years.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.520
There are many spread
options I can sell, right?

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.040
In this, my example-- again,
in the caricature example,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.890
I sold August-December.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.610
I could have sold
August-November,

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.950
August-October, right?

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:26.660
Or I can sell-- if I
have for two years,

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:32.480
I can say May, November,
June, September, and so on.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.500
If I have two years, it's 24.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.820
You can understand how
many options I can sell.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:42.010
I mean, just options
where-- options

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:47.690
to put the oil into the
tank today, and extract it

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.910
six months later
with some profit,

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.150
or maybe three months later.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.830
And so there are a
lot of these options.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.430
So first of all I
have to determine--

00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.860
so I can sell a lot of this
option against the storage.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:07.810
I have to determine A: what
is the most valuable portfolio

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.210
of options I can sell
against the storage?

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:15.180
This is-- our strategy
starts shaping up.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.876
So we want to
optimize something.

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:19.000
And what are we optimizing?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.170
We're optimizing the
value of the portfolio

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.670
that we can sell
against the storage.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.720
Value is-- remember
this cash that I

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.560
get from selling the option?

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.680
I want to get not just 447.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:39.130
I want to get 447,000--
just whatever.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.020
just I want to
maximize, and bring it

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.000
to the highest possible level
based on the information--

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.850
price information, volatility
information-- that exists

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.520
at this particular moment.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:57.660
I want to determine what
kind of portfolio options.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.030
Now, this is optimization.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.960
What are the constraints?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.560
And now the constraints
are requiring

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.560
that you have some technical,
contractual, legal,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.130
and environmental understanding
of what's going on.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:21.560
The simplest constraints I can
give you is that you cannot put

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.870
the gas in the ground or oil
in the tank as quickly as you

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.680
want.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.522
There are certain constraints
on the injection rate.

00:24:29.522 --> 00:24:31.730
There are certain constraints
on the withdrawal rate.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.310
You cannot instantaneously
extract gas from the ground,

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.160
or oil from the tank.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.460
You can never have a
situation-- remember

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.400
that whenever the
option expires,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.030
you have to do
something to extract.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.610
Remember, to extract the value,
whenever you owe somebody--

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:53.250
the option holder--
$15 or $25, you

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:58.690
have to put the oil in the tank,
wait six months, extract it.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.970
Under no circumstances--
so your option portfolio

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.010
should be sold in such a
way against the storage

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.930
that under no circumstances,
you are in the situation when

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.270
the option is in the money.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.230
So option is positive.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.350
You have to do something
to extract the value.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.200
So you have to inject,
and there's no space,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.750
because you've done
something before,

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.180
because some other
options expired before,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.220
and you put already
oil in the tank.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.690
And the tank is full.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.990
And now a new option
expires, and tells

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.950
you put more into the
tank, and there's no space.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.080
In the opposite
situation, when you

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.140
need to sell from
the tank and the tank

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.810
is empty, because some other
options from that portfolio

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:47.056
managed to completely deplete
the oil from the tank.

00:25:47.056 --> 00:25:47.555
Questions?

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:56.020
So let's try to make an attempt
to write this optimization

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.580
problem.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.150
Just for fun, so that you
have an idea what's going on.

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:11.085
So first of all, let's see
what we're trying to optimize.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.230
Let's start from the end.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:21.040
This contract simply
tells me that I

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.170
wanted some particular-- F
is the price of the futures

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.860
contract with expiration,
let's say, the month of June.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.090
So this particular
term of the sum

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:39.800
tells me that how
much I will have

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:45.430
to pay in June if I
buy-- this is the volume.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.950
Let's say right now is January.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:52.590
If I buy in June this amount of
oil using my futures contract,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:53.850
how much I have to pay?

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.510
This is kind of
cash from my pocket.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.010
Right?

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.787
I mean, it's clear.

00:26:59.787 --> 00:27:00.620
The same thing here.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.495
There is option here.

00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:04.970
This is just straightforward
buying and selling,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.500
buying into the storage and
selling from the storage.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.000
Agreed?

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.750
A little bit more
complicated is this list.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:22.220
This is the option as I told
you before-- the option that

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.980
injects oil into the
tank at one month,

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.840
and extract it in
month i, and extract it

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.850
in the month j, which is later.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.160
So you extract in June,
extract in November.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.690
So this is the
value of the option.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.550
This is the volume
associated with this option.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.230
I sold this option.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.300
Therefore, I have the
positive cash flow.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.740
So this is 447 in my pocket.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.710
This is another
option that I sold.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.420
This is an option which
is kind of opposite, which

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.710
is first you extract,
then you inject,

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.860
which is typical situation
when you receive your storage

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:10.140
with already oil in the tank.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.330
The curve is not contango,
but backwardation.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.940
So it's more profitable
for you to sell it now

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.540
because the prices are high,
and then replace it later.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.490
So it's kind of symmetric
situation to this one,

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.470
to the options that
we already discussed.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.920
It's just it works
when the curve is

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.020
in the opposite direction.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.450
So you try to make
money no matter how.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.415
Just the prices look.

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:38.790
You're trying to
make this money.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.530
So you try to optimize
this portfolio.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.030
OK?

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.520
Now, let's talk
about constraints.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:59.190
To determine the constraints,
I introduce right now

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:05.160
the Boolean variable, which is
1 or 0, which basically tells

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.040
me if, when I come to the
exercise of this option--

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.950
like in our case on July
31st, in our first example--

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.020
and I see the option
is in the money or not.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.899
So do I have to do
something or not?

00:29:16.899 --> 00:29:18.440
Do I have to inject
into the storage?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.670
And so is it $15
or it's minus $15?

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.930
If it's minus $15, the
difference between the prices,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.320
I don't do anything.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.490
So then it's 0.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.800
If it's plus $15, I
have to do something,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.040
because the owner of the
option asks me $15, right?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.920
And so I have to put
oil into the tank,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.560
and extract it sometime later.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.240
So that's one.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.170
The same thing with
the option which

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.150
is opposite-- first
withdrawal, then injection.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:58.910
So then injection constraints
will be quite simple.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.510
So at the expiration, I look.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:08.280
If this one is 1, then it means
that I have to do something.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:13.630
And what I have to do, I have
to inject-- at the month i,

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.110
I have to inject
this volume x_(i,j),

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.510
which was withdrawn later.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.300
So that is injection.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:26.090
If some option before
that was in the minus--

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.990
so I have to inject
before and withdraw now,

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.340
that will cancel my injection.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.990
So if simultaneously,
I have injection,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.280
because one option is in
the money, and withdrawal,

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.070
because the option that
was exercised before

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.110
is in the money, they
kind of cancel each other.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:45.270
So that's why this
sign is plus and minus.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.820
The same thing with others
options, and the same thing

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.300
with pure futures contract.

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.790
And that should be less
than the injection rate.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.900
The same thing with
withdrawal rate, right?

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:02.160
I mean, it's a
similar consideration.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.030
Now, maximum
capacity constraints,

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.920
it tells me that if I start
with this inventory in my tank

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.380
at time 0, and this
is basically how much

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.770
I will get at any
time i, for any month

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:20.540
i, that's how much I will have
in my tank by that time i.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.390
You have to believe me, because
it's not a trivial thing.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.590
But the same thing with
minimum constraints.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.630
What you really
have to understand,

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:36.890
that unknowns are x, y,
z, v, and unfortunately,

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.540
omega is also unknown.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.220
Omega is just-- it's basically
these are the volumes.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.240
This is the kind of control
variable, the price.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.020
And the price can be-- the
spread can be positive,

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.620
can be negative, can be 0.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:58.610
And this is becoming a very
ugly, non-linear problem,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.610
very quickly.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:04.690
Very big, so you have
a lot of variables.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:16.180
For two years, you have, what,
12 times 11, which is 132.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.310
Let me just-- no, 24.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.170
I'm sorry.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:24.080
It's 24 times 23, so
it's 12 times-- so it's

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.807
a big number of
variables, plus an equally

00:32:28.807 --> 00:32:31.390
big number of constraints, and
the constraints are non-linear.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.280
So the problem is pretty hard.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.730
I leave it up to you to
decide how to solve it.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.250
That's why they take
optimization courses here.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:56.150
I can suggest that there are
several approaches people

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.310
would take.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:01.100
There's approximation, where
this problem is approximated,

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.940
let's say by linear programming,
or quadratic programming,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.170
or whatever you want.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:09.320
You can do it through
Monte-Carlo simulations.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.800
Or there is an
interesting approach

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.240
through the stochastic control.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.050
I recommend you a paper
by Carmona and Ludkovski,

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:23.485
exactly how to do this-- how
to make a decision of injecting

00:33:23.485 --> 00:33:27.830
oil or withdrawing oil based
on the stochastic control,

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.450
stochastic optimization
methodology.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:37.750
But it is quite an
interesting paper.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.540
So either of these
approaches can be used.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:47.170
And they are used, and give you
sometimes different results,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:50.985
but you can look.

00:33:50.985 --> 00:33:51.860
Any questions so far?

00:33:57.632 --> 00:34:01.910
AUDIENCE: Is the
stochastic control solution

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.830
an optimal solution
or exact solution?

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.670
Is it giving the solution that
the Monte-Carlo simulation's

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:14.650
approximating?

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.739
PROFESSOR: Let me
put it this way.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:26.620
None of these solutions
is better, or prettier,

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.500
or whatever, because
of the parameters

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.230
that go into the problem.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.440
And you can have the
most precise methodology,

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.010
but if your parameters
are only 50%

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.726
accurate-- in reality,
all those parameters

00:34:41.726 --> 00:34:43.350
necessarily for
Monte-Carlo simulations

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.899
with stochastic
control, we really

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:45.940
don't know what they are.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.800
We can only can guess through
some implied market parameter

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.227
volatility, and so on.

00:34:53.227 --> 00:34:54.889
And if you're
wrong, you're wrong.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:59.250
Even your method can
be absolutely precise.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.340
I like it, because it's really
very nice mathematics there.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.100
We personally don't do that.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.560
I'm not going to tell
you what we're using,

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.260
but we do something different.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.090
And our methodology is
chosen to be robust.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.930
We chose it because we
want the methodology

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.750
to be extremely robust.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.797
So we don't want
small changes-- we

00:35:26.797 --> 00:35:28.380
don't want to have
the situation where

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.210
small changes, which usually
comes when you overparametrize.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.980
I mean, people like to go and
later-- in the second half--

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.430
I will discuss some of
the models people use.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.970
For example, they
see the richness

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.520
of the behavior of
the prices, and they

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.140
want to introduce
a lot of parameters

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.570
to capture this richness.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.270
By that, they sacrifice the
stability and robustness.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.380
So little changes in the
parameters and the value

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:55.060
can change substantially.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.330
So we prefer a
different approach,

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:00.880
where we maybe a sacrifice
some of the value,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.500
but we will gain the
robustness, stability.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.750
And this is the most
important thing.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.800
And most importantly, everything
that we use in the model

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.850
can be verified by the outside
regulators and controllers,

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.550
which in this day and age
is extremely important.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.770
Because these days,
to have a model that

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.990
is calibrated-- even
the word calibrated

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:29.360
causes a lot of
antennas just going up.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.860
So we try not to
calibrate anything.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.370
Everything that we
do can be verified--

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.269
every little brick that
goes into the model

00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:37.310
can be traded in the
market, and can be verified.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:45.010
This is very, very important
in this day and age.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:45.678
Yes?

00:36:45.678 --> 00:36:46.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:46.594 --> 00:36:49.660
What do you mean by
calibration [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.940
PROFESSOR: We'll get to
that, but very quick answer

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.300
is this-- just you have a lot
of parameters in the model.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.640
I'll show some of the
models people use.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.560
These parameters are not-- you
don't see them in the market.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.080
It's the result of your model.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.460
It's because you chose
this particular model.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.700
Black-Scholes uses
one parameter.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.850
If you use Black-Scholes
with jump-diffusion term,

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.770
and some other, you introduce
another ten parameters.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.370
These parameters
are not observable,

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.257
so you have to somehow calibrate
it to some market data.

00:37:25.257 --> 00:37:27.340
And the calibration becoming
a pretty interesting,

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.040
because calibration usually is
done through some kind of least

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.000
squares approach.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.250
So you try to look at
the observable data,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.030
and then adjust your parameters
using some least squares

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.000
approach to match that data.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.100
Least squares is
notoriously bad-- problem,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.010
so you may have many solutions.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.930
The solution set
can be very flat,

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:51.470
so you can stop very early.

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.290
So there are problems
with least squares.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:58.780
It's non-linear optimization, so
by itself, it's very difficult.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.760
So calibration can be
very, very unstable.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:05.641
Any more?

00:38:05.641 --> 00:38:06.140
OK.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.280
Now I have to tell
you the secret--

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.740
there is no Santa Claus.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:23.680
Just remember, I was telling you
that I go and I sold the option

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.670
to get 447.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.616
I've got the option.

00:38:27.616 --> 00:38:30.760
In reality there is
no option market.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.401
Nobody will buy this
option from you.

00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:34.150
The market for this
option-- non-existent.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:43.130
Now what do we do in this
particular situation?

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:49.260
That's where the whole beauty of
Black-Scholes comes into play.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.990
Black-Scholes didn't
get the Nobel Prize

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.290
for integrating some very
simple payoff function that you

00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:00.045
can do in first year of school.

00:39:00.045 --> 00:39:05.470
They got the Nobel Prize-- or
they got kind of appreciation

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.220
for what they've done,
because they showed

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.710
that, with this value, they also
have the strategy that allows

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.630
you by doing something every
day or every half a day,

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.880
you can replicate this value.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:20.770
So if you paid for
the option $5, then

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:25.430
you can show what
to do every day.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.660
They tell you what to
do every day in order

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.690
to get back this $5 at the end.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.850
So that's what their
main achievement.

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:38.560
Or if I sold an option,
and received $5,

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.910
then I will do
something that-- I

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.620
will use this $5 to replicate
any payout I owe at the end.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.680
So I sold it to
you, for example.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.300
So at the end, I owe you $50.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.000
But they showed how,
through the dynamic hedging,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.540
and using this $5 that
I receive up front,

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.250
I can be able to meet
my obligations to you.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.770
So they showed how to replicate
the payout of the option.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.310
So in reality, I don't
have to have the market.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.020
If I sold somebody
an option for 47,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.790
I don't have to have
anybody who buys it.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.800
What I will do, I will simply
use this dynamic hedging

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.410
strategy that
Black-Scholes advised me,

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:25.680
adopt it to the spread
options, which at the end

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:30.710
will produce for me 447.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:32.450
That's it.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.440
But here again,
this is another task

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.170
that quants will have to do.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.020
Not only they will
find the value.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.690
They will produce every
day the strategy that

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.510
allows you to extract this 447.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.070
So we already showed what
to do with the storage.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:53.610
But now you have to do on
the next level of complexity.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:57.420
You have to tell to the trader
what to do every day in order

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.340
to, in reality, get this 447
from selling this option.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:05.505
So you told this trader,
I'm selling this portfolio

00:41:05.505 --> 00:41:09.550
for $100,000 for the storage.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.500
OK, so, but there's
nobody to sell it.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.910
And you'll say, don't worry.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.320
I will do it through
dynamic hedging.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.520
At the end, you will
get your $100,000.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.210
So he will believe you.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.220
And then he will do it.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.300
He will get $100,000.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.850
Then, on the next level you
have to work with the guy who

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:27.260
operates the storage.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.220
And you will tell the
person when to inject oil,

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.542
and when to withdraw, and to
get all of this magic which

00:41:33.542 --> 00:41:34.500
we've discussed before.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:46.470
So I think it'll be
a very logical point

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.980
for me right now to stop.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.710
And in the next
half, we'll discuss

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.620
how to model the power plant.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.730
So we're going to
the next topic.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.850
So far, we have
covered how to model

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.300
a physical asset named storage.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:17.970
The same approach can be used
to model practically everything

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.240
that we're interested in.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.630
For example, we can
use the same thing

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:27.440
to model the tankers,
power plants, these storage

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.670
refineries, anything,
power lines, pipelines,

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.890
everything can be modeled
using this methodology.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:41.670
Of course, the nature of
the beast will be different.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.150
And you have to understand the
nuances and the-- as I said,

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:48.050
the constraints.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.380
This modeling--
for example, tanker

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.440
requires understanding
of all the routes,

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.780
and the constraints in the
ports, and all these things.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.350
But the conceptual philosophical
approach is the same.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.950
You have to find
some optionality

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.530
and that's some
additional value.

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:12.530
So I obviously don't have time
to go over the whole thing.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.770
But let's, again, for you
to have a taste of this,

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.546
let me just-- let's decide
how to model the power plant.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.600
Assume that you are the manager
of the merchant power plant.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.780
Merchant means that you decide
when to run it, or not run it.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:36.661
You run it to maximize the
profit of this power plant.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.410
So how do you decide?

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.310
Let's say you decide once
a day, in the morning,

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.920
whether to turn it on or turn
it off, or not to turn it on.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.580
So how do you decide?

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.090
Well, sounds complicated.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:56.794
In reality, it's very simple.

00:43:56.794 --> 00:44:00.660
You wake up in the morning.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.790
You look, first of
all, at the newspaper

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:07.550
and find out what's the
price of electricity today.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:09.690
And price of electricity
you know for each hour--

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:12.070
sometimes for each 15 minutes.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.430
It's determined.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.620
So you know for each hour,
or maybe the daily price,

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.930
enough for the whole day.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:21.260
So that's the price.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.240
If you sell it, that's how
much money you will get.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.220
On the other hand, to produce
one megawatt-hour of power,

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.080
you have to do something.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.910
You have to turn
on your turbines.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.795
So you have to bring some fuel.

00:44:34.795 --> 00:44:40.300
You have to put some fuel into
the turbines, just to make them

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:45.210
move, and produce electricity.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.120
Fuel can be anything.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.770
Let's say it's natural
gas, but some fuel.

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:53.850
Now you have to
determine-- so you

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:58.120
know how much money you'll get
for one megawatt-hour of power,

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.850
right?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:03.270
But how much it will
cost you to produce it?

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.730
So how much fuel you
need to determine

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.680
how much-- first of all,
how much it costs you

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.940
in terms of fuel to produce
this one megawatt-hour,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.650
you have to know the
efficiency of the plant.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:17.090
Because efficiency of
the plant is telling you

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:24.270
how much units of fuel--
let's say how much MmBTUs,

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.610
so millions British thermal
units of natural gas, that's

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:33.150
how it's measured-- how
much MmBTUs of natural gas

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.590
you have to burn to
produce one megawatt-hour.

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:41.570
Well, this measure of
efficiency for the power plant

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.440
is something called heat rate.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.830
So heat rate is exactly
this coefficient

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:54.485
by which you multiply the-- so
if I say that heat rate is 7,

00:45:54.485 --> 00:46:00.760
it means that I need 7
MmBTUs of natural gas

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.720
to produce one megawatt-hour
of power-- that's all.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.790
So in our case, there's
nothing to be concerned about.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:15.190
It's just simply some
constant that is given.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:19.640
It's some constant
between 7 to 20.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.130
20 is a very inefficient
plant, very rarely run.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.690
Seven is right now more
kind of a standard constant.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.340
That's the constant
corresponding

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.790
to the natural gas
power plant, which

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.120
is-- right now the majority
of the new plants is

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.600
the natural gas plants.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.410
And there are some
other costs associated

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:42.735
with producing one
megawatt-hour-- just

00:46:42.735 --> 00:46:48.520
air-conditioning, labor
costs, and so on and so forth.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.950
Typically, they are not
the biggest component.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.102
So if, let's say,
this is seven, what

00:46:54.102 --> 00:46:55.685
is the price of
natural gas right now?

00:46:55.685 --> 00:46:58.010
Do you remember?

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.410
AUDIENCE: $3.20.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.480
PROFESSOR: That's--
I wish, but it's not.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:08.060
It's around $4 right now,
let's say, per MmBTU.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.870
So you need $28.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.260
This is probably around
$3, so you need $31

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.770
to produce one megawatt-hour.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:16.660
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking of gasoline.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:21.360
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, not
that gas-- natural gas.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.590
Sorry about that, but
just even gasoline

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:26.082
is right now around $5.

00:47:26.082 --> 00:47:26.790
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:27.415
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.510
Or maybe you are filling
your tank someplace

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.348
which you'll share with us.

00:47:36.348 --> 00:47:43.420
[LAUGHS] So is that clear?

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.810
That's basically--
so you wake up.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.060
You look at the
price of the power.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.980
Let's say it's $50.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.970
You know your plant is,
let's say, heat rate 8.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:55.610
You look at the
price of natural gas.

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:58.700
It's $4, variable cost $3.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.700
Will we run the plant?

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:10.460
What will be your profit?

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:18.785
So $4, 8, 3, so it's
$35 it will cost you

00:48:18.785 --> 00:48:20.690
to produce one megawatt-hour.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:21.690
This is $50.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.600
You made $15 profit.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.390
You turn it on.

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:27.400
It runs.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.480
If, on the other hand,
the price of power

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.650
will be $30-- you look
in the newspaper--

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:35.900
you go back to sleep.

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.970
And nothing happens.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:38.690
You get zero for that day.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.020
So this is the maximum
between this price and zero.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:41.520
Agreed?

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.980
Well now, before I
go to the next slide,

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:02.150
I have to-- together, we'll
have to determine what

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:07.520
is-- if I want to buy a plant--
if I want to buy a power plant,

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.740
how much I'm willing
to pay for that.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:15.340
Well what I'm willing to pay--
I know that every day I'm

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.840
getting this thing, right?

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.030
But I don't know.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.340
Each of these things
is a random number.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.860
So I have to kind
of buy-- I have

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.040
to construct the
distribution of this price,

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.610
of this price, maybe
correlation between them.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.310
It's a two-dimensional
distribution, so correlation,

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.740
find some expected value.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:39.650
And that's how much I will want
to pay for the power plant.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:42.060
So now we come to an
interesting question.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.060
So now, real work starts.

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.260
So I know that this is the
value that I have to integrate,

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.620
but I don't know with respect
to which distribution.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.490
So I have to now construct the
model of the power prices, fuel

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:55.700
prices.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.190
And then take this
two-dimensional distribution

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:02.000
and try to find the expectation.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.601
And that's how much
I'm willing to pay

00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:04.850
for this power plant-- agreed?

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:13.660
Well, so let's start with kind
of building these components.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.660
That's what, again,
quants will do

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.540
using already the experience
from other markets, and so on.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.200
You already heard
the other lectures.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.500
So what we'll do, we'll first
look at the distribution

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.400
of power prices to see.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.060
Because I don't
know how to model

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.590
the evolution of power prices.

00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:35.150
I know if I use simply
Brownian motion-- let's

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.610
say it's my first idea.

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:39.180
Well, let's see.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.560
Brownian motion gives
us the distribution

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.810
which is, as you remember,
at any point of time is

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:48.160
kind of normally distributed.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.940
If I look at the terminal
distribution of price, which

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.810
is driven by Brownian motion--
if I assume that the price is

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.800
driven by Brownian
motion, then at the end,

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.360
I'll get the normal
distribution.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:04.900
So if I look at the, say
equity-- this is S&amp;P 500--

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:09.210
indeed it's-- we all know
that S&amp;P has fat tails, right?

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:13.690
But as we can see in a moment,
this is not a fat tail.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.840
This is very close to
the normal distribution.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.950
For the equity guys,
of course, for the guys

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.830
who trade the stocks, it's
an enormously fat tail.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.260
But from the commodity
point of view,

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.090
this is just perfect,
normal distribution.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.850
This is the distribution
that we deal with.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:36.920
This is-- the tails
here are just-- so

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.790
the normal distribution just
out of the window immediately.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.470
So Brownian motion
out of the window--

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.260
we cannot construct this
distribution of the terminal

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:50.280
prices of power using that.

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:51.060
That's one thing.

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.080
So we have very fat tails.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.960
And this is the kind
of the parameters

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.110
that specify the distribution.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.450
If I look at the, let's
say the equity index,

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.790
the kurtosis is very
close to the kurtosis

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:10.380
of the normal distribution,
which is 3 exactly.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.930
But if I look at
the Nord Pool, which

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:15.970
is the power prices in
Scandinavian countries,

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.200
kurtosis is 26.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.940
If I look at the
one-hour price, it's 76.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:27.130
So it is, as you can see, as
far from normal as possible.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.505
And we've seen it
in the picture.

00:52:28.505 --> 00:52:31.230
And these are the numbers
corresponding to that.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:35.730
Moreover, look at the
behavior of the prices.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.750
This is the price in Texas, for
example, power prices in Texas.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.890
What immediately jumps-- I
mean, look at the prices,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:45.660
and say, wow, how is
it different from what

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:49.200
you see, let's say, in the
equity world, the stock market,

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.270
for example?

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.220
What is it that
immediately jumps at you?

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:57.661
What is different here?

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:02.260
Go ahead.

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.703
There's no right
or wrong answer.

00:53:03.703 --> 00:53:04.430
AUDIENCE: Spikes.

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:07.460
PROFESSOR: Spikes--
that's the key word.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.570
Like no other market,
we have spikes here.

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:14.460
That's a major,
major issue for us

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.660
from the modeling point of view.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.530
You take any standard,
say Brownian motion,

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.580
it will never
exhibit the spikes.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:22.310
Not only that, the
volatility, of course,

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:26.090
of the prices, as we
already expect, is huge.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:27.710
It's hundreds.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.290
S&amp;P volatility right
now is 10% percent.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:35.460
This is 100, 200,
sometimes 1,000, right?

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.340
All the intuition you
have about the behavior

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:43.370
of the prices, the behavior
of the random variables,

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:47.570
is mostly evolved,
all this intuition,

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.000
under this 10, 15, 20%
volatility assumption.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:56.990
When the variables behave in
a completely different way

00:53:56.990 --> 00:54:03.510
when they have volatility
of 100% or 200% or 300%,

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:08.890
so that's another thing that
will be challenging us, spikes

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:11.080
and high volatility.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.710
It's just the same thing.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:14.470
It's everywhere,
so I just wanted

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.750
to bring-- a different
region of the country,

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:18.640
it will be exactly
the same thing.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.010
So it's common thing.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.900
So if you look, and start
to summarize what we're

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.090
trying to capture
is-- mean reversion

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.350
and spikes are more or
less the same thing,

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.890
so we know if we go far
away, it will go back--

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:37.390
high kurtosis,
regime switching, I

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:42.510
will talk about that in a
moment-- and non-stationarity.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:45.930
That goes without saying.

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:50.380
That's true for
most of the markets.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.360
And now the problem that
we have to capture--

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.250
or not the problem
but another phenomenon

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:59.880
that we have to capture--
that the power and the fuel,

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:04.870
natural gas, exhibit a
very particular structure

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:05.750
of the correlation.

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:07.560
So correlation is not a number.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.540
It's dependent the heat
rate in the market.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.239
Remember heat rate is the
efficiency of the power plant

00:55:13.239 --> 00:55:14.530
that are running in the market.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.120
Depending on the efficiency, you
may have very high correlation

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.330
or low correlation.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:21.460
We'll discuss that at the
end of this talk, which

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:23.370
is why this here.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.800
Right now, I'm giving you
something that we observe,

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.040
and our models, preferably,
should capture that as well.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:35.990
So requirements for our
model are pretty intense,

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:40.880
and pretty difficult. I
don't think that you ever

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.390
assume the requirement
of the correlation

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:46.240
should have some particular
structure, just depending

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.590
on some parameters, and so on.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.815
OK, any questions?

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:04.840
So the models typically--
the first thing people do,

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.370
they take the models that they
know, and they try to apply.

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:10.834
Let's just very quickly
go through the models.

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.500
I mean, you've seen
these models already

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.520
in the previous lectures, right?

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.900
Let's start with the
straightforward geometric

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.830
Brownian motion, which out of
the window right away, right?

00:56:20.830 --> 00:56:25.810
I mean you agree, because
no spikes, no high--

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.620
no correlation
structure, nothing.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:34.111
So it's clear that in order
to-- we want to kind of start

00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:36.110
with Brownian motion,
geometric Brownian motion,

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:40.340
try to maybe modify
it a little bit.

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.060
So what is spike?

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.972
Spike means that
just things go up,

00:56:43.972 --> 00:56:45.180
and then they're pulled back.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.290
So there should be some
mean reversion, right?

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:50.204
So mean reversion
is good, right?

00:56:50.204 --> 00:56:51.620
But unfortunately,
mean reversion,

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.490
if you-- first of all, it's
pretty strong, so it goes,

00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.330
remember, if the price
goes from $30 to $1,000,

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:03.840
and go back to $30,
mean reversion should

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.670
be extremely strong, right?

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:08.870
Second of all, what pushes
it to the $1,000 level?

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:13.450
You need to have a jump.

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.910
So that's why people
introduce the jumps.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:21.100
So we have mean
reversion, jumps; jumps

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.250
and mean reversion.

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:30.430
Still it is becoming
pretty clear

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.970
that this will not work
for the following reason:

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.590
it goes from $30
to $1,000, and then

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.380
it goes back,
because it's a spike.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.760
It goes back within
three or four days.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.505
It comes back.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.620
So the mean reversion
should be extremely strong.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.100
The force of pulling back
should be extremely strong.

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.500
But if it's so strong
that it moves you back

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.200
from $1,000 to $30,
imagine what it does when

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.980
you're on the level of $30.

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.120
Because it will be completely
flat-- just nothing,

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.490
you could not move there, right?

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:06.860
So people observed that,
and introduced, well, they

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.360
figured out maybe
the mean reversion

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.470
will be different at
the level of $1,000

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:13.450
than when you are at
the normal level of $30,

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.740
so the difference.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.600
So you introduce right now
so-called regime switching.

00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.410
So it means that
all the parameters

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:22.510
change, so you introduce
the kind of the high price

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:25.060
level, low price level,
parameters change.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.220
And now we're getting
to the example

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:32.410
that we discussed
in the first half.

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:35.560
You end up with the
model with 10 parameters,

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.890
12 parameters, which is
absolutely impossible

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.010
to manage.

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:44.630
I mean, I can give
you another, probably,

00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:48.220
hour discussing why
this approach in general

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.480
is not good.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.290
And not just in commodities,
but everywhere else.

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:56.270
I mean, I'm not a big fan of
making the models extremely

00:58:56.270 --> 00:59:01.410
complicated, because
introduction of one complexity

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:03.827
leads to introduction
of another complexity.

00:59:03.827 --> 00:59:05.410
And you just cannot
manage this thing.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:06.990
It's impossible to manage.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:10.820
Theoretically, it looks
fantastic-- unmanageable.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:15.070
So we have to figure
out something else.

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:17.080
So all these
methodologies-- and I

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.590
put them there-- the
methodologies people actually

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:25.230
use, the stochastic volatility,
the regime switching,

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:28.150
multiple jumps, and so on.

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:35.080
This-- it's all used, but it's
not what I want to suggest.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.650
I want to suggest something
completely different.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:39.620
These are the methodologies
that typically

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:43.845
are coming from fixed-income
world or foreign exchange

00:59:43.845 --> 00:59:45.040
or equities and so on.

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:49.050
I want to introduce something
completely different.

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:52.180
Any questions so far?

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.970
So I want to introduce
the methodology which

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:58.070
is more suitable and
more understandable from

00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.580
the commodity point of view.

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.110
Because actually, what's
the price of commodity?

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:06.380
Price of commodity is
driven by only two things.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.394
Can you guess which?

01:00:08.394 --> 01:00:09.560
AUDIENCE: Supply and demand.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.080
PROFESSOR: Exactly, supply
and demand-- that's all it is.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.400
That's what we'll try to do.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.100
Maybe we can-- we have a hard
time modeling the commodity

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.190
prices using just these
standard methodologies

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:27.430
from different markets,
which rely only on the prices

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:28.760
themselves.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.900
Maybe if I introduce some
fundamental modeling as well,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:36.820
I can do it without losing
the most important part

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:39.930
of this model, is it
matches the market data.

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:44.460
So I have to-- A: I want
to model supply and demand.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:50.210
But I also would like to match
every market data that I have.

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.750
So maybe I introduce
a completely different

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.890
complexity, maybe not.

01:00:54.890 --> 01:01:01.710
So let's try to see if I
can succeed here or not.

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:04.800
Before we're going to go
into the depths of this,

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.466
let's discuss how the
power prices are formed.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:22.550
Power prices are formed
in the following way--

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:29.520
let's say that the market
consists of two power plants.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.930
And there's Generator
One and Generator Two.

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:40.830
Every day, they get prices of
power formed at the auction.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.960
So every time the
generators will

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:48.100
submit the bids, which says
the following-- I can generate

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.570
50 megawatt for a given hour.

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:55.190
I will generate 50 megawatt.

01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:57.210
If you ask me only
to generate 50,

01:01:57.210 --> 01:02:01.180
I will generate them at $20.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.680
Why?

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.435
Because I will run my most
efficient power plant,

01:02:05.435 --> 01:02:06.810
which is the
cheapest one to run.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:10.260
I will generate 50 megawatts.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.570
If you want more, if
you want me to-- I'm

01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:15.250
bidding-- if you
want me to do 100,

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:18.660
then you'll have to
pay me $25, because I

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.450
will have to introduce less
efficient power plants,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:22.410
and so on.

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.930
200 to $30, and if you
want me to me generate 600,

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.090
you will have to pay me $50.

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:32.470
So that's my bid,
so-called bid stack.

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.230
That's what I'm
sending to the auction.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.220
The other guy is
sending similar things.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:41.030
The auctioneer-- there
is an auctioneer,

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:46.210
organization called independent
system operator, ISO.

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:48.680
They collect all these bids.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.050
They know what demand
will be tomorrow.

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:55.440
They collect, and then
knowing this demand,

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.260
they will-- first of all, they
will sort out all the bids

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.170
in the most optimal way.

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:06.120
So they'll put it all
together by sorting.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:10.555
So this is the auctioneer
combined all these two

01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:14.430
bids, created this
graph-- so basically based

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.970
on how much they
need to generate.

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:21.524
So based on the demand,
this will be the price.

01:03:21.524 --> 01:03:23.440
That will be the clearing
price of the market.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.650
And then, because the
auctioneer knows all the bids,

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.367
the auctioneer will
send the demand

01:03:29.367 --> 01:03:30.950
for this generator
and that generator.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:35.840
So you will generate 60, you
will generate 600, or whatever.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:40.590
The final price is the highest,
basically highest price

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:43.220
that is necessary
to meet the demand.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.310
So if the demand is 600,
so this will be the price.

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:48.600
If it's 800, this
will be the price.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:56.500
So the price is
clearly the function

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.840
of demand for any given day.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.650
Well, even if this
is the case, then

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:09.050
if I look at the-- if I plot,
do the scatter-plot demand

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:13.740
versus price, I'll have
to see something similar.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.080
Well, let's see.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.670
When we take a
particular market,

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:22.680
and do the scattered graph,
so demand versus the price,

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:28.020
you see this is the graph
that we expect to see.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.390
It's a little bit fat.

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.530
Why is it fat?

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.820
Why is it not a straight line?

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.304
Why is it not the line
as before, but it's fat?

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.740
What is random here?

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.500
Remember I told you
that each generator will

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.900
bid approximately how much
it will cost them to generate

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.850
at the particular day.

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:55.330
That cost depends
on the fuel price,

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:56.610
and that is a random number.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:00.380
So what you can see here
is a lot of these curves,

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.370
but they are kind of randomly
moving because of the fuel

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:07.420
price affects the
cost of running.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.030
But conceptually,
philosophically, this

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:14.660
is exactly what we discussed--
that these guys will

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.380
bid this curve.

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.730
And depending on the
demand, the price

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:25.370
will be simply the
value on that curve.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.320
Are you with me?

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.090
So far so good?

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:37.500
So this is-- that's what
we're trying to model.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:42.040
So if we can model that, if
I can model for every day

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:46.060
the bid curve that
the auctioneer,

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.350
the independent
system operator, sees,

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:50.170
I know the price at
that particular day.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.450
Moreover, I don't want
to get too complicated,

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:57.950
but in reality,
I don't even have

01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:59.280
to know precisely the curve.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.590
I kind of have to know
precisely the distribution,

01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:04.650
because remember, for
the value of the option,

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:07.790
you don't need to know where
the price will be at expiration.

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:11.970
You just need to know how the
price will be distributed.

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:14.780
If you catch the
distribution correctly

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.565
through, again,
dynamic hedging and so

01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:18.445
on-- that's what
Black-Scholes tells you--

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.960
you can actually value
the option correctly.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.330
So you can value the
power plant correctly.

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:25.240
But that's besides the point.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.820
The point is right now
I'm trying to model,

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:33.220
somehow, the randomness
of this bid curve.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:41.110
So now, to summarize, the power
price is the function of what?

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.720
Of demand, clearly-- we
already know it is that.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.560
But also the fuel
prices, because the fuel

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.350
prices determine the
cost of generation

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:51.950
and therefore, how much
each generator will

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.560
bid into the market.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.520
That's dependent on the cost.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.300
If the natural gas
goes through the roof,

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.180
the price of generating one
megawatt will be very high.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.770
So the person will
be-- the generator

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.520
will be bidding
very high prices.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.520
And that's what we see here.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.600
And also outages-- we
have to model outages,

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.220
because the market
is only finite, kind

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.710
of fleet of the power plants.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:20.645
And if a couple of them will
go down, the price of power

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:22.440
can be affected dramatically.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:33.330
The 1997, the Indiana-- the
price went from $40 to $7,000

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:36.960
because tornado hit
the nuclear plant.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.580
You take a big chunk of the
generation from the stack,

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.740
and all of a sudden,
you have to run

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:49.190
absolutely anything, including
some very expensive diesels,

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.760
and so on.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.100
So the price of power,
obviously, goes very high.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.670
OK, so these are three
things that we try to model.

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.070
So how will we model that?

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:14.340
Well, before even I get
to the modeling of them,

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:19.040
let me just again outline
our modeling approach.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.819
If I know the fuel-- let's say
there are no outages-- if I

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:29.850
know the fuel price,
I know then how much

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:31.430
each of the
generators-- how much

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:34.410
it will cost for each of the
generators in the market.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:37.069
Because I know
everybody in the market.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:42.069
I know how much for each of
them it will cost to generate.

01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:46.020
So fuel, if I know fuel
price, I can generate

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.620
so-called generation stack.

01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:51.810
It means the cost of generation
for each of the generators,

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:54.340
for each of the
participants in the market.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.229
The outages will simply
allow me to take out

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.180
some of these participants
out of the picture, basically.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.830
So I need to know that, but
that's-- at any given day,

01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.010
if I know the outages,
I know the fuel prices,

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:10.569
I can construct the cost of
generating for everybody.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:14.529
So it's close to the bid stack.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:18.180
It's something that they
will bid-- their cost,

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.260
maybe plus some profit.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.710
I don't know what their
profit margins are.

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:25.779
But what I know, I
know the market prices.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.100
I know the options, how
they trade, and so on.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.430
So the bid stack
will, in general,

01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:33.120
follow the generation stack.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.779
It will be, more or less,
the same thing, maybe some

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:38.000
added profit requirements.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.340
But I can back these
profit requirements

01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:43.290
from the market prices.

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:47.840
That's where my supply-demand
approach and the market

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.630
will get together.

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:52.750
I will adjust the generation
stack in such a way,

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:54.920
maybe moving it up and
down in such a way,

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.740
that I matched the
prices, and I matched

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:02.490
the option prices, so measured
the volatility of the market.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.830
So now the circle is
completely closed,

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:09.870
if I can succeed in doing that.

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:11.060
Questions?

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.390
This is the key.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.530
Well, let's see
if I can do that.

01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:27.560
So first I want to-- now if
I manage to do that, then

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.725
if I know how to model the
evolution of fuel prices,

01:10:31.725 --> 01:10:35.210
if I know how the
outages are modeled,

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:39.520
and I model the demand, then
I can determine how the power

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.080
prices will be moving in time.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.370
So power price is the function
of the bid stack and demand,

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:47.300
as you remember.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.510
So if I know the evolution of
the bid stack, the evolution

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:55.210
of the demand, I can determine
the evolution of the power

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.862
price-- completely
different approach.

01:11:00.114 --> 01:11:02.030
So let's start with the
evolution of the fuel,

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:04.940
with building the fuel model.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.250
Well, I told you that
there is natural gas.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.510
In reality, we have to
model all that stuff.

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:15.330
Because each of them has a
curve because of volatility.

01:11:15.330 --> 01:11:18.150
It looks a lot,
but in reality it's

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:21.490
not, because we have
a pretty good idea.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:23.810
Unlike the power prices
with the spikes and all

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:26.330
this crazy behavior, we
have a pretty good idea

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:29.360
of the behavior of these things,
because they're all storable.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.940
By the way, power
prices are jumping

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.760
because of non-storability
of power prices,

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.800
because they're not storable.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:42.050
Because they're non-storable,
you cannot smooth out

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:43.960
the changes in the demand.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.610
Just so you have-- your
action's immediate.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:48.440
These are all
storable commodities,

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.020
so the behavior is
much more regular.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:54.320
They're much closer, let's
say, to the equity prices.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.150
And so we can use
some standard models.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.020
So from the modeling
point of view,

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.320
they are not particularly
difficult to model.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.550
So particularly just natural
gas, heating oil and fuel oil,

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:10.440
just the coal-- just we have
a pretty good understanding

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.552
of how these things are modeled.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:22.120
Outage, well, we take
the standard model from--

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.950
and reliability
theory provides us

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:29.520
with a very well-developed
mechanism and apparatus

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.690
how to model these things.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.940
I mean, usually we do it
through some kind of Poisson,

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.890
or version of Poisson process.

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.891
It is very well understood.

01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:38.390
There's a lot of
literature on that.

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:40.890
We can model that very easily.

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:44.520
Where do we have the
parameters for these Poissons?

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.570
The government
provides us with these.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:47.700
There's government data.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:50.790
Sometimes we get it directly
from the power plants.

01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:55.130
Everybody keeps track of
the frequency of the outages

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:59.860
and so on and so forth.

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:02.470
Demand-- how will
we model demand?

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:07.250
Well, we'll model demand through
the temperature, typically.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.940
Why temperature?

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:10.340
Because for temperature,
we have a lot of data.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.310
It's statistically
a very stable thing.

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.750
So there are many
different approaches

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:17.750
to modeling temperature.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:22.966
It's up to you.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.590
There's a lot of
literature, so I'm not

01:13:24.590 --> 01:13:26.090
going to go into detail.

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:28.200
So we choose something.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.970
We model temperature.

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:31.460
From that, we model the demand.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.718
And it works pretty well.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:40.480
So now we have-- we modeled
the evolution of temperature,

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.950
evolution of demand,
evolution of fuel,

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:45.420
evolution of the outages.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:50.950
Now we can construct
the generation stack.

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:57.450
So remember, the generation
was this curve, this curve that

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:01.820
was a function of demand,
but also the fraction

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:05.490
of the outages, variable
costs, and so on,

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:10.800
and the fuel, the vector fuels.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:13.240
And then there's
these parameters alpha

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.050
and these alpha
parameters we choose

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:19.330
to match the futures, the
forward curve for the power

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.730
prices and all other market
parameters as we need.

01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:25.090
So that's how we get-- so
we're matching the market,

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:34.650
and we're matching the kind of
supply and demand formation.

01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:39.330
Now, it is very clear
why with this approach,

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:44.540
I can capture spikes without
effort, without any effort.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.537
And the reason is very simple.

01:14:51.427 --> 01:15:00.260
This is my-- remember the stack,
my bid stack or generation

01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.250
stack, whatever.

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:06.530
So for high generation
volumes, it's

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:09.190
becoming more and more
expensive to generate.

01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:11.570
And after a certain
time, you've exhausted

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:13.270
all your cheap plants.

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:15.410
You have to go to very,
very expensive plants,

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.740
like diesel plants
and so on, which

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:20.180
runs maybe once in a
lifetime, maybe once a year,

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.050
twice a year.

01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:22.062
And very expensive.

01:15:22.062 --> 01:15:23.270
But they determine the price.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:25.960
They are the ones that
determined the clearing price

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.790
at the market.

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:29.160
Now, let's see.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.346
If we are somewhere
here-- this is demand.

01:15:31.346 --> 01:15:32.990
Demand is driven by temperature.

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:37.070
Temperature is
typically a normal thing

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:38.460
with maybe mean reversion.

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:42.330
If it goes up, it typically
reverses some mean.

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.400
So this is the distribution
of demand around here.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.420
Well, if demand
moves left or right,

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.720
up, down, the prices
don't change much.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.540
So that's your normal regime.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.840
But let's assume demand
is somewhere here.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.050
If you are to the left,
the prices are very small.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:07.130
But the moment you move a
little bit to the right,

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:11.240
your temperature moves a
little bit to the high region.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.810
You immediately spike
into the $1,000 territory.

01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:17.640
But remember, temperature's
mean reverting,

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:22.100
so within five, six
days, it comes back.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.100
You go back.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:28.520
Your price goes from high
levels back to the normal level.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:31.130
That's your spikes.

01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:33.260
You get it completely for free.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:36.380
And I'll show you right
now a couple of graphs.

01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.810
One is the actual graph.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:41.460
The other the simulated
using this approach

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.470
for the same market.

01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:47.930
So as you can see, this
is the actual price

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:50.360
for that particular period.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.430
These are the prices
that we generate-- just

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:55.802
plain Monte-Carlo simulation.

01:16:55.802 --> 01:17:00.610
As you can see, this
can be easily this.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:03.750
Just from the point of view--
distribution of the spikes

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.610
and so on, it's
exactly the same thing.

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:08.270
This is what we were after.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.590
Moreover, I'll
tell you even more.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:16.270
If I knew the past of
the fuel, then obviously

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:19.800
my approach-- there
are two graphs here.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.700
You cannot distinguish
between them,

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.720
because I substituted exactly
the right price of the fuel,

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.660
just actual price,
which was historically.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:32.410
And therefore my price and the
actual price were the same.

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:36.690
So, but the reality, of
course, I don't know the past.

01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:38.740
But as I explained to
you, I don't need to know.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.570
I just need to know the
distribution of fuel prices

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:42.890
is correctly captured.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:45.370
Once I have the correctly
captured distribution

01:17:45.370 --> 01:17:48.390
of the fuel prices, I
have, according to this,

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:51.580
correctly captured distribution
of the power prices.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:57.500
Moreover, so as you can see,
we have a very nice behavior.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.470
Now from the parameter's point
of view, this is the model.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:04.330
Look at the kurtosis.

01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:05.770
This is summers.

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:08.570
Kurtosis of the model and
kurtosis of the empirical

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:09.870
is very, very close.

01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:12.580
So the distributions
are very close.

01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:15.230
I mean, the skewness
and so on-- it's

01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:21.930
a very, very good capturing
of the distribution.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:26.554
So this approach
works very nicely.

01:18:26.554 --> 01:18:28.720
It's completely different
from what you get used to,

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.530
but it's really
the one that works.

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:39.601
Moreover, final
benefit-- bonus point--

01:18:39.601 --> 01:18:41.684
this is simulated correlation
structure, remember?

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:52.540
And this is the actual
one-- very close.

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:56.650
And the beauty of it is you
don't have-- it's not an input.

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:57.960
It's an output.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.470
I don't ever use the correlation
as an input in my model.

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.410
I got it.

01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:04.870
I got the distribution of
power, got distribution of fuel,

01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:07.780
natural gas, put it all
together, compute correlation

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.450
and that's what I've got.

01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:15.000
And this means that this is
really a correct approach.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.900
And I don't need
to put it-- I don't

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.930
need to look for the
distribution that

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:20.030
has this property.

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:23.140
This property comes
for free, just

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:25.985
as a result of the
completely alternative way

01:19:25.985 --> 01:19:27.780
of modeling this thing.

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.930
Now, what is the
negative side of this?

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:32.840
The negative side is
it's extremely difficult

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.960
to do it and maintain
it, because you

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.430
have to maintain the
information of every power plant

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.247
and was built, was retired,
and will be built, and so on.

01:19:41.247 --> 01:19:43.080
Because you have to
look at the power prices

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.300
10 years, 20 years from now.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.080
You have to know what's going
to be there, what kind of stack

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.490
you have to forecast.

01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.260
That's a lot of
information to keep.

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:54.400
I mean, you have to have a big
organization to work on that,

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.560
to maintain it, to
build the model.

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.070
Because each region in this
country has a different market.

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:06.790
So you have to-- I mean,
it's a massive undertaking.

01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:08.040
It takes years.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:12.474
So it's not like you
can get it from the can.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.100
It's expensive.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:19.825
So I think that will be a
good point for me to stop.

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:25.971
If you have questions,
please let me know.

01:20:29.944 --> 01:20:30.444
Questions?

01:20:37.402 --> 01:20:40.510
I think it's music to my ears.

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:42.360
Thank you.
