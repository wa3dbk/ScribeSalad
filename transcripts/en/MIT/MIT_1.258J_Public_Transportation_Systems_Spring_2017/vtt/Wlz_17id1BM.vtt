00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:24.140
PROFESSOR: So today we talk
about ridership forecasting.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Last time we talked
about cost modeling.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.320
So we were looking
at models to estimate

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.760
costs of [INAUDIBLE] changes.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.200
Today we look at how
ridership responds,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.360
which is the other big question
the agencies, [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.670
agencies have when a
network will suffer changes.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240
So we'll talk about route
ridership prediction

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.840
needs and issues,
alternative approaches

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.170
to ridership prediction
and forecasting.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.860
We'll look at some examples
from several agencies,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.930
notably the Toronto Transit
commission and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.650
We'll look at more advanced
sort of DIS based models,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.440
simultaneous equations
models, and show

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.810
some examples of
software packages

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.760
that people use for this.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.200
So one note before we see
is that all of this lecture

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.100
focuses on short run root
level prediction methods.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.160
We're not talking about
regional level effects of, say,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.490
the land use influence on
ridership, or the total amount.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.230
We're talking about
specifically transit ridership.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.870
And it's a little
more short run.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.030
So you'll see how that plays
a role as we move forward.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460
OK, so what are the roles?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
Why do we need ridership models?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.020
Of course, predicting ridership
is tied to predicting revenue,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.520
right?

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.860
So when there is any change
an agency is interested in,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.350
will they lose ridership
or gain ridership,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.100
and what impact will that
have on their fair bidding?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.030
So first role is predicting
ridership revenues

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.110
or total fare changes.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.540
This is the most
typical example.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.900
All agencies go through
periodic fare changes

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.090
unless they are completely free.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.020
So usually you want
system-wide predictions.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.990
And the approaches are
fairly specific calculations.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.010
So you might estimate
some risk elasticity

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.630
of the response, average
response of ridership

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.920
to fare changes.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.860
You could use a time
theory [INAUDIBLE] model.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.818
That's a better approach
if you want to control

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.580
for external factors.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.690
And the best methods use a
two-stage market segment model,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.114
recognizing that different
segments of the population

00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:42.530
might have different
elasticities,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.865
different responses
to a fair change.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.990
The second role is predicting
ridership and revenue

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.990
for general agency planning
and budget [INAUDIBLE],,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.030
so not necessarily fair changes.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.690
Here, again, we need a
system-wide prediction.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.062
And the key elements are
trend projection and another--

00:03:06.062 --> 00:03:08.270
this is another place where
a time series [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.370
model plays a role.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.260
Here we're not
necessarily looking

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.800
at a response to
something, not anything

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.290
that the agency has
control over, for example.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.110
But you might have the
impacts of gas prices

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.260
or other external factors,
population growth,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.300
things like that, so trends,
seasonality, things like that.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.490
Then there's predicting
ridership revenue

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.310
as a result of service changes.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.460
This is the other
very typical example.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.200
So here we are interested
in more detailed root level

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.990
prediction as opposed to
system wide prediction.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.940
And therefore, we need
to take into account

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.360
the higher resolution
set of variables,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.870
like the periods of operation,
the headway or frequency

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.960
of service, route
configuration, stop spacing,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.521
and service type because
of demand response

00:03:58.521 --> 00:03:59.520
to all of these factors.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.500
And which factors affect
transit ridership?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.920
We mentioned a few of them.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.510
Broadly speaking,
we can divide them

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.810
into two categories--
exogenous factors that are not

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.590
under the control of the agency,
and endogenous factors which

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.690
the agency has some
degree of control over.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.820
So exogenous factors include
auto ownership and availability

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.230
and operating costs.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.470
The cheaper it is to own
and maintain and operate

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.020
your own private
automobile, the less likely

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.240
you are to take transit.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.930
Fuel prices and
availability, same thing.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.770
Demographics-- it's age,
gender, other income.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.770
All these things affect
ridership and revenues.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.180
And then the activity system.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.910
So tractors, job centers,
population density,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.640
things like that also
are affecting ridership.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.380
So to the degree that there's an
exogenous change in the system,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.220
population, employment
distributions,

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.730
these things can influence
ridership, demand

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.370
for public transportation.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.260
So usually these
things are assumed

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.770
to be fixed in the short run.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.920
And we said that we would
focus on short run predictions.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.634
Often these things are
not considered in models.

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:23.300
Some of them do.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.770
We'll look at some exceptions.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.380
And then there's
endogenous factors.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.052
And these are the ones that an
agency can control, so fare,

00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:33.260
the head of way which relates
to how long people have

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.020
to wait for service, route
structure which relates

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.590
to the walking time, access
and egress times, and the ride

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.820
time.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.830
And then there is
crowding and reliability.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.340
So obviously if we
change frequency,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.900
we might change crowding.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.390
And also reliability
through cycle

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.010
time and available
recovery time,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.120
as we've seen in
previous lectures.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:01.370
So crowding is interesting
because as crowding increases,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.530
that makes transit less
comfortable, right?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.480
So that has an impact to,
say, decrease the demand.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.190
And then if demand
is to decrease,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.710
then that would really
reduce crowding.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.310
So there is some sort of loop
there, a causal loop which

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.290
reaches some
equilibrium, at least,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.560
when we look at snapshots.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.730
Crowding and reliability
are difficult to measure,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.020
especially reliability
is difficult to measure

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.800
without ADL.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.350
And crowding is difficult
to measure without ADC.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.950
So usually these things
are not accounted

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.130
for in ridership prediction
models if you look at practice.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.600
These things are often excluded.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.190
They are important, though,
so they do effect demand.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.240
Reliability has a
big impact on demand,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.740
according to revealed
preference studies.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.222
OK, so--

00:06:57.222 --> 00:06:57.930
AUDIENCE: Can I--

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:58.596
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:58.596 --> 00:06:59.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.910
AUDIENCE: In the exogenous
factors of auto availability,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.500
now in this world we're
living where [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.150
does that fall under
auto availability,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:11.607
even though it's
not a function--

00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:13.690
PROFESSOR: But that is an
exogenous factor, right?

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.330
However you want to classify it.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.040
So the question is,
transportation network

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.140
companies like Uber and
Lyft and Fasten, et cetera,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.430
all of these companies provide
not necessarily auto ownership.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.770
But they do affect--

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.440
they provide a different
mode of transportation

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.690
that competes in some
cases and other cases

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.880
might complement
public transportation.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.920
So that's an exogenous factor.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.540
It's not necessarily
under the control

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.500
of the public
transportation agency.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.020
And therefore it's not--

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.860
I haven't seen any demand
model that captures it,

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.280
although there is some
research here at MIT that

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.441
is trying to look at that
because that's an emerging

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:54.940
trend.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:08:00.880
And it's important to see if
we can capture those effects.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.940
AUDIENCE: In certain
places [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.040
PROFESSOR: We don't know, right?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.830
We're still investigating.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.397
AUDIENCE: But you
said we consider

00:08:09.397 --> 00:08:10.480
those factors to be fixed.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.790
But actually, TNC is
an example of something

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.490
which is rather dynamic
in terms of pricing.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.140
PROFESSOR: So I didn't
say that we want

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.520
to consider them to be fixed.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.180
I'm saying that if we look at
what happens in practice, what

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.240
the models that agencies
have implemented and used

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.550
to study, to predict ridership
and revenue, those models,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.890
if you were to go
survey the industry,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.039
and even some models in
academia tend to assume

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.669
these things to be fixed.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.510
And part of that has
to do with the fact

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:46.490
that the predictions of interest
are shorter on predictions.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:51.370
For example, I'm going
to raise fares by $0.25.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.370
So should I include
the effect of TNCs?

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.120
Yes or no?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.679
Maybe.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:56.220
I don't know.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.030
But it could be a factor, right?

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.661
So good question.

00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:03.160
OK.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.450
So the traditional
approach is reactive.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.990
So if there is an
exogenous change,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.740
the reaction is to
monitor that change

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.730
and maybe respond to it in
service planning process.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.250
An endogenous change,
such as a fare increase,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.360
it means that we're sort
of modifying the system

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.480
and if we see a
ridership change,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.570
we might then react to
the ridership change.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.650
So it's always catching
up to what we see.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.420
So no attempt to anticipate
impacts prior to the changes.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.420
Current practice,
typically little attention

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.410
is paid to the problem in many
public transportation agencies,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.560
unless it's fare increases or
a major capital project, right?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.120
So we just set an example of
TNCs being a different thing.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.850
We haven't really
seen serious attention

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.780
until very recently
of what impact that

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.740
would have on our ridership.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.510
Typical or traditional planning
models are ineffective.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.280
Generally, they're
not lethal enough

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.100
to apply them for a
short run prediction.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.550
So we're thinking here
about four-step modeling.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.960
It's expensive to run.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.480
It takes time.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.120
So for short run
predictions, they

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.760
tend not to have
the high [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.030
solution that you need to decide
something about a specific bus

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.150
route, for example.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.540
So these are
typically not applied

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.170
to specific case studies.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.250
Yes, question?

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.311
AUDIENCE: What is TNC?

00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.060
PROFESSOR: Transportation
Network Company,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:48.400
so Uber, Lyft, Via, Fasten,
all these providers.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.970
So ad hoc judgmental
methods dominate.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.760
So now these methods are not
the most accurate, obviously.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.990
But they are useful, especially
if there's a small change

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.400
and you have many
proposals on the table,

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.150
you have people experienced
with the area or the network.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.330
They might have a good sense
of at least the direction

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:16.730
and the overall level of
change that one might expect.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.610
But they tend to
be quite inaccurate

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.230
for disaggregate predictions,
long term predictions, or very

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.580
large changes in the network.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.090
So if you're doing
something small, maybe OK.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.520
If you're doing something
significant, not so much.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.610
OK, so we have four approaches
here to modeling, right, is it?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:45.990
Ordered from in order of
increasing sophistication,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:48.150
starting with
professional judgment,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.370
then non-committal
survey techniques,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.040
then cross-sectional
data models,

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.580
then time series data models.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.220
And let's talk a little
bit about each one.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.460
Professional
judgment, so this is

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.390
when you bring in as an
agency either experts

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.910
within the agency
or consultants whose

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.440
job is to predict ridership.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.850
They have a lot of
experience doing so.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.850
They might have local knowledge.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.910
And of course, the
problem is that there

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.730
haven't been any scientific
studies that indicate

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.490
the accuracy of these methods.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.560
They tend not to be reproducible
every time you call someone in.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.070
That's sort of a one
shot deal, right?

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.960
So you're not really able to
replicate those results easily

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.290
or understand what
led to the prediction.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.040
This reflects lack of faith in
formal models in some cases,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.620
lack of data or
technical expertise

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.270
to support the
development from all,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.270
or a lack of time
or budget to do so.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.090
And maybe most importantly
relative on importance

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.920
of the topic of
ridership prediction

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.070
in general to an
agency is compared

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.640
to the impact of changes or
impacts on existing ridership.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.230
So agencies tend to worry
more about the reaction

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.240
of the public that
currently rides

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.030
their service than
the general increase

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.110
or decrease in ridership.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.780
Although, they do they
are concerned about that.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:16.750
They worry more
about the last four.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.700
So any questions on
professional judgment?

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.850
We all know what this is, right?

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:24.780
OK.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.600
Survey-based methods, the
next level of sophistication.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.170
So here we go out
and ask people,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.430
would you ride a
bus route if it were

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.040
extended to Kendall Square.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.300
Or if we provide
a new train line,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.090
would you do this instead
of driving your own car?

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.810
Things like this.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.934
And how much would you pay?

00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:52.870
So you can survey
people and ask them,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.280
would you take this or not?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.094
You lay out a proposal and you
ask people for their reaction.

00:14:01.094 --> 00:14:03.010
This isn't called
non-committal because people

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.470
are saying that they
would do it or not do it.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.230
But they are not
committed to doing so.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.030
And there's no promise
that they will do so.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.400
So the stated
preference might be

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.380
quite different from
the revealed preference

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.760
if one were to actually follow
up with what these people

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.730
actually, the--

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.580
question?

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.974
AUDIENCE: Is there a sense
of accuracy [INAUDIBLE]??

00:14:24.974 --> 00:14:26.140
PROFESSOR: It varies widely.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.840
And there are many
papers and lots

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.430
of studies that
have looked at this.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.030
So--

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] can
you just give us a sense?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.193
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, right here.

00:14:34.193 --> 00:14:37.690
So typically we have a survey.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.620
You might ask, say, 500
people or 300 people

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.150
whether they would
do this or not.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.885
A typical example is a roadside
survey where you stop cars

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.760
and you ask them, would
you have taken a park

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.587
and ride using the metro
system or an express bus line?

00:14:53.587 --> 00:14:55.420
And they would say yes
or no and off you go.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.070
So noncommittal, right?

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.370
There's no-- there's no
necessity to actually do

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.480
that if you said yes.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.810
So the problem is that there's
this noncommittal bias.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:11.620
People tend to say yes more
than they would actually do so.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.900
This has to do with sort
of psychological factors.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.490
Sometimes the desire somewhat
subconscious to be friendly--

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.740
there is a perception that
the person doing the survey

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.110
is interested in
[INAUDIBLE] result.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.880
And therefore, as
human beings, we

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.880
try to be friendly or try
to be positive, right?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.130
This is psychological.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.180
It's subconscious.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.200
It affects results.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.660
So what happens--
what ends up happening

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.610
is that there's an
adjustment factor

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.390
for the non-committal bias.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:42.390
And this is where professional
judgment comes in.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.140
So you do have some
survey technique.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.720
But at the end, you
need this fudge factor.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.200
You multiply it by anywhere
between 5% and 50%.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.230
And what that range-- what
that specific number is

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.950
depends on the specifics of
a problem, who you survey,

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.760
how many people you survey,
the experience with the person

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.650
conducting the study.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.480
Any questions on
non-committal surveys?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.938
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
maybe it could also

00:16:06.938 --> 00:16:10.600
be that I would say yes because
I personally wouldn't use it,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.725
but I have a kid
who might use it.

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:14.450
And so I know someone
who would use it.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.970
So I say, yeah, yeah, I use it.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:17.990
And I might even be--

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.823
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:18.823 --> 00:16:20.330
--blatantly lying about myself.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.991
But I say, oh, well, if
they provide this service,

00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:23.990
then my kid will use it.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.304
And so I want to say yes.

00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:26.720
PROFESSOR: I'll
repeat the comment

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.560
for the benefit of people
listening on the web later on.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.090
So the comment is that another
reason for a noncommittal bias

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.530
is that you might know
people who would write it.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.620
Or another instance of
this is, maybe you ask,

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.540
would you today have done this?

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.010
And maybe today
you wouldn't have,

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.960
but you think, typically
I would, right?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.459
So then you want to be helpful
and give what is most typical.

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:53.750
Problem with that is that if
everybody's is doing that,

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.250
you have a bias, right?

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.500
Because you are doing,
hopefully, a random sample.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.295
So you could have surveyed
my spouse or my kid,

00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:02.920
but you didn't.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.380
You picked someone at random.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.800
If everyone you pick is trying
to answer for someone else

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.349
or answer for what I would
have done on a different day

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.609
and that all leads to a positive
bias, then in aggregate,

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:16.920
you could have a problem.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.380
So it doesn't help if people
are dishonest and trying

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.690
to be helpful, right?

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.829
Any questions-- yeah?

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.454
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:25.454 --> 00:17:28.190
Is there any way to
randomize the direction

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.210
of the question and--

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.500
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.710
PROFESSOR: Yes, but that's--

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.930
so that's the next method.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.440
So we'll talk about
that right now.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.030
So this is not recommended
because this bias can

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.254
be significant and
it's hard to quantify.

00:17:41.254 --> 00:17:45.920
Now there's something called
stated preference analysis

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.520
or conjoint analysis.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.280
And is where we apply
statistical techniques to try

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.730
to correct for that bias.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:59.240
So this originated in
mathematical psychology.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:05.780
And what we do is that it's
a rigorous, detailed sign

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.017
of the experiment.

00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:09.350
And usually what you do is
that instead of asking people

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:12.350
if they would take
this or not, you say,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.420
would you rather take this
option or this option?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.560
And you put some bundles.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.410
And you ask them to trade
them off multiple times.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.810
You say, well, what if
it cost one more dollar?

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.370
What if-- and you
have multiple levels.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.390
So people start contradicting
themselves sometimes

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.310
in these trade-offs.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.360
And you can detect the biases
using those contradictions,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.100
or at least you can rank
the relative importance

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.200
of different factors
to that person

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.130
and then apply those factors
to correct for the bias.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:48.240
So this is, again,
this area's evolving.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.460
It is being applied already
by high end consulting firms

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.490
and also by researchers.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.945
So if you find research
papers on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:58.945 --> 00:19:00.320
stated preference
surveys, you'll

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.870
find these kinds of
techniques being applied.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:08.180
This is very useful for new
services or new service areas.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.840
Why is that?

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.510
Why would this technique be
especially useful for that?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.260
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.430
AUDIENCE: Because there
is an existing status

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.760
quo that they're implicitly
comparing against.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.150
PROFESSOR: If there isn't
any service to start with,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.670
you're talking about a new
line or a new area of service

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.760
where transit isn't
really present or not

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.640
present to the degree
that you're proposing,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.480
then there's no good way of
looking at the existing amount

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.010
and extrapolate from there.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.980
So then you have to ask people.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.500
And this is a method to
correct for [INAUDIBLE] bias.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.800
One more comment-- the
MTA useless in the 1980s.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.380
And they concluded
that they would

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.200
raise fares to repay
bonds that they

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.110
had taken for capital projects.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.795
So it's been applied
successfully.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.390
The next method or
family of methods

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.600
is cross-sectional models.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.550
So here we develop
a model of demand

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.910
as a function of route
and demographic data

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.530
to explain ridership.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.060
So we're looking at a snapshot
at a single point in time

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.830
or, say, we pick a period
of three months altogether

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.500
and we look at the ridership
over those three months

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.860
across different bus
routes in the region.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.380
And then we observe that
different bus routes have

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.670
different demand and they
have different frequencies

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.550
and they run through sectors
with different population

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.250
densities and different
employment densities.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.710
And we tried to relate
the differences in demand

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.080
on those routes to the ridership
to those characteristics.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.440
This is called a
cross-sectional model.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.630
So again, we explained
the differences in demand

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.420
as a function of the
differences in characteristics.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.320
And there are different
approaches here.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.230
Rules of thumb is the simplest.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:13.120
So we might say if
it's key bus routes,

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.820
then it has this much demand.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.630
That's a very sort of
simple, crude example.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.120
The similar routes
method is I'm going

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.950
to convert this bus route to--

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.345
I'm going to add
frequency to it,

00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:28.150
say, increase its frequency.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.580
And then it's going to look a
lot more like this other bus

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.621
route that I have in
another part of the network.

00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:35.260
So ridership should look
a lot more like that.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:38.170
Maybe I separate my bus
routes in the network

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.460
into high ridership
key bus routes

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.040
that have certain high frequency
and other less frequent bus

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.980
routes that run on less
dense parts of the network.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.750
And I take those
averages and I apply

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.400
them to extrapolate, right?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.540
So that's a similar route.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.010
You find similar routes.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.220
You use those to
make a prediction.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.920
Then there's the multiple
factor trip rate model.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.050
You, again, look at--

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.970
you do a regression, maybe.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.930
You can do this with regression
or by separate factors.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.450
So those are the last
two bullets here.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.590
So you essentially run
regression where you have--

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.420
maybe you load up
a GIS layer and you

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.290
have population density,
employment density, frequency.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.250
And out of the regression
comes these factors

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.192
where you can control
for multiple factors

00:22:30.192 --> 00:22:30.900
at the same time.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:37.676
Any questions on
cross-sectional methods?

00:22:37.676 --> 00:22:38.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.790
AUDIENCE: Because
these models generally

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.500
focus only on endogenous
factors and not

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.060
exogenous, so they
don't physically

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.500
capture the demand, how
the demand is [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.900
with difference
to other factors.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.035
So how can this be generalized
so that second point is

00:22:54.035 --> 00:22:55.610
that similar routes--

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.440
like, it can be generalized.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.480
One that uses less data or
is shallow in its nature

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.069
could not generally
be generalized, right?

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:03.860
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.359
Yes.

00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:08.104
These models are hard to
generalize because they don't--

00:23:08.104 --> 00:23:10.520
actually, any cross-sectional
model is hard to generalize,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.020
right?

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.470
Because you are looking
at a specific time

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.030
window of analysis.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.240
So you are already,
in doing so, excluding

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.600
any longer-term trends
that are often exogenous,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:28.340
like fuel prices and population
changes and things like that.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.610
So yes, by doing a
model, even the most

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.970
sophisticated of these, which
is a multivariate regression

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.870
model, if you have any
factors that you leave out,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.780
that can lead to biases
in the estimators, right?

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.790
So will you actually
see that bias?

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.810
Well, that depends on how
short run of a prediction

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.260
are you trying to do?

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.410
Is your prediction
going to be applied

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.020
to a period in the
short term that

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.430
is very similar
to the period you

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:03.260
have now where these exogenous
factors have been out,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.510
have not changed,
and therefore there

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.360
is no impact on the
bias of this model.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.820
Or are you going to apply this--

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.820
abuse this, let's
say, misapply it--

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:20.630
abuse it to predict
outside of that window,

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.300
outside of that domain,
where you do have changes

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.280
that you did not
include in the model,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.560
and they have
affected ridership?

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.300
Yes.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.710
Any other questions about
cross-sectional methods?

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.076
OK.

00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:39.750
Let's move on.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.060
A little bit about regression.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:47.630
So this is an example of
how an agency might respond

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.710
to increases in demand by
increasing frequency and vise

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.440
versa.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.900
So you look at--

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.170
you start with an observation
that ridership is quite high

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.680
and the frequency is
some amount right now.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.320
And then you react to that.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.390
So as an agency, you might
say, well, this bus route

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.330
is quite crowded,
therefore, let's increase

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.696
the frequency, right?

00:25:11.696 --> 00:25:13.070
And let's increase
the frequency.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.810
That's going to have an
effect on the demand curve.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:26.130
So all of these lines,
d, are demand curves.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:31.920
And this demand curve shows
the response of ridership

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.440
to a change in
frequency, assuming

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.720
everything else stays the same.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.960
But there are also other changes
that are not included here.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.930
So you might increase
frequency but there

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.620
might be other exogenous
factors, exogenous in this case

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.500
because frequency is the only
variable being shown here.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.480
Any other variable
that increases demand

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.420
will not result in a change
along the demand curve.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:56.880
It will actually shift
the demand curve, right?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.830
So you have demand curves
going in a third dimension,

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:06.280
increasing demand in a third
dimension due to other factors.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.450
So typically, again,
agencies are reactive.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.800
They sort of observe an increase
then they move to the next one

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.750
and they're always
thinking about one demand

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.680
curve, if at all.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.850
And so it's better
for this reason

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.840
to look at multiple factors at
the same time instead of just

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.680
one factor, such as frequency.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:35.440
OK, so these are some
typical transit elasticities.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.580
We have elasticities
to fare, to headway,

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.980
and to total travel time here.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.840
And so these are
the typical values

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.154
if you look at many
studies and take averages,

00:26:44.154 --> 00:26:45.070
this is what you find.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:48.070
So elasticity to
fare, negative 0.3.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.360
Let's do a quick recap.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.546
What is elasticity?

00:26:54.621 --> 00:26:55.120
Henry?

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.890
AUDIENCE: Percent
change in demand

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.980
over percent change in price.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:00.650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.520
That's-- so the answer is
percent change in demand over

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.030
percent change in price.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.090
I want to make two adjustments
to that definition.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.620
That's often how
it's calculated.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:15.230
But it's actually the derivative
of the curve, not necessarily

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.420
a percent change.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.340
That is an approximation
of the derivative.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.519
And the other is that
it's not just to price.

00:27:21.519 --> 00:27:23.060
In this case, we're
looking at change

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.110
to fare towards headway or
to other disutilities, so

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.220
any other factor that
affects disutility.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.220
So what is the
difference between--

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.226
what is negative elasticity?

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.874
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

variables are going up,

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.017
your ridership is going down.

PROFESSOR: OK.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.760

the ridership goes down.

Great.

is the difference

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.960

absolute value less than one

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.530
Yeah, inelastic, yes.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.988
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
this is inelastic.

00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:49.574
So what does that
mean in practice?

00:28:49.574 --> 00:28:50.740
AUDIENCE: A change in fare--

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.290
PROFESSOR: So I know that--

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.123
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:52.123 --> 00:28:54.930
AUDIENCE: --would not lead to an
equivalent change in ridership.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:55.513
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:55.513 --> 00:28:58.499
AUDIENCE: It would lead to
less than the equivalent change

00:28:58.499 --> 00:28:59.040
in ridership.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:28:59.623
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:59.623 --> 00:29:07.040
Therefore if you
increase fares, you

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.460
will lose some
ridership, but not enough

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.700
to lose total [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.430
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.300
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.120
If this volume were greater
than-- have an absolute value

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.611
greater than 1, then
you might actually

00:29:19.611 --> 00:29:21.360
decrease-- the response
in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.740
might be so strong that you
might end up loosing revenue

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.940
because the amount
is so much lower.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.980
So if you overprice an item
by a lot and nobody buys it,

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.650
you might end up
getting less, right?

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.090
In transit, typical
[INAUDIBLE] are inelastic.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.740
So this is important.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.090
This means that
any transit agency

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.920
who needs more federal
revenue can probably

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.340
increase fares and know that
they will get more money.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.100
That's sort of one that
keeps conclusions of this.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.380
The range of these values
is from negative 0.1

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.330
to negative 0.5.

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:58.710
The elasticity of headway is
a little larger in magnitude.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.310
So the response of
demand to frequency

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.890
is stronger a little bit
than the response to fares,

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:09.620
and often overlooked
in ridership spikes.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.740
And then total travel time,
people respond very strongly

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.310
to that.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:18.000
So

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.460
OK, then there are these
important other points

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.660
that I want to go through.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.850
Small cities have larger fare
elasticities than large cities.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.520
Let's talk about each one and
suggest the reasons for them.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.888
So why would small cities
have larger elasticities?

00:30:34.888 --> 00:30:36.609
AUDIENCE: The absolute value?

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:37.900
PROFESSOR: Yes, absolute value.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.099
So you're saying that they
are more elastic, right?

00:30:42.099 --> 00:30:43.140
AUDIENCE: More sensitive.

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:43.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah, more sensitive.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.260
So small cities--
ridership in small cities

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:51.000
is more sensitive than
ridership in large cities.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.620
AUDIENCE: There's
not as much of a--

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.217
there's not as much
utility lost by switching

00:30:55.217 --> 00:30:56.050
two different modes.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.440
There might not be as much
traffic if you drive instead.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.640
Some fare might be more of a
reason that people that use it.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.799
And also that parking
might not be as costly

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:07.590
so that if you raise
the fare a little bit,

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.990
you might get more
expensive than parking.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.430
PROFESSOR: OK, so you have
other sort of characteristics

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.800
in large cities that you
don't find in small cities,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.714
such as parking costs.

00:31:15.714 --> 00:31:17.130
AUDIENCE: That
would be a way of--

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:17.550
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.830
PROFESSOR: I'm trying to
summarize it, and also

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.900
repeat for posterity.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.630
AUDIENCE: Also in urban cities,
since these elasticities are

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:29.280
being computed for the
population as a whole,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.824
there are more people dependent
on the mass transit system.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:34.240
PROFESSOR: That
is very important.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.630
This is one of the key factors
affecting this, actually.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.150
So you have a much
larger dependence

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.900
on public transportation
in large cities.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.329
And also-- yeah.

00:31:44.329 --> 00:31:46.245
AUDIENCE: Is it really
the size of the city or

00:31:46.245 --> 00:31:47.700
is it the density of the city--

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.750
PROFESSOR: It's
probably density.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.680
These are correlated.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.900
So maybe this could have
been more carefully chosen.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.435
And you could say
older cities, as well.

00:31:56.435 --> 00:32:01.140
I would argue older pre-auto
industry, pre-highway expansion

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.930
cities as another way
of putting footings.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:06.660
Yes?

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.721
More ideas about this?

00:32:08.721 --> 00:32:09.220
Henry?

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.740
AUDIENCE: I don't know
how you're defining this--

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.573
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:32:12.573 --> 00:32:13.290
Someone first--

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:14.950
PROFESSOR: Henry.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:16.096
OK.

00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:17.812
You decide.

00:32:17.812 --> 00:32:19.270
AUDIENCE: I was
just curious about,

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.920
how do you define small cities?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.930
Because for example, I'm
thinking in my own country,

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:31.385
a small city would be a city of
around 200,000, 100,000 people.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:35.984
And over there, for example,
an increase in the fare

00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:38.150
would have this characteristic
because you can still

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.630
walk [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:42.020
So walking is still an option.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.090
And I think it's kind
of correlated with what

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.310
you were saying about

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.030
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.590
PROFESSOR: So all
of these things

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.170
have to do with
where you apply them.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.760
And maybe they're not
completely generalizable.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.580
But I think this
observation has more

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.750
to do with the North American
and European context.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.730
So but that's a
good observation.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.619
Henry?

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:04.160
AUDIENCE: I think
smaller cities also

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.727
have less extensive coverage.

00:33:06.727 --> 00:33:08.060
PROFESSOR: Yes, so our imports--

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:08.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.590
AUDIENCE: --are already
trained to not rely on--

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.506
PROFESSOR: So the public
transportation supply

00:33:12.506 --> 00:33:16.310
might be quite undesirable
or inefficient.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.215
And so therefore--

00:33:17.215 --> 00:33:18.840
AUDIENCE: And if you
jack up the price,

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.970
that will make it
less desirable.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.761
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:21.559
OK, great.

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:22.850
OK, let's move to the next one.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.460
Bus travel is more
elastic than commuter rail

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.370
rapid rail travel.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.070
AUDIENCE: Simply, bus travel
is smaller traveled distance

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.635
and there are possible
another alternatives.

00:33:38.635 --> 00:33:39.260
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.190
That's the key reason.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.140
So if you have a
shorter distance,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.410
and bus travel tends
to be shorter distance,

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.050
then you are more likely
to have other options,

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:53.000
whereas commuter rail, you
might be able to drive maybe

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.960
your own car, so et cetera.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.570
So there are fewer options
in general to the public

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.800
for a longer distance travel.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.630
And commuter rail
and rapid rail travel

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.396
tends to be longer distance.

00:34:04.396 --> 00:34:06.770
AUDIENCE: Commuter rail, rapid
rail, certainly in Russia,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:10.130
have a time advantage, tend
to have a time advantage

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.227
over the private vehicle.

00:34:11.227 --> 00:34:12.560
PROFESSOR: That's true, as well.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.393
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:13.393 --> 00:34:14.469
This is another reason--

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:15.400
AUDIENCE: The bus never has--

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:16.233
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:16.233 --> 00:34:18.949
PROFESSOR: --competitiveness
of the mode in rush hour

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:22.159
where buses might be
stuck in traffic and rail

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.639
is not stuck in traffic, right?

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.840
So that drives the
elasticity more

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.620
because so many more people
are traveling in rush hours.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.310
Great.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.040
Let's move on to the third
one, off peak fare elasticities

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.800
are double the size of
peak fare elasticities.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.520
Lee.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.145
AUDIENCE: The difference between
leisure and business travelers

00:34:40.145 --> 00:34:42.125
where you can change
your trip decision

00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:44.570
if it's a leisure trip, but
not if you're going to work.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:45.949
PROFESSOR: Trip purpose, right?

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:53.449
So peak travel tends to have a
higher proportion of business

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:56.120
and you don't have the
option of not doing the trip.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.230
So you must do the trip.

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.360
What else?

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.920
Something related to that.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.420
Yes?

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.610
AUDIENCE: Again,
congestion has a role.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:10.580
To consider the idea of
commuting by Uber in New York

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.894
City, it might not make sense
to do that during a peak period

00:35:14.894 --> 00:35:17.060
if you're going to be sitting
in traffic on the road

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.720
and the subway has,
then, a time advantage.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:26.300
But returning home late in the
evening, that time advantage

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.910
of transit could be
eroded because there's

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:29.930
less congestion.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.320
PROFESSOR: Right, so congestion
can have a major effect.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.000
And congestion is
larger at peak.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.910
And therefore, it
could make modes

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.300
that are segregated have
their own right of way more--

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.400
so related to the previous one.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.220
What else?

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:46.721
Eli.

00:35:46.721 --> 00:35:49.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I think
it was discretionary ridership

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.730
during--

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.260
PROFESSOR: Very important, yeah.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.610
So can you elaborate?

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.050
During the off peak
hours, you have

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.000
more people who
have no other choice

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.690
to get around, use transit.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.080
PROFESSOR: And why not?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.084
Why might these people
not have other choices?

00:36:05.084 --> 00:36:06.750
AUDIENCE: Because
they are lower income.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.041
PROFESSOR: Lower income, right.

00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:13.400
So lower income people who
work may have no other options.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.950
This may be the only
option they can afford.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.280
And therefore, they
are less sensitive.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.460
So if you raise fares, well,
it doesn't look good for them.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.210
But that's the only
alternative for them.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.350
So they'll react.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.290
Great.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.850
Short distance trips are more
elastic than long distance

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:33.410
trips.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.368
We already covered that
in the context of rail,

00:36:35.368 --> 00:36:36.610
so let's skip that.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.590
Fare elasticities
rise with income.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.772
This should be straightforward.

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:48.730
AUDIENCE: More options
if you have more income.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.110
PROFESSOR: If you have more
income, you have more options.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.890
You can afford all
the other options.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:52.840
So there you go.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.310
And what about fare
elasticities fall with age?

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:59.550
So older people,
senior people are less

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.130
sensitive to changes in fair.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.270
Why is that?

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.770
Emily?

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.110
AUDIENCE: Higher
income [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.705
They tend to have fewer options.

00:37:08.705 --> 00:37:09.330
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:13.220
AUDIENCE: Because, well,
walking might not be an option.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.780
PROFESSOR: So the active
modes might be less desirable?

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.244
AUDIENCE: They might not have
a driver's license anymore.

00:37:19.244 --> 00:37:21.410
PROFESSOR: They may not
be-- have a driver's license

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.140
anymore.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.910
AUDIENCE: They might
have failing vision

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.827
and therefore not be able
to drive or have other--

00:37:27.827 --> 00:37:29.160
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.130
OK.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.330
Of all trip purposes, the work
trip is the most inelastic.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.910
We've covered that.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.110
And then promotional
fare elasticities

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.420
are slightly larger
than short term fare

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.111
elasticities following
permanent fare additions.

00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:43.610
So--

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.110
AUDIENCE: Can you explain that?

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:46.030
What does promotion--

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:50.380
PROFESSOR: So if you
do a free fare day

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.840
and you put ads everywhere
or something like this.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.670
The response that
you will get is

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:02.170
going to be much stronger than
if you are on a routine basis

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.440
raise fares and--

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.895
yeah.

00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:10.295
So why does that happen?

00:38:10.295 --> 00:38:13.160
AUDIENCE: Maybe the increase
in demand due to the lower--

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.480
PROFESSOR: Increase if you
reduce them or decrease

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.460
if you increase them, right?

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.100
AUDIENCE: If you
increase fares, they--

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.396
Better promotional if you
have lower fare, right?

00:38:23.396 --> 00:38:24.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:29.720
But we can extend this to how
frequently this change happens

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:36.090
and how much buzz is there
about the spare change.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.080
Yes?

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.292
AUDIENCE: People feel like,
oh, it's happening once.

00:38:39.292 --> 00:38:40.750
I've got to do it
now, or I won't--

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the
psychological effects

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:46.150
of marketing, the
effectiveness of marketing on--

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:50.640
so if you look at agencies that
every year at a certain dates

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.090
raise their fares more
or less with inflation,

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:58.290
there's much less sort of the
reaction-- the public reaction

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.760
is much lower.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.840
So--

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.620
AUDIENCE: Are those
promotional fare--

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.600
free fare day, free fair
weekend, are they effective?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.880
Does anyone--

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.690
PROFESSOR: That's what
your goal is, right?

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.815
AUDIENCE: No, the goal is--

00:39:13.815 --> 00:39:14.957
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:14.957 --> 00:39:17.040
PROFESSOR: But it might
be effective at increasing

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.910
ridership temporarily if you
have some event on the city

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:21.990
and you want to--

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.140
if you want people to use
those modes instead of drive,

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.390
that might be a success.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.550
So you want to increase
the efficiency of vehicles

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.860
by decreasing load
times so people

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.500
don't have to interact
with a fare box,

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.458
you can open all doors.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:39.120
People go in and out.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120
That might be a success.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.620
So--

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.690
AUDIENCE: Paris once
did that for exposure,

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.910
to try to lure people in
because they already--

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.440
yeah.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.030
But the question
is, is it effective?

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.780
PROFESSOR: Well, again,
it depends on what

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.868
your measures of success are.

00:39:50.868 --> 00:39:52.740
Emily?

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.700
AUDIENCE: Also,
promotional fares

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.642
might attract more discretionary
trips than people--

00:40:00.642 --> 00:40:03.100
PROFESSOR: People might say,
oh, I want to try this, right?

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:03.725
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:03.725 --> 00:40:08.430
Whereas permanent
fare revisions tend

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.460
to effect people who are
just doing their commute.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.570
PROFESSOR: And therefore--

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.562
AUDIENCE: Who are
therefore less--

00:40:14.562 --> 00:40:15.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.070
So if you do any
kind of promotion,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.820
you might make people that tend
not to even be aware of transit

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.390
fares be aware of this option.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.050
And so you might lure them in.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.960
Yeah, Henry?

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.626
AUDIENCE: There are
also a lot of cities

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.780
that do free transit
on New Years Eve

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.725
to reduce drunk driving--

00:40:33.725 --> 00:40:34.350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.560
So that's another example.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.540
So on New Year's Eve,
to reduce drunk driving,

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.620
offer free fares.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.170
Yes?

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.711
AUDIENCE: So it's safe to say
that promotional fares are only

00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:44.530
useful for short-term
effects but they

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.530
don't have any effect on
long-term [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.380
PROFESSOR: I don't want
to make that broad claim,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.410
but I think I agree
with the premise of it.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.710
OK.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.990
OK, let's revisit a model that
we saw on an earlier lecture.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:17.050
This is the TTC elasticity
model, which we saw is used

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:22.670
or has been used to predict
the rider changes to service

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.490
changes, so ridership
response to service changes.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.240
So this is the-- let's recount.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.900
The total weighted
travel time is

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.290
a sum of four components--
the in-vehicle travel

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:40.070
time, the waiting time,
the walking time, which

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.440
is the access and egress
and transfer time,

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.080
and a penalty for the number
of transfers that you have

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.216
to take for that [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:47.216 --> 00:41:48.590
And then there
are these weights.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:55.445
1.5, so what does that
mean, 1.5 in this equation?

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:01.060
I'll generalize this
utility equation,

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.830
a systematic
disutility equation.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.350
It has some factors before each
of the explanatory variables.

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:07.031
Sonia?

00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:08.280
AUDIENCE: People hate waiting.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.910
So it is extra--

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.120
PROFESSOR: How much more
do they hate waiting?

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.651
AUDIENCE: They hate
waiting 1.5 times as much

00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:17.150
as they hate being
in their vehicle.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.800
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.380
Exactly.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:24.340
So now these numbers
are nice and round.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.730
So TTC did not conduct a
revealed preference study

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.280
to estimate it from data.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.930
But they align somewhat well
with revealed preference

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.620
studies.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.620
So the order of magnitude,
at least, is correct.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.550
I've seen factors as
high as 3 for waiting

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:47.980
time, as low as one, in cases
of rush hour and, say, metro.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.570
So that gives you a range.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.330
Walking, I've seen 5, 10.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.402
I've seen higher.

00:42:53.402 --> 00:42:56.440
But penalties for
number of transfers,

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.120
I've seen five
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.219
So people hate transferring.

00:43:01.219 --> 00:43:02.260
This is the street bound.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:08.860
So this is 10 minutes for every
transfer you have to make.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.270
Great, so what happens?

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.996
You compute the total weighted
travel time before and after.

00:43:13.996 --> 00:43:15.370
So you have the
current situation

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.010
and then you have a proposal
that will alter these values

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.100
and result in a new total
weighted travel time.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.510
And then we apply
some elasticities.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.320
So these elasticities
defer by period.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.470
So during the peak,
we have negative 1.5.

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.460
Mid-day, we have
a higher response.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.460
This aligns with
what we just said.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.830
Peak period ridership
tends to be more inelastic.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.490
So we have a stronger response
during the middle of the day.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.370
And if you look at early
in the morning or evening,

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.250
even stronger.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.300
So you have higher values.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.358
Question, why are
these values have

00:43:53.358 --> 00:43:56.230
a [INAUDIBLE] greater than one?

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.140
This is a trick
question, in some sense.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:04.880
AUDIENCE: Travel time is--

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.590
ridership is dependent
on travel time.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.737
It's very elastic.

00:44:08.737 --> 00:44:09.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.179
So that's one way of putting it.

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:13.220
So I guess the observation
is like, these are now

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.470
fair elasticities.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.570
And they are not
frequency elasticities.

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.680
They are elasticities of
total weighted travel time.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.660
And these are four
components coming together

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.440
and we can't really
think about it

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.970
in terms of fare elasticity
and single variable, really.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.550
These are multiple
effects coming together.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.530
So great.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.350
So do we understand
how this applies?

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.150
We have a service proposal.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.452
We estimate the
effects on riderships

00:44:45.452 --> 00:44:47.660
in [INAUDIBLE] waiting time,
walking time, and number

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.220
of transfers.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:53.219
We know how many people would
ride before and after, or we--

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:54.260
well, we don't know that.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.660
We want to predict
that, but we know

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:59.180
for each [INAUDIBLE] how
each of these components

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:01.170
would be affected.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:03.650
And then we use the
[INAUDIBLE] elasticities

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.240
to predict the change.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.870
OK?

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:08.370
Questions?

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:08.953
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:08.953 --> 00:45:10.680
Is the 10 in front
of in trans, does

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.560
that mean the average
transfer is 10 minutes,

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.820
or does this mean people
just really, really

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.070
don't like transfers because
they want a simple route?

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.630
PROFESSOR: So this
excludes waiting time.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:25.590
This is the fact that I have to
transfer is so annoying that I

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:26.700
would rather spend--

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.070
or it would be the same as
spending extra 10 minutes

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.540
in a vehicle.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.550
If you would give me a situation
where I have a single ride

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.210
option that takes
10 minutes longer

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.220
and you gave me another one
that takes 10 minutes less

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.770
but I have to
transfer, I wouldn't

00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.970
know which one to take.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:51.381
They would be equally
desirable or undesirable.

00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:51.880
Yeah.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.546
AUDIENCE: Would you
say that in a more--

00:45:53.546 --> 00:45:55.350
if this was a more
distinct model,

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.599
then the penalty for
transferring rail to rail would

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:00.390
be less than the penalty
for transferring--

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.515
PROFESSOR: Yeah, of course.

00:46:01.515 --> 00:46:03.990
You could make this
much more sophisticated.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:09.480
And you could say, are
there escalators or not?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.420
You know, you could argue,
are some parts of the city,

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.470
say, less safe, and
therefore walking time

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:23.030
is very undesirable,
especially at night?

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:27.120
So you could really go
disaggregate and apply

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.310
all these behavioral impacts.

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:31.470
So yeah, you can make
this more sophisticated.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.290
But you have the idea, right?

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.590
This is an
elasticity-based model.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.050
OK.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.122
Direct demand regression
models, again, we

00:46:41.122 --> 00:46:42.330
covered a little bit of this.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.910
We match census tract data to
route service characteristics.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.650
This is hard without GIS tools.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.030
GIS is a geographical
information system

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:52.500
where you have a
map and you load

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.470
layers of data showing
things geographically

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.740
like population density
and a point of density.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.470
Your bus stops, your bus
lines, your train lines.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.160
So we use GIS tools to apportion
population and employment

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.050
data to different bus routes.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.780
So you know that the bus route
goes along these centers that

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.240
have certain properties.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:16.260
Then we run a
regression of trying

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.880
to explain ridership
as a function

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.410
of those characteristics.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.940
And often what
happens is that you

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.600
have large or high
significance of dummy variables

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.600
and track-specific constants.

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:34.620
So the general variables
like frequency,

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.140
the variables that apply to
all the bus routes together,

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.940
tend to be maybe not as
significant statistically

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:45.210
as these very specific
variables that apply only

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.034
to one or two bus routes.

00:47:47.034 --> 00:47:48.450
And that means
that in some sense,

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:51.600
we are specifying a
model that is over fitted

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.820
and there are some
issues with this.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.720
So the other issue is
that these models tend

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.420
not to recognize
network interactions,

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.500
or they never do, rather,
because if you have two bus

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.940
lines running through the
same employment center

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:11.610
and going to two
different places,

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.815
both at the same
frequency, then presumably

00:48:14.815 --> 00:48:17.190
they should share the demand
from that employment center,

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:18.060
right?

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.880
If you only had one
bus route and you

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.100
leave the
characteristics the same,

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.706
then that ridership
would be a lot higher.

00:48:26.706 --> 00:48:28.080
This model doesn't
really account

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.100
for that, the complementarity
or competition

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.570
of the supply in the network.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.490
So that's an issue.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:38.860
And then the relationship
between supply and demand

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.760
is not--

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760
the interaction is not captured.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.470
So we can-- there are
alternative approaches.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:51.480
Simultaneous equation models
are capable of addressing

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.260
the relationship between
supply and demand.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.590
And then some other
models are able to capture

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:01.830
the relationship between
competing and complementary

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:02.330
routes.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.410
And we'll look at an example.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:07.220
That's the logical next step
beyond direct demand models.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.840
And then the full network
models which sort of

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.090
have-- you have the GIS.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.690
You have all the network.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:16.350
Those deal explicitly with
competing complementary routes

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:20.130
because people in that mall
have the option of any bus route

00:49:20.130 --> 00:49:23.780
and they see all their options.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.740
And in these models
you can include

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.850
[INAUDIBLE] distribution
of model split effect.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.660
So that's the next step beyond--

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.840
the logical next step
beyond the TTC-type model--

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.210
the elasticity model
that we just discussed.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:40.110
Both of these require GIS--

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.480
some computer representation
of the transit network

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.530
and the service area.

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:45.220
This used to be a challenge.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.700
Not so much anymore.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.236
Most agencies put out
TTFS data and write layers

00:49:52.236 --> 00:49:53.610
showing where
their bus stops are

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.050
and so this is now commonplace.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:50:00.120
This is not an obstacle anymore.

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:01.000
Questions about this?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.499
Henry?

00:50:01.499 --> 00:50:02.824
AUDIENCE: What is TTC?

00:50:02.824 --> 00:50:04.740
PROFESSOR: Oh, the Toronto
Transit Commission.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:08.280
It's the bus agency
in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.780
Other questions?

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:15.430
OK, so let's look at a
simultaneous equation model.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:23.580
So here we have ridership of
some route, I, on some segment,

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.590
Z. So we divide up bus
routes into segments.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.350
And we have many bus
routes and many segments.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:35.230
And we say that is a function of
the level of service provided.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:39.310
So think of that as
frequency, the level

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.690
of service provided on that
bus route on that zone,

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.400
and other external factors.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.720
Those external factors
are demographics,

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.780
socioeconomic
characteristics of ridership,

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:55.640
the population density, things
like that, so maybe exogenous.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.730
Then you say supply,
on the other hand,

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:04.980
so my level of service, is a
function of the ridership I

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.650
have right now because
if I have more riders,

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:09.870
I will provide more service.

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:12.320
Also, it is a
reaction to ridership

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.260
as it was in the past.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.670
And it's also a reaction
to other external factors.

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:24.750
So these two equations
are simultaneous.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.420
You have to solve
them at the same time.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.670
And they could take
different functional forms.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:34.240
We are specifying here at
a sort of conceptual level.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, is that in the
second version, is it a typo

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.450
or do we actually consider
the overall ridership

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:44.280
in the previous time period?

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.960
PROFESSOR: It
could be a function

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.510
of the ridership in the past.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:51.245
In other words, this is a way
of saying, my supply right now,

00:51:51.245 --> 00:51:54.100
my supply today, is a function
of what ridership used to be.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:56.842
AUDIENCE: No, what I mean
is, should that be segment

00:51:56.842 --> 00:51:59.550
dependent or do we then scale it
up to the entire [INAUDIBLE]----

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:04.690
PROFESSOR: Oh, it could be
segment dependent or not.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:07.560
So you're saying why not have z?

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.910
You could.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.010
If you want to add
it in, go ahead.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:12.190
Again, this is conceptual.

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:16.410
So what I'm saying is this
is not a specific model.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.600
Rather, this is a
conceptual description

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.030
of how you set up a
simultaneous equation model.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.220
So the point of that
variable is to say

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:27.750
that you could include
the effects of previously

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.540
observed ridership.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.420
So don't think about this as
a specification of a model.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.232
I'll put this on Cellar.

00:52:38.232 --> 00:52:40.190
This is the paper that
describes this in detail

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.950
if you want to look at the
specifics of such a model.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:48.840
Here's an example from
Portland Tri-Met on that paper.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:54.480
You have route 19 and route 20
which were on, in this diagram,

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.580
kind of east-west.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:01.650
So route 19 runs along
this line right here.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.160
And for each bus route we
have a [INAUDIBLE] area.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:09.630
So route 19 captures
this part on top and also

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.640
this middle part that
is shaded both ways.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.060
Another is route 20, which
runs along this line.

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.780
And it captures people here
and also people in this area.

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.670
So this area in the middle is--

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.240
people from that area go
to route 19 or route 20.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.360
So in that area, route
19 and 20 are competing.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:37.720
Then they kind of merge
and go through zone 0

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:38.970
and they are fully competing.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:42.264
They are-- maybe it's a
branch and trunk system.

00:53:42.264 --> 00:53:44.430
And then there are these
other bus routes, route 70,

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:49.350
route 75, 21, and 22, that
are across South-North,

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.420
North-South, that corridor.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.120
And we say that
these bus routes are

00:53:54.120 --> 00:54:02.010
complementary because
people might transfer,

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.680
people going from
somewhere on the south

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.170
might transfer to one of
these route 19 or route 20.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:09.810
So the fact that route
70 or 75 is there,

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.940
it means that people
get-- more than not

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.130
will be attracted
to the corridor.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:18.570
So then we quantify the degree
to which bus routes compete

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:23.070
with this overlapping
population fraction

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.540
percentage or proportion.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:31.890
So this is the percentage of
the fraction of population

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:34.740
that is on the
overlapping portion.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:36.450
So we look at route
length in route 20.

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:40.830
We're saying how much relation
is on this overlapping

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:44.980
area divided by the sum of the
population captured by route 19

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:49.200
and the sum of population
captured by route 20?

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:54.990
So that gives you an idea
of the degree of overlap.

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.230
We also measure population
in each catchment area

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:00.930
for each bus route.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.960
And we can then capture
inter-route effects.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.780
So we do that by modifying
the equation two slides ago

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.630
and adding this
third question here.

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:14.370
So before we have ridership as
a function of level of service

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.790
and external factors.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:26.720
Now we're adding the ridership
on competing bus routes.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:31.580
So these are bus routes that are
competing on the same segment.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:35.090
And they run with
overlapping population.

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:37.430
So to the extent
that this increases,

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.460
the ridership on
Route I decreases.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.070
And then we also
consider the ridership

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:47.090
on complementary routes
across this catchment area.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.430
And to the extent
that this increases,

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.310
the ridership on
route I increases.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:56.950
We also consider the degree
of population overlap

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:58.207
and the external factors.

00:55:58.207 --> 00:55:59.290
Again, this is conceptual.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.760
If you want to look
at the specifics,

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.218
I suggest you look
at the readings.

00:56:02.218 --> 00:56:03.280
I will post the paper.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:11.980
So this is a way of modeling
the effects of complementarity

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.510
and competition.

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:20.480
OK, a different
approach, moving down

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.600
the list of sophistication
of modeling approaches

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.210
is the network-based
modeling analysis approach.

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:30.920
So here we have a transit origin
destination matrix as an input.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.980
We measure how people are
using the system right now.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:39.260
We have layer like a DTFS layer
with the base transit network.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:41.304
And we put that into a model.

00:56:41.304 --> 00:56:43.720
And then we tell that model,
we're going to make a change.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.736
We're going to add
a bus line or we're

00:56:44.736 --> 00:56:46.236
going to increase
frequency or we're

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.290
going to increase
fares, whatever it is.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.770
And that model will look at
the current transit demand

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.070
and predict changes.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:53.570
OK?

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:55.580
So that's the general idea.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.220
It'll also output not
just ridership and revenue

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:00.770
but things like
rider attributes.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.960
You might have information about
income and things in GIS layers

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.650
that can be allocated
to different services.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:15.620
And there are three levels
of analysis for how to use--

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.260
three levels of detail
on the OD matrix.

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.120
The first one is
fixed transit flows.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.000
So again, in order
of sophistication,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.690
starting with the least
sophisticated, fixed transit

00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:26.190
flow.

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:31.520
So we look at the current
transit relief flow.

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.875
This could be from
a telephone survey

00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:35.000
or from any kind of survey.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.880
Or we have, now,
modern techniques

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.560
based on AFC and
inference models

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.790
that we will discuss shortly
in the next few lectures.

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:48.600
So we have the OE matrix,
current OE matrix for transit.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.480
And we assume that
the demand for transit

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.730
won't change as a
result of the service

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.480
changes in the short run.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.800
So that could be a
strong assumption.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.330
That's typically what we do.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.160
That's typically how
these models work.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.960
Again, we're more
interested in the impacts

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:11.630
on sort of current riders
than on big changes.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.470
The next approach is to say
the total demand is fixed

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:17.670
if I look at the demand
across all modes,

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:22.320
including car and bike and
TNCs and all these things.

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.240
So that you have to get from
surveys, the kinds of surveys

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.830
that are used to input data
into a four-step model.

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.880
But then you allow the
model split to change.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:36.290
So as a result of
service changes,

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.300
people might switch
between modes.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.760
They might go from transit to
car or from car to transit.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.730
So that's preferable, especially
if you have significant service

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:48.350
changes.

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.720
But it's not often put in place.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.290
And then there's the
variable total [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:59.720
Now you require all
the steps of modeling,

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.940
the four-step modeling.

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:08.060
And you are essentially
allowing the total demand

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.880
to increase or decrease as
a result of service changes

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.470
or fare changes.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.960
Typically no one does this.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.361
And one could argue
this is unnecessary.

00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:18.860
Why?

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.470
Because we are looking
at short-run changes.

00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:25.580
And total demand
shouldn't change

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:31.220
in a very short horizon
as a result of at least

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:33.330
the typical service changes.

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:37.040
So this kind of
model is great if you

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.430
want to capture the influence
of land use patterns

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:43.710
on long term
demand, for example.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.640
If, however, you were to
bring in a new rail line that

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.590
connects two employment centers,
that's a change in land use.

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:52.970
If you somehow think
that some change

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:55.550
that you will do in your
city, on your transit network,

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:58.250
will bring in a
change in population

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.460
or a change in where
people live significantly,

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.930
then you have to do this.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:05.750
That's the only case where
this would be useful.

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:09.530
Otherwise, you probably are
thinking in the short run

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:11.330
total the amount is the same.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:14.970
People might switch
between modes.

01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:17.860
So you will get step two.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.400
And if it's a very
small change, you

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.830
could even get away
with step one, where

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:26.120
you look at current demand
and people might change

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.480
when they make the trip or
what bus route or rail line

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.690
they choose, but not necessarily
the level of ridership.

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.810
OK, there's different modeling
and analysis packages.

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:40.840
Let's show three of them.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.430
MADITUC, EMME/2, and TrainsCAD.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.410
Have anybody heard
of any of these?

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:50.700
Raise your hand.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.180
OK, about half of you.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:52.700
Great.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.670
So let's start with MADITUC.

01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:59.470
It was developed in Montreal.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:01.850
It was a common
technique in Montreal.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:05.270
It requires only survey data
that includes route choice

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.270
information.

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:12.410
So this is a line level
model, essentially.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.140
It's designed for
transit service planning

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.000
and it uses all or
nothing assignments.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.240
So it looks at, for
a given [INAUDIBLE],,

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.580
which is the best
path on the network.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.340
And then it puts all of the
people on the [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.470
into that one path.

01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.050
So everybody makes the same
decision kind of thing.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:33.860
And it doesn't have built-in
data analysis or a graphics

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.610
capability.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:38.780
So you take the output of it
and you put it somewhere else.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:42.740
These people were using
SAS and other software

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:46.220
to generate graphics
and to generate plots

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:48.050
and calculated statistics.

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.900
It's been used in four
of the Canadian cities--

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.510
Montreal, Quebec,
Toronto, and Winnipeg.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:57.200
And here's an output from
of that data, plotted

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.640
with a different software.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:08.360
So this is-- you can sort of
see the business plot of OD.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.440
I'm not sure,
actually, how it's--

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.870
if it's destinations for a
given origin or what it is.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:18.660
It might just be--

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.550
oh, this is number of entries.

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:22.117
Yeah.

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:22.950
I don't know French.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:24.420
But if anybody--

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.429
AUDIENCE: It's number
of entries by foot or--

01:02:28.429 --> 01:02:29.220
PROFESSOR: On foot.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:29.970
AUDIENCE: On foot?

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:31.545
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:31.545 --> 01:02:32.580
What is that?

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.100
I don't know that last word.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:40.340
PROFESSOR: Anyway.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:45.370
And then it says AMP 629, right?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.850
OK, great.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:48.450
EMME/2.

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.750
So this is multi-modal
equilibrium.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.210
It was also developed
in Montreal.

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:55.890
It's a little more
sophisticated.

01:02:55.890 --> 01:02:58.265
It was developed with the
general regional transportation

01:02:58.265 --> 01:02:59.430
modeling package.

01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:01.950
It can generate transit OD
flows from a travel demand

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:08.280
model, which the other package
needed that as an input.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.780
It has a link node oriented
approach instead of a line

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.620
level approach.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.360
So you can have bus
stops and you can--

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.240
it has more detail, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.520
There are two options
for a transit assignment.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.750
There's aggregate zone to zone,
flow, multi-path assignment.

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:28.620
So that's usually
not precise enough

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:29.910
because it's zone to zone.

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:33.150
And then there's a disaggregate
point-to-point trip assignment

01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.700
procedure, which you
could know which bus stops

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.160
and lines and everything.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.350
It is probabilistic
or multi-path.

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:47.160
So now you have an OD pair and
different alternatives of how

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:51.540
to get from both O to D.
And one may be preferable,

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.870
but people might be split
on which lines they take.

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:58.469
And more, maybe 2/3
of people go one way,

01:03:58.469 --> 01:03:59.510
and a third go the other.

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:02.070
And some equilibrium
is reached this way.

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.360
It's a standalone package.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:06.670
This has all the
graphics built in.

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:07.680
And here's a picture.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.310
So yeah.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:15.980
The TransCAD, this
is much more local.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.530
It's over caliber
develops in Newton.

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:28.730
It has good tools to
edit transit networks.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.890
It has an API that allows
you to add your own models.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:36.200
So if you have your own model
split model, you can put it in.

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.430
It has good interactive
computer graphics,

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:42.320
database, built-in database.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.720
It has a network
assignment procedure,

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.300
lots of display options
and output formats

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.430
and very general purpose.

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:53.730
So typically, you use a transit
network database for this.

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:57.350
So that means geocoded
transit links and nodes.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:04:58.940
You have mappings
of transit lines

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.470
onto network links and nodes.

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:05.390
So you have essentially
a street network, right?

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:08.240
And you say, this
bus route goes from--

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.230
along these road links,
crossing these intersections.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.750
And transit lines are
modeled with some attributes.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.330
So headway is by service period.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.970
Travel times, models,
mode of service or bus,

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:22.010
subway, et cetera.

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:23.480
And there's also
system attributes,

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.660
like operating cost data, energy
consumption data, and fares.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.670
Some of this is--

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.390
well, these things are put in.

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:31.920
And they then are used
to compute outputs.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.340
So hybrid outputs.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:41.940
So you get ridership by link
and by line, boardings by node,

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.230
by line, by link.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:45.450
You can have OD travel
times, so in-vehicle

01:05:45.450 --> 01:05:49.320
time and also including the
access and egress portions,

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.480
transfers, et cetera.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.850
Revenue predictions,
operating cost predictions,

01:05:53.850 --> 01:06:01.110
energy consumption predictions,
even CO2 emission predictions,

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:03.810
revenues, operating
costs, characteristics.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:06.330
And you have all sorts of ways
of displaying that-- tables,

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.410
reports, plots, et cetera.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:13.800
So how about transit
route assignment?

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.830
How do we go about that?

01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:18.390
So transit route
assignment is the process

01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:22.380
by which we assign
origin-destination flows

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.570
to specific paths on
the transit network.

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:28.109
So there are two
ways of doing that.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.650
There's an all or
nothing assignment,

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:31.080
which we talked about.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.940
That's the example of MADITUC.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.760
And then there's the
multipath assignment, which

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.930
we gave an example for EMME/2.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:43.690
When would all or
nothing be OK to apply?

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:46.950
If you have not two dense of
a network and not too many

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:47.960
alternatives, right?

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.640
Then some networks,
there's only one sort

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.590
of feasible, logical
path that one

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:55.630
would take for a given OD pair.

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:58.650
But if you look at a dense
network, say, London,

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:01.630
there are often for an OD
pair multiple good ways

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:04.020
of traveling that OD fare.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.060
And therefore, that
would not be a good model

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:10.980
to use because the flows on
each link might be way off.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.470
Is that understood,
difference between multipath

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:14.700
and all or nothing?

01:07:17.382 --> 01:07:18.280
OK.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.670
Another way of dividing
these or categorizing these

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.210
is aggregate and disaggregate.

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:27.070
So we also looked at these
in the context of EMME/2.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:31.660
So aggregate is zone to zone
based on zone centroids.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.200
So you have [INAUDIBLE] of
transportation and ultra zones

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.640
or census tracts.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.040
And you look at demand
at that block level.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.090
Or you have disaggregate.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.700
So if you load a
DTFS layer, you have

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.880
sort of stop level, line
level, much more precise,

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.200
high resolution output
on where the demand would

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.510
be assigned to, OK?

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.650
And how do we go
about more choice

01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:00.190
and sometimes how
do you go about even

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:03.940
assignment to specific lines
or options within the transit

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.260
mode?

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.940
Often with logit
mode choice model.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:10.740
So I think most--
well, some of you--

01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:14.440
anyone who took 201 or is
taking 202 has seeen this?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:17.329
Raise your hands if you've
seen what a logit mode choice

01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:19.620
model, if you're familiar
with discreet choice modeling

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.760
at all, have heard about it?

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.040
OK.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.270
So it was something what--

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:29.149
I could see some shy hands that
I know are more exposed to it.

01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:32.390
So in this kind of model, the--

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:35.830
when you specify systematic
utility equations

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.140
where we say for each
of the alternatives

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.819
that this person has,
there are some variables.

01:08:40.819 --> 01:08:47.260
These variables include travel
time, cost, reliability, fare,

01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.160
anything, right?

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.560
And the differences
between the alternatives

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.779
are explained in terms
of those variables.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:58.635
And then what we get out
of-- so we run a regression.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.760
It's not linear regression.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.260
It's a different
kind of regression.

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.310
And what we get out of
that is the probability--

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.720
so we get some system--

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.569
we get some parameter
estimates, beta.

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:15.319
And we can use those to
calculate the probability

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.410
that an individual will
take some of the options

01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:21.830
that we listed rather than
the others that were listed.

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.439
So there's a very good
course taught here

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:27.020
at MIT, 1202, demand modeling.

01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.590
If you're interested in this
topic, I recommend you take it.

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.649
And it's taught in
the spring only.

01:09:33.649 --> 01:09:37.100
So yeah, so this is obviously
[INAUDIBLE] probability

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.109
that [INAUDIBLE]
you would choose

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:40.819
one mode and not the other.

01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:43.640
Often, this is
the structure that

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.724
is underneath the
TransCAD mode choice

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:47.890
model or anything like that.

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.760
And it's great if you
understand how it works.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.520
And if you can build
your own and put it

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.910
in there, even better.

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:56.800
So all right.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.900
And what are typical
variables included

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.200
in these systematic utility
equations for, say, the work

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:02.790
trip?

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:06.350
Well, it would be travel time,
out of pocket travel costs,

01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:10.390
vehicle travel time, income,
gender, auto availability,

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:11.700
and occupation.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.550
So some of these are
traveler characteristics

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.940
which vary by person surveyed.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.470
So typically, you will survey
and you collect information

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:23.380
on income, gender, things
that vary by person.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.700
And then you also collect
or put in characteristics

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.990
of the choices or the
options other person has.

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:33.040
And both of these
go into the model,

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.230
both the decision
maker characteristics

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:37.720
and the options characteristics.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.110
And sometimes we defer those
two by calling one attribute

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:44.100
and the other characteristic.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:48.830
OK, that's it for
ridership prediction.

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.830
But if you have
questions, let's discuss.

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:57.350
Yes?

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:02.680
AUDIENCE: What level of modeling
is the T doing for their--

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.910
and do they change their bus
network to match their modeling

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:08.890
or is it sort of a longer-term--

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.170
PROFESSOR: The T has a
model called [INAUDIBLE],,

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:22.280
which is an elasticity-based
model with market segmentation.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.080
So we talked about--

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.630
that was mentioned
earlier in the lecture.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:34.200
So they split population
by type of fare product.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.560
So people with passes might--

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.110
that's a proxy for, say,
frequent riders and those

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.040
who might have--

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.230
those people might have
different elasticities

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.240
than people that
are less frequent

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.460
or people that pay
cash or people, right?

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:49.490
So you split people into--
you segment the market,

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.410
then you look at--

01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:53.810
it looks at previous
fare increases

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.120
and it calculates
the elasticities

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.900
for each of those
market segments

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.320
across several time
periods and everything.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.740
So then it calculates the total
change in ridership and revenue

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.430
and also any changes across
would somebody now take,

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.080
let's say, would some
people switch to paths

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.750
or not switch to paths.

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.050
The Transit Hub has done
some research on it.

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:22.810
And some of the people who--

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:28.510
one of the persons who worked
on their research here at MIT

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.090
now works at CTPS.

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:34.060
And he's one of the people
who applied the model.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.870
And then I think
for other products,

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:42.790
it depends on the product.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:47.290
So certainly, there is kind
of the regional long term

01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:52.510
planning, which is more
four-step modeling approach.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:55.870
If there is any
specific project,

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:59.102
I haven't seen what they've done
for the green line expansion.

01:12:59.102 --> 01:12:59.810
Ari, do you know?

01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:02.420
You always know something.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.230
AUDIENCE: I mean, I--
it's the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:08.776
PROFESSOR: So that's the
professional judgment?

01:13:08.776 --> 01:13:11.150
AUDIENCE: That is a completely
non-professional judgment.

01:13:11.150 --> 01:13:12.914
I don't--

01:13:12.914 --> 01:13:14.830
PROFESSOR: Does anybody
know what they've done

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:16.420
for the green line extension?

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.587
AUDIENCE: I mean, I'm sure
they had to do something.

01:13:18.587 --> 01:13:20.336
PROFESSOR: Often these
capital [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:20.336 --> 01:13:21.670
require demand analysis.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:24.220
So I'm sure they
did some modeling.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:28.030
I'm not sure to what degree.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.659
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:29.659 --> 01:13:30.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:38.260
So whether the modeling
of the FTA requires

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.800
is the best one is
subject to discussion.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.340
And I think a lot of
transportation experts

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:48.240
have issues with it.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.370
It tends to put a
lot of weight on--

01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:55.270
if you save many people one
second, then that's great.

01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:59.640
And instead of being sort
of goal-oriented, and--

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:04.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I feel
like often agencies

01:14:04.230 --> 01:14:06.206
will do one analysis
for their grant

01:14:06.206 --> 01:14:08.500
and then their own
analysis because they

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.074
think they have benefits.

01:14:10.074 --> 01:14:10.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:16.490
So, any other comments or
questions on ridership?

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:17.920
This is an important
topic, right?

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.825
It's one of the key topics
in public transportation.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:24.090
If it's a new system, how
many people will ride it?

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:26.130
And therefore, what
mode will I choose?

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:31.080
How much will it cost, or
many, many applications.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:31.740
Ari?

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.406
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess, maybe could you

01:14:33.406 --> 01:14:35.770
speak to how well models do?

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:39.710
Do we have evidence that
models are good, models are--

01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:40.614
how-- what are some--

01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:41.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.790
I haven't actually seen--

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:47.490
I'm not very familiar
with any study that

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.900
systematically looked at that.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:49.525
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:14:49.525 --> 01:14:56.920
PROFESSOR: But again,
what we have seen a lot

01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.340
of is the earlier approaches.

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.470
And these sort of
fudge factors put

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:06.790
in, so the 50% stated preference
without conjoint analysis,

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:07.940
things like that.

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.450
And those are all
over the map in terms

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:16.690
of whether they were accurate
or not, often because often they

01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:18.420
overshoot the prediction.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.535
And you wonder, to
what extent is that

01:15:21.535 --> 01:15:24.240
a bias because you
want funding and you

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.410
want to show that there will
be ridership for it if it's

01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:31.990
a capital project?

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:36.070
But I haven't really seen--
and maybe it exists--

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:39.100
a systematic look at recent
models and how accurate

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.050
they were.

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:43.140
AUDIENCE: You mostly see it
for new systems and extensions,

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.200
not for existing
service changes.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:51.580
AUDIENCE: I'm sort of interested
not in comparing models

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.430
to what happens in reality but
what we talked about an hour

01:15:54.430 --> 01:16:00.070
ago about surveys, how stated
preference surveys compared

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:02.990
to real preference surveys, if--

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:04.990
has anyone done any
significant research

01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:07.330
about a project that was open?

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.270
What did people say
before about the moment

01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.220
that they were going to use it?

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.400
What did people then say after
about what mode did I use?

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:20.740
I can't site specific results
because I don't remember them.

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.690
But that has been looked at.

01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:28.070
And there is research on the
literature on that topic.

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:30.700
AUDIENCE: Isn't there generally
pretty bad follow-up, though,

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.240
when--

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:31.865
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:16:31.865 --> 01:16:34.754
AUDIENCE: --these demand models
are done, there is very poor--

01:16:34.754 --> 01:16:36.170
PROFESSOR: But I
think generally--

01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:37.300
AUDIENCE: They don't
actually predict--

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.466
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.

01:16:38.466 --> 01:16:43.160
So usually once you do a
study, you predict the demand.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.300
If the party goes
forward, nobody

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:49.894
bothers to compare
how bad it was often,

01:16:49.894 --> 01:16:50.810
at least not formally.

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:54.620
I'm sure people comment,
gee, that was way off

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:56.750
or that was great.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:02.530
But do we have sort of
documented studies showing

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:06.310
how well or how accurate
were these predictions?

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:08.270
I haven't really
seen many of them.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:09.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
newspapers.

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:11.560
And [INAUDIBLE] what
we do with that?

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.630
Should we require
follow-up and then if--

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:14.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.740
--portion of the grant you got?

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.884
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:17.884 --> 01:17:19.300
AUDIENCE: Well,
and maybe it would

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.594
allow us to say, OK,
which models have--

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:24.010
where have the
models worked well?

01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:25.010
Where have they not worked well?

01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.676
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:25.676 --> 01:17:27.030
Yeah.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:29.890
Well, the idea of having a
disincentive for overshooting

01:17:29.890 --> 01:17:30.782
is interesting.

01:17:30.782 --> 01:17:31.990
AUDIENCE: The price is right.

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:33.490
If you consistently
overshoot, we'll

01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:36.080
penalize you in the future.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.770
PROFESSOR: So that would
maybe put you on a position

01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:41.304
where you want to be as
accurate as possible.

01:17:41.304 --> 01:17:45.174
AUDIENCE: But then you might
be too conservative, maybe.

01:17:45.174 --> 01:17:45.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.240
It could be either way, right?

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.200
You could be penalized
for undershooting it.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.230
PROFESSOR: So, yeah.

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:59.350
Any other comments or questions?

01:17:59.350 --> 01:18:01.200
All right.
