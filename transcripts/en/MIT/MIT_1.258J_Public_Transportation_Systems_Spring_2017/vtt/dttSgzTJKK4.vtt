00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.100
PROFESSOR: OK, so you might
recall we had a snow day,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.650
and the snow day bumped us.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.890
We interrupted our
introduction theme

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.280
and dove right into
data collection.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.960
Then we did
short-range planning.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.810
So Neema was lecturing
that over two lectures.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.480
Now we're back to the third
and last introductory material.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.450
And then we'll go back and
do more data and modeling

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.410
if that makes sense.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.590
Sorry for that interruption.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.390
So it's a little more general
than the other classes

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.620
that we've seen.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.530
And today's topic is model
capacities and costs.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.200
So we'll cover a simple capacity
analysis that you might do,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.580
you know, back of the
envelope calculation.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.144
If somebody is asking
you about something,

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:14.560
and it's a completely
new service,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740
and you just want
to have an idea,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.090
I will give an example of that.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.740
Then we'll look at
worldwide status

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.720
of urban rail systems,
both heavy rail

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.450
and light rail, some bus ways.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.880
And we'll look at capital
and operating costs

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.140
at a high level, focusing more
on the US using the National

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.740
Transit Database.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.580
All right, so
first slide here is

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.560
an update of the statistics
I gave you earlier.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.470
So you have these
statistics from

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.610
the previous
introductory lecture,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.370
but these are updated for 2013.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.040
So I'm not going to
cover this in detail.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.700
But if you want to compare
with the previous table,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.480
you can do so.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.050
And here you have
more updated numbers.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.110
These come from
the APTA Fact Book,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.247
and they take the numbers from
the National Transit Database.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.660
And let's start with that
simple capacity analysis.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.500
So this is a
theoretical exercise,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.130
but it gives you some idea
of how one might approach--

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.400
if you have nothing
to go on, how

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.730
one might approach
estimating what capacity

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.380
you need for some service.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.460
So the problem is, given
a pie-shaped sector

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.650
into the central
business district served

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.830
by a single transit line, what
will be the peak passenger

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.800
flow entering the central
business district.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.110
And that might give you an
idea of what mode you need.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.609
Right?

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.990
Can you run a bus system?

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.350
Do you need a light rail,
a BRT, a heavy rail?

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.870
So it gives you some idea.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.790
And you might have
some statistics

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.220
about the city where
you're being asked about,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.390
the question.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.100
And so you can make
some assumptions.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.920
You can draw this on the back
of a napkin and, you know,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.820
do some calculus with
it if you want to.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.630
And that's what
we're going to do.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.220
So I'm going to draw on
the board a little bit.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.770
What do we have here?

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.960
Yeah, I'll draw the same
shape here for reference.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.760
So we have a cone-shaped
sector or a pie-shaped sector.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.230
And there's some angle
of that corridor, which

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.560
is the catchment area
over which people

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.150
might walk to the service.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.780
The service, by the
way, is along some line,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.290
and it reaches the city center,
which we're calling the CBD.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.950
And at that center, there is
some density, some population

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.460
density, which we call
P sub c, the population

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.340
density at the center.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.040
And at any point along this
pie or pie-shaped sector,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.220
this, the length of
this arc, is r theta,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.110
where theta is the angle, and
r is the radius from the CBD

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.200
up to that point.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.240
So r is a variable,
and it starts at 0,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.520
and it extends all the
way up to the length

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.580
of the corridor,
which is L. L is

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.370
the maximum value r can take.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.750
Does that make sense?

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.282
Everybody following?

00:04:44.282 --> 00:04:50.750
OK, and then we take little
slices of these arcs.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:59.600
And they have a very, very thin,
infinitesimally small width,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.890
dr. And we can--

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.310
that sort of sets the stage
for what we want to do here.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.360
Let's assume something.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.110
Let's start assuming the
population density, which

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.030
starts at a very high level
in the center of the business

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.772
district, starts
dropping as you move out.

00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:24.480
That makes sense.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.690
Right?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.320
In most cities,
that's what happens.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.580
We're going to assume
that it drops linearly

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.960
and that it reaches some value
lower than Pc at some distance

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.430
L from the CBD.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.060
And if we look at the
distance from the CBD

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:52.550
here, which we call r, and we
start at 0, 0 is at the CBD.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.840
Right?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.150
We start with a
population density of Pc.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.940
And we're going to assume it
drops linearly to some amount.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.330
And at some point,
we'll reach L.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.400
And that's where we
stop the corridor.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.460
So this part doesn't really
matter because the corridor

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.310
doesn't serve the part.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.790
And the rate at which that
population density declines,

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:34.200
we will call delta P.
OK, so total population

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.240
density is decreasing as we
move outwards from the center.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.900
All right, so let's
start with what is

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.820
the population in the corridor.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.320
Right?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.020
Because we need to know how many
people are in that corridor.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.330
And then from that,
we can calculate,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.160
based on some assumptions,
how many people

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.750
might access that line.

00:06:54.655 --> 00:06:57.850
So we'll start with
calculating the population

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.250
in that whole pie-shaped sector.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.190
All right, so call
it population.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:13.060
So we'll take an integral from
r equals 0 to r equals L, which

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.320
is the length of the corridor.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.720
And we take r theta, which is
the length of this arc, which

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.920
it starts very small and gets
longer and longer until we

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.260
get to this part,
which is L theta alone.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.760
Right?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.520
So this is the arc length.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:53.620
And we multiply by the
arc width, which is dr.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.620
And we multiply by the
population density.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.840
And the population
density is a function

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.330
of how far we are
from the center.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.380
So that's going to be P of r.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.860
And we can call
this graph P of r.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.320
The y value here is P of r.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.330
It starts at Pc, drops to 0.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.890
Or before reaching--
well, yeah, it

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.010
doesn't get to 0 at the
point of reaching L. Right?

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.230
So it remains positive
throughout the length

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.810
of the corridor.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.200
All right, and now we can
just, you know, do some math

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.169
and calculate this.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.970
So I'll just run through it.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:47.350
So we have r theta dr. Let's
substitute this function, which

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.000
is the population density.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.610
We assume that it
had this shape.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.010
So let's plug that in here.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.430
It's a linear function.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.570
So it starts at the
center with a high number,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:12.771
and it decreases as a function
of r at a rate of dP and times

00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:13.270
r.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:13.769
Right?

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:17.180
So when r equals 0,
there's no decrease.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.150
As you move this way,
you multiply r times dP,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.940
and you get the
difference between Pc

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.240
and the point where you are.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:42.370
All right, here I'm just
going to collect terms to make

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.810
things look a little nicer.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:07.250
All right, so again, we're just
distributing this times that

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.250
and that times that.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.130
So we have now two integrals.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.170
We can take some constants out.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.862
So theta is a constant,
and Pc is a constant.

00:10:18.862 --> 00:10:20.570
So we can take those
out of the integral.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.560
And we continue
integrating from 0 to L.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.820
But now we have a
simple thing, r dr,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.570
which we know how to integrate.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.010
And then here, dr is--

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.480
sorry, dP is given.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.510
So we have an assumption
about what that rate is right

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:47.680
so dP is taken out as
well as a constant.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.960
And we, again, integrate
from 0 through L. And sorry,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.140
and theta is also constant.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.640
Right?

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.600
So we can take that out.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.230
And we have r squared dr.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.220
So now it looks a
lot simpler, and we

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.340
can do the simple integral.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:06.840
Right?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.030
Integral of r dr is
r squared over 2.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.640
Integral of r squared
is r cubed over 3.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.860
So we can substitute that in.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:25.520
So we have Pc theta
over 2 times r squared--

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.310
and r squared goes from 0 to L--

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:37.540
minus dP theta over 3.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:46.420
And we have r cubed
going from 0 to L.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.750
And now we just simplify things,
and we compute the going from 0

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.460
to L on both sides.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:04.940
So we are left with Pc theta
over 2 times L squared.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.510
When these ranges are 0, this
term is 0, and that term is 0.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.160
So all that matters is plugging
in-- substituting L for r.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.890
Right?

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.510
And the terms of minus 0 are 0.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.710
So we don't need to write them.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:27.010
dP theta over 3 L cubed--

00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:40.340
and just collecting terms,
the ones that look similar--

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:47.983
Pc/2 minus dP L/3.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.420
OK, so this is the
population in the corridor.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.560
And it's a function of the
properties of the corridor.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.060
Right?

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.700
So if the corridor
is longer, then we

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.160
have a higher population.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.885
If the angle of the corridor
gets wider [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:11.885 --> 00:13:13.010
population in the corridor.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.470
That also makes sense.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.905
And then it also depends on the
population of the city center--

00:13:17.905 --> 00:13:20.830
the higher it is, the bigger
the population in the center.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.760
And it depends on the rate at
which the population decreases

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.320
from the center--

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.117
the smaller the
rate of decrease,

00:13:28.117 --> 00:13:29.200
the larger the population.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.075
Right?

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:30.950
Does that make sense?

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.000
OK, and now, in terms
of peak passenger flow,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.880
we can look at units, but we'll
have to add some assumptions.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.252
So actually, I
think, at this point,

00:13:49.252 --> 00:13:50.960
I can probably stop
the math on the board

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.480
and just go straight to it.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.435
So this is the modeling part.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.810
And now we're just going to
make some assumptions about--

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.200
given that the population in the
corridor and some assumptions

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.390
about what L and
theta and Pc and dP

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:10.150
are and some assumptions about
the share of those people that

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.750
would take transit, we'll look
at what the peak passenger

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.360
flow is.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.090
So let's go straight to it.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.960
Here we have the
variables that I

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.890
defined on the board and
some additional ones.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.640
We have t, c, m, and p.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.140
Right?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.422
So t is the number of one-way
trips per person per day.

00:14:28.422 --> 00:14:29.880
We're going to have
to assume this.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.960
c is the share of trips
that are inbound to the CBD,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.440
as opposed to going outbound.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:37.940
Right?

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.260
So it's what
percentage go inbound.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.260
m is the transit market
share for CBD-bound trips.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.230
So some people will take
cars or other modes.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.620
And we want to have some
assumption about what

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.330
percent of people that
are going into the CBD

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.840
will take transit, as
opposed to other modes.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.890
So that's m.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.130
And p is the share of CBD-bound
transit trips in the peak hour.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.720
So we want the peak hour flow.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.754
And maybe we don't
want the whole day.

00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:10.920
We just want peak hour flow.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.940
So there's going to be
some percentage of that.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.520
So here you have
the same equations

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.200
that I have on the board.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.740
And the peak
passenger flow is what

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.100
we have there, which is the
population in the corridor

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.320
multiplied by our four
assumptions, our four

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.600
factors that are
going to convert

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.550
the population in
the whole corridor

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.110
to what percent of people are
going to go into the CBD taking

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.250
transit.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.090
Again, this is a very
simple, theoretical exercise,

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.040
but it could be
useful at some point.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.610
And we'll just plug
in for two examples.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.500
We have two scenarios
here-- one where

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.830
the population density in the
CBD is 10,000 and another one

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.240
where it's 20,000.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.290
For reference, in New York
City, the population density

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.500
is about 28,000.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:08.840
So these are not as high
as those very dense cities.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.334
AUDIENCE: But like what
is 10,000 [INAUDIBLE]??

00:16:11.334 --> 00:16:13.500
PROFESSOR: Depends how--
again, it's the same thing.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.900
Like it depends how
far you go and what

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.040
you define as the center.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.220
But here are some numbers.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.420
This could be some city.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:21.920
Right?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.270
These are typical
of some cities.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.330
So here we have some
decreases and the rate

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.270
of decrease in the population
from the center going out.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:38.706
We're assuming a 40-degree
angle for the shape of this.

00:16:38.706 --> 00:16:40.080
If you have a
city, you know, you

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.690
have several lines
going in radially.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.600
This transit corridor serves
about a 40-degree angle.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.100
So--

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.452
AUDIENCE: Is that--
that seems like a lot.

00:16:49.452 --> 00:16:50.410
PROFESSOR: It is a lot.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.620
AUDIENCE: Like maybe
a little too much.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.730
PROFESSOR: Well, it
depends how many--

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.063
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 40
degrees like in the inner part,

00:16:55.063 --> 00:16:57.495
but, you know, 40 degrees
you go [INAUDIBLE] miles out.

00:16:57.495 --> 00:17:00.317
Now you're already making
a [INAUDIBLE] arch.

00:17:00.317 --> 00:17:02.150
PROFESSOR: At the end,
it sounds like a lot,

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.608
but, at the beginning,
not so much.

00:17:03.608 --> 00:17:09.569
If you think of a city,
you know, and you have--

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:10.974
these are 90 degree angles.

00:17:10.974 --> 00:17:12.390
Right, and you add
two more lines.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.390
That's 45.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.089
So we're how many lines
would you have in a city?

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.650
And it sort-- right?

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.069
So it's not that unrealistic
to think of some line

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.599
with a 40-degree angle coming
into the CBD from outside.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:31.770
And we're assuming a
10-mile length and factors--

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:37.730
so here we have 2.5,
0.2, 0.5, and 0.25.

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.000
So that's the assumptions
for the different constants

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.590
to convert the whole population
into the number of people

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.250
going inbound in the
morning rush taking transit.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.590
All right, so if
we plug that in,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.150
we get a required capacity of
10,000 in the first scenario

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.860
and 30,000 in the
other scenario.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.180
And then from that,
one could say, well,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.250
can I have a bus system
serving 10,000 people per hour?

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.820
Or can I have a bus
system or a rail system

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.742
serving 30,000 people per hour.

00:18:10.742 --> 00:18:13.330
That's accommodating a
flow, which this is, again,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.930
a back-of-the-napkin
calculation,

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:19.190
but it gives you an idea of,
based on the characteristics

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.440
of some city, what
we would need.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.840
So let's look at some
theoretical capacities now.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.580
So in this slide, we
are looking at kind

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.870
of high-end, upper bounds
almost on these modes.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.300
So for rail, let's
assume a very long train,

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.830
which is 10 cars long, and it's
packed with 200 people per car.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.490
And it runs at a high
frequency, every two minutes.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.740
That gives you 60,000
passengers per hour.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.830
So that's about as
much as a metro system

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:55.870
can provide in terms of
capacity or a line, metro

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.732
line, a single metro line.

00:18:57.732 --> 00:19:03.110
If we look at bus, so a
full bus, 70 passengers,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.420
that's quite packed.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.340
You could run, if you
have multiple bays,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.930
you could run
30-second headways.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.950
So if you see, BRT corridors
have capacity to do that.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.340
Obviously, if they are queuing
up to serve a single stop,

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.720
that could not happen.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.660
But if you have multiple
bays, that can happen.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.320
So based on that assumption,
you can get 8,400.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.920
All right, so that's
pushing the limits of bus.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.380
BRT-- BRT vehicles are longer.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.140
So you might fit
200 people in one

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.890
of these double-articulated
vehicles.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.230
You might have even 20-second
headways with good facilities.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.050
That gives you 36,000
passengers per hour, again,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.730
pushing the limits here.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.460
Light rail, I have
to say that I'm

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.426
assuming a two-car
train here, but we

00:19:50.426 --> 00:19:51.550
could have three-car train.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.008
So maybe I'm not
pushing the limits

00:19:53.008 --> 00:19:54.890
as much on light rail here.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.120
But based on a two-car train
assumption and 150 passengers

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.420
per car, which is quite a
bit for a light rail car,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.940
and assuming one-minute
headway, that's

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.320
18,000 passengers per hour.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.820
Right?

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.430
So you can compare these.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.520
And again, these are all
kind of upper bounds.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.580
Maybe light rail can be
pushed a little higher.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.960
But it gives you an idea of what
the theoretical capacities are.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.300
So now we have this
back-of-the-envelope

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.710
calculation--

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.780
10,000, 30,000.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.930
And what would we
need for 10,000?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.760
Could we serve that
10,000 demand with a bus?

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.530
Probably not.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.960
Do we need rail,
BRT, or light rail?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.620
Probably so.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.110
So it gives you an idea.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.070
And if it's the 30,000
example, well, it

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.500
looks like we're
going to need rail.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.400
Right?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.366
Because BRT is kind of--

00:20:45.366 --> 00:20:46.990
you're getting to
the high end of that.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.280
So we're probably going
to need rail for that.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.980
OK, and now let's look at
what happens here in Boston.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.070
So it's much lower
here, nowhere near

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.400
the theoretical
capacities, right,

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.850
that we're talking about.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.790
These are peak-hour volumes
for the different lines.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.570
So if we look at the Red Line,
which is the most crowded line,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.160
in the Cambridge section,
which is the most crowded,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.920
especially between Central
Square and MIT-- actually,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.970
that's the highest
point on the system--

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.740
we have almost 10,000 people
per hour, passengers per hour.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.963
AUDIENCE: We saw in
a different course--

00:21:22.963 --> 00:21:24.504
one of the people
from the T who came

00:21:24.504 --> 00:21:26.700
who was a graduate
of the MST program

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.457
showed slightly higher
numbers than that.

00:21:28.457 --> 00:21:30.665
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so these
numbers are a little dated.

00:21:30.665 --> 00:21:33.690
And it depends on how
you define the peak hour.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.020
And you know, I could show
you the peak 15 minutes,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.100
and that would be higher
than this, for example.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.170
So if you look at the peak--

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.610
yeah, like the peak of the peak,
it's even higher than this.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.316
But it still is the case that
these are not approaching

00:21:49.316 --> 00:21:50.440
the theoretical capacities.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.445
And that's because we
don't have, you know,

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:57.030
two-minute headways and
10-car trains or yeah.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.270
So right, so the Orange Line,
we have two sections here,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.920
the north and the
southwest, similar numbers.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.395
Blue Line is slightly lower.

00:22:06.395 --> 00:22:11.300
On the Green Line, the branches
do about, you know, 1,800,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.050
less than 2,000 each.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:17.570
So we're looking at a much
lower number than the light rail

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.620
theoretical capacity.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.510
And in the central subway
where all these branches merge,

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:27.955
we get a much higher demand,
but it's still lower.

00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:30.080
Again, these vehicles are
not running every minute.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.300
And in some cases, they
are, but not consistently.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.114
And we don't fill
all the vehicles,

00:22:40.114 --> 00:22:42.740
you know, to crush
load for a whole hour.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.820
Right?

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.520
So we're not getting
that capacity.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.300
We're not delivering
that capacity.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.841
So it gives you an
idea where we are.

00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:52.650
If you've used the
system here in Boston,

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.520
you might relate taking
the train at peak hour

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.800
to what these numbers
look like and think

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.910
about what it would take to
increase capacity in terms

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.140
of more cars or a
higher demand spread

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.650
over a longer peak
and things like that.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.250
OK, now let's look at
worldwide urban rail systems.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.960
This is metro, and I have
grouped it by continent.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.560
And it starts sort
of before the 1900s.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:29.730
And you can see the earlier
systems started in Europe--

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.590
London, Budapest.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.870
Right?

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.540
And then North America
followed closely after that.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.200
Boston takes the prize
for the first subway.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.300
That's the Green Line.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.230
And even though we call
it light rail here,

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.480
we're calling it
metro in the slide.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.320
So we have a few starts
in North America,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.362
and it sort of falls
flat in 1920s and 1930s.

00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:54.570
And then it takes off again--

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.300
1960s all the up.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.870
It keeps increasing.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.470
Asia was a little
slower to start,

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.980
but it's going up really fast.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.230
China is building
a lot of metro.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.160
Africa, I think it has
two systems right now.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.860
And there are no systems that
I am aware of in Australia,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.050
but they are building
one that should

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.080
start before the end of
this decade in Sydney.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.960
So they're going
forward with that.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.240
So this is, you know--

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.040
you can see that
we're building metro

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.616
and that it goes
together with what

00:24:24.616 --> 00:24:25.740
we said on the first class.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.130
Population is increasing.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.100
And especially urban
population is increasing.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.610
People are moving away from
rural areas into cities.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.290
The required capacities to
have agglomeration benefits

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.230
and avoid traffic and
air pollution problems

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:45.390
is requiring higher density,
higher flow systems like metro.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.290
Questions?

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.615
AUDIENCE: So you've got
Australia has some very

00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:50.490
dense cities of course.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:51.670
How do they move people in?

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.604
Like do they have BRT systems?

00:24:53.604 --> 00:24:55.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so they have BRT.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.280
They have light rail.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.310
AUDIENCE: Melbourne has
the longest light rail

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.500
network in the world.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and they
have pretty good BRT.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.309
AUDIENCE: The bulk of Melbourne
is electric commuter trains

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:08.225
that operate at sort of
subway-level headways.

00:25:08.225 --> 00:25:09.939
So it wouldn't be
included in your--

00:25:09.939 --> 00:25:11.980
PROFESSOR: So yeah, we're
not counting them here.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.750
And so good point,
it's hard to--

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.960
there are many ways of
accounting for systems here.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.095
Sometimes, you know--

00:25:21.095 --> 00:25:23.119
AUDIENCE: Commuter
rail and heavy rail.

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that might be mixed.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.700
Or do they count
those as two or as one

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.950
if there are different
systems in one city?

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:32.340
I've tried here to count
each city as one system,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.150
even if there are
multiple systems.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:39.240
So for example, I'm not
counting the Tube in London

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.880
and Docklands Light
Railway as two systems.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.184
I'm counting them as one.

00:25:43.184 --> 00:25:44.850
But some people would
count them as two.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.610
So there is some
arbitrary choice

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.370
to be made here in
accounting, but it gives you

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.860
an idea of what the trends
are and how we are moving

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.670
and how it started and
where we are right now.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.932
Here's light rail, light
rail and streetcar.

00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:00.390
So if we only looked
at light rail,

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.250
it wouldn't look like this.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.750
This includes
streetcars, and that's

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:11.750
why we start so early before
the 1900s in Europe and Asia

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.860
as well.

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.860
And then North America really
didn't follow until much

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.070
more recently.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.370
AUDIENCE: Well, North America,
it's like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:23.027
If you include North America,
every city had streetcars.

00:26:23.027 --> 00:26:25.235
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but they're
not operating right now.

00:26:25.235 --> 00:26:25.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but they're
not currently operating.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.830
AUDIENCE: You would
see [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so that's right.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.420
So that's another good point.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.810
So if we included things
that were operating

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.510
and no longer dropped,
then this graph would go up

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.140
and then down.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.580
And these are
based on statistics

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.850
of currently-operating systems
that started at some point

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:41.670
in the past.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.170
Right?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.400
So that's a good point.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.320
Thank you for bringing that up.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.980
And we see here Africa,
Oceania, so Australia--

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.000
and let's see.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Yeah, Africa, South
America, and Australia

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.140
don't have many systems.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:00.640
Right?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.990
So mainly, we have
[INAUDIBLE] in Asia,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.400
and increasingly so
in North America,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.060
but not at the same
level as in Asia.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:15.360
Obviously, that has to do
with the size of the cities

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.370
and the number of
large cities as well.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:24.210
So OK, capital costs, so
these are based, once more,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.570
on the NTD numbers, the
National Transit Database.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:33.560
These are 2013 numbers that were
published in the 2015 APTA Fact

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.100
Book.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.260
And you can download
that on Stellar

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.600
if you want to look
at these in detail.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.740
So $18.2 billion was
spent in capital costs,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.600
and we're going to look at
how that cost was distributed.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.320
So if we look at by type,
about a quarter of that

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.430
was spent on purchasing vehicles
or rehauling old vehicles

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.010
for their midlife repair.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.480
And about 60% was spent on
infrastructure and facilities.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.130
All right, so that could include
new rail lines or extensions,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:11.880
repairs of those, bus stops,
maintenance facilities, right,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.590
offices, things like that.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.940
And then about 15%, 16%
was spent on other things.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:23.470
Those other things could be
AFC systems, other things that

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:24.860
are not vehicles or facilities.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.360
Right?

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.540
So OK, by mode,
about a quarter was

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.980
spent on bus projects, about
35% on heavy rail projects,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.310
and then less, a little less,
on commuter rail and light rail,

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.500
and then 5% in other modes.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.870
And that's mostly paratransit
or demand responsive, as they

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.530
[INAUDIBLE] APTA Fact Book.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:51.150
So it gives you an idea of
how the US, on any given year,

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.990
distributes the
capital expenditures.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:59.210
You might think that,
from year to year,

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:03.290
these costs vary a lot because
capital investments are

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:03.870
very lumpy.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.370
Right?

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.630
You don't have them,
and, all of a sudden,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.509
you invest a lot of
money into a system.

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:09.050
But because there
are so many cities,

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.110
they don't actually
vary that much.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.840
And the other reason
that doesn't happen

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.030
is because a lot of the
expenditures are gradual.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.880
So it takes several
years to build new lines.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.360
So they are distributed
over several years,

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.740
instead of all at once.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.160
And here we have the
breakdown by mode and type

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.940
at the same time.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.070
So about-- the key takeaway
here is so $4.5 billion

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.980
was spent on bus projects.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.950
And about half of that was
on vehicles and about half

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.310
was on facilities, the
repair facilities, bus stops,

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.590
things of that nature.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:53.610
When we look at rail, the
percent spent on vehicles

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.400
is much lower.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.360
It's about 10% to 20%,
7% to 20% in this case,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.720
depending on the
specific rail mode.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.842
And closer to 90% is spent on
infrastructure and facilities.

00:30:04.842 --> 00:30:05.550
That makes sense.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.050
Right?

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.350
You have to lay--

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.700
you have to sort of put rail.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.490
You have to build stations.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.510
The maintenance yards
are more expensive.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.320
So these are bigger projects.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.010
To the extent that the
right of way is a subway,

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.030
then you have to dig.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.900
And so it's very expensive.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:29.160
And here you have the total
expenditure, capital cost

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.810
by mode.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.170
And so 4.5 on bus, 6.2 on
heavy rail, 3 on commuter rail,

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.250
3.5 on light rail.

00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:40.640
OK, and now focusing on
infrastructure costs,

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.715
so what drives the
infrastructure costs?

00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:46.340
First, the type of
construction, right,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.190
so if we look at
heavy rail, you could

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.430
build at grade, so
leveled on the street

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.430
or on sort of new
lands that you don't

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.100
have to acquire from anyone.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.600
That's the least expensive.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.736
Then you move to elevated.

00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:02.360
If you have to go
over streets, and you

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.100
have an elevated section, that's
the second most expensive.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.370
And then subway tends to
be the most expensive.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.390
And there are two
ways of doing that.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.450
There's cut and cover.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.700
So that's a shallow tunnel.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.900
You dig a hole.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.140
You put the rail lines, and then
you build a roof on top of it,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.150
and cars drive over it.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.470
That's shallow tunnel.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.200
And then there's deep tunnel,
which is the most expensive.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.840
That tends to be with a
tunnel boring machine.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.650
So you get these huge
machines that drill the hole.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.300
They're very fun to
learn about and look it.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.880
I encourage you to YouTube them.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.450
And they are usually
built for the project.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.730
And when they
finish digging, they

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.350
are sort of taken off course.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:49.340
And they sort of remain
interred at the level.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.790
So they're kind of used
once, and there you go.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:57.860
So London has used a lot of
these for their very deep Tube.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.563
And yeah, you should
look at these on YouTube.

00:32:00.563 --> 00:32:02.354
AUDIENCE: In New York,
it's kind of common.

00:32:02.354 --> 00:32:04.074
Right?

00:32:04.074 --> 00:32:04.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.240
AUDIENCE: It basically
goes along the avenues.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.131
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so in
London, we have both.

00:32:08.131 --> 00:32:08.630
Right?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.294
So the earlier lines like
the Central Line and the--

00:32:11.294 --> 00:32:12.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
Circle and District.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.940
PROFESSOR: The Circle
and District Lines

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.770
are definitely cut and cover.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.731
And then the Silver
Line is very deep.

00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:18.230
Right?

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.530
And so that's a
tunnel boring machine.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.530
AUDIENCE: Can you give a
sense of the difference

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:27.536
between let's say at grade,
elevated, and shallow and deep?

00:32:27.536 --> 00:32:29.660
PROFESSOR: Maybe I should
have shown some pictures.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.075
But at grade is just
at street level.

00:32:32.075 --> 00:32:34.357
AUDIENCE: No, I know, but
like the difference in cost.

00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:34.940
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.260
AUDIENCE: Like cost per mile.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.550
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'll
give some examples

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:38.570
in the next few slides.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.370
Yeah, that's a good segue.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.320
So the other key factors are
land acquisition and clearance.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.140
So if you're
building a new line,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.830
and you have to use eminent
domain and sort of buy property

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.710
from people who own them,
who own that property,

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.010
to build your new line,
that costs some money.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.670
Also, the number, size,
complexity, and length

00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.840
of the stations--

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.170
so station design is
a key component here

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.730
and the complexity
of the system.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.930
Is this an independent line?

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.250
Or are there many
points of transfer?

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.990
And how do you coordinate that?

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.750
During construction, do
you have to keep operating

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.950
some parts of the line?

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.630
How do you manage that?

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:21.470
So if you look at, for
example, the repair

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.190
of the bridge, the Longfellow
Bridge here in Boston,

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.760
we wanted to do that with rail,
for the most part, running.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.760
So that has increased the
costs of that project.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.010
You couldn't just take the
bridge down and rebuild it.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.490
And we wouldn't have the
Red Line for a long time.

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:44.162
OK, so here are
some typical costs.

00:33:44.162 --> 00:33:45.370
Here are some, four examples.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.390
Right?

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.980
And they vary a lot,
but it gives you

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.730
some idea of the
magnitude of these costs.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:54.060
So Tren Urbano was one of
the most recent systems.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.960
It was built in 2002 in
San Juan, Puerto Rico.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.130
And it 50% at grade,
about 40% elevated,

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.400
and 10% subway, just a small
section that was subway.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.620
It cost about $2
billion to build.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.830
And if you divide that by
the length of the corridor,

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:13.850
it comes out to $118
million per kilometer.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:14.350
Right?

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.960
So it gives you an
idea of what it takes.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.350
The MBTA Red Line in
1984, it was extended

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.830
to Alewife from Harvard.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.520
And that was 5 kilometer
extension, four stations.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.989
It was all subway.

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:33.639
So it cost $0.6 billion
of $600 million.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:37.710
And that comes up to $120
million per kilometer.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:41.199
All these figures are in the
dollar numbers of the year

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:45.159
that they were built. They're
not adjusted for inflation.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.340
Then we have the
Los Angeles MTA.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.730
That was a new system
started in the late 1980s.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.580
It was all subway, 7 kilometers.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.870
$1.2 billion comes
out to $180 million

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:02.220
per kilometer, so same
range, right, or similar.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.070
I mean, obviously, from 120
to 180, it's 60 million.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.490
That's a lot of money,
but same ballpark,

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.280
same order of magnitude.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.160
WMATA was cheaper on
a unit cost basis.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.580
It was built over several
decades, multiple phases, 100

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.700
kilometers, so lots of stations,
lots of distance covered.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.340
It's a mix of subway,
elevated, and at grade.

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:31.950
And it cost $6.4 billion, and
that comes out to $60 million

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:32.930
per kilometer.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.301
So yeah.

00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:34.800
Question?

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.702
AUDIENCE: Can you say
what is WMATA again.

00:35:36.702 --> 00:35:38.910
PROFESSOR: WMATA is the
Washington metro, Washington,

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:39.210
DC.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:39.810
AUDIENCE: Washington, DC.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.143
PROFESSOR: Washington, DC, yeah.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.440
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:53.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So since this--

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:54.933
PROFESSOR: In one year.

00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:55.558
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:55.558 --> 00:35:57.540
So since this remains
the same across years--

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.540
PROFESSOR: More or less.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.590
It varies, but it
doesn't vary drastically

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:02.050
is what I wanted to say.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.440
AUDIENCE: So would that
mean that in fact we're

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.605
declining the amount we spend
on transportation because this

00:36:07.605 --> 00:36:11.260
is not inflation adjusted?

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.010
PROFESSOR: This is not
inflation adjusted.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.600
That's right.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.570
AUDIENCE: So it's
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:15.444
are declining, right?

00:36:15.444 --> 00:36:16.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.912
PROFESSOR: For heavy rail, yes.

00:36:18.912 --> 00:36:20.447
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.040
We're building a lot of
light rail and stuff.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:31.019
But there is still some
expansion or repair or--

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:33.060
AUDIENCE: Does this mean
the Second Avenue subway

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.590
extension isn't in the
same order of magnitude

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.415
as any other--

00:36:36.415 --> 00:36:38.790
PROFESSOR: I'm not familiar
with the unit costs for that.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.650
AUDIENCE: I read it was like
$2 billion per kilometer.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:42.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean
it depends on many things.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.960
So--

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.395
AUDIENCE: Well,
so recent lines, I

00:36:46.395 --> 00:36:48.846
mean Seattle was
about $1 billion per.

00:36:48.846 --> 00:36:51.900
And San Francisco Central
Subway was about $1 billion per.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.250
So modern subways
are-- the stupid GLX,

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:56.210
the Tremont extension
was $500 million

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.300
because the T can't procure
a project out of their butts,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.610
but it's still still
four times cheaper

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.320
than Second Avenue subway.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.742
Well, but it's also
being built at grade,

00:37:06.742 --> 00:37:07.950
and it gets the right of way.

00:37:11.582 --> 00:37:13.252
PROFESSOR: So many
factors there.

00:37:13.252 --> 00:37:14.460
Let's look at light rail now.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:22.480
So LA MTA, 30 kilometers at
grade, so a long distance,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.580
but all at grade--

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:27.940
$690 million, this includes
stations and vehicles.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.100
That comes to $23
million per kilometer.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.680
So you can see that these
costs are a lot lower.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.260
A lot of that has to do with
it being at grade and also

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.017
not being as
complex of a system.

00:37:40.017 --> 00:37:41.100
Yeah, you have a question.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, are these
costs for just the parts

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.446
that were built in the late
1980s and not over time.

00:37:49.446 --> 00:37:52.794
Like the most recent one
is not included in that.

00:37:52.794 --> 00:37:54.710
PROFESSOR: Not including
the most recent ones,

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.620
that's correct, yeah.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.520
So Buffalo, 10
kilometers, but subway,

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.830
cost almost the
same, even though it

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.030
was a third of the length.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.410
It comes out to $53
million per kilometer.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.360
Santa Clara, 30
kilometers at grade,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:16.677
so very similar to LA MTA,
about $500 million, $16 million

00:38:16.677 --> 00:38:17.260
per kilometer.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.240
So you can see that,
even in similar systems,

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.610
there are other details
that might affect cost

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.020
significantly.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.680
And then Portland, mid
1980s, 24 kilometers

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:33.040
at grade, $214 million, about
$9 million per kilometer-- so

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.450
that was the cheapest of these
examples on a unit cost basis.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.200
AUDIENCE: Remind us what a
light rail subway is again.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.020
PROFESSOR: So yeah, these
are terms that are arbitrary,

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.810
but our stereotypical definition
that we are using here

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:55.250
is a lot of it tends to
be at grade, not always.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.590
It could be subway.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.460
It tends to have electricity
from pickup lines on the top.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.730
You might have some sections
where people board sort

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:08.970
of straight from the streets.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.950
All right, so there is not
a special platform where--

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.610
like a subway station where
people tap into a gate

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:18.110
and move in.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.252
AUDIENCE: This is not that.

00:39:19.252 --> 00:39:20.210
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.950
AUDIENCE: Light rail subway.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:21.910
So--

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.570
AUDIENCE: People are
walking into the--

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so when
we look at heavy rail,

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.150
we're thinking about
things like the Red Line

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.942
and the Blue Line and
the Orange Line here.

00:39:27.942 --> 00:39:29.316
When we look at
light rail, we're

00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:31.800
thinking more like streetcars
and the Green Line here

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.721
in Boston.

00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:34.220
Right?

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.977
So the Green Line is
more like light rail.

00:39:35.977 --> 00:39:37.560
Even though it has
the subway portion,

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:42.160
it's operating like a light
rail in some part, subway part.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:49.050
Yeah, but if we look
at other countries,

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.300
some systems are
called light rail.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.450
Docklands Light Rail
in London, false--

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.340
if we describe it,
we would classify it

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.920
as heavy rail with
these descriptions.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.150
And in Asia, we see
a lot of systems

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.720
called light rail, which are, by
these descriptions, heavy rail.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:12.090
So the terms are
used with caution.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:17.180
OK, busways, so the South Boston
Transitway was 2 kilometers.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:22.910
That was the Silver Line tunnel,
right, cost $606 million--

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.800
that does include the
purchase of vehicles--

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.880
and so $303, of course,
million per kilometer.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:35.000
TransMilenio was 36 kilometers
at grade in the early 2000s,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.380
$200 million, $5
million per kilometer.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.050
Seattle, 2 kilometer
of bus tunnel, $319--

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:43.880
$160.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.490
So the takeaway here is,
if you're making a tunnel,

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.351
you can see that the first and
third examples are tunnels.

00:40:49.351 --> 00:40:49.850
Right?

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:52.670
And they cost a lot more in
the hundreds of millions.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.280
And the three that are
at grade, second, fourth,

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.440
and fifth examples, two of
them in the 36, 35 kilometer,

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.220
and this one a
little shorter, are

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:09.746
in the two-digit, single-digit
million dollars per kilometer.

00:41:09.746 --> 00:41:11.329
AUDIENCE: TransMilenio,
you're talking

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:14.430
about like the first, initial--

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.470
PROFESSOR: Because
they've kept growing

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.180
is what you're saying, right?

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.410
I don't know--

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:24.390
I don't remember what range of
years this includes exactly.

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:28.950
But yeah, I'm saying,
you know, whatever

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:32.590
they were sort of starting
to operate in 2001.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.680
Yeah.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.790
And you can see here
36 kilometers at grade.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.890
So we could then go
look and see what

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.200
is that 36 kilometers
at grade that they

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.390
built around 2001 to see.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.370
If they've expanded
more recently,

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:46.820
that's probably
not included here.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.320
Yeah.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.590
Any other questions?

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:54.920
So these are examples to give
you an idea of what it costs

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920
or what it has cost.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:03.150
OK, generic costs
for rail, so it

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.690
costs from about
$2 to $2.5 million

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.450
per car for a heavy rail train.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.320
So if you calculate what
capacity you need, and you

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.870
think you need a
fleet of 200 vehicles,

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.545
you can take these numbers
and multiply by $2.5 million.

00:42:17.545 --> 00:42:18.920
You have some idea
of how much it

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.530
costs to purchase your fleet.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:31.160
Some recent-- a recent CNR,
it was a large procurement.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.870
And that helps bring
the unit cost down.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:38.300
So 284 cars replaced Orange
and Red Line vehicles.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:42.140
Siemens in 2010, it was
about $2.3 million per car.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.650
That was for 94 Blue Line cars.

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.240
Then we have Hyundai
Rotem, $2.3 million

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.240
per car-- these are
75 commuter rail cars,

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.590
rather than heavy rail cars.

00:42:55.590 --> 00:43:00.740
Breda, $2 million per car--
these are the Green Line

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.850
cars, 95 of them.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:08.450
And the last example are
locomotives for commuter rail,

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.710
$5.7 million per locomotive.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.950
So they cost more, but these
are not all passenger cars.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:22.510
These are the locomotives
for the commuter rail system.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.450
And for bus, so a
standard bus, a CNG bus,

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.350
the Compressed
Natural Gas, these

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.600
are, again, recent MBTA orders--

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.910
the generic cost, $300,000,
$350,000 about per bus.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:40.590
There was an order
to NABI, and it

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.640
was for 300 vehicles in 2004.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.920
And that was $320,000 per bus.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.590
Trolley, 40-foot trolley is
about $1 million per trolley.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:58.698
These are the sort of electric
Silver Line vehicles I think.

00:43:58.698 --> 00:44:00.410
I'm pretty sure.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:08.150
The articulated, 60-foot CNG
buses, 44 vehicles in 2003,

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.904
and the articulated,
dual-mode, 60-foot buses--

00:44:10.904 --> 00:44:13.070
this is Silver Line, the
one that runs in the tunnel

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.230
and goes out to the airport--

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.840
$1.6 million, 32 vehicles, 2004.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:19.340
Yeah.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.090
AUDIENCE: Maybe this
is already happening,

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.040
but is there any move
for different transport

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.940
organizations to
consolidate their designs

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.400
and like be able to reuse
vehicle design and bus design?

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:32.547
Like why are there separate
things for all cities?

00:44:32.547 --> 00:44:34.630
PROFESSOR: That's a good
question, but a lot of it

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.070
is cultural.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:39.820
There are-- so for
example, Green Line here

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.670
has sort of specific needs with
respect to like turning radius,

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:50.890
and they have a lot of steep
grades in some sections.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:54.430
They're also used to a
certain type of vehicle.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.570
So they're more
comfortable procuring

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.500
vehicles that are similar to
what they've had in the past.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.710
So there's some resistance to
trying something very new all

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.140
of a sudden.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:13.030
But there are some vehicles
that are very common, especially

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.610
in newer systems.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.407
And they tend to be
a little cheaper.

00:45:16.407 --> 00:45:19.120
So yeah, if you
can get big orders,

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.620
or if you're a small
system, and you

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:24.280
can partner with someone
else when they are procuring

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.320
to procure additional
vehicles-- instead

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.770
of you doing 10 yourself,
you add yourself

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:31.140
to an order of 100.

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:33.080
You get a lower price.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.430
So yeah?

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:35.930
AUDIENCE: But then
there's certainly

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.570
two examples of that in
streetcars, the most recent

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.470
one, which was when the Boston
and San Francisco bought

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.510
a similar design for
streetcars in the '70s,

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:46.730
and both got a crappy product.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:50.390
But 50 years before when the
PCC cars, the ones that still

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:52.910
run down in Mattapan, was a
sort of standardized streetcar

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.920
design over most of the country,
and that worked really well.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.420
So it has been done, but--

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:59.680
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
still is done, I think.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.320
Yeah, yeah.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.470
AUDIENCE: But each system, I
think, has so many [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.511
things.

00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:06.010
But when it comes
to buses, then you

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:09.851
do see the same types of
buses like in many systems.

00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:11.600
In Europe, you only
have like two or three

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.460
manufacturers that
make them all.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.330
In the US, as well.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.240
PROFESSOR: And big procurements,
not so much for bus,

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.070
but for rail, a lot
of big procurements

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.890
have rules requiring
local manufacturing.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:28.420
So yeah, you get a Chinese
company to do the latest--

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.490
where was that example--

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.355
CNR, right, but I'm pretty sure
that a lot of the manufacture

00:46:32.355 --> 00:46:36.270
is happening in
Massachusetts or close by.

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:43.940
So OK, typical capital
costs per passenger mile,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.940
so looking at a
range of examples,

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.810
it will cost [INAUDIBLE] going
anywhere from $0.05 to $0.10.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:51.726
So if you have--

00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:53.600
again, if you're doing
the napkin calculation

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:59.600
on a new system or new line,
you might think how many

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.980
passenger miles do I have.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.040
You could multiply by this to
figure out how much you could

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.900
expect to spend on vehicles.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.430
And for infrastructure, that
could range anywhere from $0.01

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.461
to $1 because there are so
many ways of doing this.

00:47:12.461 --> 00:47:12.960
Right?

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.126
It could be a subway.

00:47:14.126 --> 00:47:15.000
It could be at grade.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.980
It could be a bus.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.150
Or it could be rail.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:23.350
So it's very variable, and you
need to get into the specifics.

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:25.270
OK, now let's look
at operating costs.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.070
We've been talking
about capital costs.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.180
Let's look at operating costs.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:33.640
So in the US in 2013,
we spent $42.2 billion

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.330
across the industry.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:39.910
And if we divide that
by type, about 44%

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.600
was spent in vehicle
operations, and the rest of it

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.000
was more or less evenly
distributed between vehicle

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.250
maintenance, other
kinds of maintenance

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.970
like facility maintenance,
administration,

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.900
and purchased transportation.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.760
Purchased transportation is
when a public agency outsources

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.390
the operation of some mode.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:06.550
Most of this 14% is paratransit,
so on-demand transportation

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.900
for the handicapped
and other groups.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.120
Some of it is commuter rail.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.740
So for example, the MBTA
operates commuter rail

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.520
through a third party.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.530
All right, OK, by mode, about
half is spent on buses--

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:28.530
makes sense because there are
more bus systems and, even

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:31.140
in cities that have
rail, but the bus systems

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.800
are quite large, and
they cover a wide area--

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.030
about 20% on heavy
rail, 13% commuter rail,

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.880
and much less on light rail.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.050
Paratransit is about
12%, 3% for other modes.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:46.302
Other modes is things like
ferries and other modes not

00:48:46.302 --> 00:48:48.510
included in the traditional
bus, heavy rail, commuter

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.674
rail, light rail.

00:48:49.674 --> 00:48:58.050
So OK, and let's
look at vehicles--

00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.790
sorry, employees
per running vehicle.

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:02.550
So by mode, how many
employees would you

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:06.590
have to have to operate,
to run a system?

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.600
So paratransit, about
1.6 per vehicle--

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.210
obviously, you have one person
driving a paratransit vehicle.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.740
That person has an
eight-hour shift,

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.690
and you run that vehicle
for a longer time.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:20.350
So you need more
people than vehicles.

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.670
Bus tends to be higher
because bus systems tend

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.600
to start much earlier and
end service much later.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.990
And you also have maintenance
yards and refueling facilities.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.490
Right?

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.250
So you have bus stops to clean.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.090
So it's a more
intense operation.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:43.600
Commuter rail, 4.7-- you
have the people driving

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.410
the locomotives.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:48.690
You have the attendants
looking at tickets.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.960
You have rail to maintain
and stations to maintain.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.600
So that's commuter rail.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.490
Heavy rail is 5.5.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:59.470
Again, it starts
early, runs late.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.580
You have a lot of stations to
maintain, more so than commuter

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.020
rail, so 5.5.

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.370
Light rail is 6.8.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:14.340
Part of the recent light rail
is high is because many systems

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.310
have one driver per car.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:19.320
Or some systems, at least,
have one driver per car.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:21.490
So here in the Green
Line, we have that.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:21.990
Right?

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:25.940
So if you have a two-car
train, you have two drivers.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:29.280
And again, it starts service
early, ends service late.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.340
So you [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:35.160
You need multiple shifts
to run the whole day.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.380
And you have
maintenance of stations.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.290
Light rail stations [INAUDIBLE]
be shorter than heavy rail.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.880
So they have more
stations to take care of.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.990
And then there's maintenance,
vehicle maintenance

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:48.010
and facility maintenance.

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:52.450
[INAUDIBLE] is about three
employees per vehicle.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:58.245
OK, so comparing, these numbers
below are from a 1970 study

00:50:58.245 --> 00:50:59.670
on employees per vehicle.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.500
And it's a comparison
of bus and rail.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.540
So what's neat about the
comparison at the bottom

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:12.380
is that we are distributing
the costs of a vehicle

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:15.590
not only by mode, but also
by what type of expense.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:16.090
Right?

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:19.430
So at the top, we're
saying bus is this much.

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.660
Here we divide it by vehicle
operation i.e. driving,

00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.460
vehicle maintenance,
management and control,

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.400
fare collection,
way maintenance,

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.170
and then you have
the total number.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.530
So it is from an earlier study.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:37.430
But for vehicle maintenance,
it's more or less the same

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:39.650
on a unit cost basis.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:45.020
For bus, this is per car,
and that's per vehicle.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:51.190
So you have about 2.2 drivers
per bus for bus systems,

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:55.460
about 1 for rail systems.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.760
This is driving, but
also other things.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.200
Management and control
is about the same.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:06.180
And then the driver takes care
of fare collection on bus.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.790
But in rail, you
have people that

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:11.460
have to sort of be station
attendants and help people out.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:16.806
You might have an office where
people can complain about their

00:52:16.806 --> 00:52:18.680
needing a rebate because
their machine didn't

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.430
work or something.

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.760
They lost value on
their fare card.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.220
So way maintenance
is more expensive,

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.070
whereas way maintenance
on buses on the streets,

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:31.280
that's not even included in the
cost for running bus systems

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.360
because that's--

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.380
the Public Works Department
takes care of that.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:38.300
So overall, it's higher
for rail than bus.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.380
But you have some--

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.380
yeah, so you do have a
higher productivity for metro

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.860
if you measure it in passenger
miles per revenue vehicle hour.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:52.640
Yeah, so if you
have any questions,

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.900
I'll take them, questions on
the homework or on this lecture

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.360
or on the previous lectures.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.866
And if you don't have
questions, you may leave.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:07.146
AUDIENCE: Is that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:07.146 --> 00:53:08.770
PROFESSOR: You were
first, yeah, Scott.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:12.346
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] on slide
18 looking at capital cost

00:53:12.346 --> 00:53:17.004
over passenger mile, do you need
to pick a time period in order

00:53:17.004 --> 00:53:18.620
to make that calculation.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.060
PROFESSOR: This is very general.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:24.020
So this is sort of high level,
looking at the whole industry

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:29.010
and looking at like
capital projects.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.760
So you know, if you look
at how much it costs

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.160
to build a new line, a new
light rail line in some city,

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.860
and then you see how many
people are taking it--

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.120
so we have passenger miles.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.550
So you divide the total cost by
that, and that's what you get.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:47.320
You have a question.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:57.290
AUDIENCE: Yes, so regarding the
homework assignment, we are--

00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:00.540
basically, we should do the
assignment and maybe comment

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.730
on, but assume that
we don't know--

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.240
we won't have like the--

00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.596
what am I trying to say?

00:54:07.596 --> 00:54:09.470
It seemed like there
was a lot of information

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.090
that you have already
asked if people

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.225
who are taking the train
the one stop that we are.

00:54:13.225 --> 00:54:13.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.010
AUDIENCE: So we just assume
[INAUDIBLE] covered in the data

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.740
collection and assume
that that data exists,

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.823
but that we don't have it.

00:54:18.823 --> 00:54:19.960
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.840
So there are people who--

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.190
I think what you're
referring to is

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:29.120
there are people
who are going to MIT

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.550
who get off at Central Square
and transfer to the Red Line,

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:34.592
right, and go to Kendall.

00:54:34.592 --> 00:54:36.425
AUDIENCE: Yeah, especially
the Kendall area.

00:54:36.425 --> 00:54:38.060
PROFESSOR: Right,
now how many of those

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:41.870
would continue on the bus
rather than switch anyway?

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.170
I'm not sure.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.500
So there is a
judgment call there.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.735
But yeah, we're focusing
on the people that

00:54:50.735 --> 00:54:52.860
for sure would stay on the bus.

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.360
They're not
transferring to Kendall.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.460
So they're going somewhere
else in that area

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.650
before reaching
Kendall possibly,

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:02.710
right, or almost surely.

00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.720
And those are the people
that would definitely

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.920
stay on the bus.

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:07.150
AUDIENCE: That we talked to.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:08.691
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
yeah, exactly, which

00:55:08.691 --> 00:55:10.040
is why we picked that bus stop.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.570
But I think it's very likely
that, in a future assignment,

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.910
I will give you data on the
people who are transferring

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.920
to the Central Square Red Line.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.700
And therefore, you'll
have the whole picture

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.900
of from your survey
and from the ODX data,

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.960
yeah, AFC data from Red Line.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:32.626
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:55:35.614 --> 00:55:38.520
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:40.670
All right, goodbye.
