GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Great.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.970
OK.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.660
So today's lecture is on
transit service reliability.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.577
This is my penultimate
lecture, because we

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:31.660
have guest lecturers, too.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.250
So let's start out with what
is reliable transit for you.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.430
What do you think of when you
think of reliable transit?

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.600
What does it mean for you?

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.554
And I'll write a few
videos on the board.

00:00:48.554 --> 00:00:51.928
[CHALK ON BLACKBOARD]

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.432
AUDIENCE: Arrival at or
close to scheduled arrival.

00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:04.819
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.110
Low variance, OK, of--

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.830
there's a word for that.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.490
Punctuality, right?

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.375
So let's use that.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.187
Just because it's hard to
write on the board with chalk.

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:22.020
It's hard to spell
correctly, actually, when

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.680
you're close up to the board.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.180
Emily.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.180
AUDIENCE: Lack of disruption.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.760
So it's the same
service every weekday.

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:41.610
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: And
you kind of got two of them.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.450
Lack of disruptions
is one of them

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.540
and you said the
same service, right?

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.419
So I guess predictability.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.145
Great.

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:57.780
AUDIENCE: The word
legibility, which

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.550
is that you sort of know
where transit is going

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.345
and it makes sense.

00:02:01.345 --> 00:02:03.470
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You called it legibility?

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.280
AUDIENCE: Legibility.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.488
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:08.330
That's coining a new term there.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.840
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.220
It's coining a new term.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.450
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You had one.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.672
AUDIENCE: Oh, not in the US.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:20.172
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:21.796
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:24.955 --> 00:02:26.850
I appreciate the humor, though.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.010
Any other ideas?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.680
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
quality of the ride

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.285
is always the same,
like tables are clean.

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:36.160
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Consistent quality.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.784
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.635
It's always possible
to enter the car.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.110
Surrounding is consistent.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.026
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Sufficient capacity.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.559
Actually.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.890
AUDIENCE: I think it also
has to cover all the places

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.305
you want to go in like a 90--

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.430
some kind of percentile of
what you want to travel,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.540
so you're not getting a car
[INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.790
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yep.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:16.000
And so that includes [INAUDIBLE]
coverage, which is spatial,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.200
and also span of service,
right, which is the same thing

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.282
but temporal.

00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:26.752
[WRITING ON BOARD]

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.740
OK, these are some good ideas.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.010
AUDIENCE: I have a real--

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.420
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sorry?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.045
AUDIENCE: I said I
have a real one now.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.132
Consistent fare structure or--

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:47.340
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.030
That's usually consistent.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.870
Are you thinking of
a particular example?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.200
AUDIENCE: I think of
just when places where

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.620
the price keeps rising often.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.500
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.670
I'll say-- I don't know.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] transfers
[INAUDIBLE] confusing.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.903
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Good communication

00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:11.135
of fare policy, so
a clear fare policy.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:11.760
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.239
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.100
Eli.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.725
AUDIENCE: I feel like
we haven't worked

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:27.589
in maintenance of headways and
high-frequency service in here.

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:28.880
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.280
AUDIENCE: It's kind of
covered by punctuality

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.040
and predictability--

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.140
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.306
But it's a little different.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.550
And we're going to talk
a lot about that today.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.320
So let's add that in.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.916
So even headways?

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.570
You wouldn't say short headways.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.910
That's not necessarily
part of the liability.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.076
AUDIENCE: Well, it seems
like we're sort of actually

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:50.410
expanding the traditional
definition for liability here.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.284
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, we have been.

00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:55.000
I'm not filtering too
much out because--

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.940
I guess we'll stop here.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.620
The point I wanted
to make is that--

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.570
I'll come back to
this in lecture--

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.480
reliability means a lot of
things to different people.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.390
And doing all these
things can be difficult.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.170
So we're going to talk
about some aspects.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.740
We're going to focus
more on punctuality, lack

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.540
of disruptions, predictability.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.200
We'll talk about common
equality in system.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.435
That has to do
with even headways.

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:28.060
We're not going to talk so much
about fair policy, or coverage,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.170
or span of service,
or legibility.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.920
All right.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.230
So right.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.580
So impacts of
unreliability, the causes

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.340
of unreliability, how
to measure unreliability

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.800
or reliability, and then
real-time control strategies.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.530
We've mentioned some
of these topics before.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.030
Now let's focus on these things.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.474
OK, so passenger impacts.

00:05:51.474 --> 00:05:53.140
What happens when
service is unreliable?

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.910
We have longer
waiting times, right?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.780
We have the need to have a
longer reliability buffer.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.470
So have we talked about
reliability buffer

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.620
before in this course?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.880
No?

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.044
So if your trip to--

00:06:14.044 --> 00:06:16.460
we're going to talk more about
it later than we will here.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.074
But if your trip to--

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:23.002
[WRITING ON BOARD]

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.090
OK, so you know that running
times are stochastic, right?

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.710
So there's a distribution
of running times.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.155
So this is running time,
or in this case let's

00:06:41.155 --> 00:06:42.220
call it journey time.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:55.190
And this is a probability
[INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.610
So the schedule has to have
a single intrinsic value.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.520
And you can go to
your journey planner,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.490
and it will say your
journey takes this long.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.170
You walk this much time,
you wait this much time,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.200
you arrive at this time.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.360
So you add those components up
and you have a specific time.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.110
That specific time may be close
to the median, and may not.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.130
So if service is
reliable, then there's

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.790
little variance in this
distribution, correct?

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.860
So you might have--

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.800
I don't have much of
another color here.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.820
That doesn't work.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.710
So I'll just write
on white as well.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:34.410
Maybe a dot.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.190
So you might have one
distribution of journeys

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.375
that has lower variance.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.480
And therefore you need to budget
less time to make your trip

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.740
and arrive on time.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.850
Correct?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.040
So to the extent
that the waiting is

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.210
variable or your in-vehicle
time is variable, then

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:04.950
if you need to be at work
or at school at 9:00 AM,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.790
that means that, even if on
average it takes half an hour,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.160
you might have to
budget for 45 minutes.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.530
So the extra 15 minutes of time
that you budget, that's called

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.920
the reliability buffer.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.100
It's a cost.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.060
You could monetize
it if you wanted to.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.700
It means that people are
budgeting, and in some cases

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.740
wasting, that time.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.450
And we want to decrease that.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.440
So the need for trip
time reliability buffer.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.520
Higher loads.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.909
So that means, of
course, that vehicles

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.020
have more people in
them, and therefore rides

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.870
are more uncomfortable
for passengers.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.090
And they are also slower,
because if a vehicle has

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.150
more people in it, the
bus stops more often

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.202
and the process is slower.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:47.660
We know that from
earlier lectures.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.350
We know from random incidents
that from a passenger

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.570
perspective, passengers
will experience

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.620
more crowded
vehicles because they

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.290
are more likely to
board the vehicle

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.232
where there are
more people in it.

00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:11.190
It's a little bit of a
chicken and egg problem.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.730
So even if, on average
across the vehicles,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.200
your loads are right
where they should be,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.810
most people are going to be
on the more crowded vehicles.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.150
So that's that thing.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.590
In terms of agency impacts
can increase costs, making,

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.150
for example, you need a longer
recovery time at the terminal.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.460
And therefore, you know
that that translates

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:38.610
to higher vehicle costs, higher
crew costs, reduced ridership

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.120
and revenue, reduced
operator morale, a public

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.570
and political problem.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.225
What do we mean by that?

00:09:46.225 --> 00:09:47.850
What happens when
public transportation

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.870
is unreliable in
terms of politics?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.680
AUDIENCE: The public hates it.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.050
Public hates unreliability.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.341
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:59.000
AUDIENCE: It creates pressure.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.459
The forces against public
transportation grows stronger.

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:03.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sure.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.070
So--

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
funding, and then--

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah,
so there's a funding, right?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.990
And we'll talk more about
this in the last two lectures.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.570
So when public
transportation is unreliable,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.180
sometimes governments
are hesitant,

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.740
or the public may be
hesitant, to fund it more

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.350
before they fix the problems.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.830
But fixing the problems
might require some resources.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.250
So it's a vicious cycle.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.340
And then reduced
effective capacity.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.010
And we'll show a real example
here in Boston of that.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.060
All right.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.350
So what causes this?

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.870
We can divide causes into
external and internal causes.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.130
External causes.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.210
Traffic, demand-- demand
variability in particular--

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:43.810
incidents.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.300
So a passenger may get sick.

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.400
These things are external.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.160
The agency knows that
they could happen,

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.280
but there's not much
you can do about them.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.100
Internal causes are in
the control of the agency,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.520
at least a little more.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.954
So equipment failure, that's
something that agency owns.

00:11:01.954 --> 00:11:04.120
Maybe you can't predict
exactly when it will happen,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.830
but with some
preventive maintenance

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.300
they could reduce the
chance of this happening.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.240
Insufficient resources,
poor operations planning,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.370
lack of supervision and control,
and human driver behavior.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.580
What do I mean by
human driver behavior?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.165
How does that cause
unreliability?

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:27.020
Henry.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.620
AUDIENCE: The way that
a driver drives can vary

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.930
and that affects runtime.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.140
Or maybe some are more
aggressive and some are less.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.570
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.550
Some drivers are slow,
some drivers are fast.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.633
And then if you're running
high-frequency service,

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:40.390
they'll bunch up.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.230
And that could be the
cause of bunching.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:48.272
Or maybe that fast driver is
now running early, rolling

00:11:48.272 --> 00:11:49.480
a long headway service early.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.000
And that's really bad for
waiting time, as we'll see.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.850
So if we think about
transit, and look

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.410
at the whole process of
planning it and delivering it

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.977
as if it were a
business process,

00:12:00.977 --> 00:12:02.810
we know that we start
with service planning,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.210
and move on to
operations planning,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.430
and then actual operations.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.310
And each of these
things, the output of one

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.760
is the input to the next
process, and so forth.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.460
The input to service
policy, among them are

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.530
is demand estimation.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.810
Then we bring in analysis of
models or vehicle scheduling

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.080
and crew scheduling.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.090
And during operations
there's service control.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.090
We'll talk about service
control, real-time control,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.000
too, as an input to operations,
to make them more reliable.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.890
So there's also a feedback
loop, because passengers

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.040
might complain or somehow
you have data collecting

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.280
information on performance.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.600
And you can take that back to
service planning or operations

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.360
planning, or you could
modify your service control

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.120
to change the cycle.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.510
And here we have the key
agents in each of these steps.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.910
So transit agency
management, mostly

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.740
taking care of service policy.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.110
Then you have some
operational planning stuff,

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.300
taking care of
operations planning.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.650
And then the actual drivers and
inspectors out in the field.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.520
So I guess one
thing to take away

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.360
from this is that there are
many decisions across all

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.610
of this process that
affect reliability.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.550
And you can't really have
reliable service if you--

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.170
there's many places
where you could--

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.850
a cause on reliability.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.650
One of them might be
your vehicles break down.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.500
So no matter what
you do, if your fleet

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.530
is old and having
difficulty with maintenance,

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.570
you might have the
best service control

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.930
policies, and all the
supervision in the world,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.950
and you still have
unreliable service.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.060
So it's a hard problem.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.830
It used to be very
hard, actually,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:50.870
because, well, to
ensure reliability you

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.160
need to ensure the
variability and things.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.980
So you know from data
collection that if you

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.920
want to measure the mean, you
can calculate your sample size.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.540
Measuring the
variance of something

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.600
requires an even greater
data collection effort.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.670
So things have gotten a
lot easier with technology.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.400
And so we know that we have
several data collection

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.060
systems--

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.740
AVL, AFC, APC.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.640
That makes it a lot easier and
cheaper to measure reliability.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.950
We'll give some examples.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.020
Then we have scheduling
systems, which

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.450
make it very easy to make an
adjustment in the schedule.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.460
If we see that we've not
scheduled enough time

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.070
for this bus, we need
to add some recovery

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.270
time, that's going to increase
the fleet size by one.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.330
With a program or
scheduling software,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.330
you can do that
quickly and react.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.270
And the best systems will
actually read AVL data in,

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.510
and you don't even have
to manually analyze it.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.610
You can sort of use the
program to analyze it.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.220
And the same program
will help you schedule.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.800
And then there's improved
communications technology,

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.650
which makes it easy to
communicate instructions.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.760
Hey, depart a little
later from this stop,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.100
or from this terminal.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.040
Don't, you know, start
running without passengers.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.960
And start operating in
revenue service three

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.550
stops down because
we have a long gap.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.834
So you may have heard, you
can't really have control--

00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:26.500
there are so many
ways of saying things,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.330
but you can't really do
something about something

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.380
until you measure it.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.140
So measuring it is important.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.870
We'll talk a little
bit about reliability

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.247
as a performance metric.

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:38.330
And there are different
key performance indicators

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.967
you can calculate
for reliability,

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:41.050
and that's the first step.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.508
You want to measure
it and you want

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.500
to be able to track
your reliability

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.360
for particular routes
or system wide,

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.240
and then be able to change a
policy, see what the effect is.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.290
So one thing about
it is it's not

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.450
the only thing that matters.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.770
Reliability is important.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.050
It would be a mistake
not to measure it.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.570
Because you might have a
very productive service,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.980
but you might have all of these
problems that we identified.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.820
On the other hand, if you put
too much focus on reliability,

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.340
then it would come at a cost.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.910
If you want to make your
schedule very reliable,

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.150
then you can add a
lot of recovery time.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.752
And you could add
many timing points

00:16:20.752 --> 00:16:22.210
and make the buses
hold everywhere,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.550
and that would
slow service down.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.130
It would increase journey times.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:28.900
Even if they would
be very predictable,

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.140
they would be very long, and
that could deteriorate service.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.670
So we make a distinction between
reliability on low frequency

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.624
service and reliability
on high frequency service.

00:16:41.624 --> 00:16:42.540
What's the difference?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.120
We've talked about
the waiting strategies

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.830
for low and high frequency.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:54.310
We've talked about it
several times before.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.224
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:57.640
What's the difference between
a service that runs every 20

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.200
minutes and a service that runs
every five minutes with regards

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.660
to your strategy to
take that service?

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.970
AUDIENCE: It's more frequent
and you can just walk up.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:09.350
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, so high frequency service

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.141
is walk-up service.

00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:11.690
AUDIENCE: No random arrivals.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:11.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.540
The arrivals tend to be random.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.430
They don't actually have
to be for this distinction

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.260
to be valid.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.329
They have to be independent
of the vehicle arrivals.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.569
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:24.310
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.400
Yes, we'll mention that.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.960
So with low frequency
service, most people

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.520
will time their arrival
at stops so that they

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.260
are with the schedule.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.500
So if vehicles are
arriving on schedule,

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.170
and passengers are
arriving on schedule,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.680
people wait very little time.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.980
And if there's very little
variability in that,

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.780
if service is
incredibly punctual,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.950
people would show up the minute
before and wait almost nothing.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.530
If there's some
variability, then people

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.720
have to add some
reliability buffer time.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.760
So even though it says
it's going to come at 3:53,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.160
you might have to
get there at 3:50.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.630
OK.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.730
So you then can set--

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.730
because you want to measure
reliability, people--

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.040
especially in the US, we call
that on-time performance,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.200
which is a long way
of saying punctuality.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.280
You could have different
wait threshold windows.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.060
And we've talked about
performance measurement before.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.940
We're just here, so we're
going back to specifically

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.780
reliability.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.270
One way would be to
say, any bus that

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.940
departs this stop between one
minute early and five minutes

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.120
late is on time.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.950
And any bus outside of
that window is not on time.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.570
And then you say,
I am 90% reliable.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.094
This bus leaves that stop 90%
of the time within that window.

00:18:41.094 --> 00:18:42.760
And then you could
have tighter windows.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.430
You could say, not early and
up to three minutes late,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.980
or not early and up
to one minute late.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.450
Of course what happens--

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.047
well, let's start
with the first one.

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:53.380
What's wrong with the first one?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.730
What's different
about the first one?

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.620
You allow early departures.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.750
What's bad about early
departures when you

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.200
have a long headway service?

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.700
AUDIENCE: People
aren't expecting it

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.020
and they miss their bus.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.280
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.850
So if people are really timing
their arrival at the stops

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:16.680
according to the schedule, and
it's 20-minute headway service,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.710
bus leaves early.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.057
You arrived a minute early.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.390
Now you have to wait 20 minutes.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.960
It's really bad.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.760
Really bad.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.790
This thing is a little--

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.040
real-time apps help with this,
but not everyone has one.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.450
And if service tends
to be reliable,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:37.500
and every now and then it isn't,
then people might still have--

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.580
they're trying to show
up to work on time.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.370
So there's not much the
app can do unless there's

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.862
a good warning ahead
of time, this bus

00:19:45.862 --> 00:19:46.820
is going to come early.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.580
You'd better be there.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.660
So you have to
rush to get ready.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.030
OK.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.110
So it's good to not
allow early departures.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.940
What happens when
you move to tighter

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:04.220
bounds on the late side?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.620
Two things happen.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.820
AUDIENCE: Harder to meet it.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.861
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So it's harder to meet.

00:20:08.861 --> 00:20:11.320
And that means that your
reported reliability

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.860
comes down.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.490
So you can imagine, internally,
a pressure on the agency

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.160
to have a little more
slack, to say that you

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.930
have higher reliability.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.060
What happens in
terms of performance,

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.671
or in terms of waiting time,
benefit for the passenger?

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:35.710
If the agency actually has a
holding policy that prevents

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:37.374
a bus from departing late--

00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:39.790
more than five minutes late,
more than three minutes late,

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.840
more than one minute late--

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.923
from a stop in the middle
of the route with people

00:20:42.923 --> 00:20:45.460
inside of it, what happens is
you move to tighter windows.

00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:48.810
AUDIENCE: The
driver will be less

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.161
lenient in holding the bus
for people running after it?

00:20:52.161 --> 00:20:54.160
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Especially if you're--

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.110
right, tighter window on the
early side, more holding.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.440
AUDIENCE: Like, sorry,
we've got to go.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.731
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.800
So how do you make
the bus not be late?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.011
What's the strategy for that?

00:21:07.011 --> 00:21:08.937
AUDIENCE: You schedule in more--

00:21:08.937 --> 00:21:11.270
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: You
don't schedule for median.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.090
You schedule for a
higher percentile.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.570
So now it's easy, piece of cake.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.760
You schedule it for 80
percentile, only 20%

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.770
of the time will you be--

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.880
OK, but what happens?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.910
That means that 80% of the
time you're arriving early,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.220
so you have to hold.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.610
So as you make that
window tighter,

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.370
it means that you're
probably going to be

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.054
setting your percentile higher.

00:21:33.054 --> 00:21:34.970
And it means that you'll
be holding more often

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.110
and slowing service down.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.620
And holding is very
frustrating for passengers.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.100
So you shouldn't hold
always and for a long time.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.910
And in general, I guess
one other comment is

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:55.010
like any kind of window,
especially on the later side,

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.415
the benefits of going from
five to three to one minutes

00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:59.290
are going to be marginal
in terms of waiting.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.160
And they can be
substantial in terms

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.690
of how often you'll
have to hold it

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.297
and how slow the
service will be.

00:22:04.297 --> 00:22:05.130
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.830
Why is holding more
often if you're--

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.720
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: If
you have a tighter window.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.670
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So
if you have a tighter window--

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.280
if your vehicle must depart
between zero minutes early

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.010
and one minute late, it's
a very tight window, right?

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.370
So how can you guarantee
that that vehicle departs

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.580
that stop in the window?

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:32.560
You have to schedule it such
that it almost always arrives--

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.200
you have to allow a lot
of time on the schedule

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.620
so that almost
always it can arrive,

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.420
and it's not arriving
one minute late.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:44.603
AUDIENCE: Ah, all right.

00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:45.230
[INAUDIBLE] time.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.730
So you're--

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.020
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.270
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So you control the late side

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.020
by scheduling more time.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.660
And then what happens
on the early side?

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.610
On the early side, if
you arrive early, you--

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.670
AUDIENCE: You just sit there.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.730
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You have to sit there.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.330
OK.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:05.824
So in long headway service,
or low frequency service,

00:23:05.824 --> 00:23:08.240
there is a little interaction
between successive vehicles,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.359
so bunching is not
a normal thing.

00:23:12.359 --> 00:23:14.900
So we'll talk about bunching in
the context of high frequency

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.280
service.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.100
And then, of course, real time
information is changing this.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.060
So now you have an app.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.240
And your app, as you're doing
your breakfast, phone vibrates

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.840
and says, here's the time.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.100
Here's my predicted time.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.760
So you rush.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.710
Maybe you'll skip something
on breakfast or you'll--

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.290
I don't know.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.840
So that is very
poorly understood

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.880
from a research standpoint.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.830
We don't really know how
exactly that happens,

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:51.770
what percentage of people are
actually changing when they

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.280
would arrive based on the app.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.740
And we don't really know
what the implications are.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.470
Because you can't just say--

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.075
imagine if everybody had an app,
and everybody used that app.

00:24:05.075 --> 00:24:07.640
And you're running
20-minute headway service.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.430
Now you say, well,
everybody is going

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.110
to show up to time the
arrival at the stop.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:14.930
So let's not worry at
all about reliability.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.870
It doesn't matter when vehicles
come because people know

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.880
and they time their arrivals.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.950
So now we can speed up service.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.640
But there is some sense
of convenience of knowing

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.920
that it runs every 20 minutes.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.240
The availability of
service every 20 minutes

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.050
is a factor that wouldn't be
considered if you did that.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.380
So in some way, it
is still important

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.480
even if people can time
their arrival at stops,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.380
to keep service as scheduled
when it's long headway.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.420
And we don't really--

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:48.420
how do you measure that?

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.490
How you quantify that
convenience, that coverage?

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.560
All questions for researchers.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.510
AUDIENCE: So is there--

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:03.950
for this time window, is
there a defined threshold

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:09.790
to define something that
is a very tight time frame?

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.480
Like median, long, and
tight time frame for this?

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.330
And when does it matter?

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.590
Because obviously, tight is
different in the mornings

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.355
when you have [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:27.380
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: This
is-- that decisions are up

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.070
to the agency?

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.070
AUDIENCE: It's up to the agency.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.630
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.171
And usually there's
a trade-off where

00:25:31.171 --> 00:25:33.850
you want to set a goal
that is attainable.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.440
You don't want to be
reporting 30% reliability.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.370
So it's a bar that moves
according to the abilities

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.750
of the agency, usually.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.027
That's what happens in practice.

00:25:45.027 --> 00:25:47.360
If there are no more questions
on low frequency service,

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.210
let's move to high
frequency service.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.342
A little more interesting.

00:25:50.342 --> 00:25:51.300
Do you have a question?

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:51.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.060
What's the cut off there
between high frequency

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.990
and low frequency?

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.656
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Good question.

00:25:55.656 --> 00:25:56.570
So what do you think?

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.240
That is a good point.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.870
He said it depends
which country you're in.

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.240
That's a very
legitimate observation.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.880
So it's not just US and non-US.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.380
It's--

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.392
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:14.392 --> 00:26:15.350
AUDIENCE: Urban, rural.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:16.520
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Here in the US,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.530
here in Boston, what
would you consider

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.372
to be high frequency service?

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:23.830
AUDIENCE: Up to
10-minute headways.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.290
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
10 minutes?

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.414
AUDIENCE: Up to 10 minutes.

00:26:25.414 --> 00:26:27.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, certainly
not more than that.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.420
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
If it's 12 minutes,

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.675
do you look at the schedule?

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:30.883
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:26:30.883 --> 00:26:33.020
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:33.530
All right.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] divides
it as 15 and [INAUDIBLE]

GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So
yeah, some agencies say 15.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.120
In London, I think it's 12.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.530
I think that's the cutoff.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.970
Now, if you go to
Chile and you say

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.530
that you're running
10 minute, they

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.970
think of that as long
headway service-- very long.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.230
Because they have buses
that run every minute.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:03.500
So that's high frequency, and
seven minutes is low frequency.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.500
So that's a
distinction, at least

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.110
from an operational standpoint,
that people make differently

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.870
in every country.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.260
But in terms of
waiting time strategy,

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:17.000
I think it still holds that it's
somewhere between 10 and 15.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.770
Maybe between 8 and 15.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.000
We don't know.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.360
Obviously, there's a continuum.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.520
It's not like everybody switches
at exactly some threshold.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.090
It depends on the person, and
what technology they have,

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.930
and what service they're taking.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.710
Between those 8 and 15
minutes, or even 12 minutes,

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.890
there's going to be a transition
from one strategy to the other.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:39.410
And you know that when you're
well in the high frequency

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:43.610
zone, your models of random,
or at least independent,

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.250
arrivals of passengers
at stops hold.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:51.530
Whereas as you move towards 15
and longer, they stop holding

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.780
and you shouldn't be measuring
waiting time like this.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.070
AUDIENCE: I was asking
that because, even

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.260
with 10 minutes, which is
considered high frequency,

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.546
I still want to schedule
myself for when I'm

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:01.755
going to get to the bus stop.

00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:04.045
I'm not just like, oh, let
me just walk to the bus stop

00:28:04.045 --> 00:28:04.900
and I'll wait.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.358
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So for 10

00:28:06.358 --> 00:28:08.970
minutes, do you actually
consult the schedule?

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.230
AUDIENCE: Well, I consult
the app for 10 minutes.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.730
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
But do you

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.940
plan to take the 9:10 train?

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:21.560
Or-- you see, there's a
distinction, like the day

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.510
before, you know I'm
going to take the 9:10

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.300
AUDIENCE: If they were running
clock-based, consistent

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:25.900
10-minute headways,
then I would.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Then you would show up.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:27.410
Yeah.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:28.099
But they're not.

00:28:28.099 --> 00:28:29.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So for you,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.220
10 is right there on the fence
between the two, it seems.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.340
More on the scheduled side,
on the high frequency side,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.210
perhaps.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.108
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.030
But let's say that
it's five minutes.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.940
So now we're clear
on that vague area.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.820
So now you're in a zone
where most people will

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.202
time their arrivals at
stops-- sorry, will not

00:28:53.202 --> 00:28:54.410
time their arrivals at stops.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.240
They will show up
when convenient.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.929
And they expect to wait
about half of the headway.

00:28:58.929 --> 00:29:00.720
You know that if the
headways are variable,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.200
you're going to have that
waiting time increasing.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.930
So there's going to be a
reliability buffer time

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.555
calculation that you can do.

00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:10.850
And it's going to be the
coefficient variation

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.500
of headway, will sort of affect.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.190
That's the factor that sort of
increases the expected waiting

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.690
time.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.390
Punctuality is not as
critical for the passengers.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.710
They don't really
care if every train

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.966
is five minutes
late, as long as they

00:29:27.966 --> 00:29:29.090
come in every five minutes.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.360
It doesn't really matter that
they're all five minutes late.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.250
So really, what
matters for a passenger

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.560
is bunching and long gaps.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.720
We've talked about that before.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.720
We know that in high
frequency service,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.740
there is a lot of
vehicle interaction.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.720
We can maybe review it quickly.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.860
Think of this as a bus route.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.430
And here's a vehicle.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.960
Each of these are vehicles.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.480
And there's a random
arrival process.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.950
Passengers are arriving
randomly at the different stops.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:16.330
So what happens when vehicles
are not evenly spaced in time,

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.840
not in space.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.990
So what happens when
they're not evenly spaced?

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:23.810
AUDIENCE: The one that's close
to the next one picks up less?

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:27.550
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, so this vehicle

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.760
has a smaller gap ahead of it.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.800
And therefore, because
people are arriving

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.520
at some rate, in that
time, for that rate,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.370
fewer passengers will
be taking this bus.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:42.910
And that means that
real times are shorter.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.490
Vehicle catches up.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.920
So now you have a bunch.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.340
Eventually this vehicle
will catch up to this one.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.790
If this vehicle,
the one ahead of it,

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.150
has a long headway ahead of
it, the opposite happens.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.480
More people than average
arrive, and then that vehicle

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.970
has many more people in it.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.340
The loads increase.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.420
It slows down.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.395
So those two effects work
together to create bunching.

00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:07.700
And we've talked about that.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.375
And with bunching, the
counterpart is long gaps.

00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:13.250
You usually have a bunch
and then a long gap.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.110
Or a long gap preceding a bunch.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.130
So you'll hear
passengers complaining,

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.190
I've been waiting 15 minutes,
and now three buses arrive,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.320
as if that were ironic.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.231
But that's actually
exactly why it happens.

00:31:29.231 --> 00:31:31.730
AUDIENCE: So what's the best
strategy to deal with bunching?

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:34.063
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
We'll talk about many of them.

00:31:34.063 --> 00:31:35.180
Yeah.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.900
OK, so one observation is
that some high frequency

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.520
routes have branches.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.950
So they're only high
frequency in the trunk,

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.760
and the individual branches
are actually long headway.

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.120
And there, you have to
run scheduled service

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:52.930
on the branches.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.790
And then you have
to, I guess, try

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.160
to run scheduled
service on the trunk.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.870
There might be some
hybrid strategies,

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.750
but that's still the
subject of research.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.030
And of course, schedule
control is much easier

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.040
than headway control.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.584
You can do it
without technology.

00:32:07.584 --> 00:32:09.250
You can print a
schedule, and the driver

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.630
can have the schedule
in the vehicle.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.590
And you can tell drivers,
don't leave early.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:17.390
And if they follow instructions,
they won't leave early.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.580
So if you want to
control headways,

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.200
and you want to keep the
vehicles evenly spaced,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.460
now you need all this
technology infrastructure

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.580
to detect where vehicles
are, to predict the running

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:33.160
times between them, and to
communicate instructions

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.060
to those vehicles so that
the headways can be adjusted.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.920
Here's a little
reliability buffer time.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.350
So let's talk about how
to actually calculate it

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.240
in a high frequency,
closed fare system.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.540
So think of the London Tube.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.010
You tap in the station, and
then you tap out when you leave.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:59.170
So you can measure the
probability distribution

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.320
of travel time, or of journey
time, from tap-in time

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.270
to tap-out time.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.870
And we define the
reliability buffer time

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.405
as the difference between
the 95th percentile

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.180
and the 50th percentile
of that journey time.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.530
So again, if this distribution
were much narrower,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:23.140
then people would not have to
budget that difference as they

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:27.220
plan to make a trip, to arrive
at a certain time at work

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:27.720
or school.

00:33:32.922 --> 00:33:34.380
Something interesting
about this is

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.640
that London has somewhat
recently started

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.350
refunding fares if
people's journeys exceed

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:45.990
30 minutes of the expected.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:50.550
So they're not doing it
by percentile, but they--

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.860
so here's an application
in fare policy,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.770
which is not the
most obvious one.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.370
But you can certainly
measure this reliability

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.160
of buffer time.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.040
Yes, question.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.400
AUDIENCE: Do you know
how much it costs them?

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.608
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: No.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.330
I don't think much.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.170
Well, it is a lot in total.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.239
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.989
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I don't remember

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.150
what percent of passengers.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.560
I think the percent
is quite low,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.820
except if there's a big
disruption it might be high.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.100
But because of the sheer
size of the network,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.659
I'm sure that that adds up, too.

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:21.159
Yeah.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.449
AUDIENCE: It's a good
marketing strategy.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:24.100
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.050
AUDIENCE: Builds confidence.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.300
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
London, they

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.550
don't talk so much passengers.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.940
They talk about their customers.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.770
And they want to have
customer service.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:36.897
And so they like to have
that internal mentality.

00:34:36.897 --> 00:34:39.230
AUDIENCE: Well, how do they
know someone wasn't dwelling

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.540
at a station as a passenger?

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.340
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Because they

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.690
can look at other people
doing that same trip.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.969
So if somebody
wants to hang out,

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.469
they're not going
to get a free trip

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:52.835
just because they wanted to.

00:34:52.835 --> 00:34:53.960
AUDIENCE: It's interesting.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.000
In the daily metro,
to prevent crowding,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.710
if you spend too much
time in the system,

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:00.694
they actually give you a
penalty when you tap out.

00:35:00.694 --> 00:35:02.360
And so some of the
journeys are so long,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.680
people actually have
to rush to get out,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.120
or else they suffer
a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.286
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Not very good reliability.

00:35:07.286 --> 00:35:09.730
We can add that to the list.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:10.290
Yeah.

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:13.730
AUDIENCE: How do they determine
the expected journey time?

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.495
Is it median--

00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:16.370
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
They look at this--

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.160
so they measure this.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.790
And I'll show you
the next slide.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.290
Before we move on
to the next slide,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.110
any other questions on this one?

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.270
I saw several hands raised.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.910
OK.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.440
So they look at good
days and bad days,

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.670
to answer your question.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.910
So they pick some
baseline of days

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.540
that have no major disruptions,
service is running well.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.360
It's the amount
that they expect.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.650
And then they'll measure
reliability buffer time

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.300
on those days.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.730
So that is an
amount that they say

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:53.660
is sort of inherent
to the operation

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.660
and not much under their
control, unless they invest

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:01.220
in better signaling systems
or things like this.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.550
Anything in excess of
that, if you look at,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:08.330
now, all days together,
will be something

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.320
that they could have avoided.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.400
That's the idea.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:15.170
This distinction between
the baseline buffer time

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.060
and the access buffer time.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:21.290
So if that x as buffer
time exceeds some amount,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:25.940
you can then say, well,
we have a problem.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.060
Passengers were taking much
longer than we scheduled for,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.830
or that we thought they
could take, and therefore

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:36.870
let's refund the fare,
because it was bad service.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.323
AUDIENCE: This is for
[INAUDIBLE] on the Victoria

00:36:39.323 --> 00:36:39.823
Line?

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.150
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.660
Northbound?

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.527
You mean this graph?

00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:46.110
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.220
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.553
So northbound, southbound, yeah.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.380
And the reference is right here.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.580
David Uniman, 2009, so you can
check it out in the library

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.170
if you're interested.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.530
OK, so what happens
when it's low frequency.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:06.720
Now people are not
arriving necessarily

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.102
to randomly or independent now.

00:37:08.102 --> 00:37:10.060
They might actually be
scheduling their arrival

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.830
to meet a particular train.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.800
But of course, trains may
not be running on schedule.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.470
So you have this
space-time diagram here.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.980
We have time on the horizontal
and space, or the stations,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.330
on the vertical.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.690
And you see that
there is some degree

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.710
of variability in timing.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.520
And if these vehicles
were on time, maybe

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.300
they would be more
evenly spaced.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.810
So we have taps.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.290
Here, there's a
touch in at 8:00.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.810
And so what we do is that we
look at what's the next train?

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:51.170
When does that tap
in aboard, and that's

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:52.730
how much they waited.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.190
You're comparing to
scheduled departure,

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.270
which is in this case 8:06.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:04.760
So because the train--

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.280
I don't know if I'm
explaining this clearly.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:13.120
So you can match the
tap-in time to the closest

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.440
scheduled departure that
follows that tap in.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.160
And that's the train that
the person intends to board.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.590
And that's how much
the person intends--

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.470
the difference between those
two times is the amount of time

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.260
that the person intends to
wait or expects to wait.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.450
Any waiting time beyond
that is excess waiting time.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.910
And then you're going to do the
same for the in-vehicle time.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.690
That's where
[INAUDIBLE] and that's

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.940
how you get reliability
buffer time.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:53.650
So you're now considering the
waiting strategy is different.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.320
And here's the reference.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.340
2010, another thesis.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.150
For bus, there's
another challenge.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.750
Well, there's two challenges.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:06.540
The first one is we
need to distinguish

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.050
between the performance
of the contractor,

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:13.970
if it's a private operator
and you're paying the bus

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.450
company to run service for
you, and the performance

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:17.990
as the passenger sees it.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.780
So as it says on the bottom,
if service is unreliable,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.930
the passenger doesn't
care why it's unreliable.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.930
But the operator
needs to know if it's

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:30.630
the fault of the
operator or if it

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.790
was an external
reason that was not

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.560
under the control
of the operator.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.090
Why?

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.276
Why is that important?

00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:44.470
Henry.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.450
AUDIENCE: If there is traffic,
then there could likely

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.780
be traffic downstream, as well.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.785
And you would continue
to be on the line

00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:58.120
for the remainder of the trip.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.530
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.540
But you're thinking
of a specific trip.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.150
Because I'm thinking
more generally.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.260
So why would the agency
want to distinguish

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:13.140
between bad performance that
can be assigned or blamed

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:18.090
on the operator versus bad
performance that is exogenous.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:19.590
AUDIENCE: Because
if the bad service

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.740
is due to some act of
God, then the agency maybe

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.640
can't hold the
contractor accountable.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.830
But if the contract and service
provider did something wrong,

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.344
then there can be some
kind of punishment.

00:40:31.344 --> 00:40:32.760
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, yes.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.510
And in this case, a
punishment under the contract

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.430
might be a penalty.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.760
So they might withhold some--
if there's a performance bonus,

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.175
maybe the operator
does not get that bonus

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:47.511
when there might be actually
provisions for a penalty.

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:51.010
Or a discount on the payment.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.850
And it doesn't have
to be an act of God.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:58.620
It can be normal traffic.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:04.530
And the variability
in travel times

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.900
that is expected
because of traffic

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.630
that is not under the
control of the operator.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:14.910
But what if the operator is
not maintaining his buses

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.060
and some vehicles have
to be put out of service?

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.010
So the operator drops trips and
now performance is not as good.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.330
That is very clearly the
fault of the operator,

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.570
and you want to
penalize the operator.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.830
So that's one challenge.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.350
So you have to
measure reliability,

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.050
but you might have to
assign its sources.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.690
You might have to calculate
the sources of those

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:41.260
and sort of assign cost codes
to whatever you measure.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.930
And there might be a mix.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:47.370
The other challenge is that
typically, buses are only

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:49.230
tap on and not tap off.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.280
So you have to--

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.090
journey time includes
the in-vehicle portion.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.800
So now you have to
figure out where

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.830
this person alights to figure
out the in-vehicle component.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.530
And waiting time is
another portion of this,

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.290
and the passenger
doesn't tap in until they

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.540
have finished waiting.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.160
So you have to go back and
calculate, how long did they

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.910
wait?

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:12.300
So those are two
minor challenges.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.530
Here's a strategy.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.170
For destinations, we have ODX.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.790
So we can look at
their next tap in.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.610
We can do trip chaining,
as we discussed previously,

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:24.810
and infer the destination
for that person.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.610
And for some people
that will fail,

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.890
but we can scale
up in probability.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:32.970
We can say, well, if this
person didn't have a next tap,

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.080
let's look at the
distribution of passengers

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.720
who do have an
next tap and let's

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.920
assume that these other
people have destinations

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.800
that are in proportion--

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.820
distributed in the
same way as people

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.650
who have destinations inferred.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.710
And then from AVL, we can
sort of do the same trick

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.690
that we did for rail.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:56.940
We can assume that there is
some process by which passengers

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.810
arrive at stops.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.600
So if it's high-frequency
bus service,

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.870
we say it's some arrival rate.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.400
If it's low
frequency service, we

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:11.940
say they arrive on time
to match the schedule.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.147
And then we can compare that
with actual vehicle times.

00:43:15.147 --> 00:43:16.730
So if we have an
assumption about when

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:20.580
the passenger arrived, then we
can calculate the difference

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.100
and measure the waiting time.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.660
So it's more
stochastic because we

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.940
don't know exactly when
this person arrived.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.730
But in probability, you
know that in aggregate,

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:33.300
across all passengers,
any one person arrived

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.430
between this bus and that bus.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.470
So yeah.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:43.250
Questions about this process
for measuring journey time

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.327
reliability?

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.752
Comments?

00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.960
AUDIENCE: One man complained
about waiting time, it's

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.005
like with the bus.

00:43:53.005 --> 00:43:54.040
Like, oh, with
the scheduled bus,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.130
if the person only waits
one minute, that's great.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:59.730
But if I'm waiting at my
desk for eight minutes,

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.030
I actually was--

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.530
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So that it

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:04.850
goes back to the
discussion about apps

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.880
that we had just
a few minutes ago,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.890
that you can't just say
that because there are apps,

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:13.720
then we can just run
service unreliably

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.030
if it's long headway.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.114
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:16.114 --> 00:44:18.280
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So if it's high frequency,

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.070
you probably won't care.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.130
You'll just still go.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:25.230
Or you'll be timing it, but you
would have arrived randomly,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.870
anyway, to some extent,
i.e. your intention

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:31.080
to begin the trip is random,
or at least independent

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.730
of the schedule.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.110
But if it's long headway
service, then yes,

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.520
you maybe stay at your desk
or get a cup of coffee.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.260
But you're still inconvenienced.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.720
And so there's a penalty for it.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.060
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:45.990
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And we need to figure out

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.740
how to measure it.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.560
And one way is to assume
that people still arrive,

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.099
or want to arrive, on time.

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:55.390
And that's what we've been
doing because that's what we

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.460
used to do, and kind of works.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.117
But it's slightly different.

00:45:01.117 --> 00:45:03.200
AUDIENCE: So how do you
use the stochastic process

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.070
to estimate wait time?

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:06.361
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:16.260
So let's-- another timeline.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.300
So in this case it's a
timeline, not a space line.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:32.140
So let's say that there's
a tap at that time.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:39.270
And the buses are
arriving here, here, here.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.770
Sorry.

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:43.460
Well, the tap has to be
when the bus arrives,

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.510
or very close to it.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.780
Because the person is
tapping in at the bus.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.060
So what you know
for this person,

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.490
assuming that this
bus isn't full,

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.120
is that that person
arrived as late

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.160
as exactly when that
vehicle arrived,

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.930
and as early as this vehicle.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:04.640
So you know that
the arrival time

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:08.150
of that person and the time
at which they began waiting,

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:13.070
is a stochastic variable
with a uniform distribution

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.820
on that range.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.530
And you know the mean
of that distribution

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:20.363
is half the headway.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:27.960
So if the bus arrivals
are high frequency

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.460
and the person is
arriving randomly,

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:32.160
then this is certainly true.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.760
If it's long headway
service, then you

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.300
have to then consider what
the scheduled times were.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.820
So now you have to do a
process similar to what

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.970
we did for rail, where--

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.340
let me just draw it here.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:47:00.789
So if this bus was
meant to arrive here,

00:47:00.789 --> 00:47:02.330
then maybe you say,
well, this person

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.750
must have been wanting
to get on that bus.

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.590
And so you made them
wait some extra time.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:18.290
And then if this bus was
scheduled to depart here,

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:21.140
then you know that
bus was early.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:23.296
So that means that some
of the people that end up

00:47:23.296 --> 00:47:28.270
tapping in here were probably
trying to get on this bus

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.650
and they missed it.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.060
Because they arrived
between this and this time--

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.070
between the actual
and the departed time.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.230
So those are the people
who suffer the most.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.060
And that's more
difficult to calculate.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.760
You might have to assume
some proportion of the people

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.630
you see here.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.770
You could compare
to a typical load

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:52.020
and see if there's
an excess, and assume

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.130
that that excess would have
been on the previous bus,

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:58.290
if that bus had
departed on time.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.070
So you have to use
more assumptions.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.110
OK.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:11.026
So we understand how to measure
reliability for rail tap ins

00:48:11.026 --> 00:48:15.300
and tap outs, long headway,
short headway, and for bus.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.040
So strategies.

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.074
So the question Eli had earlier
was, what do we do about it?

00:48:21.074 --> 00:48:21.990
Now we can measure it.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.130
So if you can measure something,
you do something about it.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:25.180
What can we do about it?

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.000
So two kinds of things.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.470
We can use preventive strategies
and corrective strategies.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.710
Preventive strategies are aimed
at maintaining normal service

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.870
and having some robust
operations plans that

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.650
can handle unreliability
without having a domino effect,

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:44.730
where everything cascades
into unreliability.

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:47.100
And that it reduces
the probability

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.930
that problems occur.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.890
Corrective strategies
are you know,

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.960
you're monitoring the system,
you see unreliability,

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.700
and you do something to the
system at that time to fix it,

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.580
to make it more
reliable and to minimize

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.840
the impact on passengers.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.340
So examples of
preventive strategies

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.560
are having reserve fleet
of drivers and vehicles.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.810
If a driver is sick,
you have another driver

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:11.970
and you send that driver.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:16.470
Vehicle is not operating,
you have another vehicle.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.390
Having exclusive bus lanes.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.460
So if you have great
separation, you

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.200
get rid of some of
the unreliability that

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.095
comes from traffic.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.440
Traffic signal
priority-- sorry, that

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.200
should be transit
signal priority.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.260
We talked about that in
our previous lecture.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.970
There are route
design strategies.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:37.980
So we know.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.040
We've seen that longer routes
are more reliable because they

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:47.040
have more time between recovery
time, between layovers,

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.300
essentially.

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.200
They have fewer stops.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.860
So there's less of a dwell
time unreliability effect.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:03.480
You can make schedules that
have a good amount of recovery

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.420
at the end.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.090
So you look at the
percentiles and you

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:08.780
make sure that you're
not picking the average

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.930
to calculate your cycle times.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:14.190
And you set the timing
points at good percentiles.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.760
Maybe it's the median, maybe
it's the 40th percentile.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.380
And of course,
hiring supervisors

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.380
to make sure that your
people are showing up

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:26.460
and they're leaving on time
rather than whenever they want,

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.750
et cetera.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:31.050
So it's schedules.

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:36.120
So two critical decisions-- the
cycle time, we know about that.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.800
We know that it impacts cost
and the reliability of departure

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.930
time of the terminal.

00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:42.450
And you're very
familiar with that,

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:45.480
I think, by now, so I don't
have to spend as much time

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.470
discussing it.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:48.190
Timing points is another.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:54.700
So you can, in the middle of a
bus route, have timing points.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:51:00.060
So we know that there
might be a terminal here

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.650
and a terminal here.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.840
And whenever a bus
arrives at the end to be,

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:09.990
they then have a
layover to catch up.

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.080
We know that from
assignment one, even.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:16.050
But you can actually
have points in the middle

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.890
where buses are also not
allowed to leave early.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:25.890
And so if you schedule the
times of these in some way,

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.040
then buses might hold
more or hold less,

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.920
and they will depart
those points on time.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.830
Where should you put those
timing points, if at all?

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:38.650
AUDIENCE: Inter-transfers?

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:39.858
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:51:39.858 --> 00:51:47.370
So one idea is that if there's
a big train station here

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.580
or another bus line
that also runs--

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.070
especially for low
frequency service--

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:55.470
and people want to connect,
they need to transfer,

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:56.730
and they want to connect.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:59.720
You might actually have a
timing point for both routes

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.210
there so the vehicles meet and
people can switch vehicles.

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:05.400
So that's one idea.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.380
What else?

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.581
AUDIENCE: Maybe after a high
variability section, like after

00:52:09.581 --> 00:52:10.080
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:11.288
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:52:11.288 --> 00:52:16.470
So maybe this lane
has a lot of traffic

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:24.400
and it's causing a
lot of unreliability.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.570
So you want to take
care of it there instead

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:35.320
of letting it cascade into more
variable headways, for example.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.095
What else?

00:52:37.095 --> 00:52:38.679
AUDIENCE: High demand,
those stations.

00:52:38.679 --> 00:52:40.636
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
High-demand stations.

00:52:40.636 --> 00:52:41.240
OK.

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.400
So what about demand?

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.370
Demand is important,
but what exactly?

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.380
AUDIENCE: I mean, if the bus is
reliable at that stations, then

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.800
the passengers--

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.400
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
What do you mean?

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.770
For example, a lot of people
getting off from this bus

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:02.184
to take that station, or to
enter that train station, or--

00:53:02.184 --> 00:53:04.600
AUDIENCE: People are getting
onto the bus at that station.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.808
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:11.160
So right upstream of sections
where there are many boardings.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.400
That's a very important
thing because that's

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.830
where most people benefit.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:17.700
And what else?

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.240
What else about passengers?

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.740
Where would you not
want to do this?

00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:25.210
Harry.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.540
AUDIENCE: When the bus is full?

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.498
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
When the bus is full.

00:53:28.498 --> 00:53:31.350
So if your load profile looks--

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:32.460
I don't know.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.380
A lot of people get on here.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:38.470
And they're mostly
not getting off.

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:41.362
And they sort of
come down like that.

00:53:41.362 --> 00:53:43.890
Do you want timing
points on that bus route?

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.105
You don't.

00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:47.880
You don't want timing points
because most people are

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:53.250
getting on here and they don't
want to be held here and here.

00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:59.010
And very few people might
be boarding in this section.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:02.020
So if you hold a
timing point, you're

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:05.610
going to benefit few
passengers and penalize,

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:10.290
by longer and more frustrating
vehicle rides, many passengers.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.650
So what if there's a big
transfer station here,

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:19.200
and a lot of people
transfer, and then

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.280
here there's another station
and a lot of people get on.

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:28.830
So then this is a good place
to have a timing point,

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:34.170
right before a lot
of people board

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.880
and when you don't have
many people on the bus.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.700
The flow profile is low.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] liability
before that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.556
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Exactly.

00:54:43.556 --> 00:54:47.750
So you want to maximize the
segment of the population that

00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:49.844
will benefit from the
strategy and minimize

00:54:49.844 --> 00:54:51.260
the segment of the
population that

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:56.230
will be hurt by the strategy,
i.e. people in the bus.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.130
OK.

00:54:58.130 --> 00:55:02.480
So that's a word about number
and location of timing points.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.460
And then the schedule
at each timing point.

00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.200
What should you set
the percentile at?

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.960
Should this be the median?

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:13.730
Should they be 80 percentile?

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:18.110
Should they be 30 percentile?

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.460
AUDIENCE: The median realm.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.740
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So what happens if you--

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.674
how many vehicles
will have to be held?

00:55:24.674 --> 00:55:26.090
What percent of
vehicles will have

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.380
to be held if you set
it to 80th percentile?

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, 80%.

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:30.170
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: 80%.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.670
OK.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:36.100
So 80% of vehicles would be sort
of getting here and waiting.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.280
That may be acceptable if,
again, very few people are here

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.410
and a lot of people
are boarding.

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:45.266
What if it's more of a mix?

00:55:45.266 --> 00:55:46.640
Then you want to
bring that down.

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.620
You dial it down.

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:53.030
So some people say
set the half cycle

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:55.250
to somewhere between
90% and 95%--

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:59.690
we've done that-- and then
set timing points at 65.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:03.690
I actually prefer that the
timing points are below 50.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.300
Because then you can
advertise to your passengers.

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:13.690
You're essentially lying
to people and saying--

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.920
you're motivating people to
arrive earlier than, most

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.010
often, the vehicle arrives.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.140
So their probability
of arriving and missing

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.080
a vehicle that
departed early is lower

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.080
because you're telling them,
expect an early departure,

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:29.999
essentially.

00:56:29.999 --> 00:56:31.290
Except you don't call it early.

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.165
You say that's when it's
scheduled to arrive.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.150
So essentially you
can control this

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:43.010
by scheduling a certain way,
and then on the other side

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:44.020
by controlling it.

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.230
AUDIENCE: But the pushback
when people are like,

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.930
oh, the bus is
always running late.

00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:48.410
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:49.680
Yeah, so it affects--

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.520
there's a balance.

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:55.560
I'm not saying, schedule
it 10th percentile.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.540
But I think a little below
50 is a good strategy.

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.300
Because then you would
minimize holding.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.700
You would only
hold vehicles that

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.526
are really early, essentially.

00:57:08.526 --> 00:57:09.650
And holding is frustrating.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:12.880
You don't want to be
doing it all the time.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.180
So by scheduling at
a lower percentile,

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.340
you don't hold as often.

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:21.570
And you don't hold
for as long times.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.854
All right.

00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:24.520
You have to be careful
when you do this,

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.870
when you have timing points.

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:29.170
Because then your AVL
data will come in,

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.970
and you're going to say,
what's the running time?

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:36.460
Well, if people are
following your instructions,

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:39.490
the minimum running
time will be whatever

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:40.630
your timing points are.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:49.050
So maybe your distribution
would look like this.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.900
But because you
have timing points,

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.100
you've chopped off
the early portion.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:58.440
And now it looks more like this.

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.020
And now your 95th percentile
is more to the right

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.100
than it used to be, maybe.

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:04.780
Maybe not.

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.829
Maybe it stays where it is.

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:08.370
But you have to be
careful with this.

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.160
Your average will certainly
move to the right.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.590
So just be careful about that.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:23.730
One strategy is to distinguish
holding from running,

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:27.720
but that's a little
difficult with AVL sometimes.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.849
Another strategy is to run a
month without timing points,

00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:33.390
essentially instruct
your drivers not

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:36.540
to use timing points, and
collect data for a month,

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.320
and then use that for planning.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:42.330
So just the things we can do.

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:43.870
OK, now corrective strategies.

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.020
So obviously, supervision.

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.730
Having supervisors, having an
operations control practice

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.136
is important.

00:58:51.136 --> 00:58:53.900
There's different strategies.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:55.860
This is one of my favorite
topics in transit.

00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.520
So holding-- you can do holding
to schedule or to headway.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.860
So what is holding to schedule?

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.260
That's a simple one.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.540
We've mentioned
it a dozen times,

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.860
and even in this lecture.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.710
You don't allow a vehicle to
depart early from a timing

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:14.420
point or from a terminal.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:19.490
So if a vehicle arrives a
minute early at a timing point,

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:24.380
you instruct that driver
to hold one minute.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.720
Even though that bus
is able to move on,

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.140
that bus holds for one minute.

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:32.140
TSP we talked about.

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:34.481
What's deadheading?

00:59:34.481 --> 00:59:36.230
AUDIENCE: Just moving
a bus from one place

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:40.662
to another that's not
a revenue [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:40.662 --> 00:59:41.870
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:58.880
So let's say that
you have buses here,

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.710
and this is your terminal.

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:03.980
And there's a bus that
you are about to depart.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:08.420
And your headway, the scheduled
headway is more like this.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.750
So you were supposed to have
a bus here, but you didn't.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.890
Something happened and
the bus wasn't there.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:22.060
And now you have two buses
there instead of one.

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:23.810
Maybe there was a
bunching on the way back

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.110
and the bunch arrived late,
as it usually happens.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:30.950
So one strategy that you can
use is to take the first one

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:35.090
and instruct a deadhead
to somewhere around here.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.460
So this bus would run
without its head sign

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.590
on, not allowing
anybody to board--

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:44.450
and that's why it's
called a deadhead--

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.030
to this stop.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.870
And then this bus
departs immediately,

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.550
but it remains in service.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.300
So if that deadhead can
happen quickly, maybe not even

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.140
following the
streets or the bus,

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.960
maybe there's a faster way.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.660
And you inject it downstream.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.830
You can speed things up, you
can balance the headways.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.043
What's expressing?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.603
AUDIENCE: Skipping stops?

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:15.186
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: That's
one way of doing expressions.

01:01:18.232 --> 01:01:19.940
Expressing can be done
from the terminal.

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:25.410
So the distinction between
expressing and deadheading

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:29.050
is that expressing them
with people inside.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:32.820
So in this case, you
could have allowed people

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:35.940
to board at the
terminal and then said,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:37.250
we're going to run express.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.624
You tell people
who are boarding,

01:01:38.624 --> 01:01:40.140
we're going to run express.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.520
So if you're getting off
anywhere between here and here,

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.340
don't board.

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:49.680
And the vehicle then skips
stops, but with people inside.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.100
So I don't think I need to
do a drawing for this one.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.240
Expressing can also be
done halfway through.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:04.590
So if you have this
situation, then you

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:09.000
could say these people
might have boarded, not

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.422
knowing that this bus was
going to be expressed,

01:02:11.422 --> 01:02:12.380
but something happened.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.400
Maybe the driver was slow.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.870
Maybe there was some traffic
accident and there were delays.

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:22.410
So you can then announce
this bus is being expressed,

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:24.109
or this train is
being expressed,

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:26.150
and we're going to skip
the following three stops

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:28.000
and arrive somewhere.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.520
So if you're getting
off before the express,

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.440
you have to decide,
are you going

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.300
to stay and then walk back?

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.190
Are you going to stay and then
take transit the opposite way?

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.130
Or are you going to
get off right now

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:42.910
and wait for the next vehicle?

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:44.770
So it's a higher
penalty for passengers.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.180
What about short term?

01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.880
We've talked about all of these,
but in the context of planning.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.250
And now we're using them
for real time control.

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:57.486
So this is deadheading.

01:02:57.486 --> 01:03:00.438
[WRITING ON BOARD]

01:03:13.151 --> 01:03:13.650
Right.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:17.616
And then yeah, so short term.

01:03:17.616 --> 01:03:20.508
[WRITING ON BOARD]

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.860
Here's the situation.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:38.280
You have-- this doesn't happen
often, but it does happen.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.600
You have a bunch
in one direction

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.400
and a very long gap in
the other direction.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.960
And what happens with bunching?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.060
The bus behind is
usually not very full.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:58.660
So you stop these
buses and say stop.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:03.730
And you tell the people here
to move to the bus ahead.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:04.510
Get off the bus.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:05.343
We're in short term.

01:04:05.343 --> 01:04:07.720
We're going to
terminate the trip here.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.680
And those people will have
to transfer to the next bus.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.190
If you don't allow
this to happen,

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:15.210
then it's really
onerous for passengers

01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:18.430
because they have to get off
and wait for the next one.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:20.830
So it's better if you
coordinate it this way.

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:24.850
And then this bus gets sent
here and begins operating

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.091
in the opposite direction.

01:04:28.091 --> 01:04:30.090
AUDIENCE: How much of
this is done automatically

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.667
versus a person
looking at this--

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I don't know of any case

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.540
where this is done
automatically.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:40.500
There has been researchers here
at MIT and elsewhere, including

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:44.820
me, who have tried to
write algorithms that

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.780
detect these opportunities.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.160
But I don't know of any
real implementation.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.620
London buses does this,
or at least they used to.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.620
I think they still do.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:05:00.600
But they really try
to coordinate this.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:06.070
They very rarely curtail
trips without coordinating

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:07.187
in a bunch.

01:05:07.187 --> 01:05:09.270
Because then people have
to wait for the next one.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] as well.

01:05:10.935 --> 01:05:11.280
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Pardon?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.300
AUDIENCE: The train
systems [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:12.680
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.350
Yes.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:14.830
So in trains, it's more common.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:19.170
But it's usually a person in
a control center determining

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.742
that they want to do this.

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:23.200
AUDIENCE: What's stopping them
from [INAUDIBLE] algorithms?

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.827
Is it that the algorithms
are not good enough or--

01:05:26.827 --> 01:05:28.660
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's part of it.

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:30.727
And then yeah.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.310
I think I would say
that's part of it.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:33.870
The other is maybe
a lack of interest

01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:38.694
or a lack of faith
in the computer.

01:05:38.694 --> 01:05:39.870
There's a system in place.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.100
It's just, you know, it's hard.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.560
AUDIENCE: But there are two
elements to this problem.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.730
One is that you have to detect
a problem in one direction.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:49.230
And the other thing
is that you have

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.330
to detect an opportunity
in the other direction.

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.190
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So
this doesn't happen very often.

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:54.790
AUDIENCE: There
are two parts here

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.790
that are completely
independent from each other.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:57.375
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
They're not independent,

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:59.100
though.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.860
If the route is long
you actually have--

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.260
even though in a short
route, in any given segment,

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.634
the probability
of this happening

01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:08.890
is low, if you have a long
route it's much higher.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:13.560
It's like the point you brought
up with Professor Fritz'

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.980
lecture, you said, oh, the
chances of a bus benefiting

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.110
from this are very small.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.330
And then you said, well,
what if it's a long route

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.870
and there are 20 signals?

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.640
Same thing applies here.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.160
You might have a long
route with many windows,

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.270
and the chances that there
is one window at any given

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:34.500
time in the rush hour
is actually pretty high.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.150
AUDIENCE: And then the other
thing is, as the controller--

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.940
suppose I'm the controller,
I have the algorithm.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:43.110
And my computer starts
beeping and gets all excited.

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.640
I have to respond
quickly to this,

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.210
because that
opportunity will pass.

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:51.210
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And getting back

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:54.080
to algorithms and
anticipation, what's

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:57.150
sort of neat about
algorithms is that you

01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:00.390
can try to predict that this
will happen rather than waiting

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.290
until it happens to react.

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:04.106
And if you can do
that early enough,

01:07:04.106 --> 01:07:05.480
you might actually
instruct a bus

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.937
that is departing the terminal
to short term later on.

01:07:09.937 --> 01:07:12.020
And if you do that, then
you can set the head sign

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:14.770
on the bus to the short version.

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:16.470
And people who are
boarding it are

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.640
going to know that
it's going to be

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.390
short term so you won't
have to coordinate

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.650
with the bus next to it.

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.570
You don't have to have
a bunch, in other words.

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:26.280
So you can then
minimize the problem

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.500
to finding a long gap
here and predicting

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.902
when that gap will meet the next
bus that's being dispatched.

01:07:31.902 --> 01:07:33.110
You need algorithms for that.

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:34.710
It's very difficult to do it.

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:36.460
AUDIENCE: What do you
tell the passengers?

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.670
Do you tell the passengers,
listen, guys, this bus

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.550
might get short termed,
just so you know.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:40.720
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: No.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.780
You change the head sign.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:46.170
And you say this bus is running
to Central Square instead

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:47.500
of Harvard.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.272
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:49.980
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
you know this is going

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.271
to happen during commute hours?

01:07:51.271 --> 01:07:52.800
Like the red line--

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.380
I mean, I suppose for trains,
the red line is so long.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.280
But if you know your [?OE?] are
mainly in the downtown area,

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.070
wouldn't you know beforehand
that you want to just have

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:03.630
higher frequency
on this one branch?

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:05.130
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That would

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:07.410
be a service planning,
short terming strategy, not

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:08.716
a real-time control strategy.

01:08:08.716 --> 01:08:09.840
So we make the distinction.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.690
Both are short terming,
but this is something

01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:17.260
that you decide in real time
to bring the service that you

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.640
are delivering more close
to what you plan to deliver.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.729
Which is different from strategy
in service planning, where

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:26.609
you identify when we talked
about rider or quarter

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:27.134
strategies.

01:08:27.134 --> 01:08:29.550
There might be a core of your
route that has higher demand

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:32.990
and you have short terms to have
frequency higher at that point.

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:35.869
Very different
reasons and horizons

01:08:35.869 --> 01:08:37.410
for planning and
all sorts of things.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:44.130
OK, use of reserve vehicles,
this happens more with rail

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:44.773
than bus.

01:08:44.773 --> 01:08:46.439
You could have it
with bus, too, though.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:49.380
I know that in South
America they do it with bus.

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:53.130
So you have some buses
stationed somewhere

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.229
in the city near key routes.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:59.670
And they're just waiting
there for an opportunity.

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:01.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.600
[CHATTER]

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.279
Right.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:10.707
So then someone in a control
center sees a long gap

01:09:10.707 --> 01:09:13.290
and they call that bus and say,
there's a big, long gap there.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:13.800
Rush.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:18.160
Go into that corridor and
start operating Route X. So

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.670
they can inject a vehicle.

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:23.930
And you can do that with rail,
too, if you have pocket tracks.

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.570
So you might have pocket tracks
somewhere and sort of insert

01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:28.100
a train.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.880
Ari knows something about that.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.920
OK, so mostly, if
you do holding,

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.359
holding's the best strategy
for keeping service on track.

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:41.216
You don't usually want to do
the more aggressive strategies

01:09:41.216 --> 01:09:43.090
because they hurt
passengers and they require

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:44.649
much more coordination effort.

01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:46.880
But if you have a
major disruption,

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880
sometimes you need them.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.180
Holding by itself won't cut it.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.500
Holding can be done in a
bunch of different ways.

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.160
You can hold to
schedule adherence.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.760
We've spoken about that.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.630
For headway, we've
kind of brushed it off

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:59.920
and said headway adherence.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.128
Well, there's actually a
lot of ways you can do that.

01:10:02.128 --> 01:10:04.090
So one of them is to
look at the schedule

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:06.430
and realize that the time
between scheduled trips

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:07.660
is five minutes.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:09.130
So now instead of
actually trying

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:11.410
to stick to the
actual times, you

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:14.210
want to stick to a separation of
five minutes between vehicles,

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.570
because that's the time
that was scheduled.

01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:19.240
So that would be scheduled
headway adherence.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.770
The next-- and these are
in order of sophistication.

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:25.850
So the next one is
threshold headway adherence.

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:28.780
So if you think
about it, there's

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:34.000
no reason why the scheduled
difference between departure

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.560
times is the best threshold
that you should use for holding.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.310
There might be one that is a
minute less or a minute higher

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:45.200
that results in
better performance.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.792
Why not?

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:49.750
What physical reason is
there for the scheduled

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.190
time being the best one.

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:52.060
There isn't any.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:57.880
So if you optimize
the threshold,

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.820
you can get better performance.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.290
And usually the optimal
threshold is below,

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:05.020
it's shorter than the schedule.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.660
So you hold less often.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.350
The problem with
headway adherence

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.640
is that you hold too
much, essentially.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.277
So then there's
headway regularity.

01:11:16.277 --> 01:11:17.860
Don't worry about
the schedule at all,

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.650
or about any
predetermined headway.

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:23.470
You have a separation
between vehicles.

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:29.440
And I know that if
I have vehicles,

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.690
I want my vehicles
spaced this way.

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:37.850
But instead, I have
this situation.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:42.990
So I want this vehicle
to hold until it is here.

01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:46.090
Or rather, what
will really happen

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.590
is this vehicle will stay there.

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.570
You will ask it to stay there.

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:52.030
And you want this
vehicle to move on

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:55.090
and this vehicle to move
on to these positions.

01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:56.530
And now they're
even, and then you

01:11:56.530 --> 01:11:58.230
let that vehicle
go at that point.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:11:59.564
So that's even headway holding.

01:11:59.564 --> 01:12:01.480
AUDIENCE: That seems
pretty easy to implement.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.140
How often is it--

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:02.890
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Now it is.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.580
It used to be very hard.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:09.070
So how would you implement
targeted headway holding

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.775
without technology?

01:12:10.775 --> 01:12:11.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:13.650
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No, but how would you?

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:14.320
You can't do it.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:14.890
AUDIENCE: You need a
supervisor [INAUDIBLE]..

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.890
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You need a supervisor.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:19.036
So in London there
was actually a time

01:12:19.036 --> 01:12:20.410
when you didn't
need a supervisor

01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:23.440
because you had the driver
getting off the bus,

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:27.100
and hitting a button on a
post, and it starts a timer,

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.720
and then the driver leaves.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.210
The next bus comes along
and it sees the time.

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:34.620
So it knows, like, ah, OK,
this is when I have to leave.

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.750
So you can do that, even
without wireless communication.

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.700
Even in headway
you can't do that.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.290
You need communication.

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.080
Somebody needs to know
the vehicle before,

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.750
the vehicle after, that
means they communicated.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.916
So it's much more of a
recent strategy in terms of--

01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:52.290
AUDIENCE: Oh, so
in this strategy

01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:54.392
you're not necessarily trying
to maintain a certain headway.

01:12:54.392 --> 01:12:55.660
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No certain headway.

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.900
It's often when it
emerges from the system.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.581
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:58.581 --> 01:12:59.830
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yep.

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:01.990
And that's actually-- if
we want to split hairs,

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:04.710
there's different kinds of
ways of doing unit headway.

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:06.770
And let's not get into it.

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:11.010
Then the most sophisticated
class is optimization.

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:14.120
And there's something called
rolling horizon optimization.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.390
So what happens there is
that you use a simulation

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:19.330
model, essentially, to
predict how the system would

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:24.130
evolve if you're holding time
for a certain configuration.

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:26.560
And you can test a bunch of
different headway holding

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.600
configurations and
pick the one that's

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.960
best at a given time
based on those forecasts.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.200
In other words, pick the holding
time that maximizes performance

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.870
across forecasts.

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:42.889
And so what's neat about this is
that they can trade off waiting

01:13:42.889 --> 01:13:43.930
time and in-vehicle time.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:48.970
When you hold, the people inside
the vehicle are waiting more.

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:53.800
The winners of this strategy are
people who would miss that bus

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.900
and have to wait for
the following bus that

01:13:55.900 --> 01:13:57.850
has a long headway ahead of it.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.250
So by evening out
the headways, you

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.325
make everybody wait
about the same.

01:14:02.325 --> 01:14:04.450
And that minimizes average
waiting time and average

01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:05.740
crowding, et cetera.

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:10.120
So optimization strategy
can predict or keep

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.600
track of how many people
are inside vehicles.

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.100
And it can know, well, I
know this is the penalty.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.750
I know this is the benefit.

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:20.630
Let's trade these off and let's
hold the optimal amount of time

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:24.390
such that the total
time is minimized.

01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:26.500
And you can multiply
by factors that

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.430
take into account this utility
of waiting being higher

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.040
than the disutility of
being inside the vehicle.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.620
So what that does is it
reduces excessive holding.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.870
So if you know that you
have a full vehicle,

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:45.136
you don't hold it, even if it's
very close to the next one.

01:14:45.136 --> 01:14:46.510
Why would you hold
a vehicle that

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:50.700
is full, even if it's this
one right here bunched

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:51.710
to the next one.

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:52.210
You don't.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:53.920
You don't want to hold it.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.120
What if the vehicle isn't
full, but it will be full

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:59.590
five stops ahead, because demand
is very high for some reason.

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:00.640
And you know that.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.240
Then optimization algorithm
will see that because it's

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.770
predicting for next hour.

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:10.360
So it'll be able to
pick a strategy that

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.640
improves performance.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.680
One challenge is drivers.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.750
If you hold too
much, then drivers

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.820
might be 20 minutes
late for their shift,

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.440
for their meal break.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.950
What do you do about that?

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:23.320
That's still a challenge.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.060
And that's a
challenge throughout.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.880
But there is opportunity
with optimization algorithms

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.350
to insert constraints that
take those into account so

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:35.290
that your holding
policy is something

01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:36.601
that you can implement.

01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:38.434
AUDIENCE: It seems like
[INAUDIBLE] would be

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:40.650
to [INAUDIBLE] the algorithm.

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.930
If it's taking 45
minutes to come up

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:44.940
with this great solution,
then [INAUDIBLE]..

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.356
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So
this problem is [INAUDIBLE]..

01:15:47.356 --> 01:15:50.490
And if you crunched
all the possibilities,

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:51.596
you would never finish.

01:15:51.596 --> 01:15:52.970
So you need a very
good algorithm

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:56.710
to find something fast.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:15:57.420
Yeah.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.780
So there's two different
ways of doing rolling horizon

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:02.880
optimization.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.060
One way is to have constant
running times in demands

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.710
within the prediction horizon.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.960
So imagine this blue
window being your--

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.180
this is the time right
now, and you're predicting

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:13.690
over the next, say, hour.

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.446
And that's the blue window.

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:17.820
What is actually happening is
that your running times are

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.670
going up slowly and gradually.

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:21.630
Your demand is going
up slowly, gradually

01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.150
because you're in the PND.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:28.380
If you are using
static input, you

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:32.380
have to say what the running
time is for the whole horizon.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.480
So what you might do is break
up the day into periods.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.120
And if you start at this
time, anytime before this,

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.950
you set some average.

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:42.700
And then once you
cross that threshold,

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:44.200
you set a different average.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.530
But then you miss out
on some information.

01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:50.070
So I worked on a
model that actually

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:53.940
takes some dynamic
inputs, too, to consider

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.860
these transitions, essentially.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:59.900
And the way it works is you
have these dynamic functions

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.130
of running times and demand.

01:17:02.130 --> 01:17:04.040
You can see the
current system state.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.030
You send that to a model.

01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:10.530
The model passes on those
inputs and some holding time

01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:13.200
configuration to a performance
model, which essentially

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.720
forecasts what the
system would do,

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.440
how the vehicle would move,
where passengers would board,

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.824
all those things.

01:17:19.824 --> 01:17:21.990
And then that gets sent to
a cost model, which says,

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.950
how much are people waiting?

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:24.290
How much are people in vehicles?

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:27.330
Let's add those up and figure
out what the average is.

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.710
And then that gets sent back
to the optimization model,

01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:31.560
and the optimization
model says, what

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.320
if we, instead of doing
that, let's turn this knob

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.750
and increase that holding
time and decrease this one,

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.080
go again.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.830
So it can do that on
a loop, essentially,

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:45.210
until it finds optimal times.

01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:49.680
The objective function is the
average time in the system.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.440
So Wv is like extra
time in the vehicle.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.860
So it's the time
that a person spends

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.890
at a stop in the vehicle, not
moving because the vehicle is

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:00.780
being held.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:02.580
So you're adding
time to that person.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:05.500
And then Ws is waiting
time at the stop.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:07.440
And we can multiply
by some factor

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.360
because we know that waiting
time is more onerous.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.020
There's a bunch of constraints.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.364
I'll skip the differences
between static and dynamic.

01:18:14.364 --> 01:18:15.780
Essentially it's
that running time

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:18.810
so demand can be
functions of time now.

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:20.290
Here's what happens.

01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:25.840
So here we test four
different strategies.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:29.850
The first one here, TH,
is threshold holding.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:32.290
EH is even headway holding.

01:18:32.290 --> 01:18:36.180
OS is optimization
of static inputs,

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.000
and OD is optimization
with dynamic inputs.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.050
And then we tested--

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.950
if we look at the
bottom two sets of four,

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:46.950
these are cases where both of
the men and the running times

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:48.030
are dynamic.

01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:49.690
So they're both transient.

01:18:49.690 --> 01:18:51.720
And we tested a
case of low crowding

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.410
and a case of high crowding.

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:57.330
So what we see is that in
all cases of low crowding--

01:18:57.330 --> 01:19:03.090
by the way, the bottom 2/3 sets
of runs are cases where maybe

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:06.110
running times are dynamic but
demand isn't, or demand is

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:08.260
dynamic and running
times aren't.

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:12.080
So if you look at all the
cases of low crowding,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.960
the white ones here, there's
very little difference

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.030
in performance.

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:17.640
So it means that
you don't really

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.530
need the most
sophisticated strategy.

01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:22.380
And the benefit of a very
sophisticated optimization

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:25.020
strategy with dynamic
inputs is not really

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.940
going to bring you
a lot of benefit.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:30.690
If you look at the high
crowding case, what you see

01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:34.470
is that there is a pretty
significant benefit

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:38.520
of even headway holding over
even optimized threshold

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.200
holding.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.530
But moving to the
model with optimization

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.940
doesn't do much
for you if there's

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.050
a lot of sort of dynamics
and system potentially.

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:56.100
So part of that is because the
static inputs high information

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.190
about when those
vehicles will fill up.

01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:00.450
And when you insert that
information into the system,

01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:03.910
then the optimizer can
see more of what happens

01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:06.500
and can improve performance.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.320
Here to the left is lower
cost and therefore better.

01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:15.720
Yeah, there's more
to parse here,

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.420
but we're running
out of time, so I'm

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:22.150
going to skip a few slides.

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:26.550
So you have control problems,
routine disturbances

01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:30.192
where you lose speed
adjustments and holding lightly.

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.650
Then there's
short-term disruptions

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:34.397
that might last between
five and 30 minutes.

01:20:34.397 --> 01:20:35.980
And there you can
apply the strategies

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.160
that we've discussed.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:41.460
And then there's very long,
much longer interruptions

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.430
in service for which you
need to do something major,

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:48.210
like bringing out bus service
to replace train service.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:51.432
And so only holding,
short terming,

01:20:51.432 --> 01:20:53.640
expressing, deadheading,
they're not going to cut it.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.210
You have a much bigger
problem to deal with.

01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:00.930
Here's a situation
in a rail operation

01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:04.580
where there's a signal
failure, or perhaps there's

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:08.220
a suicide attempt, and there's
a person on the tracks.

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:12.640
And you have this train that's
standing there and can't move.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.690
So the first thing
you should do is

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:17.580
hold the trains
downstream, immediately

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.039
downstream of the blockage.

01:21:19.039 --> 01:21:21.330
If you don't do that, they
will run around and queue up

01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.560
on the other end.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:25.500
And the people
entering these stations

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.120
are going to wait a long time.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:30.226
and those stations
are going to fill up.

01:21:30.226 --> 01:21:32.850
The other thing you should do is
these trains that are lined up

01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:36.840
here should be expressed
as soon as the blockage is

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.410
cleared up so that you can
move those vehicles forward.

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:42.630
And the vehicles at
the end of the queue

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:46.041
can begin normal operation.

01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:47.070
Does that make sense?

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:53.690
A lot of the very
sophisticated models

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:56.220
are not used in practice
for a number of reasons.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.795
Sometimes it's that the
models are simplistic.

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:05.830
Sometimes it's sort of a
lack of faith in models.

01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:08.890
Often it has to do with
the data in real time

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:11.484
about where vehicles
are not being that good.

01:22:11.484 --> 01:22:13.150
So actually detecting
where vehicles are

01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:15.520
could be a major challenge.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.410
And you need that information to
make the determination of what

01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:20.080
the optimal strategy is.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:25.330
Recently our lab did a
pilot of a real experiment

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:28.720
with the Green Line holding
two headways instead

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:31.000
of the schedule.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.120
So right now they
use paper sheets

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.140
and they have a schedule.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:39.910
And Jeff Fabian, who's
a student in the lab,

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:45.520
designed an app that has all the
train and driver information.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.510
And it also calculates the
even headway departing time.

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:52.690
So that departure time which
would cause an even headway.

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:56.920
And for two weeks we had the
inspectors of the terminal

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:00.100
use that instead of
the paper schedule.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:03.280
And what happened-- here's
a picture of the app.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.890
So you have all the
trains for the day.

01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:07.430
There's color coding.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:10.330
So green is coming
up and you can see

01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:11.600
all these times are different.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.690
So 9:36, there's some extra
holding there for the train

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:20.860
that had been scheduled at 9:34
so that the headways are even

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.640
coming out.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.660
And here's what happened.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:31.340
The variability decreased
by about 40% in some cases,

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.460
if you look at the
coefficient of variation.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:37.000
And you only look at
trains that were compliant.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.640
What really happened
overall was a mix of things.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:42.340
There was some noncompliance
with headway times,

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:46.210
some insistence in departing
on time to the schedule,

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:49.930
and then sometimes a compliance
to the [INAUDIBLE] headway

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:50.675
policy.

01:23:50.675 --> 01:23:52.300
So here's the
coefficient of variation.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.860
You know what that is.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.380
You know that lower is better
and the Green Line is lower,

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.880
so it's better.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:01.390
You can calculate the
equivalent benefit

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:03.550
that you would get
by adding trains

01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:07.070
to service in terms of
decreasing waiting time.

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:09.850
You can increase frequency
by adding new trains.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.840
So decrease in
variability of headways

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.550
was equivalent to
adding 1.7 trains.

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:18.350
Which is money.

01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:20.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but if I'm not
mistaken-- you can correct me

01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:21.770
if I'm wrong.

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.440
There is a mechanism
in this algorithm

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.274
that tries to go back
gradually to the schedule.

01:24:26.274 --> 01:24:27.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No, I wouldn't

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.240
characterize it that way.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:34.990
There are constraints to prevent
situations where there aren't

01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:38.950
enough trains to be departed.

01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:42.310
And there are some constraints
on how much holding

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.410
there can be, et cetera.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.410
So yeah, there's
an intention not

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:51.380
to have too much of a cascading
holding throughout the day.

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:55.210
But it's not so much as
a programmed linear trend

01:24:55.210 --> 01:25:00.010
towards schedule or
anything like that.

01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:02.440
AUDIENCE: Because you're
going off schedule, does--

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.130
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Slightly.

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:04.230
AUDIENCE: Slightly.

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:06.030
So would you ever
run into issues

01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:08.604
with communicating
with the public?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:11.020
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Green
Line, especially in peaks,

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:15.230
high frequency, not running
very reliably, anyway.

01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:18.610
So I don't know anyone
that looks at the schedule.

01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:20.807
Maybe very early in the
morning, but I don't know.

01:25:20.807 --> 01:25:22.390
Maybe late at night,
but I don't know.

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:24.431
AUDIENCE: I've totally
used Green Line's schedule

01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:25.180
late at night.

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:25.840
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Late at night.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.714
Yeah, late at night, I
think it would happen.

01:25:27.714 --> 01:25:30.422
But I don't think that during
the day it would happen.

01:25:30.422 --> 01:25:32.130
And what happened with
this late at night

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:33.754
is that the schedule
is reliable enough

01:25:33.754 --> 01:25:36.570
that the even headway times are
the scheduled times, anyway.

01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:37.820
So there's no issue with that.

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:41.170
AUDIENCE: So would there be an
issue in terms of applying this

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.122
to a more robust system?

01:25:43.122 --> 01:25:45.580
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: We
learned a lot from this pilot.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:50.350
And I think whoever implements
the next rail system will

01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:52.360
have to rejudge his thesis.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.900
Because there's so much that
we learned, about compliance,

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:59.030
about issues with data.

01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:00.370
I recommend reading it.

01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.080
Eli.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.996
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
how it's determining

01:26:02.996 --> 01:26:04.570
the headway that it should be?

01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:05.530
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It's even headway.

01:26:05.530 --> 01:26:06.550
AUDIENCE: It's just
maintaining event.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:07.592
It's not like optimizing.

01:26:07.592 --> 01:26:09.341
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No optimization.

01:26:09.341 --> 01:26:11.350
It's a very simple
even headway strategy.

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:13.360
Prediction of the time
it takes this train

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.720
to reach the next
one, prediction

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.430
of the time it takes
the trailing train

01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:20.860
to arrive at the
terminal, and then

01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:26.740
using those to calculate
the headways, essentially.

01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.720
And then determining
the holding time

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.850
to keep that train
the middle and then

01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:34.610
adding some constraints to
prevent excessive holding.

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:38.290
Also to prevent-- if
there was a long gap,

01:26:38.290 --> 01:26:41.200
you might want to not hold
the second one too much.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:45.010
Send those together.

01:26:45.010 --> 01:26:46.260
Here's something interesting.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.620
Here's a space-time graph.

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.450
Time horizontal.

01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:54.250
Green here shows compliance
and red shows non-compliance.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:56.290
So the first thing
we see is that when

01:26:56.290 --> 01:27:00.450
there's a lot of green, those
lines are nicely evenly spaced.

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:01.440
So that's good.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.690
That's the lower
coefficient to variation.

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:07.167
When you see red, you see
some bunching later on.

01:27:07.167 --> 01:27:08.500
That doesn't happen immediately.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.520
And it's slight.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.070
Notice how slight the
deviations can be.

01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:15.060
But you see the effects
of the dwell time effect

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.750
and the crunching happening.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:19.000
The other thing that happens
is that they have someone

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.450
controlling at reservoir.

01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:24.370
So they have someone stationed
there holding trains,

01:27:24.370 --> 01:27:27.050
keeping them evenly
spaced, more or less.

01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:30.285
And which trains are being held?

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:37.210
The ones that are
not as green, right?

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:41.050
So you've sent a train that
might be full of people.

01:27:41.050 --> 01:27:42.840
And you've decided
that you somehow

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.860
need it to depart a
little bit earlier

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.360
than the algorithm said.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.790
And then you wait till you fold
to them and hold two minutes.

01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:55.750
You could have avoided that
by having left a little later

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:56.540
from the terminal.

01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:58.636
AUDIENCE: They're
never hold at Fenway?

01:27:58.636 --> 01:27:59.950
Fenway seems to--

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.160
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: No.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.910
No, just long hold times.

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:08.320
So that's the end.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.600
Sorry for being a
few minutes late.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.070
If you have questions on
holding or real-time control,

01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:15.640
let me know.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:18.540
Next lecture is on fare policy.
