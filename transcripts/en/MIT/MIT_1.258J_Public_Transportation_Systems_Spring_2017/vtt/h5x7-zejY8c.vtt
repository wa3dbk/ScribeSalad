00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.710
NEEMA NASSIR: Let's
go ahead and start.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.730
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070
My name is Neema Nassir.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.520
I'm a post-doctoral associate
at Transit Lab, MIT.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.110
I've been invited to give a
few lectures in this course

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.180
and basically participate
in delivering the course

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.630
material for this course.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.970
I will be talking
in this session

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.130
and in the next session on
Short-range Planning Practice.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.950
And then I'll be back again
in April and in four sessions

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.670
in April, lecture number
13, 14, 15, and 16

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.410
dealing with vehicle scheduling,
crew scheduling, network

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.840
and root structure and
high ridership corridors.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.090
So let's go ahead and start.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.070
In this session, we are going to
talk about short-range planning

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.420
practice.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.890
And basically, I will give
a brief set of definition

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.400
and concepts and
introduction to the planning

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.310
activities that are usually
made at transit authorities

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.150
in the US and also worldwide.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.200
And then we will briefly
talk about the measures

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.550
and the standards and guidelines
that are published and used

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.690
by transit agencies to plan
their service based on those.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.820
Then we will also talk about
current practice and critique

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.780
of the existing systems.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.630
Probably we will cover icon
1 and some material in icon 2

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.650
this week.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.230
And then the rest will
actually be delivered to you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.865
in our session next Tuesday.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.350
So the planning decisions and
the planning activities that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.740
are usually done at the
transportation planning

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.490
agencies and public transport
planning agencies usually can

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.990
be classified into four
different type of decisions

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.500
depending on frequency of
decision-making and the need

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.840
for making decisions and
the scope of decisions--

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.580
the scope of changes that are
related to the decisions that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.370
are made with each activity.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.530
These planning
activities are divided

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.130
into four different classes--

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.540
long range planning activities,
medium range, short range,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.640
and control.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480
Long range planning
activities basically include

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.490
major capital investment--

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.370
major improvements to
the infrastructure--

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.230
which would include construction
of a new station, a new rail

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.050
line, a new bus
way to the system.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.820
Or it could also be
related to and as a result

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.660
of major institutional changes
and changes to the, basically,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.180
financial resources
of the organization.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.420
The decisions that [INAUDIBLE]
involve long range planning

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.730
are usually driven by political
and economic considerations.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.510
And basically, the
type of analysis

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.470
and the type of planning that
is done in long range planning

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.740
activities involve projection
into the future and prediction

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.860
of demand and prediction
of situation in the future.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.760
Therefore, it requires
a comprehensive analysis

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.940
usually for any strategic
planning of interactions

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.120
between changes in land
use and interaction

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.460
between land use and
demand in the future.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.290
And it basically needs
to capture or have, like,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.470
an insight into the future of
the network and of the region.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.700
The next range is
basically or the next class

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.750
of planning activities
is basically

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.000
the medium range activities.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.080
Medium range activities include
bus network structure design,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.190
network size design and
improvement, fleet size,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.020
fare policy and technology.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.590
It basically involves
incremental or medium

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.865
improvement to the system
and to the transit service.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.750
One point that I need to mention
about the long range and medium

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.900
range is that
these two, although

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
are really important
in the planning

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.330
practice for
transportation systems,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.400
but these decisions are usually
done at the upper level--

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.090
at the higher lever than
the transit authority.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.190
For example, long
range decisions

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.890
are usually done
in collaboration

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.700
between NPO's metropolitan
planning organizations,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.530
state departments
of transportation,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.910
and transit authorities.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.490
So the transit authority is
not the final decision maker

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.630
in that case.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.940
And it needs close interaction
and close collaboration

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.190
with the higher
level organizations

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.309
and governmental agencies
to make the final decisions.

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:02.600
So that's about the long range.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.760
Medium range is also
somehow similar.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.500
It usually, for
example, the decisions

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.740
that are related to the network
structure, although there

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.050
is a lot of interesting research
going on in universities that

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.680
deals with optimization of
network design and optimization

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.760
of the structure of the
network, because what happens

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.750
in practice is that usually
in the networks that we live

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.830
and in current cities, the
actual layout and structure

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.760
of the network is already given.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.300
And it's usually rare
or impossible that we

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.630
start from scratch and start to
design a network from scratch

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.490
to begin with.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.660
So therefore, what
we usually observe

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.620
is incremental changes to
the network and addition

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.210
or elimination of some routes
from the service and basically,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.184
decisions that are
related to that.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:06:59.492
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:06:59.492 --> 00:07:00.575
NEEMA NASSIR: Yes, please.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:02.700
AUDIENCE: In terms
of fleet size,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.710
could that come as a
request from the agencies?

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.320
Like, an agency says,
we have a bus line.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.200
It's at capacity
or over capacity.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.790
We need more buses.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.670
Could it come, like, from a
request to the higher level?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.020
NEEMA NASSIR: Yes, definitely.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:23.060
Yeah, but it eventually requires
the interaction on those,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.380
so securing the funding
from the upper level

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.010
governmental agencies--

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.820
so yeah.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.440
So the reason that
I'm explaining this

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.000
is that I'd like for you to
understand why we are focusing

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.030
on short range decision-making
and short range planning

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.130
practice in this course.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.480
That's mainly because the bulk
part of activities at transit

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.490
agencies is related to short
range planning and short range

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.430
decision-making.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.990
So what we mean by short
range decision-making

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.890
are decisions that are
usually made more frequently

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.560
than a yearly basis.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.830
And they basically
entail decisions

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.740
about the structures
of the route--

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.990
layout of the route--
layout of the stops--

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:22.380
and basically decisions about
the frequency of service--

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.520
timetable-- and vehicle
and crew scheduling.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:33.210
Despite the top two
classes of decision-making

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:39.659
that are usually driven
by political and economic

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.210
considerations, short
range decision making

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:49.890
and control activities are
usually basically driven

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.110
by cost optimization.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.590
And these are basically
tactical decisions as opposed

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.620
to strategic decisions that
are usually in the long range

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.170
and medium range.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:07.960
So then there's real time
and control decision-making,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.100
which is basically
usually done currently

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.890
in using expert decision
and expert activities.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.790
There is an ongoing
effort in the technology

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.580
to improve the
quality of control--

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.850
ongoing research to
use real time data

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.060
and improve the real
time performance

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.070
by using real time control.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.380
This includes revisions
of the routes.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.300
That could be the
case in reaction

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.390
to incidents and
disruption situation.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.960
It could also relate to holding
and dispatching decisions--

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.460
thank you--

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.700
that could actually
be used to improve

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:11.550
the effective capacity of the
system by trying to regulate--

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:18.730
have a better frequency,
basically, in the service.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:26.470
So similar to the
typical planning problem,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.780
there are major
elements in planning

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.750
for public transportation
and particularly

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:37.930
in short term and short
range decision-making.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.380
It includes data
collection similar to what

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.750
you guys have done in your
homework assignment number 2.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.660
Collection of data on demand,
collection of data on supply,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.790
and interaction of
supply on demand

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.660
is an essential part to be able
to make decisions and make them

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.040
basically reliable and
actionable intelligence

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.740
for the decision-making process.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.630
Then there should be
analysis on identification

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.960
of potential problems and
identification of opportunities

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.210
to improve the situation.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.900
And then there is
the creative part

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.050
of design of options,
solution, and strategies

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.000
to address the situation.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.180
And then typical to
any economic analysis,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.880
there would be an
element of cost

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:37.450
and benefit estimation to be
able to justify the project.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.810
So in terms of operational
planning process

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:49.030
or in another term short
range planning process,

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.450
there are multiple stages
involved in the work.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:58.450
And usually, what happens
is that in practice,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.050
it is proven that the
planning procedure

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.580
can be decomposed into
sequential decision-making

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.080
processes.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:14.860
And although it is
possible to formulate

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.850
all of these decisions into one
gigantic optimization problem

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.210
and solve it for all
the decision variables

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.910
that you need to basically
address, however,

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.180
the practice has
shown that there's

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.300
a nice way of
decomposing the process

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.170
and to solve problems and solve
them sequentially in order

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.390
to make sure that
you're satisfying

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.660
all the constraints
to the accurate level

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.290
and you're gaining the--

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.050
you finally get a
realistic optimal solution

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:54.700
for your planning practice.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:02.850
Considerations regarding
policy constraints and some

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.500
of the economic
concerns are usually

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.630
difficult to formulate
into optimization problems.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.090
But there are
published guidelines

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.590
by governmental agencies
that you can basically

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.740
follow and make sure
that at least the top two

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.390
level of the decision-making
processes and tasks

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.710
here are basically done
to the satisfactory level.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.760
So let's go ahead and start
and review these tasks.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.380
There are lectures
in this course that

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.730
are dealing with each
one of these tasks

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.610
and components in planning.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.060
But in this lecture,
I'll just briefly

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.850
go over these
different components

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:56.000
as an introductory
part of the course.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.460
So for every
optimization problem

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.435
or in this case
planning process,

00:14:06.435 --> 00:14:08.040
we have a set of inputs--

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.390
constraints-- basically,
that you need to satisfy.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.790
And then there's an
objective function

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.880
that you need to
optimize-- so inputs.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:24.840
So the first component of
the planning and practice

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.060
here is bus route design.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.860
This includes design
of layout of the routes

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.700
and layout of the stops.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.030
And basically, the
input into this task

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.040
includes constraints that are
related to right-of-way roadway

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.640
constraints, like if there
is a river in your network,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.900
there's this connectivity.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.580
There are bridges-- tunnels.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.120
So these are the kind of
constraints at network level

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.310
that you would like to satisfy.

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.980
And there's also demand
constraints in the network

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.380
that you need to
consider for this task,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:07.140
like, you have a sense of what's
the demand from certain suburb

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.500
to the downtown area.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.450
And you basically would
like to have a route

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.470
system that kind of
can address that demand

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.090
and satisfy that demand.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:23.521
Then the solution to the
design component and that task

00:15:23.521 --> 00:15:25.020
[INAUDIBLE] out of
routes and layout

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.650
of the stops that are
basically resulting

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:32.440
from the first
component, and then

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.980
the set of routes
and stops will be

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.560
input into the second task,
which is setting timetables.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.150
This task includes finding
frequencies for the routes

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:50.040
and from that identifying
and defining--

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.260
basically, generating
the timetables

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.410
based on frequencies.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:59.250
There are usually considerations
related to policy headways,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.850
policy frequencies, and
capacity frequencies

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.240
that need to be
addressed in this task.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.660
But again, this task
is also somehow dealt

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.450
with using the
existing guidelines

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.380
and just satisfying
these guidelines.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.400
The input and other
constraints that

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.920
are considered for
this task would

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.680
be level of service
guidelines, and again,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.360
the demand constraints
in the network.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:35.940
Then from the set of timetables,
what will be resulted here

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.530
is the departure times that
was scheduled for the service.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:45.900
So the first two components
of row 1 and row 2,

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.580
basically, are dealing
with satisfying the demand

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.280
and satisfying the guidelines.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.600
But once you go beyond
the first two components,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.914
it becomes to the
level that you know

00:16:57.914 --> 00:17:01.050
kind of what's the service
you want to deliver.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.150
And then you're dealing
with tactical decision--

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:08.579
how you can optimize the cost
of delivering this service

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.180
and improve efficiency.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.589
So did the third row
here basically deals

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:17.369
with the departure
times that are

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:19.470
given for all the
routes in the network

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.500
and for all times of day.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.180
And then what you
need to do is how

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.079
you want to allocate
your resources in terms

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:33.210
of allocate the
vehicles to the system

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.940
to make sure that
that service is

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:41.190
going to be delivered on time.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:45.680
So that would be the task
of vehicle scheduling input

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.830
into that task or
constraints that are involved

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:54.080
or running times on different
segments of the route

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.930
and also the departure times
that are given from upper level

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.580
decision-making process.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.730
And it will eventually
result into a schedule

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.020
of given buses in terms of
what are specific trips they

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.020
need to serve and what's
the sequence of these trips.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:16.660
Then the output from that
decision with the vehicle

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:22.450
schedules into the task
of scheduling for drivers,

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.890
this task also include
input from operator

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.950
and basically work
union constraints,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.540
like maximum shift hours
and, for example, like,

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.870
break times and lunchtimes
and maximum separation

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.130
between two shifts.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.050
And there are rules
and regulations

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.430
that are related to that.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:50.770
And this task, again, is a
task of allocating resources

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.240
to minimize the cost
of scheduling drivers

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.000
to deliver the service.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.520
And the result would be
the schedules for the crew.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.450
So then these decisions can
be looked at in another way,

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:13.170
too, like, we can further
classify these decisions

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.470
into service planning decisions
and operational planning

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.030
decision.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.880
Service planning decisions
would be the decisions

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.790
that define service as it
is perceived and understood

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.700
by public.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.160
This is basically
the part of service

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.435
that is visible to the public.

00:19:32.435 --> 00:19:33.810
And then there
are decisions that

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.660
are related to operations,
which basically

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.290
defines how operations occur
to produce the service.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.770
This is somehow a black
box to the passengers.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.390
And yeah, basically,
the passengers

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.140
should not really care
what's the vehicle's schedule

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.950
and what's the crew's schedule
that is assigned to the trip,

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.572
as long as trip is being
delivered as it is scheduled.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.100
So in terms of other
characteristics

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.670
of these decisions,
we, basically,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:18.790
for network design frequency
setting time table development,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.320
vehicle scheduling,
and crew scheduling,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:28.570
the decisions that are involved
in planning, basically,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.840
starting from top to bottom
frequency of decisions,

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.140
basically are increased.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:40.570
And the scope of
decision-making into the future

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:44.545
is basically become
limited and smaller.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:55.360
And also, the decision-making
in the network design frequency

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.110
setting and timetabling
is basically

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.650
made based on guidelines
and standards.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.700
And decision-making on the
lower level-- vehicle scheduling

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.220
and crew scheduling--
is made usually

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.650
based on optimization of cost.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:18.230
And then given the nature of the
decision-making, the tools that

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.480
are used and the
techniques that are

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.150
used for solving these planning
decision-making processes

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:33.160
are basically ranging from
judgments and manual analysis

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.250
that is more dominated
into computer tools that

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.420
are basically designed to
solve optimization problems

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.000
for minimizing the cost.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:52.080
So similar to the classical
evaluation structure,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.910
when you're dealing with
planning questions and planning

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.400
projects or planning
alternatives,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.950
there's this structure that
starts with goals, objectives,

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.740
measures, and standards
or guidelines.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:15.300
So let's just make a quick
practice and define a goal

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.520
and then define
objectives for that goal,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.010
and define measures
based on that,

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:32.170
and see how a standard can be
defined to make that planning

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.130
decision acceptable.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:40.920
So let's define a goal.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.180
Does anyone have any suggestion?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.648
What is an important goal for
public transportation system?

00:22:58.648 --> 00:23:00.256
AUDIENCE: Maximize ridership.

00:23:00.256 --> 00:23:02.870
NEEMA NASSIR: Maximize
ridership, yes.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:10.020
So let's say you want
to maximize ridership.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.520
That's your research
problem, right?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.000
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLING]

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.480
NEEMA NASSIR: [CHUCKLING]

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.330
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.810
[LAUGHTER] So then in
terms of objectives,

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.330
what would be an objective
that we can define for this?

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:31.830
I would say probably
the peak hour demand

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.380
could be one
objective or peak hour

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.660
ridership in certain corridor.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:47.600
Let's say peak hour ridership
per weekday per month.

00:23:56.625 --> 00:24:00.100
Well, peak hour ridership
would be the objective here.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.850
And then the measure
that you would define

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.170
would be peak hour ridership
per weekday per month.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:16.310
And then the standard
that you want to define

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:22.670
would be something
that not only captures

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:26.090
the demand side, but also the
supply of the system, too.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.445
So you would come up
with probably, like--

00:24:30.445 --> 00:24:31.070
I would, like--

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.320
AUDIENCE: Riders per vehicle--

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.570
riders per mile-- per hour.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.840
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.210
Or let's say, like,
60% of capacity.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:47.160
Like, your standard
in this case would

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:54.010
be your peak hour ridership
should be greater than 60%

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.020
of capacity.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.590
So this was just
an example that we

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.150
tried to work out one practice
for evaluation structure.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.430
But let me give you another
example that is actually

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:10.030
used in the practice.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.900
So assume that we
are considering

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:20.250
the goal of reliability
in the transit system.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:25.130
The goal of reliability
would be considered

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:32.570
one of the main
goals because if we

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.850
have a reliable public
transport system, you can secure

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.140
and you can guarantee
a body of demand

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.970
in your network that can
rely on your transit system

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:56.740
and basically adapt to
the lifestyle of using

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.830
public transport.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.160
And that's beneficial
to the system

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.160
from different perspectives.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.450
So the objective
that we can define

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:15.712
for reliability in this
case would be possibly--

00:26:15.712 --> 00:26:17.170
can you come up
with some objective

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:22.210
that we can define with the
goal of improving reliability?

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.650
AUDIENCE: On-time performance.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.275
NEEMA NASSIR: On-time
performance, yes.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.940
So on-time performance
would be the objective.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.850
And then we need to
define a measure for this

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:42.690
to be able to measure
that objective

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.680
for each one of the
scenarios and for each one

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.440
of the alternative plans.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.112
So what would be a measure
for on-time performance?

00:26:55.112 --> 00:27:01.407
AUDIENCE: Characterizing with
our car driving [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.407 --> 00:27:02.740
within a certain amount of time.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.823
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yeah.

00:27:03.823 --> 00:27:10.680
So let's say percentage
of on-time arrivals.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.130
So we would say percentage
of on-time arrivals,

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.470
and we would define
on-time arrivals

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:24.470
to be between 0 and 5
minutes of the schedule.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.900
And then the standard
that many of the agencies

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:39.400
use to measure this would
be 90% or 95%, basically.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:52.020
So this way, the
transit agency can

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.330
go ahead and evaluate the
performance of the operators

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.810
of the system who
basically are running

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:04.260
some part of the service
and come back to them

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.550
and say, OK, your performance
in terms of reliability

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.220
has been acceptable or not.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:10.720
Please.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.753
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
something [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:15.753 --> 00:28:22.891
Or would it be just standard
operating procdedure

00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:24.655
they were planning as well.

00:28:24.655 --> 00:28:27.450
And their reliability
was somewhere around 80%,

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.127
and now the goal is
to achieve a 10% gain.

00:28:30.127 --> 00:28:30.960
NEEMA NASSIR: Mm-hm.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.460
AUDIENCE: And comparing that
with the previous one would

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:34.774
be a benchmark again.

00:28:34.774 --> 00:28:35.940
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:41.610
So another measure would be
percentage improvements as

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.320
compared to baseline.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.790
And then the transit agency
can define a standard

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.160
of at least 10%
improvement to the baseline

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.130
should be required
for reliability.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.840
Yep, thank you.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:04.290
So then one other
interesting point

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.620
that actually comes to mind
looking at the existing

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.860
guidelines is that on-time
arrivals are usually

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.980
defined for 0 to 5.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.220
That basically means
that you consider

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.290
a bus that is late by two
minutes to be on time.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.520
But a bus that is
early by one minute

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.360
is not considered to be on time.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.990
Does anyone have any
comments about this--

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.550
why we do not consider
early arrivals on time?

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.612
AUDIENCE: I think
misconnections for people

00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:39.877
who expected to be there
at a certain time, but--

00:29:39.877 --> 00:29:40.960
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yeah.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.820
AUDIENCE: --they left.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.330
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.663
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] connected.

00:29:43.663 --> 00:29:45.040
NEEMA NASSIR: So
it can be proved

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:51.330
that based on typical
assumptions about passenger

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:57.120
arrivals, early arrivals
of buses and service

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.000
is usually more negative
as later arrivals.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.540
Let's make an example here.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:09.960
For example, let's assume
under uniform arrivals

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.490
of passengers--

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.070
let's assume if
this is my scheduled

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.790
arrivals over the
axis of time and this

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:24.480
is my number of passengers
waiting in the bus stop

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:30.900
under uniform
arrivals, [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.520
you have some
accumulation of passengers

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.810
that are waiting at the stop.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:48.370
And then what happens is that if
one of these buses are early--

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:53.120
let's say it basically
arrives at this time--

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.350
what happens is that
the amount of time

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:59.500
that we are saving
due to this arrival

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.670
is basically less than
the amount of time that

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:09.700
will be added to our waiting
time for the next trip.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.200
And that's because the number
of people who are experiencing

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.140
this is a little higher--

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.080
number of people
that experience it,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.110
saying, the additional
waiting time

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:23.300
is higher than number
of people who are

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.410
experiencing the early arrival.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.960
And it cuts to
their waiting time.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:39.130
So if you compare these two
areas, that basically tells you

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.240
you're basically
having a loss or having

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.360
an increase in waiting time
if your service is early.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.210
And then the situation
becomes worse--

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.920
indicates that you suggested--
when people are coordinating

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.550
with the system--

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.240
for example, it
is assumed that--

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.340
and it can actually be proven
by looking at the data, too--

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.420
people make the transition
to coordinated behavior

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:10.740
and coordination with the
schedule as the frequency

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.110
of service increases.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:17.640
For example, for a
service that is scheduled

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.380
to be delivered every half
hour or every one hour,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.810
it is expected
that passengers are

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.995
coordinating with the
system and coordinating

00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:34.500
their arrivals with the
departure of the buses.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.450
But when it comes to
more frequent service,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:45.537
then we will have
more uniform arrivals.

00:32:45.537 --> 00:32:47.120
So in that case,
what we would observe

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.490
is that passengers arrivals
would resemble something

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:50.175
like this.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:01.390
Well, it has to go up to
here, the original case.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:07.690
And then in that case if
your service early by five

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:13.150
or 10 minutes, you will have
the main bulk of your passengers

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:17.500
who need to wait another
headway, basically.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.820
So this should be actually
added to your computation, too.

00:33:24.114 --> 00:33:25.530
Is there any
questions about this?

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:43.150
So in terms of the advantage of
guidelines in transit planning,

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.230
one of the main purposes
of these guidelines

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.930
is to communicate to
the public the rationale

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.510
and the logic behind
your decision-making

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.990
and behind your allocation
of resources to the system.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.470
It also gives you a
consistent and fair basis

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.360
for decision-making.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:07.260
And it is somehow gives you a
tool to justify your decisions

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.320
and also a tool to make
sure that your decisions are

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.830
fair and justified in nature.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.949
It also gives you
the opportunity

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:22.080
to balance the improvement and
the investments to the network

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.040
and gain a uniform level
of service improvement

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.620
for efficient service.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:34.030
So the guidelines that are
existing in the literature

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.570
and in the practice, basically--
in the state of practice--

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:42.940
are dealing with the
design of service

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.860
and with the
delivery of service.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.360
So the design of service
basically dealing

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.489
with variables that
are related to spacing

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.360
and density of stops,
spacing and density of trips,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.410
and frequency of the service
as it is designed and as it

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:03.830
is in the schedule.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:05.500
So there are guidelines
related to that.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:09.160
And there is also guidelines
related to how you deliver

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.820
or how the transit agency
delivers the design service

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:18.340
and how the performance
actually took place.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:24.570
So the main factors of service
design and service quality

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.590
from the passenger's
perspective are basically

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.620
reported by transit
capacity and quality

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:38.340
of service manual of the
Transportation Research Board.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:45.360
And it basically includes
frequency of the service as one

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:51.090
of the main aspects or
factors that are defining

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:52.410
the quality of service--

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.050
waiting time,
reliability, and access.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:59.130
This is access over time
and also access over space.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.970
So why do we again have
both frequency and waiting

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.990
time in here?

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:11.340
So if frequency and waiting
time are kind of interrelated,

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:17.460
how come there are two separate
items here on the list here?

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.070
Does anyone have any
suggestions about this?

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.990
So let me go ahead and
explain how I understand this.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:43.600
Frequency of the service
is important not only

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.550
in terms of the waiting time--

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.500
that could be
associated with that--

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.041
but also when it comes to lower
frequency system and longer

00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:52.540
headways.

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.360
The waiting time is not a
function of frequency anymore.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:04.010
It basically, as we
discussed, the waiting time

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:08.450
could actually be
independent of frequency.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:12.280
However, in those cases, there
is a burden of coordination

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.900
that is imposed
to the passenger.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.060
So if you have to coordinate
your arrival, for example,

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.280
in the morning
from home to work,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.190
then there is some
sort of inconvenience

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:29.740
that is imposed to you
to basically make it

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.980
to your coordinated schedule.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.930
And then waiting time
is also important

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:41.100
because if the
service is frequent

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.640
but at different
ranges of frequency,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.800
you may experience
different waiting time

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.830
if the process of
arrivals of passenger

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.060
is assumed to be
a random process.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.340
Then reliability
as we discussed is

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.940
one of the important
features and one

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.350
of the important
aspects of the service.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:08.230
It usually is a measure
based on on-time arrivals

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.430
of the service.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:16.340
And then the next
aspect that is important

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.630
is access to origins
and destinations.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.560
This access can be
interpreted in two ways.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.820
We can look at access in terms
of space and in terms of time.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.290
Access in terms of space is
closeness to the bus stops

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.490
and closeness to the
service from origin

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.930
and from the destination.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.810
Access in terms of time would
be the span of service--

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.000
when you like to travel--

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.125
and basically, what
is the service time

00:38:45.125 --> 00:38:48.115
and available times of service.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.390
So yeah, as I
mentioned, most agencies

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.000
have guidelines covering
a span of service.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.250
For example, MBTA
has this guideline

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:07.850
that for weekdays, you need to
have service from all suburbs

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:13.130
into the CBD area with--

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.910
at least, like, at latest,
arrives at 7:00 AM.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.620
So you need to basically be
able to cover between 7:00

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:28.760
AM and 6:00 PM as your
services span in MBTA.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.080
For TransLink, it's
also somehow the same.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.750
You need to-- basically,
minimum service guidelines

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.810
to ensure that 95%
of trips listed

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.620
can be completed in the
time span given below.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.210
Like, from any point
to downtown Vancouver,

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:51.980
you need to have service
that can actually

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.170
arrive in downtown
Vancouver by 7:00

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:59.090
AM, for people who should
start their work at 7:00 AM.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:03.890
And then there's also
trips in the evening.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:09.110
And it basically says earliest
departure time of mass transit

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.840
trip in the evening
from downtown Vancouver

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.320
to any town center needs
to be midnight for people

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.540
who basically
would like to enjoy

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:21.090
the nightlife in
the downtown area

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.180
and then use transit
to go back home.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.740
So in terms of route
design and in terms

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.480
of layout of routes
and stops, there

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.290
are also guidelines that are
addressing this decision.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.410
MBTA has a policy objective
to provide transit service

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:45.070
within walking distance,
which is defined a quarter

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.760
mile of all residents that are
living in area with population

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.230
densities greater than 5,000
people per square mile.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:58.150
That's basically an
interesting guideline.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.860
It considers two
different variables.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.530
One is the population density.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:07.420
And the other one is the
density of the stops or vicinity

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.850
or walkability of
transit in areas

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:17.290
that are populated with
densities greater than 5,000

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.440
per square mile.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:25.530
So in terms of
comprehensiveness objective,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:30.030
TransLink basically has very
comprehensive guidelines

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:36.900
related to basically a set of
different performance measures

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.590
and goals.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:43.260
Let me read from these.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.410
At least 90% of our
residents and employees

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:48.120
in urbanized
development areas should

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:52.500
have a walk less than
450 meters to a bus stop.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:57.420
So this is related
to access over space.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.275
98%--

00:41:58.275 --> 00:42:01.350
AUDIENCE: When they say 90%
of residents and employees,

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.010
basically they're looking
at that person twice.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.150
The person is on
one end, a resident,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.640
and on the other
end, an employee.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.200
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yes.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.235
AUDIENCE: So it's-- OK.

00:42:11.235 --> 00:42:15.740
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, you want to
consider both ends of the trip,

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.380
right?

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.110
And these percentages
are a little tricky.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.540
Sometimes they're counting
the number of people-- number

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.170
of residents.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:25.200
Sometimes they're
counting OD pairs.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.180
Sometimes they're
counting passengers.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:33.270
So it's a little tricky to
interpret these correctly.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.350
So the second one basically says
98% of all peak period transit

00:42:37.350 --> 00:42:39.720
trips to and from
downtown Vancouver

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:43.560
should require no more
than one transfer.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.930
That basically is 98% of
people who are traveling from

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.430
and to downtown to the suburbs.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.800
And so it may be a little
difficult, especially

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.700
in the absence of AFC data--

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.610
Automated Fare
Collection system data.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:08.270
It can be a little tricky
to measure these objectives.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.890
What's usually
done, basically, is

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:16.980
people go out and basically
ask from transit riders

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.720
about their origins
and destinations.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.510
It's called Public Transit
Origin Destination Survey

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.530
that is usually done on board.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:24.874
Do you have a question?

00:43:24.874 --> 00:43:25.374
OK.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:31.600
So the second
measure here relates

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.820
to connectivity in the network.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.290
The third one is 95%
of all peak period

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.990
transit trips to the
nearest town centers

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:42.980
should require no more
than one transfer.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:47.630
Again, this one is also related
to connectivity of the network.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.670
And fourth one is all trips
between one town center

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:55.270
and adjacent town centers
should require no transfers.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.530
Again, this one is a
guideline on connectivity.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:04.390
And then again, the last
one is also on connectivity.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:09.160
It basically requires that
95% of all peak period transit

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.300
trips to major regional
activity centers and gateways

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.820
should require no more
than two transfers.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.940
OK, so any questions
or comments about this?

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.911
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:44:21.911 --> 00:44:24.370
AUDIENCE: In terms of one
connectivity between one town

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:28.290
center and adjacent town
center, definition of a town

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.550
varies from place to place.

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:29.960
NEEMA NASSIR: Mm-hm.

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:31.830
AUDIENCE: I know that
specifically Vancouver

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.770
has rather large suburbs--

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:36.240
like, suburbs of
100,000 people--

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.230
200,000 people.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:41.770
So you actually have a
few municipal entities

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:42.479
for a large area.

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.311
NEEMA NASSIR: Mm-hm.

00:44:43.311 --> 00:44:46.110
AUDIENCE: But you can have
areas where that condition would

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.900
be a little bit too strict
if you have, let's say,

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.030
the Boston area,
which is generally

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.760
slightly smaller suburbs
and more suburbs to connect.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.500
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yeah.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.380
So some of these may
actually be a little tricky

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.765
to measure and to quantify.

00:45:00.765 --> 00:45:01.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.656
And they're able to compare.

00:45:02.656 --> 00:45:03.660
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when I
see these numbers, then I

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:11.592
try to think about equity, and,
like, the 10% that is not 450--

00:45:11.592 --> 00:45:12.425
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:45:12.425 --> 00:45:13.360
AUDIENCE: --is it from that or--

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:13.910
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:14.400
AUDIENCE: --a bus station--

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:14.730
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:15.630
AUDIENCE: --[INAUDIBLE] the 5% .

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.464
NEEMA NASSIR: Mm-hm.

00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:18.880
AUDIENCE: So how do you navigate
these types of trade-offs

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.565
in the face of equity.

00:45:21.565 --> 00:45:22.690
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.910
This is a really good point.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.220
Some of these
percentages, I think,

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.180
are related to random variables.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:34.360
And those are somehow
acceptable because that's

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.570
when you try to define
a confidence interval.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.170
But when it comes
to cases like this,

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.490
it is not a random
variable anymore.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:50.470
It's basically like a special
variable that constantly

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:55.270
requires a certain amount of
connections to the downtown

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.380
area, right?

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.760
So that may be one of the
loopholes of this guideline.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.490
That's a really good
point because one

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.440
may argue that if
95% of my OD pairs

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.160
are connected with the minimum
connectivity requirement,

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.230
what about the rest of 5%?

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:18.160
Does it mean that all people
who live in that 5% area

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.950
will have to go through the
unacceptable connectivity

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.360
situation?

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.530
So that's a valid point.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.450
And thank you for
bringing that up.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.910
AUDIENCE: Does Vancouver
actually achieve these goals?

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.814
It seems kind of implausible--
kind of difficult to--

00:46:34.814 --> 00:46:35.790
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:36.936
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:36.936 --> 00:46:41.790
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, well,
these are basically usually

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:47.160
for projects and plans
that are being proposed

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.190
for-- or like small
start projects

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.470
or for improvement plans.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.120
So I think what they try
to do is to make sure

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:01.740
that the ones that are being
accepted and being implemented

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.330
would satisfy this.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.960
But I'm not really sure if
the existing network satisfy

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.370
all these conditions or not.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:09.407
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:09.407 --> 00:47:11.502
AUDIENCE: Sorry, is
TransLink the name

00:47:11.502 --> 00:47:12.710
of the agency that runs the--

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.850
NEEMA NASSIR: Yes, right.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.800
Yeah, right.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.680
OK, so any other questions?

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.660
All right.

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:31.300
So then TransLink
guideline on route design

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.520
is very interesting, too.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:35.880
They have really
interesting logic

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.770
to validate the design
and the improvements that

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.290
are proposed for route design.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:46.710
So what it says is that
deviations from the most direct

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.760
route must have walking
time savings for customers

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.560
on the added route
section greater

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.590
than the increase
in total travel time

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.120
for through passengers.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:03.820
So does anyone have
any interpretation--

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.455
quick interpretation--
on this guideline?

00:48:08.455 --> 00:48:11.800
AUDIENCE: The only reason is
[INAUDIBLE] a major destination

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:14.710
where people [INAUDIBLE]
or otherwise people

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:20.500
are going straight and what
[INAUDIBLE] people on buses.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.940
So the second to the
last stop on the route,

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.800
may be you make that
deviation to have

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.890
people on the bus [INAUDIBLE]
traffic [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:27.760
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.760
Yeah.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:29.340
Right.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.339
You have a comment, too?

00:48:30.339 --> 00:48:31.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:31.876 --> 00:48:33.440
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yeah.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:39.110
So if you look at the problem
or look at the situation

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.630
from the perspective of system
and from the perspective

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.860
of total travel time in the
system, what they basically

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.590
are requiring is
that, for example,

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.260
let's assume that I
have a suburb here.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.330
And then this is
my downtown area.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.810
And there is a route here
that has multiple stops.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.600
And then there's
another suburb here,

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.350
which, in the original plan
is being served by this route.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:08.990
However, it requires a walking
link to different stops.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:14.090
What this guideline basically
requires is that if the total

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:18.050
travel time for all passengers
for traveling from here to here

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:21.770
and for all that are traveling
from here to here is going

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:29.870
to be increased, then you cannot
justify an additional detour

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:34.670
here to serve this area, meaning
that if the total travel time

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:41.930
saving that is done on the
walking time of these people is

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.890
not as much as total increase in
travel time of people that are

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:49.440
traveling from this
suburb to this suburb,

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.160
then you cannot justify
the design or the re-route.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.810
So in terms of
guidelines related

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:07.050
to a schedule and guidelines
related to frequency

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:11.070
and timetable, we
basically, in practice there

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:14.790
are two main
components-- component

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:20.220
that is related to the policy
of design and components

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:22.260
that is related to the
crowding situation.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:26.190
Policy of design basically
dictate a minimum headway

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:30.300
or basically a minimal
frequency or maximum

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.510
headway for the service.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.940
And that's basically
the case when

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.670
there is no crowding situation.

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:44.640
However, in the main corridors
and in peak directions,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:50.400
we usually would go beyond
the service of policy headway

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.780
because we need to
accommodate the demand.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:02.070
And that's basically how the
maximum passenger crowding

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.830
guides come into play.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:13.890
So in terms of the actual
guideline on policy of headway

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.530
for MBTA, we have
maximum headway

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.710
on all local bus routes
should be 30 minutes in peak

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:21.360
and 60 minutes at other times.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.880
For express routes, there
should be at least three trips

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.820
in each peak period.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.720
So let's discuss a little
bit more about this.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.340
Why do you think that we need
to have a policy headway--

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.000
maximum policy headway?

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.610
If we are considering
the demand and we

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.900
are trying to satisfy the
demand by number of vehicles

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:52.130
that we are assigning
to the route,

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.541
then why should we
care about a minimum?

00:51:54.541 --> 00:51:55.040
Do you--

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.315
AUDIENCE: Because if the
demand is really low,

00:51:59.315 --> 00:52:01.729
that person-- you can't
make him wait forever.

00:52:01.729 --> 00:52:02.520
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.765
AUDIENCE: You'll have
to serve him equitably.

00:52:03.765 --> 00:52:05.280
NEEMA NASSIR: Exactly, yeah.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.775
Again, the equity issue and the
accessibility issue, basically.

00:52:09.775 --> 00:52:11.400
AUDIENCE: And there
are also, you know,

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.520
still elderly people who
don't use smartphones

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.590
to coordinate their
arrival at the bus

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:17.930
stop when the bus is coming.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:18.540
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:21.040
AUDIENCE: And you don't want
to make them wait indefinitely.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.050
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, exactly.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.550
Right.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:30.460
OK, and then when it comes
to considerations related

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.680
to the crowding,
we have guidelines

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.440
about maximum crowding
and maximum expectation

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:40.550
of crowding that would
dictate a minimum frequency

00:52:40.550 --> 00:52:41.740
for the service.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.730
For example, for Green line,
the maximum passengers per car

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:51.950
should be no more than 225% of
the seats in the peak period.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.110
In the off peak, the
maximum passengers

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.450
should be no more than
the seated capacity,

00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:00.610
except in the central subway,
which can go up to 140%.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:09.490
Yeah, so here is the
TransLink guideline

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.500
on frequency objective.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:17.080
It basically defines different
headways based on time of days

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:22.600
and based on modes of transit
that the transit agencies

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.005
and operators of the
system need to satisfy.

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:35.850
So in terms of guaranteeing
that the load and the crowding

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.940
situation is addressed
in the guideline that

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:44.070
is related to frequency,
there is some analysis

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:51.180
that is done to make sure that
your frequency is high enough

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.630
that your crowding
situation does not

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:56.490
exceed a certain level.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.480
Why do we care about the loads
and the crowding situation?

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.820
The first reason is
that we do not want

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.740
to frequently deny to board.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.830
That would yield to
increased travel time.

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:16.170
And we would like to basically
avoid higher dwell time that is

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.620
associated with higher
number of boardings--

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.070
alighting number of
wheelchairs on board--

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:28.800
that would eventually, again,
increase the running time.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.160
For example, in the acceptable--

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.780
in a regular
standard 40-foot bus

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.960
the acceptable load of 70
passengers are considered.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.330
However, the average that we
estimate based on our design

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.300
should not exceed 55 passengers.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.640
So that's the case
of indeterminacy

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.770
and the confidence intervals
that we kind of allow

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.300
in the analysis.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:00.750
However, it's a little
different with the equity issue

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:05.700
that you mentioned in this case
because you want to make sure

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.810
that to a certain
degree of confidence

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:15.130
your system is performing at
an acceptable crowding level.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.760
The variability to
demand could actually

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.030
relate to bulk arrivals
or group arrivals

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:27.450
that may happen at
once due to exchanges

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:30.120
from different service.

00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:35.280
Or it could actually relate to
the variability in the headway

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:39.720
or variability in the nature
of demand based on day of week,

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:43.470
based on seasonality, based
on the weather condition,

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.810
and so on and so forth.

00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:52.640
Then the other objective in
the guideline of TransLink

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.020
is the objective of comfort.

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.440
And it basically deals,
again, with the crowding level

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:04.040
or the design crowding
level or crowding averages

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:09.380
that we are basically
computing as objectives to be

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.330
tested for this guideline.

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:14.390
As you can see again,
for different peak

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:20.950
periods and different type of
vehicles and type of service,

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:27.530
there is published numbers
in terms of the averages

00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:36.810
or computed averages for
the maximum crowding levels.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.620
So look at these numbers.

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.510
Does anyone have any idea
of why some of these numbers

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:46.780
are larger?

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.570
For example, for peak 15
minutes in AM and PM peak,

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:57.600
you would allow an average
of 60 passengers on-board.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.780
However, when it comes
to computations of peak

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:05.327
30 minutes, you
would only allow 55.

00:57:05.327 --> 00:57:07.701
AUDIENCE: You don't want people
to be left behind because

00:57:07.701 --> 00:57:09.027
of frequency of the services.

00:57:09.027 --> 00:57:13.220
Knowing that there maybe
another hour or service

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:14.456
is another five minutes.

00:57:14.456 --> 00:57:16.440
NEEMA NASSIR: Right,
yeah, that could

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.340
be one reason that actually
yielded to this design.

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.454
Any other thoughts
or suggestions?

00:57:24.454 --> 00:57:27.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the 15
minute peaking limit

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.407
allows you to have one
very full vehicle that

00:57:29.407 --> 00:57:31.198
sort of would skew the
averages [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:31.198 --> 00:57:33.929
and could moderate that.

00:57:33.929 --> 00:57:34.720
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:35.594 --> 00:57:38.069
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, exactly.

00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.610
Yeah, please.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.011
AUDIENCE: Is this like--

00:57:40.011 --> 00:57:42.610
could be, like, a
chicken or egg problem

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:47.020
where the ones the routes were
needed with peak 15 minute

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.585
headway are ones that you
will expect a lot of people.

00:57:50.585 --> 00:57:53.085
Or is it the other way around
where you see a lot of people,

00:57:53.085 --> 00:57:55.810
and then you make
it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:55.810 --> 00:57:57.160
NEEMA NASSIR: Yes, right.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.110
Well, yeah, that's exactly
one of the considerations

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:05.590
in design of a frequency
and design of a schedule.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:10.810
So if I want to reward--

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:14.380
what Ari mentioned-- if you're
computing your average over 15

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:18.910
minutes and then you're
computing your average over 13

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:21.950
minutes and you're observing
a higher crowding level over

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:30.730
the accepted level, then if
the situation becomes more

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:32.620
critical--

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.526
if you're computing
over 30 minutes,

00:58:36.526 --> 00:58:37.900
it's more critical
than if you're

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:41.000
computing over 15 minutes.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.940
So if you observe an
average of high crowding

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.750
level for 30 minutes
or for a longer period,

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:53.560
that is a sign of a
higher actual average

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:57.711
of crowding level.

00:58:57.711 --> 00:58:58.210
Yeah.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:58.630
AUDIENCE: It's funny.

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.850
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, maybe
you explained it better.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:02.099
I shouldn't have rewarded you.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:08.420
So the other objective
that TransLink covers

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.410
is basically the
comfort situation.

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:14.360
This is one of the
interesting ones.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.980
And I do not really
know how it's

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.230
possible to measure
this for a design.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:23.960
It's probably usually being used
in evaluation of the existing

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.920
service.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:30.020
It basically deals
with number of minutes

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:38.480
that you expect from
passengers to be standing--

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.320
maximum number of minutes
of being standing on board.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:45.500
And there's a
level of compliance

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.250
that is defined for each one.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:53.840
For example, you would
allow no more than 95% cases

00:59:53.840 --> 01:00:00.140
that passengers would have
to stand more than 20 minutes

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:01.940
on the trip.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.510
So I can imagine if you
have an existing system

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:09.170
and if you want to
measure this, you

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.220
can go out and
survey these numbers

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:18.090
and compute averages and
compute the distributions.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:24.440
However, if you have a
design which is not in place,

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.940
does anyone have
any thoughts how

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:33.406
you can come up with some sort
of estimation for this case?

01:00:33.406 --> 01:00:35.354
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:35.354 --> 01:00:37.760
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah,
simulation could be

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.970
one possible way of doing this.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:48.566
Simulation of demand could be
one possible way of doing this.

01:00:48.566 --> 01:00:52.570
AUDIENCE: You could check,
like, if it's a train--

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:57.850
I saw the Sky Train there, you
can see where the train fills

01:00:57.850 --> 01:01:00.280
up and then assume
that everyone else--

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.510
everyone that boards
the train afterwards--

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:05.147
if you know how many people
are boarding-- if you have--

01:01:05.147 --> 01:01:05.980
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.720
AUDIENCE: --data to
do that, then you

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.050
can assume that everyone who's
boarding after is standing.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:15.220
And then you can see how many
of them have 20 minutes or more

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.854
left on the journey till
the train [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:17.854 --> 01:01:18.770
NEEMA NASSIR: Exactly.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:19.600
That's a good idea.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.220
So what you're suggesting is
to generate the load profile

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.500
for the line.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.610
And whenever the load is
over the seating capacity,

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:33.170
you measure the
time period on that.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:35.150
So that's a good idea.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.280
Right.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:41.170
So in terms of for Toronto
Transit Commission,

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.320
the loading standards
is something like this.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.330
For different types
of vehicle, you

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:50.840
would allow different
averages for your design.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:55.120
So there is also one
interesting point here.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.330
Why do you think for
low frequency service

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:06.230
you would allow a lower crowding
level or a lower average

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.969
ridership?

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.957
AUDIENCE: If it
was that crowded,

01:02:12.957 --> 01:02:16.217
you would want to add frequency
to better serve people riding.

01:02:16.217 --> 01:02:17.300
NEEMA NASSIR: Right, yeah.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.670
That could be one good answer.

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:24.740
The other reason
that I can imagine

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.530
is that if it's a
low frequency service

01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:30.110
and if someone is denied
boarding to a low frequency

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.780
service, they have
to wait longer.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:37.700
So we would allow a little bit
of a slackness in the design,

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.530
so we would avoid a
situation like that.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.560
OK, so let's stop here.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.720
And then we will
continue through the rest

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:59.620
of the guidelines, particularly
with reliability of service

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:00.220
next week.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.803
AUDIENCE: So there's
a question there?

01:03:01.803 --> 01:03:02.685
NEEMA NASSIR: Right.

01:03:02.685 --> 01:03:03.999
AUDIENCE: I was going to
ask is there a reason why we

01:03:03.999 --> 01:03:05.150
use so many Canadian transits?

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.990
NEEMA NASSIR: Sorry?

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:07.406
AUDIENCE: Is there
a reason why we

01:03:07.406 --> 01:03:09.510
use so many Canadian transits?

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:11.335
NEEMA NASSIR: That's
a good question.

01:03:11.335 --> 01:03:13.400
AUDIENCE: Their public
transportation is better.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.430
NEEMA NASSIR: Yeah, better--
probably the closest place

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.720
that has better
public transportation.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.670
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
