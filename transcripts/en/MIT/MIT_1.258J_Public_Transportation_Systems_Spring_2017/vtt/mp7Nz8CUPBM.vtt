00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.580
PROFESSOR: But today, we'll
start with the customer

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.320
information one, which I
really will admit that probably

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.660
some of you folks know
more about this than I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.100
do at this point.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.930
But what I'm going
to do is cover

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.580
the trends that
have been happening

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.050
in the last couple of years.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.160
And then I'd like to get into
a discussion, towards the end,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.140
about where we should go.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.030
Because where we're starting
to do some research on this.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.000
Apar, who's usually
in the class, who's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.400
doing some stuff here.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.170
And we can talk a little
bit more about this.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.600
This is the outline essentially
just saying where we've been

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
and where we're going and
some ideas, essentially--

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
both my personal
ones and others'.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.280
This is actually a
lecture that started --

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
The first version of this
was done by Nigel Wilson.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810
So I gotta give him a
lot of credit for this.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.120
And then we've evolved
it, as it went,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.550
over the last several years.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.740
So this is a spectrum of
components of customer

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.010
information-- or characteristics
of customer information,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.720
really--

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.270
and how it's evolved from what
transit agencies are providing

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.510
to their customers.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.170
On the left is what
was the old stuff.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.800
On the right is
where it's going.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.140
And it's not all there yet.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.650
But generally, things have
been moving, and fairly quickly

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.100
in the last couple of
years, from an operator

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.960
view to a customer view.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.360
Operators used to
just tell people

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:25.769
what their schedule was and
barely where the trains were.

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.060
There were some maps out there.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.860
But way-finding
was very, very bad.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.830
And so, essentially, you
have to pick up these pieces

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.870
of paper, which were static.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.270
And now it's moving to a more
dynamic real time perspective.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.380
Everything was always pre-trip
or pre-planning your trip.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.550
And now, there's some
indication that things

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.694
are getting more en route.

00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:55.110
You have these real time apps
that we'll talk a little bit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.570
about.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.230
The last two are the ones that
probably haven't moved quite as

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.840
fast as some would have hoped.

00:03:06.374 --> 00:03:08.040
I think most of the
customer information

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.370
that's out there still treats
everyone as a generic customer.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.750
It doesn't really see
your particular needs,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.420
although there are things
like service alerts

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.820
that you sign up for
very specific routes

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.050
and things like that.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.030
But there's not too
much specific to you.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.280
And then, generally,
you've got to look still

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.520
for the information and
pull it up yourself.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.190
It's not coming to you without
you taking any action, in most

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.020
of these apps, although
some of the apps

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.820
are starting to move that way.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.249
So, yeah.

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.290
AUDIENCE: The active
systems and passive systems,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.918
is that supposed to be
the other way around?

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:55.370
What's with the active part?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.270
PROFESSOR: The active part
is from the perspective

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.960
of the customer.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.910
The customer has to
actively seek out

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.100
the information as
opposed to it coming

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.122
to him without doing anything.

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:09.070
OK.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.570
Yeah.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.200
And anybody, you can
interrupt, as well.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.620
I like the give and take.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.120
It's the technologies that allow
these things to include things

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.990
that you've pretty much
talked about here, probably

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.570
already, automatic
vehicle location

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.330
systems, automatic
scheduling systems,

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.780
so that the whole data of the
mission of the transit agency

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.030
is now in digital form.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.990
And more generally, is available
to the public through what

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.770
most [INAUDIBLE] used to call
the Google Transit Data Feed.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.830
And now it's the General
Transit Data Feed.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.050
Because, basically, everybody
adopted what Google started.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.570
And it provides
universal formats

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.360
that all the transit
agencies have basically

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.930
converted their data to.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.470
GPS and Wi-Fi cell phones.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.530
GPS is used on the vehicles,
generally, sometimes

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.900
in the cell phones.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.780
But essentially,
provides your location.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.780
And this is where the
customer specific stuff

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.590
has gotten better.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.590
Because that technology
has allowed it.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.280
If you didn't have a
phone that told everybody

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.650
where you were you wouldn't
be able to get information

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.860
as good as you do now.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.900
AFC provides a database
on your trip-making.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.940
And that's important
for two reasons.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:53.410
One, it allows the agency to
know where people are traveling

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.110
much better than they used to.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.030
And it also allows
them, if they so desire,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.620
to start to develop stuff for
you based on your history.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.190
And this is a little
bit controversial.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.320
We still have a
lot of discussions

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.880
with transit agencies about
the privacy of the data

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.770
and tracking you through
there and your taps.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.920
But frankly, all the commercial
people were doing this.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.270
And I think, the customers
come to expect it.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.400
And the agencies have
to get over this hump,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.300
do a privacy policy
that says, we're

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.320
going to use this
data in these ways.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.220
And we're going to
give people information

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.770
based on their previous travel.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.870
I don't think too many
people have done that yet,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.120
but they're thinking about it.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.540
And unfortunately, sometimes
the government lawyers

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.020
are more obstinate
about doing things

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.420
like this than the private
sector lawyers who generally--

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.620
my biased observation
is, the private lawyers

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.630
finds a way to do with
the company management

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.350
wants them to do.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.699
The government
lawyers finds a way

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:19.240
to tell management
they can't do what

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.250
they want to do, in many cases.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.660
And it's unfortunate
from that perspective.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.960
And then, obviously, wireless
communications and the apps

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.520
that have been developed.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.460
So before Google
Transit, and this

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.340
is probably ancient
in your eyes,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.950
but there used to
be a bunch of--

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.920
not a bunch-- about
three or four or five--

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.870
software companies worldwide
who did these things.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.580
And they were doing it
with really old technology.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.220
And they were mainframe systems.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.620
And they collected
literally, $1 million

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.540
for each Transit Authority.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:11.400
And it was funny to see Google
do this for free, essentially.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.610
Because these companies almost--

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.900
a lot of them just died
because of the competition.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.460
So when they first did
this, we were all amazed.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.040
Because a lot of the
big transit authorities

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.270
had invested lots
and lots of money

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.659
to the majority of planners.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:38.200
And they involved a tremendous
amount of data preparation

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.270
and a lot of customization
for each city.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.750
And this was a breakthrough
that nobody ever saw.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.730
Nobody quite
understood why Google

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.460
was doing it at the time.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.250
But it was welcomed.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.200
And there's some funny stories
about how it was then adapted.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.620
Because a lot of the big
transit authorities already

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.370
had these trip planners
that they invested

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.190
these millions of dollars on.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.490
And they were loathe
to give them up.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.450
And they were loathe to then
change the input to the Google

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.130
Trip input.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.680
Because all the formats
of these other things

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.180
were all proprietary.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.030
And they basically had
to do a lot of work

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.680
to get it into Google transit.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.420
But they got embarrassed
into it by students, students

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.000
even on the high
school level, who

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.600
really took their
towns' schedules

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.680
and put them into
Google transit.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.640
And this was done in
city after city, really.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.480
In some cases, in big
cities, to show them up.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.520
And other cases,
in little cities,

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.040
because they just didn't
have the staff to do it.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.302
So it was a great development.

00:09:58.302 --> 00:10:02.000
You've seen the apps that--

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.050
next vehicle arrival
times, but on your phone,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.830
which you all probably use.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.554
There's many new apps.

00:10:10.554 --> 00:10:11.470
Some of them are good.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.636
Some of them aren't so good.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.640
Give the Google data out.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.010
And have other people
write the apps.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.910
That was the chosen
path, because they

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:29.140
realize they couldn't do it as
quickly as private people could

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.760
do it.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.400
And they, essentially,
let this go.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.780
My criticism of this approach--

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.130
I think in Boston we had
between 35 and 45 transit

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:49.570
apps, none of which
were well supported

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.850
for about two or three years.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.890
Nobody quite knew.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.985
The people who really cared--

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:58.360
there was a little bit of
word-of-mouth that went around.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.030
There was the rating systems
online and things like that.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.310
But when you ask around, there
was at least a half dozen

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.280
that were being used
and nobody quite

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.920
knew whether they
were good or not.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.190
And basically, everybody had a
different standard with respect

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.850
to whether they would use them.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:23.570
And so, recently,
they've changed.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.590
They've started to endorse apps.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:33.010
The MBTA this year endorsed
Transit as their app.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.160
In a lot of cities, City
Mapper has been become

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.020
the standard for most people.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.400
And so, there's
two or three that

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.610
are reasonably good both in the
design and in the information.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:53.230
But I'll talk about the good
and the bad of these in a second

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.571
here So I've put three--

00:11:56.571 --> 00:11:57.070
yeah.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.870
Go ahead.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:04.820
AUDIENCE: So regarding these
apps [INAUDIBLE] have you also

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:10.266
looked at different levels of
perspective of how people use

00:12:10.266 --> 00:12:15.290
the information, especially how
features, about income levels--

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.500
There's been very little.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.710
And there is some
research going on.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.830
It's a real question.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.780
The research question is, have
these changed people's habits?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.830
Has it changed their behavior?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.880
And there's not a
lot of evidence.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.440
I don't know.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.790
Gabrielle, do you
have any examples

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.002
that you'd like to throw out?

00:12:42.002 --> 00:12:43.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.780
Candace Brakewood, who was
a graduate student here

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.710
and then went on to get
her PhD at Georgia Tech,

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.280
has done some good
research on this.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.065
But it's limited, in
terms of the samples.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.030
And it's not
conclusive with respect

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.880
to across the spectrum
of the use of the thing.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.760
AUDIENCE: I ask because not
only because the process

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.880
being used [INAUDIBLE]
but because many

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.970
of these points that we
were just talking about

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.210
are being emulated in
the development world.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.700
And I think it's the
way we should go.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.146
But if access to this data--

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:31.660
if people are not using this
data in the developed world,

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.080
then I also believe
that policy is

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.540
geared towards encouraging
people or making this data

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.970
more accessible [INAUDIBLE]
people [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.470
And I think-- my feeling
about this whole area

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.760
is it's got more questions
left than answers.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:58.370
There's not a definitive
way, essentially.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:02.720
So I think we should we should
talk about it as we go here.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.920
We'll see.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.280
So the basic aspects of these
things you probably know.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:18.770
The best ones really depend
on knowing your location.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.030
So again, you have to
give the app permission

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.660
to know your location
through your smartphone.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.600
If you don't do that, they
don't work well at all.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.370
Because, basically,
then you have

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.560
to tell them where you are.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:39.640
And most of them don't even
have a good way to do that.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.600
The NextBus one, which
was the earliest one,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.730
does have a drop-down
menu, if you don't want

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.050
to tell them your location.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.650
And you can just
pick as you go down.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.030
But the other ones
don't really offer that.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.140
You basically have to
tell them the location.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.740
And it works well.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.500
It knows where you
are right away.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.530
It looks at
everything around you

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.000
and it gives you the schedules,
the next couple buses

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.100
that are right around you.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.780
And so you can download
any of these things

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.790
and see how it works.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.640
I go between
NextBus and Transit.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.260
I haven't used
CityMapper that much.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.360
Although in Europe,
almost everyone

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.340
uses CityMapper much more
than any of these other ones.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.570
The newest thing has been
providing these other modes.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:38.330
So essentially on Transit
now, you can order an Uber.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:45.500
And you could look at anyone
who wants to give them

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.900
data, essentially, of options.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.330
And so, I don't think
Bridge is on there.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.710
But I've seen the car
sharing things on there, too.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.790
So it becomes other
mobility services as well as

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.720
public transit.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.357
Yeah.

00:16:00.357 --> 00:16:03.505
AUDIENCE: I suspected that
when those Uber services

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:07.280
TNCs started popping
up on the transit apps,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.055
I suspected that
they might be paying

00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:11.760
those apps to have that option.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.100
Because those options didn't
exist until not too long ago.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.830
And suddenly, you
see this option.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.100
Is there any truth to that?

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.320
PROFESSOR: Well, the
first one that tried

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.830
is a thing that's extinct now.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.350
It's called RideScout.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.910
RideScout was the first
one who tried to put

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.410
all these things together.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.790
And they actually got resistance
at first from Uber and Lyft.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.540
Because at the
beginning, Uber and Lyft

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.260
felt like they had all the
demand that they could handle.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.380
And they wanted people
to go to their app.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.660
They didn't want to pay them.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.930
Now, I don't know.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.250
This Transit app clearly has it.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.630
And a lot of the other ones--

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.700
CityMapper also does.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.500
Yeah.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.200
So I think they are paying them.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.510
But that's the maturity
of the TNCs as well.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.290
Because they're trying to get as
much market share as they can.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.790
And also because Uber
has so much money,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.560
they just throw it at
everything in order

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.530
to get as much as they want.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:23.089
Don't worry, I'll make other
editorial comments about Uber

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:23.869
as we go along.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.099
[LAUGHING]

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:28.130
All right.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:35.330
So this is the possibilities.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.700
And the last is, can we attract
more customers using these?

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.470
And that's the open question.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.090
There's some
indication that we can.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.820
I think, from a
research side, we

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.550
want to do more testing of
pilot projects to see if we can.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:01.050
I believe the second
point is really important.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.760
We need not only information,
but integrated payment

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.420
mechanisms on the phone so
that you don't have a separate

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.510
barrier to taking
transit, which is,

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.240
you gotta get a fare card or you
gotta put money in the fare box

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.680
or you gotta--

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.460
there's some transaction
cost with the way

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.530
fares are in Transit.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.950
If it's all on the phone
and it's all together,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.280
it really makes it a
lot easier, I think.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:39.690
And so, feel that if you put
the two together, you get more.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.270
There aren't too many
people that have done that.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.970
Chicago has the Ventra system
that does, to a large degree,

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.100
do this.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.610
They're only doing it for
transit systems in Chicago.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.870
They're doing it for the CTA.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.000
But you can buy a
metro ticket now.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.480
So it's actually multi
operator in the Chicago area.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.910
It's the commuter rail.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.620
And you can also
use it for PACE.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.880
So it's an account
based system on an app.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.660
And then you can get information
in terms of the services

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.920
as well.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.650
So it's getting there.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.660
There aren't too many systems.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.335
Dallas uses information app
that includes payment as well--

00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:24.490
unlimited.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.460
There's a few of them out there.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.610
London's got the payment.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.070
And now they're doing the
app for the information.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:39.600
So they were ahead in terms of
different payment mechanisms.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.040
So it's getting there.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.340
The question really
is, what do you need

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.250
to get people's eyes on it?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:56.590
And right now, I believe
it's mostly word-of-mouth.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.599
Those transit agencies spend
very, very little on marketing.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.640
They used to do advertising
and things like that.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.090
All that stuff's gone by
the board with the operating

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:08.710
resource constraints
they've had.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:13.880
So it's like a lot of things.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.640
There's all these
new things out there.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.340
But how do you get people
to even look at it.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:23.050
And that's a big question
that the big companies

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.160
know how to do.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.520
The transit agencies clearly
haven't figured that out yet.

00:20:31.884 --> 00:20:32.800
goes a little further.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:41.070
So this is an idea
that when London

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.820
was talking about integrated
payment on a phone

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.330
and using your credit
card account to do it.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.490
George Kocher said,
yeah, don't stop there.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.280
Do all the information, as well.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:59.910
And you can essentially just
have the whole transaction

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.910
with public transit and,
potentially, other mobility

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.220
services right in your pocket.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.000
The public sector
has been wary of is

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.460
this whole idea of tracking
your movements and keeping it.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.750
And that has been
a difficult thing

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.250
to get over even
in the research.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.680
We've tried to do
little pilot projects.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.300
And the amount of
bureaucracy you

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.100
have to go through in order to
essentially ask people if we

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.320
can track their movements--

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.030
which, by the way,
when you do ask them,

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.280
and you tell them what you're
doing it for, especially

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:47.910
for transit, over 50% is our
experience actually agree.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:54.240
So it's a large sample of
the users agree to this.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.660
Because, essentially,
they see the value

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.040
at some of the information
that's coming back.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.200
So the challenges that are left.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.680
There's still some
agencies, when

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.300
you go from city
to city, that don't

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.910
have a lot of good
real time information.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.940
So the apps don't
work very well.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:21.030
And for the life of me, it's
just a matter of inertia,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.150
I believe, in these places.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.220
Although in some
cases, they just

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.340
don't have the technology staff.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.060
I mean, they're below
water all the time,

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.330
in terms of the projects
they have on technology.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.020
And this is not their
highest priority.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.720
But we still have a lot
of cities that aren't

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.197
releasing the real time data.

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:45.780
So some of these
apps just don't work.

00:22:50.028 --> 00:22:53.950
The standard format
for the schedule data

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.870
is pretty much established--
the general transit data feed.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:04.270
But the GTA [? available ?] time
is not that well established.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:10.180
And most cities that provide
real time data to the public

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.830
do it this way.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.200
But they sometimes do
it in a different way.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.930
So actually, MBTA
has two formats.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:21.820
And it turns out
that right now--

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.370
the GTA vest format,
and you can correct me

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.560
on this one, Gabrielle.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.070
But the GTA vest format
requires the developers

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.660
to download all of the
data for all of the routes

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.240
when they ask for it.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.240
It's setup for
somebody who wants

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.810
to pull every route,
whereas in some cases,

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:50.920
if you want to do this faster
and you want to do it smarter,

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.290
you don't want to keep
pulling the whole system.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.050
Because you can't
do it fast enough.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.380
And I think this is something
we found when we were actually

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.060
using it for a
different purpose--

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.310
for an internal purpose.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:09.490
But we wanted to use their
separate API to their database

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.570
where this data resides.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.190
Is that--

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.450
AUDIENCE: It's mostly correct.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:25.070
One distinction [INAUDIBLE]
[? format ?] [INAUDIBLE] data

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:32.370
[INAUDIBLE] agencies like the
[? MBTA ?] [INAUDIBLE] one

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.390
example [INAUDIBLE] is the
waiting time for the Green

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:37.790
Line.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:41.699
So they've developed a
custom API [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:41.699 --> 00:24:42.740
PROFESSOR: Based on that.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.480
The biggest issue with
all of these apps,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.800
really, is they don't
work well in predicting

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.280
when the bus is going
to arrive unless there's

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.140
no traffic out there.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:04.380
So when there are generally good
conditions in terms of traffic,

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:08.460
they're generally good at
predicting the arrival.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.490
When there's disruptions
and when there's

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.970
any significant
level of congestion,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:20.400
they always underestimate the
time that you're going to wait.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.720
And you can see this.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.120
And people get very,
very frustrated

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.100
when it says it's going
to arrive in 4 minutes,

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.790
and it takes 8 or 9 minutes.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.500
Yeah.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.038
Yeah.

00:25:29.038 --> 00:25:32.014
AUDIENCE: Can you say something
about when the code shows

00:25:32.014 --> 00:25:35.250
the vehicle [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:35.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.400
Well, the Transit app does that.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.110
You can push it and see the
map and see where the bus is.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.240
And so, that helps.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.210
Because when you get
to know your route

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:52.050
and you get to know how long
it generally takes when--

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.590
I take the route 1
bus towards Harvard.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.895
So I look out over the bridge.

00:25:56.895 --> 00:26:00.000
And if the bridge is backed
up and it says 3 minutes,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.260
I know it's really
about 8 to 10 minutes.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.220
So you're right.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.680
It does help when it does that.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.820
But frankly, for everyone,
that's another button.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.060
You have to scroll through
the map to see if it's there.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:19.770
The vehicles don't
always show up.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.010
Because that vehicle hadn't
been pulled in the last--

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.710
whatever-- minutes or something.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.650
And there's a lag time.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.770
There's a lag time with
the update on this thing.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.800
There's a student in
electrical engineering

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.420
who wants to do his master's
thesis on throwing out--

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.040
most of these
predictions in Boston

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.400
are based on the NextBus
black box algorithm.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:47.110
And we don't know
exactly what's in there.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:51.570
It's mostly based on historical
information about travel times

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.530
on the route.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.450
So the way the algorithm
generally works

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.230
is historical travel times
on the route by time-of-day.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.620
And then it puts in a little bit
of the last one or two buses.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.890
But we don't think it
puts in enough of that.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.690
So there is a student in
electrical engineering

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.400
who wants to perhaps
do a master's program.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:19.320
Because he is very frustrated
at the MIT shuttle predictions,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.430
which are always
not very accurate.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.880
And he wants to throw out
the NextBus predictions

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.800
and put in the
homegrown prediction.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.100
And so we'll see
how that works out.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.300
AUDIENCE: I guess, the
next level for these apps

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:40.050
is to pull data from
Waze or some live data

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.460
I think it's the big
problem which is how much

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.795
longer it actually will take
the bus to get from A to B.

00:27:45.795 --> 00:27:49.050
And then there's the
advantage, thinking of Waze,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:51.530
of having that
they're linking a lot

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.770
more vehicles and people
are transmitting this,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.060
well then integrate
expected Transit travel

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.490
times and the actual
travel time on the road.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.650
We could integrate that.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.970
And it would be a
very powerful tool.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:05.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.650
That's exactly what
he is going to do.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.890
He's going to use the
Google real time traffic.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:13.770
And then, so, yeah.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.755
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when
you the [INAUDIBLE] transit

00:28:16.755 --> 00:28:18.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.560
PROFESSOR: It's using their--

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:27.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.630
PROFESSOR: I think
on Google Transit,

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.040
there's a little indicator
whether it's real time or not

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.000
real time.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.530
And if that's bolded,
you know it's real time.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.540
And it's based on something.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.900
But again, those companies--

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.740
it's just like NextBus.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.210
They have their own algorithm.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:49.730
And the question really is--

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.830
I don't know who the
people in the traffic field

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.100
are, whether they're looking
at these predictions.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:00.450
But I know if you look
at the Bluetooth signs

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.120
on the traffic side,
there's a huge lag effect.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.780
So when traffic is building
up, you never get enough--

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:11.940
the Bluetooth
prediction is too low.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:16.350
When traffic is coming down,
the Bluetooth projection

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.850
is too high.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.940
And I look at this all
the time on the highways.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.980
Because I gotta go back
and forth to Cape Cod.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:30.030
And it's amazing to see, it
is better than the Transit

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.500
predictions, I
can tell you that.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.333
The other issue with
the Transit predictions

00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:37.600
is they've got issues that
the Traffic doesn't have.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.470
They got dwell
time at the stops.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:44.610
And all it takes is one
wheelchair at Central Square

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.870
to be loaded and that thing
is off by 2 or 3 minutes, just

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:49.950
like that.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.400
Because it takes 2 or 3
minutes to load a wheelchair

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.783
and secure the wheelchair.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.690
And then there's sometimes a
crowd coming out of the subway.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.280
And depending on the
driver, they wave

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.580
on the people who they
think have passes.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.180
Other drivers, they tell
him to get on the back door.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.910
There's other drivers
say, no, you gotta--

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.760
and then other drivers insist
you get behind the yellow line.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.160
And they'll sit there
at the stop for awhile.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.230
So there's all this
driver behavior,

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:28.110
not to speak of the difference
in pulling in and out of stops

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:32.130
among drivers, which you don't
have in the general traffic

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.250
flow.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.950
So you got the
general traffic, you

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.770
got the dwell times for
things like handicap vehicles.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.500
So it's a huge problem.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:45.620
It's not it's not a
simple algorithm to solve.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.410
It's one of those things that we
should be looking to do better.

00:30:54.631 --> 00:30:58.160
In major disruptions,
it really becomes

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.160
an issue of how much
do you tell the public,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.620
let's do something else.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.690
This bus is not coming in any
reasonable amount of time.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.120
You can walk there a lot faster.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.800
And all the transit
agencies have been

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.690
reluctant to figure that out.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.310
Although London is a lot
closer to thinking about,

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.500
how do we tell people
about disruptions?

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.110
And how much do we divert
them from their normal path?

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.630
But there's not a lot
of real good research

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.220
out there about how to do that.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.605
There is an issue with
the transit agencies

00:31:37.605 --> 00:31:39.730
that, again, it's because
it's a government agency.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.540
And this is probably more in
the US than anywhere else.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.230
But because of the Americans
with Disabilities Act,

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.150
certain types of
information can't

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:53.430
be given out to the public
by the transit agency

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.740
unless it's fully accessible.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:32:00.070
And so, one of the reasons
we don't have more bus

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:05.020
stop signs is because small bus
stop signs on small monitors

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.960
are not accessible under
the terms of the Americans

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.430
with Disabilities Act.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.820
So they have to spend a lot more
money doing accessible signs.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.692
And I would argue that
this is something that's--

00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:28.780
you can buy every disabled user
an accessible smartphone app

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:32.620
built for that
cheaper than making

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.370
every piece of
information accessible.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:42.270
But there's been no
movement on this.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.950
That's just an accepted fact.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.250
What they've done to get
around this a little bit is

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:51.390
they say to the cities and
towns or somebody else--

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.060
the federal transit agency
has their interpretation

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.760
of an accessible
sign, and other people

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.970
have different interpretations.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.240
So there is some
movement allowing.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.030
Like these private
transit screens

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:11.220
you see, they have to be paid
for with non-federal money,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.960
essentially.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.990
And they're paid for,
usually, by private people

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.710
or by the city under
some non-federal grant.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:20.210
Yeah.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.168
AUDIENCE: Do they have
to work with the NextBus

00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.540
commission [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.490
PROFESSOR: Have to
have an audible thing

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.250
or a Braille thing or
something like that.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.860
Yeah.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.760
And finally, this idea
of private ride sharing.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.990
And so, we have
all these systems

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.980
and private operators that
are being incorporated here.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.750
But why not-- you can find me.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:56.310
If I want to give you a ride
from MIT to west Cambridge,

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.170
why can't I get in that app?

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:02.580
And then you could pay me
a few bucks for that ride.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.890
And there's a few people who
are developing mostly web

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.900
applications right
now, but are starting

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.780
to develop the phone
apps to do private ride

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.630
sharing in this, as well.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:20.699
The Ubers of the world don't
like these things at all.

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:24.179
And I don't really have any
good examples of people doing it

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:25.409
on a wide-scale basis.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.170
But MIT is very
interested in doing this

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.120
within their mobile app.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.620
So--

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:32.245
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:32.245 --> 00:34:33.660
If I can give you an example.

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.989
In Israel, where I come
from, Uber and Lyft

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:38.389
have not been allowed in Israel.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.170
But they have allowed Google.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.739
And Google started privately
developing consultant areas

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.550
where people use exactly
these services where

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:48.480
if a private
individual says, I'm

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.070
going from a suburb to the beach
right now at this time of day.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.396
If you want to join me and pay
me a few bucks for the ride.

00:34:55.396 --> 00:34:58.764
So Google actually has
started a pilot [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:58.764 --> 00:34:59.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.660
So I would argue
that this might not

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.600
be the best thing for Transit
if we got everybody sharing

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.530
rides all the time.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.000
But for the metropolitan
area and urban area,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.360
it's probably a great thing.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.860
And it's better than having
Uber and Lyft drivers

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.490
who, when they're not
full, running around empty.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.880
Because they're basically
a purposeful trip

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.655
that's being made, as opposed
to just being a business.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.280
So these are potential
research questions.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.220
I think I've talked about
the arrival predictions.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:42.970
The second one is important.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.720
We do a lot of research
in the Transit lab

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.020
about this using the
real time information,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.820
both from their vehicles
and from customers.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.570
Much less, thus far, from
customers in a real time

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:58.070
framework.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:02.780
But if we have that kind
of information coming

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.020
in all the time, how do
they make adjustments

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.770
to the operating plan?

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:15.960
So for example, the simplest one
of these is on ball game days.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.230
They store trains
outside of Kenmore Square

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.420
and outside of
the Boston Garden.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.360
And then they only release
them when the crowd shows up

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.740
on the platform.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.095
But it's still very low tech.

00:36:31.095 --> 00:36:32.390
There's a guy down there.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:33.490
And he says, send one in.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.290
[LAUGHING]

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.100
But if you think about
that on a smaller scale,

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:48.890
if a school gets out, and it's
on the Riverside line on the D

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:54.950
branch, instead of on
the even headway at 3:48,

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.110
you dispatch it a
little bit early.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.510
Because you knew the
school just got out.

00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:04.730
And you will pick up that
school load right away.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.910
And then the next
bus can pick up

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.770
all the rest of the passengers.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.470
Or maybe they'll put two in
a row or something like that.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:17.000
This is good research.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.200
It's still in its infancy, I
would suggest, at this point.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.990
The travel behavior
question is paramount.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:33.740
And as I said, I don't know of
really good research on this.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:40.930
And the bad part about it
is I think any research that

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:46.480
relies on surveys, revealed
behavior, or stated behavior

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.120
is just no good anymore.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.820
It may have been
good in the past

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:54.840
or they may have been lying
to us about how good it was.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.280
But right now, we need something
that looks at the real data.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.000
And so, this is where
the tracking data is key.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.526
And it's starting to be done.

00:38:06.526 --> 00:38:11.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I worked
in industry data before this.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.416
Most of the issues we
had in the private sector

00:38:14.416 --> 00:38:19.000
were overcome by making
the data fully anonymous.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.110
Is that still not the case
with these Transit systems?

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.200
Couldn't you just have instead
of me being Scott Foster,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.740
I'd be number 12379.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.360
It is clearly doable.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.540
And it is done.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.010
We hashed the names
and the serial numbers

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.350
and all that stuff.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:46.030
But-- I just had a conversation
about this with a public agency

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.730
person this morning--

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:53.012
they get very concerned
about small numbers.

00:38:53.012 --> 00:38:54.970
And on Transit, there's
a lot of small numbers.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.080
If you're actually looking
at OD movements from A

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:05.210
to B in the early morning,
there may be only a couple

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.340
of people doing that.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.740
And so then they get
nervous about doing that.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.890
And I would argue that
those are the very things

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:12.880
we want to learn about.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.280
Because you look at the bus.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:19.090
And you know it's full
at 8:00 in the morning.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:23.550
But where should that bus be,
maybe, at 6:00 in the morning?

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.330
It maybe should be
somewhere very different.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.960
And we have to use this
automated data to do that.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.500
And we'd like to track
who who's using it

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.610
and how they're using it.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.130
Because they might be using
it very, very differently.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.700
I don't know if you've noticed
this advocacy group, Transit

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.190
Matters in the Boston area,
but they have this proposal

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:46.600
for all night service.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:49.900
And it's different than
the late night service

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.537
proposal in that it's looking
at service for workers early

00:39:55.537 --> 00:39:57.370
in the morning and at
the airport and things

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.411
like-- this guy knows it.

00:39:58.411 --> 00:39:59.560
Yeah.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.110
He did.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:00.700
Yeah.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.199
OK.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:11.770
But anyway, it's just,
that makes sense.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.800
But what you don't
have is good data

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.410
about who's using it where.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:22.690
And there's not enough out
there to really measure it,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.010
in that particular case.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.530
Because there would
be induced demand.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.275
AUDIENCE: So we can guess at
where people are going just

00:40:31.275 --> 00:40:36.260
by where [INAUDIBLE] can't get
the regularity when you get

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:38.900
the small [INAUDIBLE]
And the private sector

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.020
is the same thing.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.070
You have to make
sure you don't come

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.500
close to identifying
an individual--

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.695
customer level data.

00:40:45.695 --> 00:40:48.470
So it's always
aggregated in some way

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.440
to make sure that you
couldn't figure it out.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.981
You have all the
people maybe getting

00:40:51.981 --> 00:40:56.329
on [INAUDIBLE] between
5:00 AM and 6:00 AM knowing

00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:57.370
that they got on at 5:05.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.036
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:04.030
And there's a whole spectrum
here of what is acceptable

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.720
and what is not.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.320
I guess, I just
argue, and I've said--

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.030
I had a TRB talk
about five years ago

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:20.960
about how the phone knows
when I'm near a pizza spot.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.860
And it sends me an ad.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.150
And I said, you know,
and if you actually

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:30.740
look at the terms of use
of Google on those phones,

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.620
it's like they can do
anything with that.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.500
They can look at
your phone call.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.390
If you actually
read those things,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:43.370
they use every piece of data
that they have accessible

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.250
almost any way they want.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:49.130
And if you say you
decline, then you're

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.270
location stuff
doesn't work ever.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.680
So it's a mess.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.890
And if these folks
can get you to do it,

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.170
I say, well, the private
sector is doing it.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.600
There isn't many bad things
in the public sector.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.290
People think, oh, they'll
arrest you or something.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.745
And maybe, in this case,
maybe these days they will.

00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:12.286
I don't know.

00:42:12.286 --> 00:42:17.210
[LAUGHING] But in the old days,
when I was talking about this,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.590
I said, you know, come on.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.270
Let the government do its job in
the sense of planning services.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.130
Yeah.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:31.770
So one thing that
comes out of this,

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:39.050
and this is customer information
and marketing combined,

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.140
if we have a lot of this
automated fare data,

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.440
on a voluntary basis, we
can create customer panels.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.450
So you can ask people, we'd
like to help plan things better.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:53.120
Let's put these panels together.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.704
We're going to use your
data for two months.

00:42:56.704 --> 00:42:59.120
And we want to ask you some
questions about your attitudes

00:42:59.120 --> 00:42:59.619
and things.

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:04.640
And this is done a lot
in the private sector.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.100
When we've done it, a lot--

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.210
anywhere between 35%
and 50% have said, yes.

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.740
You can essentially do
this on an ongoing basis.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.020
And you can create
a very large panel.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:23.050
And you can randomly select
them for other little surveys.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.660
And then you could see if
they react with respect

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.960
to their particular
travel behavior.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.580
And so, I think this
is the way we learn

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.920
the travel behavior impacts.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.780
But you gotta get a big panel.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.690
And so far, the
transit agencies have

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.430
been a little
worried about this,

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.080
again, from the
privacy perspective.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.470
I say, if people agree,
there's no privacy issue.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.510
And then you can
continually enrich this.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.160
You could keep recruiting
people for this

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.040
so that there is a lot of churn
in the transit ridership--

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.720
that people don't stay
forever riding the bus.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.890
Because they move or they get
a new job or they buy a car.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:18.400
The thing you could then
move to is pilot programs.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.320
And you could select
people on these panels

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.020
to be offered new things.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.800
And so this thing
that we're trying

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.620
to get started with the CTA is
to do mobility as a service.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.600
So they have this Ventra app.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.690
It works really, really
well for transit.

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:42.970
Well, why not put bike sharing,
car sharing, potentially TNCs

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.590
on this app?

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.310
And do it in a way
that the transit agency

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.790
dictates who gets paid and
how much they get paid.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.120
And this is a big sell.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.570
Because they see Ubers and
Lyfts and the car-sharing people

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.410
as the evil empire.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:07.630
But what we say is, do
it on a pilot basis,

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:10.180
because you can get
these individual panels.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:14.260
You could do it on a
general public basis,

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.730
if they volunteer.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.950
Or you could do it
through employers,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.480
which, then, is
another way transit,

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:31.280
I think, has underutilized their
market strength, in a sense.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:37.190
Employers, in large
cities, have a motivation

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.260
to promote transit.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.900
Because if they don't
promote transit,

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.570
they have to make sure that
their employees can find

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.421
parking near their offices.

00:45:46.421 --> 00:45:48.170
So they either have
to provide the parking

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.140
or they have to provide
a parking subsidy.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.570
As many of you know, we
have been doing a lot here

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:57.110
in MIT with this and trying
to change the behavior

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:03.290
by essentially giving a free
transit pass to every employer

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:08.210
and charging daily for
parking as opposed to what

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.830
used to be a Either, Or.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:14.960
You pick transit or
you pick parking.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.630
You can do all these
things to learn.

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:22.170
But what it all depends
on is this mobile data

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:28.500
and other automated data
sources to tie it all together.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.700
I think one of the issues
that this will also help

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.790
is you can get
feedback from people

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:39.370
about what they want to know
when they want to know it.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.240
So you can't do that in a
fully-automated fashion.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.630
So these panels are
the only way that you

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:49.430
can get to a large
representative group of people

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:53.360
and quiz them about when
they had bad service

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.360
and what they did and
what kind of information

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:58.880
that you need to get to them.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:06.600
So the next four slides
are from Montreal.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.750
And Isabelle Trottier presented
them a couple of years

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.630
ago when she came down here
to what we call the Transit

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.430
Leaders Roundtable.

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.420
And they are a little
bit ahead of the curve

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.260
in terms of providing
mobility as a service.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.260
And I'll just give
you some examples.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:28.680
This is mostly
oriented towards biking

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.680
in Montreal and bike sharing.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.070
But I picked it,
because I have an ax

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.330
to grind about the biking.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:40.700
And so, I'm not
quite as bad as Fred.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.350
But I have a good example here.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:48.930
So the bicycles are
growing in popularity.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:52.020
I don't know exactly what
passport mobility is.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.100
I don't remember what it is.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.690
But it's essentially
a way to buy things.

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:01.802
I think it's an account
that you can use.

00:48:01.802 --> 00:48:08.024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:08.024 --> 00:48:08.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.210
So the reason I picked
the bicycle here is this

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.450
is a place that has been very
successful at combining bikes

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.940
and buses in the same
lane, which we're

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.360
having a huge fight here
in the Boston area about,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.280
whether it's safe or not.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.750
And they have done and recently
have been doing studies of this

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:37.620
and looking at where it works
and where it doesn't work.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.550
And they've brought the bicycle
people in to see the data

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:43.050
and do it transparently.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.150
And I argue, we have
to do this in Boston

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:49.590
or else the MBTA is dead.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.450
There's a bunch of examples.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.850
The conclusion drawn from
the first pilot project

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:57.520
was it's both possible
and even desirable.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.080
It's safe, and it's functional.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.570
The cyclists like it.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:06.990
The bus performance-- they used
to have the lane by themselves.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:08.070
Now they don't.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:10.890
It's not gone down.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:14.680
And they're deploying it
now, on a case by case basis,

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.360
depending a little
bit on the layout

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.300
of the streets and the lanes.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:26.940
And so my little commercial is
we need to do this for mobility

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.610
in the Boston area.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.880
So my final slide
in this whole area

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:37.850
is Lead to a Re-definition
of Public Transit.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:42.680
And I think that we're
almost there, at this point.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.220
All these mobility
services are being--

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.980
the same people are using all
of these mobility services.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:52.050
There are now the
private car users.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.950
And there are people
using mobility services.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:59.600
And they're using a
combination of them.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.380
I did talk two
years ago when they

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:09.440
did the first study of users in
the New York City area of Uber

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.230
and taxis and public transit.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:15.620
And at the time, the
Uber fare in Manhattan

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:22.740
averaged about $20, which
was still pretty high.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:28.520
And the analysis said that
if it got down to around $10,

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:34.130
on average, and people used
1/3 third of their trips--

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.870
all their trip making on Uber--

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:40.520
and 2/3 on transit,
you would actually

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:47.330
spend less on that combination
than buying a car even

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:52.470
in the outer
Boroughs of New York.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.920
So what's happened
in the meantime

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.170
is that Uber fares
have come down.

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.620
And they're probably at that
level, as an average, now.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.520
So that means if you're
economically savvy,

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.980
you're crazy to be
operating a car.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.701
Because, generally,
for the longer trips

00:51:09.701 --> 00:51:10.700
you can take the subway.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.180
And for the shorter
trips you take Uber.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:22.500
And the question is,
has it changed behavior?

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.140
The New York City people say,
there's more cars in Manhattan.

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.780
So that indicates there
are more people using Uber.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.180
Because they're not using more
private cars in Manhattan.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:36.030
Because they have
no place to park.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:41.240
So this is a thing
that transit is

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.020
extremely worried about
but it's doing very little.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:52.880
And the question is, can
we control this in any way?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.860
And I would argue,
the only way they

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:59.060
can do it is by having
a joint deal where

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:04.910
they give information and
payment together on an app.

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:08.354
And they give you
unlimited rides on transit.

00:52:08.354 --> 00:52:09.770
And they give you
a certain number

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:12.380
of rides on these other modes.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:18.710
And basically, it's a good
economic deal for everyone.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.040
And you market it like that.

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.180
Because frankly, transit
has been cutting back

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.700
the really bad
off-peak services.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:34.250
Because they can't afford to
subsidize it at $10 a ride.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:38.210
And if they only subsidize--

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:42.590
for example, you might give them
a certain number of Uber trips

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.510
that are just to and
from rail stations.

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:47.420
Because they can do
this geofencing thing.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:54.440
Or you might give a
subsidy for Uber trips

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:59.260
up to a certain amount per trip
for a certain number of trips.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.330
There's a whole bunch of
bundling that you can do here.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.480
And what I'm saying
is that we gotta

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.100
do this in a series of
controlled experiments

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:14.520
and learn what people want
and what people use and learn,

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:19.220
frankly, whether we're going
to end up being just high

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:23.150
frequency corridor routes left.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:27.590
And there is a real
debate about this.

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:31.580
And there's a real
debate about whether this

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:37.014
is where we're going to end up
or whether Uber and Lyft are

00:53:37.014 --> 00:53:38.180
going to go out of business.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.960
Because they, right now,
have unsustainable fares.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.040
That's what the transit
people hope and bet on.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.840
But I'm not sure that's
going to happen or not.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.460
So, yeah.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.572
AUDIENCE: That's what's
really interesting to me.

00:53:52.572 --> 00:53:55.084
I definitely agree these
are going to have phenomenal

00:53:55.084 --> 00:53:55.584
impact..

00:53:55.584 --> 00:53:58.790
But in London, they are
investing huge amounts

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.832
of money for Crossrail
and Crossrail 2, which

00:54:01.832 --> 00:54:04.260
are high frequency routes.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.530
But in cities where
the road layout is not

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:14.470
a grid they have to
scale larger, [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:20.060
And London's doing it largely
on the economic theory

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.530
of agglomeration--

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:26.210
that they have such a density
of employment opportunities

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:30.120
and other activities
that are altogether,

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.620
they should have an economic
benefit to the thing.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.500
Frankly, every
developed country,

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.710
every almost developing
country in the world

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:45.350
is doing more investment in
transit than the United States.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:49.700
And Fred would argue
that we should just

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.730
forget about all this stuff
and just build more rail

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:56.260
lines in certain places.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.970
I think that, in
many cities, we're

00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:00.860
beyond a little bit of that.

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.400
Because the sprawl is so great.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:04.910
It's right.

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:08.570
In the big old cities,
the densities--

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.240
if we want to increase the
density in Boston or in New

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:16.620
York or Philadelphia, yes,
you have to have rail.

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.750
Because essentially, you can't
increase the density anymore.

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.570
Because there's no
place to put the cars.

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:24.630
But in some of these other
cities that are spread out

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:29.250
more, it's just not as
clear of what you should

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.890
do in terms of investment.

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:32.403
Yeah.

00:55:32.403 --> 00:55:33.236
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:55:33.236 --> 00:55:35.210
You said that
transit authorities

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.670
are worried about this.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:41.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:46.630
PROFESSOR: Nationally,
for the last decade,

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:50.370
transit ridership
has gone up steadily.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:52.510
And everybody was really happy.

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.750
The last two to three
years, bus ridership-- not

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:58.510
rail ridership-- bus
ridership has gone down.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:00.280
And all the large cities.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.180
And everybody's debating about
what's the cause of that.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:05.350
Is it just the gas prices?

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:07.750
Is it Uber and Lyft?

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.430
What is it?

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.570
And they're worried.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:12.070
Yeah.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:18.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:18.714 --> 00:56:19.630
PROFESSOR: Nationally?

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:20.129
Yeah.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.254
There's a big debate about
why did D.C. has gone down.

00:56:27.254 --> 00:56:28.920
Because they've had
all these disruption

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.440
because of the
safety and because

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.410
of the reconstruction of things.

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:36.210
So D.C. is a special case.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:38.740
But New York flattened out.

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.510
That's right.

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:41.590
And New York was going up.

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:47.250
And nobody can argue it's the
economy, because the economy

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.690
has been growing.

00:56:52.094 --> 00:56:52.594
Yeah.

00:56:52.594 --> 00:57:00.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:00.976
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:03.252
[LAUGHING] He knows
this better than I do.

00:57:03.252 --> 00:57:06.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:06.912 --> 00:57:08.620
PROFESSOR: They're
skeptical in Montreal?

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.115
AUDIENCE: Can't decide it.

00:57:09.115 --> 00:57:10.706
There is skepticism in Montreal.

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.240
In theory it should work.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.346
Because buses and some high
schools average the same speed.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.920
In practice, the cyclist
goes 15 miles an hour.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.150
The bus goes
zero/thirty zero/thirty

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:33.320
So there might be a
leapfrog leaping out anyway.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.310
I think what the
issue is that cyclists

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.710
feel that they might get
squeezed [? there. ?]

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:41.560
There's two issues.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.210
One is that if you just have--

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:46.140
I think for really short
segments, these makes sense.

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:52.080
For [INAUDIBLE] you're probably
thinking of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.090
A couple hundred yards
with a huge bottleneck.

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:57.360
And frankly, if a bus
had to follow a cyclist

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.340
at 8 miles an hour, [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:59.340 --> 00:57:59.890
PROFESSOR: It wouldn't matter.

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.223
AUDIENCE: It would still be
much faster than a car going

00:58:02.223 --> 00:58:03.480
two or three lights.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.110
But in longer corridors,
especially where

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.120
you have the bus pulling
from the curve and back,

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.330
it becomes more of an issue.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.350
There's the question of
whether you could build

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:17.680
some kind of floating bus stop.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:19.430
So you'd have separation
at the bus stops.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:22.120
And the vehicles would
never have to cross paths.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.930
And the buses could
pass the cyclists.

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.690
And the cyclists could pass
the buses where needed.

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:31.337
But that's more, I think, cities
sort of see this as a panacea

00:58:31.337 --> 00:58:33.420
where they can lay down
some [INAUDIBLE] for that.

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.037
And it's not a
problem [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:35.037 --> 00:58:36.620
mention that in
[INAUDIBLE] in Madison

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.830
they have shared bus bike lanes.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:40.510
And they work pretty well.

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.620
And I don't disagree.

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:46.690
But those are also some
five lane wide streets

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:51.224
where they can provide
a really wide facility.

00:58:51.224 --> 00:58:51.890
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.920
It does depend on the
width of the lane.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:59.270
I agree [INAUDIBLE] agree that
we could do a lot with queue

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.110
jump lanes--

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:03.290
not fully dedicated lanes.

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:08.240
We can't give up a full lane all
the way up and down Mass Ave.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.730
But in front of MIT, we can.

00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:14.480
From the river to
Albany Street, we can.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:18.290
Because there's no
commercial activity.

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:23.825
We have 17 parking spaces out
here in front of 77 Mass Ave.

00:59:23.825 --> 00:59:24.710
17 spaces.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:27.740
You can put them on
Amherst Alley really easily

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.510
and have all this
space that we could

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:31.340
devote for bikes and buses.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:35.780
So what I would argue is,
we need queue jump lanes.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.910
A lot of people talk about--

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:41.100
did Peter Firth
talk about TSP yet?

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:41.600
OK.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.170
He's coming.

00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:45.860
Peter's going to come and talk
about Transit Signal Priority.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.290
And listen carefully.

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.760
Because transit signal priority
provides very, very small

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:58.310
improvements, especially if
the bus is stuck behind a car.

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:04.970
And so, the question is,
transit signal priority

01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:09.260
works well when at the
congested intersections

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.530
we have a queue jump lane
that the bus can get around

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:17.030
the long line of cars that
might be there in the rush hour.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.360
And so we need both.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.180
And what I would argue is
that in those small segments,

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:26.628
the buses can share
it with bikes.

01:00:26.628 --> 01:00:30.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:32.600
PROFESSOR: Enforcement.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.210
Yeah.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.210
I mean that's the only--

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:38.570
AUDIENCE: In San
Francisco [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.830
driver literally
busted out camera

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:42.400
in front of driver [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.750
PROFESSOR: They can push.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:44.250
Yeah.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.964
AUDIENCE: Take
pictures [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:45.964 --> 01:00:46.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.040
I think a lot of people do that.

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:48.850
Yeah.

01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:51.550
I think London does
the same thing.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.280
London has a lot of these.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:54.406
And they--

01:00:54.406 --> 01:00:56.114
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Bus lanes and there

01:00:56.114 --> 01:00:57.330
are also taxi lanes [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:58.954
PROFESSOR: And they're
also bike lanes.

01:00:58.954 --> 01:01:03.430
And in London, it
looks scary to me.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.420
Because they go so fast.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.010
But around here,
as Ari says, you

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:13.150
know if we get seven or eight
miles an hour out of a bus,

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:14.560
we're happy.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.740
Because they're only
average four or five.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.240
[LAUGHING]

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.700
AUDIENCE: That seven
or eight miles an hour

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.226
is enough to get to a
light that's actually

01:01:22.226 --> 01:01:25.802
held green for ten seconds so if
that light changes [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.394
AUDIENCE: I don't see
why that problem is

01:01:32.394 --> 01:01:33.955
unique to the facility.

01:01:33.955 --> 01:01:39.210
Because even if the bus is
sharing a lane of traffic

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.984
and the bike lane
is not a bike lane,

01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:42.442
there's still
[INAUDIBLE] conflict.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.010
AUDIENCE: That's certainly true.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:49.020
I think what the issue
is that cyclists--

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.910
some cyclists can
be very special.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.529
And I'm not talking about
anyone who works at the City

01:01:53.529 --> 01:01:54.112
of Cambridge..

01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:01.140
There are some cycling
advocates who would rather--

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.020
there are some cyclists
and cycling advocates

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.130
who don't understand that
there were transit issues

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:08.320
before traffic [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.970
And there needs to be a bit of
a detente between the cyclists

01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.204
and the transit users.

01:02:15.204 --> 01:02:17.120
The problem-- I think
Frank pointed this out--

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.244
is that the cyclists are
meant for [INAUDIBLE] more

01:02:19.244 --> 01:02:22.990
organizers than cyclists who are
put in mortal danger every time

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.990
they're going somewhere.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:27.400
And transit users are
just like [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.100
And there's a difference
between those two groups.

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:35.930
And I know that this
past November, I

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:40.130
think in the past fall I'm on
the Cambridge Cycling Committee

01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:42.650
and I try to be
a voice of reason

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:45.100
for transit as well on
those bicycle committees.

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:45.650
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:47.150
PROFESSOR: The only
voice of reason.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.650
No.

01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.670
[LAUGHING]

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:51.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sometimes there

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:58.310
can be [INAUDIBLE]
bus stops on Mass Ave.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:01.430
PROFESSOR: Because 40% of the
people on Mass Ave in the rush

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.180
hour are on buses.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:05.010
Yeah.

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.327
AUDIENCE: And 50% of
them are on bikes.

01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:09.410
PROFESSOR: It's even more.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.910
Yeah.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:11.210
It's almost 50%.

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.680
Yeah.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.844
And a lot of the
arterials around here,

01:03:14.844 --> 01:03:15.760
that's the percentage.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.310
It's between 35% and 50%
of the people are on buses.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.893
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] The bike
doesn't take up that much room.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:32.297
So the issue, I think,
winds up being that--

01:03:32.297 --> 01:03:33.630
PROFESSOR: We're off topic here.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:34.510
[LAUGHING]

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:36.052
AUDIENCE: We had a
nice conversation.

01:03:36.052 --> 01:03:38.093
I think when you get people
in the same room they

01:03:38.093 --> 01:03:40.320
start to understand that
there's a give and take.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.300
[INAUDIBLE] and
I said, if you're

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.990
doing planning an
isolation where you talk

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:45.130
to bike people and they, say, we
want X and you talk to transit

01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:47.640
people and they say they
want Y, the easiest thing

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.348
is to do nothing.

01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:51.300
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.210
I think the bus
lane actually gets--

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.880
although, these
days I'm not sure--

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.130
but I would say that the bus
lanes get more adverse reaction

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:07.560
from the drivers than
the bike lanes do.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.490
Because they don't seem to
take away driving lanes.

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:14.010
Whereas a bus lane
seems to either take

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.770
a driving or a
parking lane away.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:21.300
And so, it gets more
opposition from the drivers.

01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.990
But there's a quote.

01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:27.580
I forget the quote now.

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:32.110
But basically,
urbanologists-- people--

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.440
have started to
realize that we're

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.920
spending tons and tons of
money doing bike facilities

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.360
in these urban areas.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.570
And we're spending nothing
on transit facilities.

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:46.320
And that's a long-term disaster.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.760
Because essentially,
there is a limit

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.780
on the amount of bike use, I
think, in any of these places.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.700
Because there's lots of people.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.780
I used to bike.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.580
I live four miles away.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.240
I used to bike.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.350
I'm getting old.

01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:06.851
So I'm losing a little bit of my
perception and stuff like that.

01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:08.100
I had a couple of close calls.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:09.330
I stopped.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:10.920
I basically just stopped.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.600
I said, I'll bike
when I go to Cape Cod.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.490
I'm not going to bike
in these streets.

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.410
Mainly I was afraid
of the other bikers

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:21.670
then I was as opposed to
being afraid of the cars.

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.700
And there's lots of
people that just can't.

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.630
And a lot of those people
want to take buses.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.590
But they also don't want to be
held up in congestion streets

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:32.860
all the time.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.530
So can we switch?

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.120
I don't know your computer.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.700
Can we switch to the other one?

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.640
We'll just get started on
the Performance Measurement.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:45.750
And then we'll go
into the next one.

01:05:51.195 --> 01:05:52.690
Great.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.770
The reading, I
think, is important.

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:01.290
It's a dry topic.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:05.340
It's how transit authorities
evaluate themselves

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.400
and how they evaluate themselves
with respect to other transit

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.510
authorities.

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:11.670
But it's important.

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:17.820
Because if they don't do
performance measurement,

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.050
nobody improves.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:20.970
And there's example
after example.

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:24.810
The two best examples,
from my perspective,

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:27.240
are the CTA, about
five years ago,

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.950
instituted this rigorous
performance measurements regime

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:39.000
that the general manager
sat at a weekly meeting

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.160
on a rotating basis
with every department

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.810
and developed
performance measures

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:45.180
and tracked them
for each department.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:49.810
And the performance, almost
universally, went up.

01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:52.470
There's a set of slides
that I can't go over.

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:56.850
But we'll put on
Stellar about this.

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:01.660
It's an amazing story, I think.

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.600
The GM was only
there for two years.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.770
He was one of these
management by data types.

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:10.680
And then he got moved to
run the school department,

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.400
for God's sake.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.470
I don't know why.

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:15.120
But, anyway.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.630
And the other example
really is the MBTA

01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:22.740
under the fiscal management
control board, where they've

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.980
insisted that there
be regular updates

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:29.820
and data-driven analyses.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:35.220
And if you look at the progress
on things like Overtime,

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:42.000
and essentially, things that
are inefficient, generally,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.410
they've improved.

01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:46.710
And there's a lot more to
improve here at the MBTA.

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:49.170
And there's a lot
of issues that can't

01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:53.310
be solved just by better
management and performance

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:54.560
measurement.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.100
But there's a lot that can.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:08:02.560
And so, I think this is
a really important topic.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:07.320
So what we have
here is a little bit

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.720
of justification of doing this.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.480
There is an older report
that's really good--

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.430
TCRP 88 that essentially
is a cookbook

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.200
on how to develop a
performance management

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:21.270
system for your transit agency.

01:08:21.270 --> 01:08:25.290
And it's a really good report
with respect to the measures

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:26.220
you use.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.970
And they divide into small,
medium, and large urban areas.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:34.380
And they give different measures
for four different ones.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.910
A lot of people want to compare
themselves to other people.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.640
There's this national database.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.689
And this is the website.

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:45.060
And you can see
performance measures

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:49.290
from everyone in the
country on a pretty much

01:08:49.290 --> 01:08:52.779
equitable reasonable basis.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:56.130
And then there's the concept
of performance audits, which

01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:58.260
we'll talk a little bit about.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:02.490
So why do it?

01:09:02.490 --> 01:09:04.410
Basically, whatever
gets measured

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.700
gets noticed by management.

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.340
And everybody's into these
new management dashboards

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.900
with key performance indicators.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.200
It can be done and
not have an impact.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.180
But I feel like,
whatever that indicator

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.609
is, people manage to it.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:29.160
Sometimes the indicator
is the wrong indicator.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.319
And it's not so good.

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:36.840
Because it's the easy one to
measure as opposed to what

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.029
they should be focused on.

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:41.399
Many of them are--

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:45.630
the measures that the board
and the top management look at

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:48.750
are oriented to the
supply of the transit--

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:51.300
what the vehicles did
as opposed to what

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.380
the passenger experienced.

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.550
The best example
of that is when you

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:03.750
look at on-time performance.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.370
They measure it
within 2 or 3 minutes.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.030
And that doesn't mean anything
if the bus is supposed

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:14.310
to come every 7 or 8 minutes.

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:21.990
Because basically, there's
this phenomenon of long gaps

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:24.330
and then followed by bunches.

01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:27.660
There's very few passengers
on the bunch buses, especially

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.830
the second and third one.

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:34.260
And most of the people
are on the crowded bus

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:37.080
who had to wait, which
is the first one.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.600
And they had to wait
much longer for that.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:45.360
So the wait time for
passengers is not

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.410
linearly related to this
on-time performance measure

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:50.590
that they have.

01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:54.270
So you actually should be
trying to measure effective wait

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:58.210
time for all passengers.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.510
And that should be
your measure for most

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:03.380
of the transit services.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.100
They also use some of
the performance measures

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:09.450
on a system basis for
funding allocation.

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.870
I'll mention a few things there.

01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:14.525
I talked about this TCRP Report.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.180
It's nice.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:24.276
And I think it used to have
a website associated with it.

01:11:24.276 --> 01:11:25.650
So you could
actually go in there

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.290
and put your own
program together.

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.790
I'm not sure if it still does.

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:30.110
Because it's fairly old.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:36.470
But it's nice in that it
isn't one prescribed thing.

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.450
It gives you a lot
of different options.

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:41.300
And you can tailor it
to your urban area.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.490
This is the process that
they recommend in the report.

01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:53.460
Again, this is an internal
performance measurement

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:53.970
system--

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:56.190
performance management system.

01:11:56.190 --> 01:12:02.190
And it's a top-down to find
your goals and objectives get

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:03.300
management support.

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:08.590
And I guess, the second
one is extremely important.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:12.600
I used to, as my olden
days as a consultant,

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.800
I used to do transit performance
audits for transit agencies.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.570
And the experiences
varied further

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:24.300
than anyone could imagine.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.490
I'd been in some
transit authorities.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:28.870
The first meeting was
with the general manager.

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:33.170
And he says, go get 'em.

01:12:33.170 --> 01:12:35.490
And he says, and come back
with all the information,

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:37.400
because I want to know it.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.920
And you would do it.

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.590
And we'd come back
with the indicators.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.480
And he'd say, OK, what
do I do about this?

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.810
What I do about this?

01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:48.590
He'd bring the
departments in and says,

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:50.600
I'm not blaming anybody.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.370
We just gotta
develop action plans

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:54.140
to get these things better.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.150
And I've been in
other properties

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.270
where the general
manager said, literally,

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:02.420
on the first
meeting, you're here

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.090
because the state
makes me do this.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:11.090
So I want you to get in and out
of here as quick as you can.

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:15.470
And basically, I know
how to manage my place.

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:17.260
You don't have to
tell me anything.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:23.350
And now, all of these were
relatively small properties.

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:25.520
We did some larger properties.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.430
But basically, there's
a tremendous variation

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:32.920
among management styles on this.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.940
And so, if you're
going to do this,

01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.060
you want top management to be
supportive right from the start

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.940
and to participate
in developing it.

01:13:45.772 --> 01:13:49.250
The rest of it is intuitive.

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.160
The most important
thing is, how do

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.920
the results, when you
update all these measures,

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.190
get integrated into
how you actually

01:13:58.190 --> 01:13:59.990
carry out the business?

01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:03.300
And that is a hard
part sometimes.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.190
And it's a part that
you need to think about.

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:11.210
And you gotta think about, what
can I do about this indicator?

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:13.970
And I think part of
when you're deciding

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:17.870
what the indicators are,
that's a big part is thinking

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.190
about that step 7 and 8.

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:24.050
And essentially, if
something's working

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:25.880
and you're making
progress, you keep it in.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:31.130
If you don't, an 8, you throw
it out and try something else.

01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:37.850
This is the way they've got
lists and lists of measures.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.790
They've got bunches of tables.

01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:43.910
And again, they have them
for large properties.

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.790
It makes sense for large
properties, medium, small,

01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:49.850
actually under 50,000 people
in the metropolitan area.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:52.580
So they basically
say, this is kind

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:54.800
of what we think
your capabilities are

01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:00.180
based on staffing and
these kind of properties.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.210
There's some more.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.750
I'm not going to
go through these.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:06.190
The NDT data.

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:08.320
How many people have
actually gone in

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.830
and looked at these tables?

01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:11.230
Anybody?

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.330
Two.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:13.470
OK.

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.820
You should all do this.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:18.180
It's pretty interesting.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.910
They've got a whole range
of transit properties

01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:22.660
across the country.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:25.530
And you can sort
them in various ways.

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:26.850
You can download reports.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:29.760
You can download
it in CSV files.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.890
You can see how your city
stacks up against other cities.

01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:36.460
Consultants use
these all the time.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.760
And the good thing about
it is at the beginning when

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.880
they first developed
this, definitions

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.760
were variable across cities.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:49.200
And each year, the
government has done

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.420
what big bureaucracies do well.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.020
They started to
standardize this.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.910
And they call you up if
they don't like your number.

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:00.300
And they also call you
up if your numbers change

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.400
from year to year too much.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.930
And they ask you why.

01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:06.300
And so there's an
auditing process

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.040
of the data that's in here.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.880
Now the only
downside of it is it

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:17.810
got big quick when they first
developed it in the 80s.

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:20.890
And then there was a backlash
from the transit agencies

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:23.070
in the city saying,
you're asking us

01:16:23.070 --> 01:16:24.250
for too much information.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.900
This costs too much.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:33.610
And so, I don't think they've
added the proper updating of it

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:39.310
with respect to developments
that have been in the transit

01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:42.270
over the last 10
or 15 years or so.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.670
And there still is
some inconsistency.

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.260
There's still a
little bit of latitude

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.019
on how you allocate your costs.

01:16:54.019 --> 01:16:55.060
That's the hardest thing.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.670
And have you guys had
cost allocation models?

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:00.770
Yeah.

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:05.810
So you saw the uncertainty
of exactly what you put--

01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:09.530
all these costs-- what
category you put them in.

01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:14.240
And so, that part, while
they define a lot of it,

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.440
they don't define it
down to the bottom.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.550
And so, I think that there
is, especially in the costs.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:25.490
So the cost effectiveness
numbers that come out of

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:30.180
here aren't necessarily
directly comparable

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:34.310
depending on the property and
how seriously they take it.

01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.890
The other issue
with this is this

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.770
is another thing where
the management style--

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:42.500
some management actually
ask their people

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:46.010
to look at other properties
here and report back.

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:47.490
And they care about it.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:50.000
And other management says,
just get that report done.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.020
Get it out of here.

01:17:52.020 --> 01:17:55.340
So this is a similar thing.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.660
Leadership is important.

01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:06.360
So this issue of
performance audits.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:11.730
So outside of doing it with key
performance indicators going

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.580
to the board, there's
also these efforts

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:19.950
to do it comprehensively,
maybe a deeper dive, than you

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:22.470
would do on a regular basis.

01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:25.620
And they usually bring in
outside people consultants

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:29.520
or maybe a state
group that comes in.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.130
And they go around,
especially, like, say,

01:18:32.130 --> 01:18:35.700
for the RTAs here in
Massachusetts that are all much

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.500
smaller than the MBTA--

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.480
they have a standardized
performance audit

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.880
group that goes around.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.700
And they give them information.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.310
I think the big issue,
especially in the smaller

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:51.540
properties, is they don't
have the resources to find out

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.840
what other people are doing
very easily as compared

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:57.482
to the larger cities who
just call up people and say,

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:58.440
I'm going to come down.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.820
I want to hear about this.

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.920
Or they set up a
special panel and they

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:04.840
bring in some experts
on a particular issue.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:09.510
What this process allows is
identifying critical issues

01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:14.670
that are performance issues and
then allowing the consultant

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:16.530
to focus just on
those two or three

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:20.700
issues or the outside group
and say, give us information

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:24.600
about how we can improve
just in these areas.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.920
And then it brings information
from other properties.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.249
Because these people have
been doing it in other places.

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:42.020
And the big debate when
this first all started

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.860
and among the people who did
it was, should you focus on

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.840
internally in the trends in your
internal operation or should

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.450
you focus on how you
compare to other people?

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:59.440
And there's no the answer here.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.520
I always said, it doesn't
hurt to look at outside.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.500
But clearly, if you're
looking internally first,

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.900
you can see whether you're
getting better or worse.

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.270
And you know the
data is consistent.

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:17.500
And you know the issues that
you're having trouble with.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:22.730
Because intuitively, you know
it as well as from the data.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:30.880
So I would say, generally,
the peer comparisons were

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.540
often used by the outside
groups to say, where should we

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.730
focus going in?

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:39.470
And let's dig deeper
in these areas,

01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:43.615
because these numbers look
a little bit out of context.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:47.820
Almost done here.

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:51.530
So I'm going to press on for--

01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:53.480
to--

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.440
So the bulk of the
effort was internally.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.020
One thing that this
allows is because you

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.930
have this facilitator
and the outside group,

01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:08.710
it allows you to tell
them, like a counselor,

01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:11.380
this is why I really
can't get my job done.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:17.880
And we really developed
a mode with these folks.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.780
You can tell us.

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.880
We're not going to
attribute it to you.

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.610
We're not going to necessarily
go to your direct boss

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:25.560
about your complaint
to the direct boss.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:27.720
But we might mention
this to somebody

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.150
higher up in a more general way.

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:33.660
And we had ways
of assuring them.

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:37.260
And so, employees
liked this, especially

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.970
if they were hitting roadblocks
in doing a better job.

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:44.970
And in small properties,
sometimes personalities

01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.810
got in the way.

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:49.930
And so we would provide that
feedback to the top management

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:51.370
as long as they wanted it.

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:58.960
And just I'm aware of a
very significant state

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:00.640
program in California.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:04.600
They have to do this
every three years.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.620
It started at two.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.210
Now it's down to three.

01:22:07.210 --> 01:22:08.830
And they have a set format.

01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:13.390
And they send the same kind
of people around to each one.

01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:18.790
And there's some compliance
with state requirements

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:21.280
and funding and
things like that.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.460
But it really was
a comprehensive.

01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.770
And they looked in
these five focus areas.

01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:31.960
And they essentially--
when you got the feedback

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.450
from most of the smaller
properties, at least,

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.340
they felt like this
was a great program.

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:41.770
Because it gave them the
ability to focus harder

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:45.230
on things on a periodic basis.

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:48.790
And then when you came back, you
measured those areas and said,

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:54.810
OK, what else was
going on at that point?

01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:56.500
I think that's where
I'm going to stop.

01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.330
Yeah.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:00.730
Anybody have any last questions?

01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:04.581
We can pick this up a little
bit in the service contracting

01:23:04.581 --> 01:23:05.080
stuff.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.240
Because it comes up there, too.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.420
The difference
between performance

01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:15.160
in your internal operations and
performance by your contractors

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.080
is nothing.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.280
In fact, it's harder to
manage the service contract.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.510
And we can talk about
that at the next one.

01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:27.156
OK.

01:23:27.156 --> 01:23:28.840
Anybody?

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.440
Great.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.990
Thanks.
