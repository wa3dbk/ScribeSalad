GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So now we

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.740
resume after our hiatus
in the introductory theme,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
because of the snow day.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.360
We resume the
introductory theme, right?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.510
And this is the second of
three introductory lectures.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.710
And today we deal with the
modal characteristics and role.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.900
So we talk about the different
modes of public transportation

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.350
and their characteristics
and what role they play.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.600
We're looking at the range
of modes and services,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.040
the descriptions of each mode.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.600
And we'll do some comparisons
in terms of how they perform.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.180
So what are the
roles for each mode?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.910
When we think about the
different modes that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.372
can be used for
transportation, we

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:02.870
can think in
different dimensions.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.240
And one of them is going from
low density to high density.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.450
That is from very
sparse OD matrices

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.970
where origins and
destinations are

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
both scattered in a geographical
area to a situation where,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.700
along a particular corridor,
there are concentrated origin

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.310
destination pairs and
many people wanting

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.980
to travel along the corridor.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.540
Obviously this
happens more in cities

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.830
than it happens in rural areas.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.060
And we also see
that we can think

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.390
about it in that same dimension
from having low vehicle

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.630
capacity being necessary
to requiring high vehicle

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.420
capacity.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.990
And by capacity, I
mean the capacity

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.150
of a vehicle to hold
passengers inside, right?

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.440
So in that direction, we have
private modes on the top.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.320
And we have public modes,
so-called public at the bottom.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.220
So we all know what the auto is.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.620
It's a private mode that is
often used a single person,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
sometimes by a family.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.470
And yeah, so very low density
of the payer being served.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.140
Then you go to
carpool where people

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.090
are more in that same vehicle.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.920
And there might be multiple
stops along the way.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.320
And vanpool, slightly
larger vehicle.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.370
This is often private.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.330
So it could be arrangements
between co-workers

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.050
requiring capacity
higher than a normal car.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.010
So they get a van.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.700
And maybe one of them drives
it or maybe they hire a driver.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.180
So then in the public
side we have taxi.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.370
And I'm using the
term here generally.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.780
So you can think of
this as one of the newer

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.760
forms of taxi of
transportation that were

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.180
companies like Uber and Lyft.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.830
So you might hail a
cab just for yourself.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.000
And that's the extreme.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Or you might use
the pool servicing,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.440
the pool services offered
by those companies,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.910
or you might share a taxi.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.244
So you start increasing the
utilization of that vehicle.

00:03:08.244 --> 00:03:09.160
Then we have publicos.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.490
Publicos are-- they
can be cars or vans.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.890
They're operated by a private
driver often in an association.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.240
And they usually
drive these vehicles

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.550
along more semi-flexible,
semi-fixed corridors.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.040
So people more or less
know the routes they serve.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.120
They have some flexibility.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.010
So they can say,
well, can you take me,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.220
you know, around the corner.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.240
And they'll do that.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.210
So it's the mode that is sort of
right before formalized public

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.230
transportation.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.550
Then we have fixed route bus.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.190
That's the route
one and the buses

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.550
here in Boston and in many
places, traditional bus

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.420
service.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.910
BRT, which is bus
rapid transit, which

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.160
is a mode where buses are being
used to deliver transit that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.130
is generally delivered
via rail services,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.090
light rail services
in particular.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.590
We'll look at some examples
later in this lecture.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.290
And then we have light rail
like Boston's Green Line

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.220
and heavy rail, which is the
traditional subway or Metro

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.570
system, right?

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.089
In the middle sometimes
subscription bus.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.140
So the car services
that are sometimes--

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.550
it's oft-- like a
normal sized bus.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.380
It could be paid
for by a company

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.720
to get its employees
to the site, right?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.520
So it's somewhere in the middle.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.540
Because it's not public.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.800
So not everybody can use it.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.530
But it's not private.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.660
Because somebody
else, so there's

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.700
a third party who is
providing the service.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.610
So along that same direction
of increasing vehicle

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.680
capacity and passenger flows.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.610
We can also look at what happens
to the operating arrangements.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.310
And we have three operating
arrangements listed here,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.510
three classes.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.590
What happens to drivers?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.030
What happens to right-of-way?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.730
What happens to
routing and scheduling?

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.600
So how much does it
cost to have drivers

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.050
operating a private car?

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.460
If it's just you, you
don't think about the cost,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.040
although you could assume some
cost for your value of time.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.590
But you're not paying
someone to drive you often.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.670
As you move to van,
as I said earlier,

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.060
if it's an arrangement where
you or one of your friends

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.340
is the one driving the
van that's free as well.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.680
Or if you hire a driver, then
it becomes a low cost salary

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.410
or payment for that
driving service.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.540
Then we have mini bus and bus.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.820
So depending on the
size of the system

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.330
and how big the vehicles
are and the context of how

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.260
that driver gets hired,
it could be low cost.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.000
But as [INAUDIBLE]
and labor unions,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.730
then the cost starts
increasing, right?

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.730
So you have higher
salaries, and especially

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.920
as you move towards light
rail and heavy rail,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.510
much higher salaries
for drivers.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.740
However, when we get to heavy
rail, especially the more

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.600
modern, the most
advanced systems

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.550
of heavy rail, a lot of
these are driverless.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.200
They operate automatically.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.240
And they might have
attendants inside of them.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.700
But they don't necessarily
need to have attendants.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.520
So you could think
in the extreme,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.140
this is coming
back down to, well,

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.580
it's a robot
driving the vehicle.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.650
And I don't have to
pay for a driver.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.610
In terms of right-of-way, we
start with shared right-of-way,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.910
so cars, vans, minibuses, and
buses typically share the road

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.930
with other cars, right?

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.800
So they're sharing the space.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.940
And they're stuck in
traffic, if there is traffic.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.660
For bus, light rail,
you have a mix.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.930
Some of these systems
can operate only

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.040
in a shared right-of-way or
only in dedicated corridors

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.300
or a mix of both.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.260
So light rail systems, for
example, often have shared--

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.899
often have dedicated
right-of-ways,

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.440
but when they hit
intersections, they

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.660
have to wait like
all the other cars

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.662
to cross the intersection,
not always, but often.

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:09.370
And then there's
dedicated right-of-ways,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.840
which is more typical for Metro
systems where it's a tunnel

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.530
or it's a grade or
it's up and over, yeah,

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.710
like an elevated section.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.440
But it's dedicated
to this Metro system.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.750
So you have a question,
[AUDIENCE],, yeah?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, now, light rail.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.120
What would you call light
rail on certain segments

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.020
that needs--

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.045
that has its own
complete right-of-way

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:35.290
it's grade separated?

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.440
Because they have that--

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.930
these big systems where
they're partially light rail

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.830
and they're
partially segregated,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.149
and even that heavy
rail that even has

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:44.440
occasional crossing [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.200
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's right, yeah, yeah.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.075
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:47.616
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Absolutely.

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:48.920
And that's a great question.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.300
So the question is
why, or how do we

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.137
label some services that
share characteristics

00:07:57.137 --> 00:07:57.970
that I'm describing.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.790
I'm seeing Metro as this way
and light rail as this way.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.120
But there are, in fact,
systems that combines

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.510
some of these characteristics.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.320
So I'm talking about the
stereotypical descriptions

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.620
of each system.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.290
And one of the points
of this lecture

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.410
is, in fact, that it's blurry.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.620
All these lines are blurry.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.040
And you can combine
different characteristics.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.470
So, yeah.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.517
But it's still
useful as a framework

00:08:22.517 --> 00:08:24.100
to think about all
the different modes

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.706
and their typical or
stereotypical characteristics.

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:31.400
Right, so, routing
and scheduling,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.990
so if you're in your own car,
it's fully flexible, right?

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.140
You decide where the car is,
when it leaves, when it ends,

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.690
its trip.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.669
As you move towards
minibus and you're

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.434
sharing the ride
with other people,

00:08:44.434 --> 00:08:47.500
it might have either fixed
routes or fully flexible

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.160
or somewhere in between, like
the Publicos that I described

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.590
where there is a
semi-fixed route

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.900
but with some
flexibility to deviate

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.530
from those to accommodate
certain passenger's

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:00.820
destinations.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.760
And then as we move to
the most formal systems,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.040
it's a picked through--
it's a published service

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.890
plan with stops
at certain places

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.430
and people know
where to go take it.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.109
Any questions on the
terms of services?

00:09:15.109 --> 00:09:15.734
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:16.182
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:16.182 --> 00:09:16.910
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
[INAUDIBLE],, yes?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.740
AUDIENCE: On Publicos.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.990
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.210
AUDIENCE: Typically the
flexibility would be,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.650
would be with the alighting.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.900
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.530
AUDIENCE: You would have
to know where to board.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:25.810
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's right.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.110
AUDIENCE: But they could
drop you off anyplace.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.360
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.320
Sometimes you can
call the companies.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.410
And they can communicate and
say, arrange for a pickup.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.184
But most typically, yeah,
you have more flexibility

00:09:37.184 --> 00:09:38.100
on the alighting side.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.220
All right.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.929
Other categories.

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:44.220
Let's talk about rights-of-way.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.670
We started talking about that.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.380
So degree of segregation.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.110
We can think about
three different levels,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.000
surface with mixed traffic.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.120
This is typical for
buses or light rail that

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.800
has no preferential treatment.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.810
Then we go to
longitudinal separation

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.790
with at-grade crossing.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.920
Well, the Green Line here in
Boston is mostly like that,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.170
several benches are like that.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.240
So they run on their own track.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.950
When they hit an
intersection, they

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.310
have to wait for the red
light with other cars.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.160
Some sections of the
Green Line are actually

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.840
surface with mixed traffic.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.740
I'm thinking about the
last end of the E line.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.570
And then full separation, right?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.090
So that could be at-grade
tunnel, elevated.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:25.810
Technologies.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.330
Let's talk about technologies.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.690
Support, which is referring
to contact between the vehicle

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:34.180
on the surface, what
counters the force of gravity

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.070
essentially for these vehicles.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.430
We have rubber tire
on concrete for buses.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.290
That's typically what it is.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.520
Some trains have that.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.400
If you go through the Metro
system in Paris, for example,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:50.170
you'll see rubber tire on
concrete for their Metro.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.890
That has a benefit over steel
wheel on steel rail in terms

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.680
of the grip, and,
therefore, acceleration

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.270
and braking distances.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.680
They can be shorter.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.890
Steel wheel and steel rail is
more common for rail systems.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.470
And the maintenance
cost is lower.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.670
And they last longer.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.510
But they have a lower
coefficient of friction.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.900
So braking distances are longer.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.977
And the capacity to climb
very steep grades is reduced.

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:19.810
You have a question?

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you
think Paris [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.915
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I don't know.

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.580
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah, I

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.700
don't know why they chose that.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.740
AUDIENCE: I have an answer.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.031
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah?

00:11:31.031 --> 00:11:32.860
AUDIENCE: The
Michelin, the company,

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.100
when they were rebuilding
the Metro after World War

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.517
II put a lot of pressure on
their jeeps [? for climbing ?]

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:40.599
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That sounds more likely.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:43.147
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of
a conspiracy theory but

00:11:43.147 --> 00:11:44.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.570
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Not a conspiracy but,

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.290
yeah, the local industry being
favored in the construction

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.216
of a system.

00:11:51.216 --> 00:11:52.590
That makes a lot
of sense, right?

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.660
So, I'll buy that.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.390
Right, so other support systems.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.920
Let's get some ideas.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.350
Besides these very
traditional rubber

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.780
on concrete or
rubber and asphalt,

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.250
steel wheel on steel rail.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.110
What other forms
of support exist?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.735
Some of them are fancy, some
of them are less common.

00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:13.507
Let's start over here with

00:12:13.507 --> 00:12:15.000
AUDIENCE: Magnetic levitation.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.950
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Magnetic levitation, so Maglev,

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.550
right?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.750
You can think about some of the
Japanese systems that do that.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.400
For a very high speed rail,
you want to reduce friction.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.300
So use magnetic levitation
to reduce friction.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.070
Over here.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.710
AUDIENCE: No contact [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.300
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah,
well, not a real system yet.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.650
It can't take turns.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.170
But yeah, so air.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.790
It's some other
form of levitation,

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.990
right, well, based on
air pressure, and yeah.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.280
Any other ideas?

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.786
AUDIENCE: Small
airplanes [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:49.786 --> 00:12:51.076
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:53.230
We're not-- well, in this
course, that is right.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.771
It's a form of public
transportation.

00:12:54.771 --> 00:12:58.510
In this course we are excluding
some forms of public transit.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.460
We're excluding airplanes.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.480
You could argue that
elevators are a form

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.580
of public transportation.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.490
They go up and
down along a track.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.910
And you have stops
that you call.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.740
But we're also excluding them.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.140
So, yes.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.100
I'm thinking more traditionally
but somewhat different

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.696
forms of support.

00:13:19.696 --> 00:13:21.010
AUDIENCE: Cable cars.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.010
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Cable
cars, yes, or gondolas, right?

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:29.150
So suspended cabs that are
taken over the air, yeah.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.650
Yeah.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.336
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Right, there's

00:13:32.336 --> 00:13:34.480
funiculars, which are
[INAUDIBLE] and are,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.480
sort of, they look
like little a rail car.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.340
But they climb
very steep grades.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.904
Yes.

00:13:45.904 --> 00:13:46.890
AUDIENCE: Ferries.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.306
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Ferries.

00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:50.080
So if you go to
Translink in Vancouver,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.570
ferries are part of their
transit system, yeah.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.250
So, OK, I think that
covers some ideas.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.500
Let's talk about guidance now.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.960
And when I say guidance,
I mean lateral control.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.460
What steers the vehicle?

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.420
So, traditionally steered
by the driver, right?

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.950
That's bus.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.580
For rail, obviously the
vehicle is guided by the track.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.730
And then there are
other forms of steering.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.100
Any ideas of what they could be?

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.803
AUDIENCE?

00:14:15.803 --> 00:14:20.195
AUDIENCE: I mean, this is
also a little bit, maybe,

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:22.995
little bit into the future
but self-driving vehicles.

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.370
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes, so

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.460
you have a robot with a Servo
that's steering the thing,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.030
yeah.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.330
We have an example in this
lecture of real systems

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.214
that already do that, yeah.

00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:36.015
AUDIENCE: There's [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:37.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's right.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.220
We have a picture of that.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.380
And so great.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.229
All right, great, so,
yeah, examples of that.

00:14:45.229 --> 00:14:47.020
Now let's talk about
energy and propulsion.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.810
So for bus, the most
traditional thing

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.217
is to have a diesel
internal combustion engine.

00:14:53.217 --> 00:14:54.800
It used to be the
conventional engine.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.580
Now they've really improved
with fuel injection

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.110
and other technologies.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.840
They've made them clean diesel.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.980
So they control the exhaust.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.490
And these engines can shut
down and start very cleanly

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.080
without wasting of fuel.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.390
So, they reduce
pollution and noise.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.380
There's compressed natural
gas and abbreviated CNG.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.010
A lot of the fleet here in
Boston, bus fleet, is CNG.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.330
And they're pretty loud.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.970
And they have a CNG
logo in the back.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.270
So you'll notice
when you see them.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.200
Those are-- they require special
maintenance and refueling

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.790
facilities, of course.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.950
And, at least in North America,
CNG was popular for a while.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.310
But now agencies
are switching back

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.040
to diesel, and in particular,
clean diesel and hybrid

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.660
electric with diesel.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.556
So fully electric buses exist.

00:15:48.556 --> 00:15:49.680
And they're getting better.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.500
Battery energy storage
is getting better.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.900
So we have fully electric
buses that can service--

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.040
that can provide
service for many hours

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.520
without recharge in between.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.560
So that's great.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.020
And as I mentioned,
hybrid diesel electric.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.920
That's very common.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.030
I think it's being the
preferred bus mode now, so

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.780
preferred energy system or
propulsion system for buses.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.630
So often how this works is
that you have a diesel--a clean

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.080
diesel engine, that powers
an electric generator,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.370
which stores electric energy.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.400
And then on each wheel,
you have electric motors.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.250
So, in fact, the propulsion
directly is electric.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.870
And you're only using the
motor to generate electricity.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.521
So you can get a lot
of fuel efficiency

00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:35.520
from that, especially
because all of these buses

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.260
stops so often.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:36.760
Right?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.000
They have very-- a
lot of stop and go.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.990
And so sometimes you
can just kill the engine

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.880
when the bus is stopped.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.980
All right, what about control?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.470
So we talked about guidance,
which is lateral control.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.340
What about longitudinal control?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.450
So how do you control
when you stop?

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.360
How do you accelerate how
quickly you go or brake?

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.180
So we have manual or visual.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.690
So buses are typically
driven by a person who

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.310
has a brake and a accelerator.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.920
And they control everything
manually and on site.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.780
There is also
manual with signals.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.880
This is more typically for rail.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.430
You have signals that
might set a limit, a speed

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.560
limit on the vehicle
and protect trains

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.750
from crashing into each other.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.250
And then there's
fully automatic.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:28.780
So you have a robot controlling
the longitudinal movement

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.710
of the vehicle.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.650
Questions on these technologies?

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.540
We'll see some examples.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.040
[AUDIENCE]?

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.529
AUDIENCE: In terms of
automatic [INAUDIBLE] as well?

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:39.820
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.019
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
bus exactly where it is.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:44.310
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.755
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's right, yeah.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.940
OK, so we talked about
automatic train protection.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.000
Here's how it works.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.150
This is the classical
block system for rails.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.050
And here's how we control
the longitudinal movement

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.950
in a system like the red line.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.460
So this is the
fixed block system.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.420
What you do is that you divide
the track into sections.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.930
And the goal of the system
is to prevent trains

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.290
from colliding into each other.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.120
So let's suppose that there's a
train right here and in maroon.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.030
And it's occupying
a section of track.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.900
The track knows that a train
is occupying that segment.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.280
And to prevent a
collision, it blocks trains

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.530
from entering the
previous segment.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.700
OK?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.360
And how does it do that?

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.160
It does that by setting the
speed limit on the segment

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.890
to [INAUDIBLE] upstream to 0.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.090
So if a train were to
enter that segment,

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.300
it would be braked
automatically.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.090
And then the speed
limit gets increased

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.230
as you go farther upstream.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.080
So a train can move
along the track.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.630
But if it gets too close
to the piece of track

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.430
to being occupied, it will
have to slow down or brake.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.940
Have you been on a train
here or elsewhere where

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.520
you're braked all of
a sudden in the middle

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.993
of the track between stations?

00:19:10.993 --> 00:19:14.070
Yeah, and then normally you
hear the brakes going off.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.790
And then it starts again.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.880
So what happens in those
cases is that the driver

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.410
exceeded the speed limit.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.080
And the automatic train
protection system kicked in.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.570
It brakes, it brings
the train to a halt.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.180
And the driver won't be able
to start the train again

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.510
until the pressure on the
brake system is released.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.290
Questions?

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.256
AUDIENCE: Do you know that the
DC Metro does not have this?

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:36.734
Because I used to never ride
the front or the back car.

00:19:36.734 --> 00:19:39.668
Because they were notorious
for hitting each other,

00:19:39.668 --> 00:19:40.792
at least like 10 years ago.

00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:42.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, they have that.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.525
So if-- they have a system
to prevent collisions.

00:19:45.525 --> 00:19:46.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.066
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
If it thinks--

00:19:48.066 --> 00:19:51.509
if it's not maintained properly,
then things can happen.

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:53.300
Or it could be that
they haven't enabled it

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.620
in some sections of the track.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.702
I don't know the details.

00:19:55.702 --> 00:19:57.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because there

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.440
were a lot of people
that died [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:58.520
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.050
AUDIENCE: There was like--

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.550
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, so--

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.381
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] years
ago the DC Metro [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:03.381 --> 00:20:04.880
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
All right,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.630
so, one of the things with
block systems like this

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.760
is that they constrain
the capacity of the line.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.950
If we look at the red
line, in particular,

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.370
this is the line that
puts a constraint

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.500
on the frequency of service.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.830
Approximately three minutes.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.740
You can't run service
more often than that.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.230
And the red line, because
of this, the way the blocks

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.280
were assigned.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.480
So what happens?

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.350
As you're moving from
Kendall to Charles MGH,

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.070
and particularly in the
segments from MGH to Park,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.780
this segment right here
is downhill, right?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.600
You're going from elevated
downhill to subway.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.490
So you're also going downhill
on steel wheel on steel rail.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.020
And the track may be wet.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.470
Because it was outside.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.560
So there's a concern
that the braking distance

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.270
might be quite long.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.840
And to be very safe and
conservative, what happens

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.070
is that trains are
not allowed to enter

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.130
Park Street until
the train ahead

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.630
departs Downtown Crossing.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.330
So you need to clear the
platform of Downtown Crossing.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.620
And only then can you start
moving into Park Street.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.520
So that might cause trains to
be held up at Charles actually.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.410
So, yeah.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:24.300
So if we look at the time that
it takes the train to close in,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.230
that is from the beginning
when the head of the train

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:34.830
hits the circuit just after
Charles MGH to the time it

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.210
actually gets to
Park Street and opens

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.670
it's doors, the dwell time at
Park Street serving passengers,

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.884
allowing passengers to
get off and to board.

00:21:43.884 --> 00:21:45.300
And then you have
the running time

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.910
between Park Street
and Downtown Crossing.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.980
And finally the time
it requires a train

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.180
to close its doors and exit
and for the tail of the train

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.580
to clear the circuit so that
it's no longer occupying

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.150
the circuit.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.350
That's about three minutes.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.430
You can't run service
more often than not.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.460
So you would have to change
the blocking, the sign

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.850
of this segment to the
red line if you wanted

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.240
to increase the frequency.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.160
More modern systems are
indications based train control

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.270
systems.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.370
And what happens
in those cases is

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.810
that the blocks are not fixed.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.940
They move between vehicles.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.060
A computer will look at the
speeds and the distances

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:26.970
between trains and
generate virtual blocks

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.680
that are quite short.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.620
And they can control
with finer precision

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.725
how the speed limits
that a train has that

00:22:34.725 --> 00:22:36.720
are being applied for safety.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.140
Often, these are in systems that
are automatically controlled.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.540
So you have the
moving block system,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.640
which increases the capacity.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.670
And you have a computer
also regulating

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.640
the speed, which eliminates
driver variability

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.640
and further increases the
capacity of the system.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.599
Any questions on blocking?

00:22:57.599 --> 00:22:59.390
AUDIENCE: What are some
examples of systems

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.367
that are the most modern?

00:23:01.367 --> 00:23:03.950
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: I will
give some examples next slide

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:04.449
actually.

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.230
So great segue.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.480
So levels of
automated protection.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.770
So we start with basic.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.631
The Green Line has
no [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:13.130
Right?

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:17.070
So, and that's why a few
years ago, somebody was--

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.672
well, said the
person was texting.

00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:20.630
But then they said there
was a medical problem.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.350
I'm not sure.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.850
So--

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.340
AUDIENCE: That's quite
a medical problem.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.970
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So, yeah.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.550
So a train rear-ended
another one.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.680
It wasn't too bad.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.230
I don't think
anybody was killed.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.350
But, yeah, so there
are advisory signals

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:40.160
along the track that say, you
should go or you should not go.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.320
Or you should go slowly.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.271
But it's up to the driver
to regulate that speed.

00:23:45.271 --> 00:23:47.646
AUDIENCE: On the Green Line
as well one of the provisions

00:23:47.646 --> 00:23:49.363
is on the wayside,
the signal [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:49.363 --> 00:23:51.380
are so old that if you
get your red signal

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:56.140
and it is not changing
and you wait 60 seconds,

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.140
you can proceed through.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.806
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right,
and you have to proceed slowly.

00:23:59.806 --> 00:24:00.710
But, yeah.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.280
Right.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.540
So they allow trains to
sometimes to both two trains

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.790
to birth on a platform
in some cases,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:11.090
although they're not
really liking that anymore.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.160
But they used it
a little bit more.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:13.890
Right, so--

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:14.570
AUDIENCE: And in
Chicago, though,

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.542
that train's
[INAUDIBLE] you can call

00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:19.179
to get clearance to pull past
the red signal [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:19.179 --> 00:24:21.470
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's true for most systems.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.370
You can override.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:27.530
And with a very slow speed you
can take control and manually--

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.080
and you need that, because
sometimes these systems fail.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.269
And they all go red.

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.810
So you still have
to move the trains.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.640
And you need this
override system.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.670
But it won't allow
quick movement.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.440
AUDIENCE: That's how we had
runaway train on Red Line.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.690
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yep.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.240
OK.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.810
The next level of automation
is manually setting the speed

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.637
below the maximum level.

00:24:46.637 --> 00:24:48.470
That's the Red Line,
what he just described.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:52.570
In-cab signals, the speed limit
of the block that the train is

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.880
occupying is sent to the
cab so that the driver

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.680
knows what the speed limit is.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.350
It's up to the driver to
determine what the speed is.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.020
But if the driver
exceeds that speed,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.640
the automatic train
protection system

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.270
kicks in and brakes the
train to a halt. All right?

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.420
Then we have manual setting
of dwell times only.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.230
So the train drives
itself between stations.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.980
The driver decides on
the door opening and door

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.140
closing manually and,
therefore, controls how long

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.000
the doors are open for.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.690
So it's a more advanced
system from the '70s and '80s.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.130
And then we have
semi-automated so we

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.640
have automatic train supervision
or automatic train regulation.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.200
A good example of
this is Tren Urbano

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.950
in San Juan, Puerto Rico
and the London Underground

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.370
central line.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:45.800
So here the train can
drive itself automatically

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.600
between stations.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.330
The driver only pushes
a button to tell

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.260
the train go to the next
station essentially.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.480
In Tren Urbano's
case, and I imagine

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.690
this is true in all system.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.560
The drivers are
required to manually

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.620
operate for small fraction
of their [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.110
to manually control
trains if there

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.594
is a failure of the system Eli?

00:26:10.594 --> 00:26:14.380
AUDIENCE: But they don't
control dwell times in these?

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.590
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
They can but often not.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:19.480
Often the dwell times
are also regulated.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.510
AUDIENCE: They
definitely control them

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.600
on the Central Line.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.100
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, so--

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:25.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Warning
for the people on the platform.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.660
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.690
AUDIENCE: --people
on the platform.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.310
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So you have this button

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.680
that you push, the driver,
to sort of authorize

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.640
the movement forward.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.060
So you can, right,
you can not press it

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.580
and thereby extend
the dwell time.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.440
But the speed between the
stations and everything else

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.440
is the parking of the
train at the platform

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:45.648
and the opening of the doors.

00:26:45.648 --> 00:26:47.270
It all happens automatically.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.520
Then you have full automation.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.400
And this comes often
with a communications

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.120
based train control.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.830
So you could drive this
without any driver inside.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.860
Shut-- airport trains
are often like this.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.040
But we're seeing this in
Metro systems as well.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.840
In some systems, they
still have attendants

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.960
or they still have a
driver just in case

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.100
or for political reasons.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.010
But these systems
can drive themselves.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.500
You often need
platform screen doors.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.860
That's one of the concerns
with fully automatic systems.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.065
It allows people to
go into the track

00:27:31.065 --> 00:27:32.690
and the computer
won't see them, right?

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:38.840
So it has to be a more
controlled system.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:42.900
Line 14 in Paris is
another example of that.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.950
Yeah, and then you can
[INAUDIBLE] capacity

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.310
through a moving block system.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:52.670
And here's an example of
the C Line in New York City.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.170
Questions?

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.830
AUDIENCE: You said
[INAUDIBLE] people [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.830
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, so these systems

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.526
have platform screen
doors and they

00:28:00.526 --> 00:28:01.650
don't have a driver, right?

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.990
So you go in and they
move between stations.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.660
But you also have
lots of Metro systems

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.910
in cities that work like that.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.770
As of 2013, there were 48
fully automated Metro lines

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:18.060
in 32 cities over the world
that didn't require a driver

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.634
to operate.

00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:19.800
And that number is going up.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:23.685
OK.

00:28:23.685 --> 00:28:24.560
Let's talk about bus.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.143
What is a bus?

00:28:25.143 --> 00:28:27.595
And [INAUDIBLE] we're talking
about the stereotypical--

00:28:27.595 --> 00:28:29.720
this is the what is a bus,
what is a train lecture.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:35.290
So this is the stereotypical
description of what a bus is.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:39.630
But of course, the boundaries
between these modes are blurry.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.230
So stereotypical
definitions are of vehicle

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.690
operating individually
with rubber tires

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:47.270
with manual lateral and
manual longitudinal control,

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.630
so a driver has full control.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.330
Sizes.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.290
They can be small like a minibus
can carry 10 to 20 passengers.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.900
And you could go up to
bi-articulated carrying

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.920
as much as a light rail system,
a light rail train, so up

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.280
to 250 passengers.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.990
If you at systems like
Curitiba in Brazil.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.731
Vehicle design, you can have
high floor design or low floor

00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:09.230
design.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.880
Can somebody suggest
what the difference is

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.180
and what the benefit
of low floor is?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:15.680
Eli?

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.350
AUDIENCE: Low floor is better
for wheelchair accessibility.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.890
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Uh-huh, there's

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.556
another benefit.

00:29:19.556 --> 00:29:21.170
So one of the
benefits of low floor

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.994
is wheelchair accessibility.

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:23.660
Another benefit?

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:24.860
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sorry?

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.444
AUDIENCE: The boarcding
time is lower.

00:29:26.444 --> 00:29:28.651
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Shorter dwell times, right?

00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:31.190
These people are not climbing
stairs to get on the vehicle

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:32.330
or off the vehicle.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.699
You can speed up the process
and increase capacity.

00:29:34.699 --> 00:29:35.240
Another idea?

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.120
AUDIENCE: The ride
is more stable?

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.453
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Sorry?

00:29:38.453 --> 00:29:39.950
AUDIENCE: The ride
is more stable.

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.241
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I'm not sure that's the case.

00:29:42.241 --> 00:29:45.220
I don't think that has
a large impact on--

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.890
yeah, on-- I don't think vehicle
design in terms of high floor

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.680
or low floor increases
stability that much, not

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.040
anyway for the speeds
at which these buses go.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.450
It's not much of a
critical consideration.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.900
OK, right-of-way.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.440
So all options are available.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.330
You could be on the street
sharing your lane with cars.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.400
Or you could have a
dedicated bus lane

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.790
with no signals and
preferential treatment

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.640
if you have some signals.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.260
So everything goes.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.980
In terms of guidance,
often it is manual.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.770
But sometimes you
have the systems

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.870
to automatically guide the bus.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:28.500
And we'll see two examples of
that later in this lecture.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.197
Propulsion.

00:30:29.197 --> 00:30:30.280
All options are available.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:30.900
You have electric.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.566
You have diesel.

00:30:31.566 --> 00:30:34.830
You have hybrid, everything.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.100
And in terms of fare
payment, another key decision

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.340
if you're thinking of a
new bus system in your city

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.290
is, do you have
the people paying

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.900
the fare as they
get on the vehicle

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.120
or do you want that to--

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.580
do you want that payment
to happen outside?

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.060
So are you going to make
some stations where people

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.130
pay their fare and then
board without having

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.960
to interact with a fare box?

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.520
The benefit of the latter
is that you speed up

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.500
the dwell times.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.120
But of course, you
need to spend more

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.740
on fare gates or some other
means of paying a fare.

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.635
AUDIENCE: Is there a benefit
to high floor for urban buses?

00:31:13.635 --> 00:31:15.010
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: There--

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.530
AUDIENCE: Not intercity coaches.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.320
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So they are cheaper.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.460
Because it's easier.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:25.230
You have more space to, right,
to put all the mechanical parts

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.780
of the bus.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.770
And I'll actually show
you in some BRT systems,

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.655
like, Curitibas, it
is very high floor.

00:31:32.655 --> 00:31:33.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:33.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.976
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: And
that's a very high capacity.

00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:37.650
So, yeah.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.840
So this is a bus.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.550
This is a traditional 40 foot
bus that seats 39 people.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.610
It has capacity for 56
people if you count standees.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.460
You can crush a
few more people in.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.870
Here's a double deck,
capacity for 70 to 80 people.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.360
The upper deck is
for sitting only.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.710
If they see you
standing, the driver

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.700
will announce that you have
to sit down for safety though.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.910
Articulated bus in Bogota.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.420
So now you're getting
a bigger size.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.590
You have two sections much like
the light rail, the Green Line

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.580
vehicle here in Boston.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.140
But this is a bus.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.770
And bi-articulated so you
can keep adding sections.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.740
This is the example
that I mentioned

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.870
where it's a high floor bus.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:28.430
Notice how high the doors are.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:32.240
And obviously no one's going
to jump from the street

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.050
up or down.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.040
These are [INAUDIBLE]
at specific stations.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.282
Here's the photo.

00:32:38.282 --> 00:32:39.240
These are the stations.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.360
You can see other
gates so people

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.250
have to enter the stations and
pay their fare as they go in.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.110
And, sorry, and then there
are these little platforms

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.800
that stick out.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.870
The bus stops right
in front of those.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.680
And the doors open
wide much like a Metro

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.950
door will open very quickly
to allow level boarding.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:03.830
So this [INAUDIBLE] of
BRT, bus rapid transit,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.930
with all the features
of bus rapid transit.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:13.080
So you have [INAUDIBLE]
link, fare collection.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.140
You have very wide doors.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.000
So it behaves like
a rail system.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.620
But it's buses that
are serving it.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.900
Were there some questions?

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.980
I saw some hands.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980
Perhaps I answered them.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.170
OK.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.550
Now a minibus, a
very small minibus.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.370
So, if there were a cute bus,
perhaps this is it, right?

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.640
So this is in Avignon, France.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.950
It says free service one
bus every six minutes

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:48.080
from 7:30 to 7:30 from
Monday to Saturday.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.800
So this probably
sits 10 people about.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.160
So here's [INAUDIBLE]
Cambridgeshire busway

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.690
in the UK.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.220
This is automatically guided.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.934
So the bus has
the mechanical arm

00:34:03.934 --> 00:34:05.350
that sticks in
front of the wheels

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.900
or behind the
wheels with a curb.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:12.250
And it sort of holds
laterally against the,

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.110
these edges of concrete.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.139
And so if that guideway
turn, the steering wheel

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.650
will also turn.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.780
That make sense?

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.929
The benefit of this is
that you can run quick.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:27.370
You can sort of operate at high
speed through narrow sections.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.340
This is more useful in tunnels.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.110
So, for example, the
Silver Line here in Boston

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.317
could operate much faster if
it had that system to guide it.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.489
OK.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.889
Here's another
system for guidance.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:48.150
Can somebody tell
me how this works?

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.508
It goes back to what
Emily said earlier.

00:34:50.508 --> 00:34:52.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:52.520
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: What?

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:52.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.105
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Do you notice these lines

00:34:55.105 --> 00:34:55.810
on the floor?

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.790
So there's a camera looking
down right in front.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.370
And it's-- this camera is
program to automatically steer

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:07.270
the bus such that it
remains along that line.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.280
So the lateral control of
the bus in [INAUDIBLE] it

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.561
runs in France.

00:35:13.561 --> 00:35:15.561
It is fully automatic.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.530
Eli?

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.155
AUDIENCE: What's the
advantage of that?

00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:22.140
Like [INAUDIBLE]
dedicated [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.015
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You can [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:24.015 --> 00:35:26.520
this is a pretty narrow section
if we're going both ways.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:33.230
So [INAUDIBLE] computers are
better at controlling things,

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.730
so--

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.420
and we could highlight
other features

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.780
like this sign here saying
when the buses are coming.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.759
And so this is a
nicer bus system

00:35:46.759 --> 00:35:47.800
with elements of the BRT.

00:35:50.324 --> 00:35:52.240
That's another comment
I want [INAUDIBLE] BRT.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.750
BRT is-- the full BRT is
much like [INAUDIBLE] example

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.050
I showed you, but
especially in North America

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:03.920
and actually all over
the world, agencies

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.700
are taking elements of BRT and
applying somewhat selectively.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.060
Sometimes they call it
BRT even so they take

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.640
the branding of BRT into it.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.740
Hopefully, it's more
than just the branding

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:19.267
and they've taken
other [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:19.267 --> 00:36:22.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what happens

00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:24.870
when the lines get
dirty or there's snow?

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.180
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.100
I imagine you have to clean
and repaint the lines often.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.250
Or you have to take control.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.750
Yeah.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.702
AUDIENCE: --radar.

00:36:35.702 --> 00:36:37.077
AUDIENCE: Other
places where they

00:36:37.077 --> 00:36:39.880
put actually like coils in the
ground and then touch that.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.630
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.130
Yeah.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:44.820
OK.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.986
Let's talk about light rail.

00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:48.270
So stereotypical
description of light rail.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.240
Vehicles operating
individually or in short trains

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.480
with electric motors and
overhead power collectors,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.150
steel wheel on steel rail with
manual or automatic signal

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.350
control.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.470
So if you were a
consultant and you

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.880
were thinking about
[INAUDIBLE] about what, how

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.749
you were deciding on the
key aspects of a new system,

00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:11.290
you could think
about vehicle design.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.620
Are you going to make it
high floor or low floor?

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.360
So some vehicles here
in the Green Line

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.950
are-- we have both
on the Green Line.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.241
I don't know if you've noticed.

00:37:18.241 --> 00:37:19.680
The older ones are high floor.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.010
You have to go upstairs
to enter the vehicle.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.370
And the more-- the newer
ones are low floor.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:31.330
You could have articulated
or rigid body vehicles.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.530
Right-of-way, we have
an option just for bus.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:38.470
And you also have a fully
automated to manually

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.303
[INAUDIBLE] or
things in between.

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.160
And here are some examples.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.450
We have-- this is in Utah,
so the TRAX, T-R- A-X.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.610
And this one goes
through, I believe

00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:00.420
this is an intersection
where cars can cross.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.700
So it's sharing some
aspects of its right of way.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.090
Here's the Metro Blue
Line in Minneapolis.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.460
Both of these take
power electrically

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:16.540
from overhead catenaries
as you see here.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.612
But the third, well,
no, not the third.

00:38:18.612 --> 00:38:19.820
Here we also have catenaries.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:26.320
That's Here is the fourth
example I have of light rail

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.910
it has no catenaries.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:34.390
So this is a more modern
system for powering light rail

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.750
that actually
stereotypical description.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.294
So does somebody
know how this works?

00:38:41.294 --> 00:38:44.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it
has-- you can see three lines.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.100
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
There are three lines.

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.349
So these two are for guidance.

00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.030
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: And
there's one in the middle.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.870
AUDIENCE: Then one is for power.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.310
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's the third rail.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.726
So how do you prevent people
from electrocuting themselves

00:38:53.726 --> 00:38:54.700
when they walk.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.190
Because typically in Metro
systems a third rail,

00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.601
it's [INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:01.100
Huh?

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.344
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
induction maybe?

00:39:03.344 --> 00:39:05.135
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No, it's contact.

00:39:05.135 --> 00:39:06.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.991
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Nope.

00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:09.250
It has to be--

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:11.620
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.370
AUDIENCE: It's in short
insulated sections

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.640
that are only active when
the vehicle is going.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:15.920
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And they're

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.020
electronically controlled.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.670
So the head and the
tail of the train

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.280
emits some signals
that say, I'm over you.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.010
Open, like, turn the
turn the section on.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.240
And only the section that is
under the vehicle is powered.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.240
The rest of it is disconnected.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.130
So it's prettier.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.300
Because you don't have
these overhead catenaries

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.020
that are somewhat
unsightly taking space.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.400
Over in the back?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.420
Sorry.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.430
This is in Bordeaux in France.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.090
AUDIENCE: So is it also
cheaper because it's

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.522
in the ground [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:49.522 --> 00:39:50.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I don't--

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.440
I can imagine that it's
more expensive actually.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.240
But I can't say for sure.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.840
It's getting-- you know, when
this started it was a new thing

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.550
and there were issues with
[INAUDIBLE] and other things.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.570
It's getting more widespread.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.560
And I think they've solved
a lot of [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.930
It's becoming more common,
so I imagine that the cost

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.270
will go down with that.

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.524
AUDIENCE: Back in the '50s
and before New York and DC

00:40:16.524 --> 00:40:18.190
wouldn't allow overhead
so they actually

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.540
had clouds that if they
had conduits in the ground,

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.750
they had to have [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.833
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, underground, yeah.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.680
All right.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.840
Stereotypical description
of heavy rail.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.030
Vehicles operating in
trains with electric motors

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.850
on fully separated right
of way with manual signal

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.520
or automatic longitudinal
control, level boarding

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.830
and off-vehicle fare payment.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.810
So Metro, right?

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.460
If you were designing
a Metro system,

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.190
what would be your
key decisions?

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.990
You would think
about train length.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:52.400
How long will my train be?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.530
It can't be longer
than your platform.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.620
So your station assigned
has to go with this.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.600
If you have old
stations and you're

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.500
having a capacity problem, you
can't just buy longer trains.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:08.720
Some system allow for
the last car to remain,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.340
at least the last
door of the last car

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.380
to remain in the tunnel.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.980
In London you see that.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.470
So a [INAUDIBLE] station
saying, if you're

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.690
in the rear of the
car, move to the front,

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:25.350
because we're entering
a shorter segment.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.400
So that's one of them.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.340
The other things that
could limit the length

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.990
are turning radius radii,
but that's not usually

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.160
a problem with Metro.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.060
Because Metro doesn't usually
have very tight curves.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.560
OK.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.580
Right of way.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.430
So you could have it at-grade.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.270
If you have it at-grade that
means that if you want cars

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:50.480
to cross under or over, you have
to do a tunnel or an overpass.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.450
Elevated, [INAUDIBLE] you
were making the overpass kind

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:57.200
of over a long stretch for
the train and allowing--

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.580
keeping your streets as they
are and a tunnel [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.910
well [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.600
The Tren Urbano in Puerto
Rico has all three types

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.710
of right of ways.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.740
Station spacing is
another consideration.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:14.730
If you space stations out--

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.240
if you have longer distance
between stations that means

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:20.150
you can cover a longer
distance faster.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.700
But that means that
people have to walk longer

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.920
to their final origin
or their, sorry,

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.050
their first-- the real origin
or their real destination.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.640
And their at both
ends of the trip.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.230
And then operating arrangements.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.740
We talked about the different
blocking systems and control

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:37.310
systems.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.950
Do you want this to
be driven by a human

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:43.900
or will a computer
be taking over?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.840
So questions about this?

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:46.420
Yeah?

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.753
AUDIENCE: So the difference
between heavy and light rail

00:42:48.753 --> 00:42:52.210
is it as simple as just
heavy and light rail or--

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:53.710
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No, it has

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.590
nothing to do with
whether-- with the weight

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.240
of the vehicle for sure.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.620
So, but again, and stereotypes--

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.972
AUDIENCE: Well, not of the
vehicle but [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:06.192
the type of vehicle.

00:43:06.192 --> 00:43:08.150
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] no.

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.590
But stereotypically
yes because you

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.425
have streetcars, which are the
track is kind of embedded--

00:43:13.425 --> 00:43:14.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.840
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--on the-- and narrower kind

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.548
of on the ground.

00:43:16.548 --> 00:43:18.270
And then these
heavy rail systems

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.940
tend to have a third rail
and sort of wider gauge.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.770
It's for higher capacity.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.930
So here's an example.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:28.200
This is-- is this
Beijing or Shanghai?

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.460
AUDIENCE: Beijing [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.170
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.040
Yeah, Beijing.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.430
Line 4 in Beijing.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:36.070
And you can see here, so
platform screen doors.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.260
So these will only open
when a train is there.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.640
And it protects
people from being

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:43.750
pushed into the track, which
could happen by accident

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.480
or a person trying to commit
suicide, which is actually

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.880
a big problem for
Metro operators.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.431
Yeah?

00:43:50.431 --> 00:43:53.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you mentioned,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:59.030
do they control the door of
the last car [INAUDIBLE] so--

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.280
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.120
AUDIENCE: --they open--

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.203
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
They don't open the door

00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:06.190
that is not-- yeah, yeah.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:09.190
Only open doors that are right
in front of a platform screen

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.870
door if that makes sense.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.730
And it's hard to align
the train very well.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.420
So you often have these, with a
computer controlling the train,

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.922
to stop precisely
where the doors are.

00:44:22.922 --> 00:44:25.192
AUDIENCE: Do you
know a system of how

00:44:25.192 --> 00:44:31.815
they choose the doors,
which one will be open them?

00:44:31.815 --> 00:44:33.190
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah, I

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.990
mean it's just
based on-- the train

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:37.660
will stop so that its first door
aligns with the first platform

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.350
screen door.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:39.910
And everything
else just follows.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:40.882
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:40.882 --> 00:44:41.368
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Huh?

00:44:41.368 --> 00:44:43.804
AUDIENCE: I think he means with
the control system back here.

00:44:43.804 --> 00:44:45.345
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:47.320
what communication
happens exactly?

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.090
I don't know the
details of each system.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:50.770
It might be a little
[INAUDIBLE] yeah.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.490
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.460
This is an elevated section.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.700
You see the third rail right
here carrying the power.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:05.914
Power.

00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:07.830
Let's have a quick aside
and talk about power.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:18.600
There are two electric sort of
categories of [INAUDIBLE] rail

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.610
is most likely [INAUDIBLE]
volt direct current power.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:32.000
And systems that are
longer [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.980
alternating current at 25
kilovolts, so much higher

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.480
voltage.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.880
Any ideas about the
trade-offs between these two

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.840
or when would you use
one over the other?

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.687
AUDIENCE: Third
rail at low speeds?

00:45:48.687 --> 00:45:50.020
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Maybe.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.100
But more than lower speeds,
it's shorter distances.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.200
So why?

00:45:58.602 --> 00:45:59.741
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:59.741 --> 00:46:01.032
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah?

00:46:01.032 --> 00:46:04.132
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:04.132 --> 00:46:06.090
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So, if you're-- yeah,

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:08.790
so if you're in a tunnel, the
tunnel construction will be

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:14.130
more expensive if you have to
fit in a catenary and space

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.621
for the pick-up, right?

00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:18.120
What else?

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.356
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:19.356 --> 00:46:20.740
AUDIENCE: I think
a lot of it has

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.990
to do with where you
have to build substations

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:24.430
and how power is transmitted.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.970
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And that

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.800
is-- that is the key difference.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.380
Yeah, so--

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] power
is a lot easier to transfer

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:28.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.013
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:46:30.013 --> 00:46:32.930
AUDIENCE: --distances but the
cost--it probably cost more

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:33.430
to--

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.790
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
To maintain the system.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:35.289
Right.

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:40.664
OK, so AC power, well,
you can change the voltage

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.580
on the current, right?

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.260
So you can make it
very high voltage.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.830
And that means that it's easy
and cheaper to transmit over

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.060
longer distances.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.460
So whenever you have
intercity trains,

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:57.120
almost always they will be
overhead high voltage AC.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:01.200
For subways, shorter
distances, tunnels,

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.320
you don't want to have
transformers everywhere.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.810
And the other problem
with high voltage

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.980
is that it arcs more easily
between two pieces of metal.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.000
So in a subway sys-- in
a subway train like this,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.680
you don't have much space
between underneath the train

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.870
to fit things in with
proper electrical isolation.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.640
So if it's an intercity
train, it's higher floor.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.080
You have more space.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.240
But if it's a Metro system,
often you have less space.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:37.230
So if it's DC inside
the train and you

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.890
don't need transformers
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.740
at very short intervals
in your system.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.830
Yeah, so that was a
short parenthesis.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.260
Commuter rail is another
kind of rail system.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.940
So the stereotypical
description.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.950
Vehicles operating in trains
with long station spacing.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.610
This frequently.

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:59.050
Serving long trips
into the central city.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:01.710
There's usually a large
balance between peak hour

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:04.250
and off-peak service.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.760
So commuter rail to bring
people into work in the morning

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:13.350
and out of work [INAUDIBLE]
in [INAUDIBLE] afternoon.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.350
So you often have
service every hour

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.720
or every two hours in
the middle of the day.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.680
It's on the sign for
frequent service.

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:24.210
Your key decision--
the decisions

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.800
are fare collection strategies.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.750
Are you going to put
gates on the whole system

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:30.590
as if it were a Metro system?

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.800
Are you going to
have paper tickets?

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.610
Some systems are moving
towards mobile phone ticketing

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.150
where you buy something
that flashes in colors

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.210
and proves that you've
bought a valid pass.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.920
So different strategies
for fare collection.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.040
Line length, how long-- how
far out from the city center

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.100
are you going to lay
track and provide service?

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:55.060
Are you going to through
route in the CBD?

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.020
That is, is the train going
to only get to the CBD

00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.070
and turn back?

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.050
Or are you going
to cross the city

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:05.460
and provide service
on the other side

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.860
having crossed the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.240
That's pretty critical actually.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.020
Because it's commuter
rail is very directional.

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.010
So if you don't have
a place near the city

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:19.530
to store your trains after
you have inbound service,

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.060
you'd have to then
take them out.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.820
So you're running trips that
cost you money to operate,

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.307
and we're not
serving many trips.

00:49:27.307 --> 00:49:28.890
So if you have through
routing and you

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:32.500
have a yard close
to the city center,

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.690
it might make more sense.

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.920
Station spacing is another issue
and extent of parking capacity.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.730
Why parking?

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:46.580
Because commuter rail is often
accessed with a park and ride

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.520
service, right?

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.260
So you're usually-- you drive
to a commuter rail station.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.520
You park there.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.200
And then you take
the commuter rail.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.755
Questions on commuter rail?

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.180
OK.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.070
Some examples.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.850
[INAUDIBLE] this
[INAUDIBLE] diesel.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.290
So in some sections
it runs on diesel.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:17.800
As it gets closer to the city
center, it uses electric power.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.170
Here's Mumbai.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.850
This one has a catenary.

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:25.932
So it's taking power
from these catenaries.

00:50:25.932 --> 00:50:27.795
This is GO Transit in Toronto.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:34.149
This is typical of commuter rail
having two levels, two decks,

00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:34.940
fit more people in.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:40.550
OK.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:44.070
So what are the traditional
service concepts?

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:45.990
Bus on shared right of way.

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:50.300
Street car or let's say light
rail on a shared right-of-way.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:52.430
Heavy rail on
exclusive right of way.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.100
And then commuter or
regional rail on something

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:58.250
that is semi-exclusive or
exclusive right of way.

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:03.460
Sometimes commuter rail shares
the segments with freight.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.560
So-- and that's
it's semi-exclusive.

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.610
Newer service concepts, BRT.

00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:14.800
So we're looking at using
buses to operate something that

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.840
is more akin to light
rail or even to lighter

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.390
heavy rail, if you want.

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:26.020
So including exclusive lanes
and or transit signal priority

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:30.520
where the signals turn green
when one of these vehicles

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.255
approaches to not delay
the vehicle [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:34.255 --> 00:51:36.820
And then light rail on
exclusive right-of-way,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.725
which makes it more
like heavy rail

00:51:38.725 --> 00:51:41.350
if you look at the stereotypical
descriptions that we had here.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:46.960
OK.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.085
And what else is happening?

00:51:48.085 --> 00:51:49.580
Increasing diversity.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.320
Driver arrangements.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:57.130
Instead of having people hiring
part-timers to cover the peaks

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:01.890
or having 10-hour days
but not five days a week.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.960
And then payment by
vehicle type so you

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.850
as much for [INAUDIBLE]
for a heavy rail car as you

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:11.020
would for a bus.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.050
So let's go back to
part-timers and 10-hour days.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.300
Why are these
[INAUDIBLE] help increase

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.850
the efficiency,
[INAUDIBLE] efficiency,

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:23.940
of a bus or a rail system?

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.128
Why is that necessary?

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.230
AUDIENCE: Like as people that
just work in a peak period

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.250
where you need more--

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.260
if you're operating
more of your fleet

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.510
but if you don't actually
need them for the whole day.

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.900
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.640
So that would be for
part-timers, right?

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:39.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, part-timers.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:39.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, so you

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.870
might need more to run more
service only at the peaks.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:44.430
And the peaks are
not long enough.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:47.772
They're also not--
they're also not spaced--

00:52:47.772 --> 00:52:49.980
they're kind of spaced eight
hours apart aren't they?

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.930
So an eight-hour
day doesn't really

00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:53.700
work to cover both peaks.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.120
So that's why you can do
that by hiring part-timers

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:01.080
or by extending the day to get
10 hours and cover both peaks.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:04.770
OK.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:05.760
Routing and scheduling.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:10.790
So fixed, flexible,
advanced booking.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.530
Yeah, so vehicle types.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:18.180
We have all these minibuses,
articulated buses, rail cars,

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.860
bi-level rail cars, low floor.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.510
We saw some examples.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.445
Control options.

00:53:22.445 --> 00:53:23.820
Traditionally it
was fixed block.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.490
But now we have moving block.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:27.660
And we have fancier
systems [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.460
collisions and to
actually control

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:34.410
the system to run faster
and more even headway.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.320
And you have dual
mode operations.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.690
So bus systems or
light rail systems

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.380
that work more like
buses but also more like

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.980
rails in some segments.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.950
So in some cases, this dual
mode has more to do with power.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:54.390
So it could be a bus that runs
electric in a tunnel section

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.570
but runs diesel [INAUDIBLE]
tunnel section like the Silver

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:59.775
Line here in Boston.

00:53:59.775 --> 00:54:02.370
It could be having some
sort of [INAUDIBLE] system

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:06.810
that operates on streets as
a normal bus would but then

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.280
enters a corridor where it's
fully dedicated to the bus

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.090
system.

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:14.340
So it's operating
in both manners.

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:14.960
Yeah?

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:29.650
AUDIENCE: Why [INAUDIBLE]
I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.650
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I'm not sure I follow.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.100
I can't hear you very well.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:33.600
But--

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.778
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
If you're

00:54:36.778 --> 00:54:38.746
asking about why not run
diesel in the tunnel?

00:54:38.746 --> 00:54:39.495
It's for exhausts.

00:54:39.495 --> 00:54:40.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.480
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah,
so there might be regulations.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.030
You don't want diesel
exhaust in the tunnels.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:49.180
So it's for health reasons.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:51.250
A lot of the newer
buses, like hybrid buses

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.590
that are diesel electric,
because obviously

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.880
if you've got a fully electric
bus, there's no issue.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.446
If you've got a diesel electric,
some of them have a [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:59.446 --> 00:55:01.510
If you're entering
the tunnel you can

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.300
tell it to only use electric.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.100
And it's [INAUDIBLE]
slower it will.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:09.530
But it'll run only on electric.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.910
And then get-- you turn that
off when you exit the station

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.650
to keep generating electricity.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.580
Questions on these?

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:22.243
OK.

00:55:22.243 --> 00:55:23.540
Rail versus bus.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.610
So rail has higher capacity.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.470
Bus has a lower capital costs.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:34.549
It's cheaper to buy a bus than
to buy a rail or to build rail.

00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:37.090
Buses, you buy the vehicle and
the streets are already there.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:40.570
So you're not having
to build stations.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.670
The unit operating costs
are lower for rail.

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:45.610
So if you look at the
average, and we'll

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:49.540
look at some of these costs,
unit cost by say, by trip,

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:50.950
by passenger trip.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:54.970
Because so many people ride
rail, it's cheaper per ride

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:58.780
to provide rail
than to provide bus.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.870
Bus, however, can
cover a wider network

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.050
because it's more flexible.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:06.940
Rail tends to better
service quality.

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:08.410
Because it doesn't have traffic.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:10.300
And it has a dedicated
right of way.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.510
So, yeah.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.790
And it has a stronger
land-use influence.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.790
Because the stations are in map.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:21.620
And you sort of know
the rail map of the city

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:25.710
much faster than you learn
about its bus network.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.420
So there's a bias that people
have towards taking rail

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.030
over taking bus, even if
rationally taking a bus

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.960
would be faster.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:37.960
You may not even be aware
of all of your bus options.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.160
And fewer negative
externalities.

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.120
That's because electricity
that powers these is often

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.650
generated outside of
the city and brought in.

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:50.410
So the air pollution cost by
the consumption of electricity

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.270
for rail is not--

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:56.930
is not an externality that is
internalized in the city often,

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.780
if that makes sense.

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.160
So, right.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:03.170
So bus is much more flexible.

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:06.680
And you can operate it
on any road [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.100
or on a guided right-of-way
or a designated right-of-way.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.570
And it's more
prone to being used

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:15.830
in [INAUDIBLE]
mode nature, right?

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:18.540
So just the flexibility.

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.790
Let's look at the--

00:57:20.790 --> 00:57:25.400
going back to the APTA
Fact Book of 2011.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.927
And these are numbers for 2011.

00:57:26.927 --> 00:57:29.010
Because they always do
these reports for two years

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:32.130
before the report comes out.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:36.100
So how much was spent in
bus service in the US?

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:41.910
So 18, this is in millions,
so 18,000 million,

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:46.890
actually billion heavy rails
less and light rail even less.

00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.200
And then commuter rail
is more expensive.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.670
Paratransit is a form
of transit that is

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.280
provided to handicapped people.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.650
And it's-- you reserve it.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:01.020
You say, I need to be picked
up here and taken there.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.350
And you get a window,
maybe a three-hour window,

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.880
so it'll schedule
a pickup and take

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.880
you to provide service for you.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.060
So, because it's so dedicated,
it's expensive to run.

00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:17.970
OK, in terms of-- that's in
terms of operating expenses.

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:21.470
How many trips are served?

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:23.620
So bus also provides
more than heavy rail,

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.410
because there are more bus
systems all over the US.

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:29.410
Heavy rail, but you can see
if you compare the operating

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:33.130
expenses with annual
unlinked passenger trips

00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:36.680
that it's more efficient
per passenger, right?

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.620
And then light rail and
commuter rail and paratransit

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:42.920
are much smaller
contributors to this.

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:46.490
Let's go down to these
pale yellow ones.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:48.770
Here we are dividing
operating expense

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:51.560
by revenue vehicle
hour or revenue vehicle

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.670
mile on length of trip.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.820
So we got some
unit costs, right?

00:58:55.820 --> 00:59:04.820
So you see the unit costs
for bus, $3.40 per bus ride.

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.680
For heavy rail $1.80.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.420
For light rail $3.

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.740
For commuter rail $10.

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.630
And for paratransit $26.

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:15.690
So this is how much it costs
to run that service when

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.140
you divide it by the
number of people taking it.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.380
Questions?

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.880
AUDIENCE: So like
in London, the bus

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.450
is like half the
price of the Tube?

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:26.430
For example, at least,
most of the time so

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.939
would that imply that
either the buses in London

00:59:28.939 --> 00:59:30.480
are probably a lot
cheaper than these

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:32.250
or that they're
subsidizing the bus

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:35.210
trips because the less
affluent people tend to take

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.045
the bus versus the Tube?

00:59:38.045 --> 00:59:39.795
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
More the latter.

00:59:39.795 --> 00:59:40.190
AUDIENCE: That take the bus?

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.180
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:41.660
So, yeah.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.100
AUDIENCE: So buses
tend to be more.

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:43.850
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I mean, it's

00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:45.320
cheaper to run one bus.

00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:48.050
But if you look at how
many people can ride a bus

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:51.080
and how many people
can ride a train, yeah.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:57.450
The Tube unit cost basis is--

00:59:57.450 --> 00:59:59.050
yeah, it's more efficient.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:02.760
The other thing is that you
put Metro service in places

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.120
where there is high demand.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.720
So it's somewhat
cyclical, right?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.070
Bus service, you might have a
mandate to cover a big area.

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:14.610
So some of the bus corridors
might be operating on profit.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.350
And some of them
might be, you're

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.440
doing it because you have a
mandate to provide service.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:25.230
And it's running-- it's
underutilized and the price

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:30.390
that your cost per rider
might be much higher.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:32.380
AUDIENCE: These are
all operating costs

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.202
to just to keep it running--

01:00:34.202 --> 01:00:35.660
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yes, yes.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:36.310 --> 01:00:38.101
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
No capital costs.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.740
And we're not talking
about fares here.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:42.067
So this is how much it
costs to pay the driver,

01:00:42.067 --> 01:00:43.150
the fuel, the maintenance.

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.470
Yeah.

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:46.040
OK.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.590
Let's look at mean
passenger load.

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:49.880
I think this is interesting.

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.360
So 10.7 for bus.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.000
So if you look at if you take
a bus in the US at random,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.340
the average number of people
in it will be 11 people.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.530
Does that make sense?

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.250
Is that your experience?

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:07.390
Seems a little low.

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:09.690
So one way of
thinking about it--

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:11.610
maybe I can clear the
board a little bit here.

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:16.050
I'm sorry it's very--

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:16.809
yeah.

01:01:16.809 --> 01:01:17.642
they're all used up.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.040
One way of thinking about it
is let's think of the AM peak.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.320
So, and let's just
keep it very simple.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.100
So you have service
going this way

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.850
from one terminal to the other.

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:48.340
Let's say and A and B and
service going back, right?

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.360
And because this is
the AM peak and this

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:55.360
is the central
business district,

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.060
let's say that
everybody's going in.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.390
Nobody's coming out.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:00.100
So you have a lot
of people boarding

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.140
the bus closer to the city.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:09.720
Well, yeah, let's do it the
other way more realistically.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.070
People are boarding the bus.

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:17.870
And as they get to
the CBD, they alight.

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.230
They get off at the
city center, right?

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:29.090
So let's say that a bus--

01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.697
this bus fits 45 people.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.810
So that's the
people right there.

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:38.540
So what's the average
in that direction?

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.800
It's half of 45, right?

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.490
And then if you divide
45 by half and then

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:47.560
by half, because there's
only one direction

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.000
providing service,
you have 45 by four.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.620
Right, 45 by four is 11.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.460
So there you go.

01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:01.390
Just making sense of it,
right, a quick check.

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:02.705
AUDIENCE: There is another
piece that a lot of us

01:03:02.705 --> 01:03:05.080
have taken buses in Boston,
others in San Francisco where

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.590
there are a lot of people
who take the bus [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:08.330
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:08.720
Yeah.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:09.730
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.070
And there is some of that in
some of these other modes.

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:15.140
So heavy rail.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.030
For [INAUDIBLE] reasons, 25.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.037
This is per car
not per train so--

01:03:19.037 --> 01:03:20.120
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.240
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.810
Light rail also by
car, although may

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:28.990
light rail systems or
single car or two car, so--

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:36.980
I think commuter rail is higher,
35.3 [INAUDIBLE] two things.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.530
One is that your mostly
operating on the peak power.

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:42.690
So you're not providing
much service off peak.

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:46.210
Therefore, there's this
higher demand there.

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:51.130
The other thing is that
it [INAUDIBLE] right?

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.780
So these cars are bigger.

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.690
They have two decks sometimes,
and they fit more people.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:01.651
So that's why you have
higher mean passenger load.

01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:02.150
OK.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:04.895
So just looking at some
sort of averages nationwide

01:04:04.895 --> 01:04:07.410
and make some sense of them.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:13.860
Riderships by mode
and [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.390
start with heavy [INAUDIBLE]
systems from two classes ago

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:22.660
we saw that the oldest systems
are the first ones to be built.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.790
And they're in cities that
depends a lot on transit

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:26.470
and use a lot of transit.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:30.940
So these five older systems,
this was the ridership in 2009.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.390
If you look at seven newer
systems built after that,

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:36.940
that's the combined
rider, much lower, right?

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.350
So you see the older systems
are carrying a lot more people.

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:45.550
And if you look at the
change from '74 to 2009,

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:50.620
[INAUDIBLE] the old [INAUDIBLE]
grew 63% and [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.820
With light rail, you have--

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:58.435
you start with seven old
systems, 188 million.

01:04:58.435 --> 01:05:00.760
It grew by 26%.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.530
A lot of newer
systems, do you see

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:06.602
that, there are much more newer
light rail systems so there

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:10.640
are newer heavy rail systems.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:13.730
Commuter rail, four
old, 12 new, same idea.

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:19.580
The older systems grew
by 36%, 12 new systems

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:23.820
carried much less than the
four old systems though.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.190
And here's four bus.

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:28.820
We had 5--

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.285
5.4 billion.

01:05:30.285 --> 01:05:32.030
It grew 10%.

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.700
So that's just
giving you an idea

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.490
of how heavily the [INAUDIBLE]
systems are being used.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:41.480
If you look at what has
happened from 1999 to 2009,

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.680
so one decade, the number
of active vehicles 10%.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.450
So the investments, the
supply in heavy rail

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:53.570
grew by 10%, though
the demand [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:56.570
case supply measured in
another way, revenue vehicle

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.720
miles operated, 20%, or 19%.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.320
For light rail, we see that
many more vehicles are being

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:06.860
[INAUDIBLE] and much
more revenue models

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:07.700
are being operated.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:13.020
So again, more investments in
light rail than in heavy rail.

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:15.630
And, yeah, commuter rail
is somewhere in between.

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:18.220
For bus it's much less.

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.890
It looks like there
is a higher level

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:25.190
of [INAUDIBLE] in light rail
systems than in other modes.

01:06:27.866 --> 01:06:31.130
OK, and service trends by mode.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:37.800
So we have here boardings
per revenue vehicle mile.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:42.260
So this is a way of
measuring how much supply.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:47.510
In 2009 this how much 5.2 for
heavy rail and light rail.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:50.360
Heavy rail grew by 16%.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.870
Light rail decreased by 15%.

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:56.510
Again, more investment
in light rail but more

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:59.690
of the growth happening
in heavy rail.

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:01.530
Commuter rail same thing.

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:04.520
Some of this could be
people, more people

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.720
moving towards cities and
not requiring commuter rail

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:12.050
or suburbanization, people
living in the suburbs

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.760
and working in the
suburbs for not

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.760
having to take commuter rail.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.170
For loads, we see, again,
loads increasing in heavy rail,

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.670
decreasing somewhat or staying
flat in other [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.024
So these are general trends.

01:07:28.024 --> 01:07:30.290
OK.

01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:33.380
[INAUDIBLE] do you have any
questions on these modes

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:38.910
and their characteristics
and the role they play in--

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:39.540
yes?

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.540
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.700
First of all, what exactly
[INAUDIBLE] and second of all

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.470
can you talk about why light
rail is [INAUDIBLE] being

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:49.372
so much more operated on than
[INAUDIBLE] why those changed.

01:07:49.372 --> 01:07:50.580
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.729
So revenue vehicle miles.

01:07:53.729 --> 01:07:55.020
Let's start with the first one.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:56.390
What is revenue vehicle mile?

01:07:56.390 --> 01:08:01.580
It's a measure of the distance,
total distance covered

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.270
by a vehicle that
is serving trips.

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:09.950
So it excludes that
heads from garages

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:13.580
to the beginning of our
route or any other vehicle

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:16.130
movement where the vehicle
is not serving people.

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.160
It's not-- this doesn't
have its head sign on and--

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.720
if it's a bust, right?

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.910
So that answered
the first question.

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:28.189
And the second one
was, why is there--

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:30.859
why does there seem to be
investment in light rail

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:36.890
when it seems like the
ridership is decreasing

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:40.220
and the amount of
revenue vehicle miles

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.760
are going down as well?

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:50.470
So, this is more of a planning
and politics question, I think,

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:52.600
cities and urban planners.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:56.050
Because light-- because
rail has more power

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:57.939
to change the urban landscape.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:01.140
Because in people's
minds, it is more--

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:04.410
it's more physically
present and permanent.

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:09.149
There is a preference towards
rail systems over bus systems.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:14.410
Metro is appropriate
for very large cities

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.240
that a lot of them--

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.100
a lot of those cities
that require Metro

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.479
already have Metro.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:21.550
So what we're
seeing is that there

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.130
is a lot of cities
that are maybe not

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:25.510
as big to require Metro.

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:27.640
But they could use
a light rail system.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.870
They could also use BRT.

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:32.750
But they have a bias towards
light rail in planning

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:35.050
and for political reasons.

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.240
A politician might
prefer to claim,

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.300
I built this train system, not
I put some buses on the road,

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:41.800
right?

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:48.920
So these are real factors that
influence the mode choice.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.830
The other thing is that a
lot of these newer systems,

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.660
because they are
in smaller cities,

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.814
they bring the average down.

01:09:55.814 --> 01:09:58.499
So--

01:09:58.499 --> 01:10:00.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] even if I

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.330
could add on that [INAUDIBLE]
the US you had new light rail

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.800
systems in Cincinnati, in
Tucson, and Kansas City.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.497
But even if-- but their
increase in ridership,

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:11.330
so there, their
contribution to the increase

01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.700
in ridership of light
rail might not even

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.760
compensate for loss of
ridership in other cities

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.200
that have old systems like
Philadelphia or Boston.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:19.500
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.499
AUDIENCE: And so if
Philadelphia has a decrease,

01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:23.340
I'm not saying it
did, but if it did,

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.010
then it could wipe
out the increase

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:26.270
that Cincinnati contributed.

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:27.520
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yep.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:28.280
It goes both ways.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.071
These are averages.

01:10:29.071 --> 01:10:31.910
So-- any other questions?

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:32.790
Yes?

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:41.727
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] by local
agency or like [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:41.727 --> 01:10:43.310
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It could be.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.819
So the question is [INAUDIBLE]
commuter rail referred to

01:10:46.819 --> 01:10:47.860
in terms of the operator?

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.750
Who operates
commuter rail and is

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.990
that one of the characteristics
that-- but yeah.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:54.280
I didn't include that here.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.350
Because there are many
different arrangements

01:10:56.350 --> 01:10:58.810
for what commuter
rail is and if it's

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:02.450
publicly operated or privately
operated through a contract

01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:05.525
through the public sector.

01:11:05.525 --> 01:11:07.360
Yeah, there's all
sorts of arrangements.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.610
Sometimes there's
a separate agency

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:12.190
that operates commuter rail.

01:11:12.190 --> 01:11:15.490
And it's not the same agency
that operates the inner city

01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:16.840
bus and Metro.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.340
So--

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:22.572
AUDIENCE: You used
the word [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:24.780
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So commuter rail is usually

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.750
characterized by more service.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.550
The purpose of commuter rail is
to bring workers into the city.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:31.050
Right?

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:37.110
So you have a service that is
radial going into the city.

01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:38.910
The frequency of
service is higher

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:42.290
in the AM peak and the
PM peak, lower off peak.

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:44.910
Whereas intercity is
more of a scheduled--

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.520
intercity rail is more like
airplanes and the airline

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.490
industry where you have a
schedule and trains leave

01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:52.380
every hour or every two hours.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.790
And you book in advance.

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:55.770
And right?

01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:00.023
So slightly different
characteristics.

01:12:00.023 --> 01:12:00.522
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:00.522 --> 01:12:02.800
AUDIENCE: I had a
couple of questions.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.491
Well, I guess the
first one is if you

01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:07.740
go to pretty much any airport
and they have an airport

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.161
transit system, they have
automated-- it's automated

01:12:10.161 --> 01:12:12.310
as platform screen
doors and all the like,

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:15.390
and we've been building those
in the US since the '70s,

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:18.060
why are there-- why is
that never put forth

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.600
except for a couple of
occasions in, I guess, Vancouver

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.170
and a couple of
very small systems?

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.530
That's the second part of it.

01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:26.514
So is there any good
reason for that?

01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:27.930
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
My guess

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:30.240
is that you have more
space in airports.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.260
And it's less political.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.700
You have the stakeholders
of the airport,

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.740
the airport has
funding streams to--

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.110
for capital projects.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.980
You have the space.

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:47.430
The airline has to use eminent
domain to build any system,

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:48.930
if that's what
you're talking about.

01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.260
If you're talking about
building a new system.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.060
In terms of retrofitting
an old system,

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.890
well, that's harder
than building a new one

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:56.973
from the beginning, right?

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.215
So the investment required to--

01:13:00.215 --> 01:13:02.922
the station shutdowns
and all the headaches

01:13:02.922 --> 01:13:05.380
that you have to deal with if
you're retrofitting a system,

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.470
putting in a new signal linked
system, all these things,

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:11.160
you might require
a new fleet that is

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:13.080
capable of operating this way.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.040
So it's a heavy lift--

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.150
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--to do the retrofitting.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.500
But it's being done.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.770
If you look at London,
London's been doing it.

01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:23.910
They're-- yeah,
the Jubilee Line,

01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:27.450
which is the color silver
in the map of London,

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.966
is operating with--

01:13:28.966 --> 01:13:29.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.720
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--with-- but from screen doors

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.590
in the center at least.

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.770
And--

01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.460
AUDIENCE: Also the full
DLR system in London.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:33.680
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.120
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.841
And that's-- it's funny, because
that's Docklands Light Railway,

01:13:37.841 --> 01:13:38.340
right?

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:39.180
L is for light.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.660
But it's Metro according
to what we covered today.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.470
It's heavy rail.

01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:46.640
AUDIENCE: And then the
second question was,

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.940
if you look at something
like cross-linked or RER

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.795
or something that's [INAUDIBLE]
which is your sort of hybrid

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:54.690
commuter rail but then
operate on transit very high

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:55.190
frequency--

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:56.481
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:13:56.481 --> 01:13:58.030
AUDIENCE: Perfect questions.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.321
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:13:59.321 --> 01:14:01.120
So again, we talked
about stereotypes

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.790
and the lines are blurry.

01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:06.020
And I think it's useful to--

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.810
the point of this is not to
really categorize everything

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.820
and be able to claim
this is a heavy rail.

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.740
This is a light rail.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.060
It's more as just a
framework to think about

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.670
if you're a planner,
or a consultant,

01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:21.170
and you're in charge of
deciding or helping your city

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:24.959
decide what mode to
use for some project,

01:14:24.959 --> 01:14:26.750
here are the things
you should think about.

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:29.030
Here are the key decisions
that you have to make,

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:32.170
station spacing, capacity,
what are you dealing with?

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:36.500
So in that sense, this context
is-- this framework is useful.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.640
But I wouldn't go--

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.240
I wouldn't use it to
necessarily classify everything

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.140
into one with one label.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.100
Yeah?

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.891
AUDIENCE: So these
trends that you've shown

01:14:47.891 --> 01:14:49.932
are pretty much all
[INAUDIBLE] the US systems?

01:14:49.932 --> 01:14:52.140
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Well, we have many pictures

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.265
from internationally, yeah.

01:14:53.265 --> 01:14:54.764
AUDIENCE: You touched
on [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:54.764 --> 01:14:57.059
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
There's Canada, Mumbai.

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:57.558
Right, so--

01:14:57.558 --> 01:14:58.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:59.700
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:14:59.850
Yeah.

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:02.100
AUDIENCE: Yes, but the
trends, though [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.430
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Oh, yes, yes.

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:04.190
AUDIENCE: Ridership.

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:04.990
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's right, yes.

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:06.430
AUDIENCE: That sort of stuff--

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.910
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:09.260
AUDIENCE: --is not quite
the same outside of the US?

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.718
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, I'm

01:15:10.718 --> 01:15:13.740
not as knowledgeable on the
trends in Europe and Africa

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:18.600
and Asia, South
America, though I'm

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.750
sure that other countries
and the European Union

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:26.650
have something similar
in terms of reporting.

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:30.270
So, yeah, I happen to know
the Fact Book and the NTD

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:31.052
statistics.

01:15:31.052 --> 01:15:32.010
I'm familiar with them.

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:36.229
So I can go and refresh them
and look at the unit costs. ;

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.770
I'm sure you could
do the same thing.

01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.190
I just haven't done it.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:43.043
It would be interesting to see
how those trends have compared

01:15:43.043 --> 01:15:43.989
[INAUDIBLE].

01:15:49.627 --> 01:15:52.210
All right, if there are no more
questions, class is dismissed.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:58.520
Please, meet with your teams and
pick a day for data collection.
