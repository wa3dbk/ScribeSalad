00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.896
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So today, we'll

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.020
talk about cost estimation.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.930
It's the first of the
modeling lectures.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.460
We'll talk very briefly
about the role--

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.180
the different roles
that cost models

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.090
have in transit agencies.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.800
And then we'll discuss
three types of--

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.990
three categories of cost models.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.350
So all right, let's get into it.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.840
So what are the roles?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.760
How could cost models be used?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
And to start, a cost model is
a model, a mathematical model

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
that takes some
variables and predicts

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.865
some costs for the agency.

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:01.190
It could be operational cost.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.700
It could be fixed cost.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.379
So how could these be used?

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.590
The first row is predicting
the cost change associated

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.970
with a service change.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
So this is a very
traditional typical example.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.400
So you might extend
the route as we

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.110
are thinking about in this
assignment, Route 1770A,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.100
extending it.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.180
And you might wonder, how much
will that cost to operate?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.670
So you could use a cost
model in that situation.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.890
Or maybe there's a wider
increase in service.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.640
Maybe service is being
expanded from ending

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.980
at 2 AM to running 24 hours.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.930
How much would that cost?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.840
So these are the kinds of
questions, service changes

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.450
that you might want to
have an idea of how much

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.150
will it cost me.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.530
So they are often concerned with
marginal or incremental costs,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.450
especially in this application.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.220
So if you expand service to
cover all night, for example,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.000
you may not need that--
that change may not

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.060
trigger the need for
a new bus maintenance

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.660
facility, or some large
capital expenditure.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
So we're talking here about
per-- incremental cost.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.760
As I add buses, or
as I add bus hours,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.490
or as I add driver hours,
how much extra do I pay?

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.270
You have different results
over different time periods.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.590
This is important.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.060
It doesn't cost the same to run
service off-peak or at night

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.725
as it does on-peak.

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:31.640
I will talk more about
that later in this lecture.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.030
But having that in mind,
and having a cost model that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240
is sensitive to
time periods might

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.880
be very important to
get accurate estimates.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.080
OK, so these models
can also be used

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.720
for routine performance
monitoring and service policy

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.350
triggers.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.350
You might remember from
the short-term planning

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.850
lectures that there are some
processes where every bus

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.960
route might be reviewed.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.530
And you might decide that
you need to add service

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.000
based on its performance.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.570
Or you might decide
that a bus route

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.710
isn't meeting the requirements
to be financially sustainable.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.130
So if you are considering
removing, dropping

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.670
service [INAUDIBLE],, how much
will you save by doing that?

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.770
All of those are
applications of bus mode.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.590
OK, the second point
here is that you

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.480
can predict the cost
change associated

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.090
with the change in a
production process.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.260
Now, we're not talking
so much about service,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
but we're thinking
of, what happens

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.210
if I'm in a labor agreement
that does not allow part timers,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.200
and now has negotiated the
ability to hire part timers?

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.900
What will that do to cost,
sort of cost structure?

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.290
What about if I want to
contract out maintenance work?

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.180
I'm doing that
right now in-house.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.980
And now maybe for a
portion or for all of it,

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.800
we are looking at
public-private partnerships

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.320
to contract out
maintenance work.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.630
Or contracting out suburban
bus routes-- for instance,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.400
I have low ridership.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.170
And they're kind of
on the outskirts.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.180
You don't want to drop
service, but maybe you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.610
don't need big 40-foot
buses and you can run them

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.590
with smaller buses.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.270
Could you contract those out?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.070
What will that do to cost?

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.565
New fare technology, the MBTA--

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.690
I don't know who was
here a long time ago.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.875
We had tokens here.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.570
And we moved to the CharlieCard.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.930
And now the MBTA is thinking
about the next generation

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.340
of fare collection for Boston.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680
AUDIENCE: When was the
CharlieCard invented?

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.535
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I don't remember the year.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:29.700
AUDIENCE: 2005.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.600
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
But it was--

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.766
yeah, it was the mid-2000s--

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:33.000
AUDIENCE: 2005.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.630
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--because I remember in 2004

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.864
there being tokens still.

00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:39.780
AUDIENCE: I think the
last station with tokens

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.844
was Government Center in 2006.

00:04:42.844 --> 00:04:44.760
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So anytime something

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.790
like this happens,
there is a change

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.890
in costs, administration costs.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.300
And the recovery of the fare
recovery ratio might change.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.435
So can we model that?

00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:59.130
And can we use cost models
to predict those changes

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.110
in cost or in revenue?

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.420
OK, then another sort of third
and very important application,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.530
not so much in Boston
right now, but certainly

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.800
in other jurisdictions,
is the allocation

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.540
of subsidy required
by jurisdiction.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.152
So if you look at, for example,
the WMATA in Washington, DC,

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.402
there are different districts.

00:05:21.402 --> 00:05:23.590
And they all have
to pay for service.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.460
So there are many examples of
this over the states and also

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.250
internationally, where different
jurisdictions are essentially

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.840
partnering to subsidize
public transportation service.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.580
And we know what the total
cost of operation is.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.180
So how much is fair that
each restriction pay?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.804
According to size, according
to how many people--

00:05:52.804 --> 00:05:54.470
often, it's according
to how many people

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.720
ride from those jurisdictions.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.020
So you might have a data
collection to figure out

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.780
how many people are taking buses
from each of the jurisdictions.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.770
And then you need to allocate
a cost allocation model

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.920
to take all of the costs,
including the things that

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.020
are sort of more obvious, like
the bus hours that operate

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.750
in those jurisdictions, but also
things that are not directly

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.480
connected to the jurisdictions,
such as administration

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.180
costs, and facility
maintenance, and those things.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.920
So all of that needs to be
allocated to each jurisdiction

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.230
so that the cost can be
evenly or fairly split.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.620
And doing that right
is critical, often,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.770
even for the decision
to participate or not

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.800
in this program.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.670
Question?

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.370
AUDIENCE: For jurisdictions,
you mentioned Washington.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.330
Would that be like
Virginia and Washington DC?

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.870
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.760
AUDIENCE: Or in New York,
it would be New York--

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.230
Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey?

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.428
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:06:51.428 --> 00:06:53.870
AUDIENCE: Or would you
also mean, like, counties?

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.911
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
There are many examples

00:06:55.911 --> 00:07:00.470
and different structures of how
different jurisdictions come

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.070
together to provide service.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.800
So in some cases, you have
many different operators,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.630
and more commonly in
the West of the US,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.490
many different operators all
providing service somehow.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.490
In other cases, you have
one major operator funded

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.720
by different jurisdictions.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.280
All right, so you
might remember,

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.120
we've only talked about
modal capacities and costs

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.070
that, especially in the
US, in North America,

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.300
costs are divided into capital
expenditures and operations

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.350
expenditures.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.120
So capital costs have to do
with the purchase of vehicles,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:45.600
or the [INAUDIBLE] of
vehicles, heavy maintenance,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.950
the fixed facility
construction, so construction

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.010
or major repairs of
trucks, garage, stations,

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.600
bus stops, things
like that, and then

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.470
other long-term physical assets,
so administration buildings,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.310
and things like that.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.020
And then there's
operating costs.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.310
So those have to do with--

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.160
they're more
proportional to how much

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.630
service you output, so labor
wages and benefits, materials

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.570
and supplies.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.440
Materials includes fuel,
and tires, and electricity

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.480
to run the-- power the metro.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.780
Then there's agency
administration and other kinds

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.370
of expenses of this nature.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.910
So it's important to
keep those two in mind,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:36.150
because the cost
models that we specify

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.220
should take this
into consideration

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.500
and be able to allocate
the capital and operating

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.590
expenses separately.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.350
All right, so there are
three types of cost models

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.750
that we're going to discuss.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.230
The first is a fully
allocated causal factor model.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.770
It's the simplest of
ones that we'll discuss.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.450
One of the problems
with that model

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:01.100
is that it allocates all of
the costs to some categories.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.450
And it's not sensitive
to time periods.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.730
As I said earlier, some costs
vary a lot by time period.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.620
So the second model essentially
is a variation or an extension

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.940
of the first one, where we do
take some specific costs that

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.240
are very sensitive to
time and capture that,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.160
those differences, over time.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.980
And then we'll talk about
incremental fixed/variable cost

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.480
models.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.440
We're going to give examples
of all of these using MBTA bus

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.350
from the '90s as an example.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.770
Let's start with the first
one, the fully allocated

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.650
causal factor model.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.860
So here's what you do.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.870
You select some causal factors.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.430
So these are not necessarily--
maybe causal factor is one

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.280
of the best term, but
that's what this model is--

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.290
class is called.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.750
I would say, these are
explanatory variables more

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.600
than causal factors.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.930
They don't have to
cause the cost directly,

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.000
but they are used as explanatory
variables in a model of cost.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.240
So then you assign each expense
type to each of the factors.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.410
So for example, operator
wages and benefits,

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.310
where would that go?

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.260
If you were thinking of three
kinds of explanatory variables,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.234
vehicle hours being one,
vehicle miles being the second,

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:16.650
and peak vehicles
being the third,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.610
and you're going to assign
every cost you incur

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:24.050
to one of those three, then
operator wages and benefits

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.800
are more appropriately
assigned to vehicle hours,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.950
because the pay
drivers by the hour,

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.380
so this is the one that it
relates to most closely.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.780
Fuel-- so fuel may be a
combination of vehicle hours

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.560
and vehicle miles.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.250
Or if you have to assign them
to one, then vehicle miles--

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.940
you think of the fuel
mileage of vehicles.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.930
So that's the one
that most closely

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.700
relates vehicle miles to fuel.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.092
And then administration--
well, administration, you

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:00.800
might want to assign
it to peak vehicles,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.376
because peak vehicles is a proxy
for how big is this agency.

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:05.750
And the bigger that agency,
the bigger the administration

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.380
costs.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.980
So it's one way of
assigning these things.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.232
So this is an example.

00:11:13.232 --> 00:11:14.690
After you do all
those assignments,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.720
you calculate the average
costs for each of the factors.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.192
So you have, for
example, the cost

00:11:23.192 --> 00:11:25.400
assigned to vehicle hours
divided by the total number

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.480
of vehicle hours.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.460
And you have those unit costs.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.530
And then the cost
model is simply

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.350
each of those unit
costs divided--

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.000
or multiplied by the three
explanatory variables

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.290
that you included.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.260
So you multiply your
unit vehicle hour cost

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.350
by the number of vehicle
hours, your unit vehicle miles

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.020
cost by vehicle miles,
and your unit peak

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.070
vehicles cost by peak vehicles.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.040
And that is the total
cost of the agency.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.540
Questions?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.290
AUDIENCE: This assumes
that you're somehow

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.710
able to split the data
into those categories,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.440
to say the costs assigned
to vehicle hours are x.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.870
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yes, so that's one

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.080
of the characteristics and
perhaps weaknesses of this kind

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.540
of model, that it requires
the judgment of the person

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.590
to assign--

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.747
to first, to generate
these classes

00:12:08.747 --> 00:12:10.580
and these explanatory
variables, and second,

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.690
to assign them to each
cost of this class or each

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.090
account in a ledger to each of
these explanatory variables.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.680
So But these models are
used in the industry.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.151
So if you plug in the
number of vehicle hours,

00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:31.650
and vehicle miles,
and peak vehicles

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.700
that you used to
estimate this model,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.860
then you're just going
to get the total cost

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.460
of operations or of--

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.330
or total combined cost
on the same period

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.400
that this data came from.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.630
But more interestingly,
if you are considering

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:55.080
expanding service, and that will
increase vehicle hours, vehicle

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.390
miles, and peak
vehicles, then this model

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.960
will work in some
ways to forecast

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.250
what the total cost will be
after you grow your agency.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.032
So this is one application
of this simple model.

00:13:08.032 --> 00:13:10.490
AUDIENCE: Is there a time unit
that you're supposed to use,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.240
like a full year to
capture [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.031
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
This is up to you

00:13:14.031 --> 00:13:15.756
as well, another judgment call.

00:13:15.756 --> 00:13:17.640
It shouldn't be one day, but--

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.340
because you want to see
all the kinds of expenses.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.670
So I think a year makes
sense, a fiscal year,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.870
because you will have to put
out a statement for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.040
You do accounting on
that fiscal year basis.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:41.190
OK, so here's an example from
1996 of a bus on the MBTA.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:44.130
So we have those three
variables that we

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.780
talked about--
vehicle hours, vehicle

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.820
miles, and peak vehicles.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.650
We divide each of those
into variable or fixed.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.870
So some of the expenses
are considered variable,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:59.070
because they sort of scale up
more linearly as you increase

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.420
the number of vehicle hours.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.240
And others are more
fixed expenses.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.100
You wouldn't expect to
get extra fixed costs

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.020
by adding a few buses, right?

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.410
So one example of
that is, if you

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.370
get 10 more buses
for a new bus route,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.440
you don't need a new
maintenance facility.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.030
So your maintenance
facility might

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.980
be considered a fixed expense.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.840
And you might want a
variable cost model

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.200
to predict the changes
of that small change

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.740
or that marginal change.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.520
So that's why we divide things
into fixed and variable.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.120
The total cost to be
allocated is $173.6 million.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.720
And we divide it over these
six categories, so the three

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.630
variables and their fixed
and variable variance.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:54.160
Here we have the percentages
of each and the unit costs.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.370
So now, what are possible cost
models following this approach?

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.140
A first and simple one,
a very traditional model,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.490
is the first one listed here.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:13.120
So 39.82, which is the total
unit cost of revenue vehicle

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.660
hours-- it's the sum
of 37.13 and 2.69--

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.780
times the number of revenue
vehicle hours, and then 2.41,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.410
which is the sum of 2.270 and
0.14 times revenue vehicle

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.750
miles times some factor.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.440
And that factor,
essentially here, we have--

00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:35.400
we're not capturing
the difference

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.320
between fixed and
variable costs.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.707
So that's why we add them
up here, 39.82 and 2.41.

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.290
The other characteristic
of this model

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.660
is that it does not
have peak vehicles

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.430
as an explanatory variable.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.090
So we address that with
this adjustment factor.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:57.660
If you take the total
cost, which is 173.6,

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:05.550
and you divide it by the sum
of the unit costs for revenue

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.310
vehicle hours and revenue
vehicle miles, you get 1.26.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.550
And that's the
adjustment factor.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.112
So any questions--

00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:16.820
AUDIENCE: Sorry--

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.778
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--with that approach?

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:21.470
AUDIENCE: You said the 1.26
is calculated by doing what?

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.761
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Let me write it down for you.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:40.042
So you have a total of 173.6.

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:41.130
And that's a total.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.830
And you divide it by the total
of the total number of unit

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.110
costs that you are capturing
with explanatory variables,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:05.195
which is 29 plus 5.7 plus 50--

00:17:05.195 --> 00:17:06.140
AUDIENCE: Plus 3.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.598
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--plus 3.

00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:08.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.660
AUDIENCE: And last [INAUDIBLE]--

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.860
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--equals 1.261.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.079
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:17.624 --> 00:17:19.040
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So we're

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.740
dividing the total by the
amount that we did capture.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.550
And then that factors
out of the model.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.520
So this is a very simple
model of a full annual cost

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.830
for the agency.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.730
Here we're looking
at the fiscal year.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.750
And it's sensitive
to two variables.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.090
It's not sensitive
to time period.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.990
And it's mixing fixed
and variable costs.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.054
So this model may not be the
best one for some applications.

00:17:46.054 --> 00:17:47.720
AUDIENCE: But just,
what's the intuition

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.420
behind using vehicle
hours and vehicle miles?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.545
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It's something that you--

00:17:52.545 --> 00:17:54.230
that agencies always
measure and report,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.490
so it's something that there's
already a data collection

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.740
effort for it.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.830
If you think about especially
the traditional applications

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.270
without automatic
data collection,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.220
there is an effort
to measure anything

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.720
you deliver to collect how
much output you produce.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.090
And so we already have that.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:21.920
It's something that then you can
use as an explanatory variable.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.330
And it relates to service.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.650
So it's your service output.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.330
These are variables
that are also

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.960
going to be found in any
service funding proposal

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.150
in some way or another.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.574
If you extend routes, then
that increases both of these.

00:18:39.574 --> 00:18:41.490
AUDIENCE: I guess my
other question was, like,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.870
what's the intuition behind
vehicle hours being relatively

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.400
more expensive
than vehicle miles?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.983
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That depends

00:18:48.983 --> 00:18:52.672
on how you assign each of
these cost categories to it.

00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:55.005
AUDIENCE: It's not that, like,
operating a bus implies--

00:18:55.005 --> 00:18:57.213
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Well, I mean, in this case,

00:18:57.213 --> 00:18:57.780
wages are--

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.520
wages and benefits are a
principle or one of the key--

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.981
AUDIENCE: Got it, OK.

00:19:02.981 --> 00:19:04.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--one of the key costs

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.800
for the agency.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.030
And that's being reflected
entirely in vehicle hours.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.510
And potentially fuel
is a second one.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.660
And that is at least
partially covered

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.890
by running vehicle hours.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.480
It could be.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.310
I'm not sure in
this model if it is.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.830
I suspect that everything was
assigned to vehicle miles,

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.910
but it could be.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.410
So yeah, vehicle hours is
a proxy for more things.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.040
More costs are being
assigned to that variable.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:34.710
Eli?

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.210
AUDIENCE: Can you
give some examples

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.099
of variable and fixed costs?

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:40.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, we'll

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.060
actually see more of those
later in the lecture.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:54.190
Fuel is variable,
because as you drive more

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:59.860
and you consume more--
and if you all of a sudden

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.600
operate less
service, then you'll

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.910
see that drop immediately.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.950
A fixed cost could be
the administration costs

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:15.400
for, let's say, your
service planner team.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.140
So you've hired people.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.240
And if you drop
service a little bit,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.540
you're not necessarily
going to fire people.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.600
Or if you expand service,
you're not necessarily

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.250
going to hire a bunch of people.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.040
Or you may not need
new offices for them.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.222
So all of those
things are more fixed.

00:20:33.222 --> 00:20:33.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.330
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, second model, so here we

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.030
have the same first
part of the model,

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.190
but now, instead of using
the adjustment factor,

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.120
we directly take the unit cost
of peak vehicles and add it in.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.340
So now we have a model that
is sensitive to peak vehicles

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.945
as well.

00:20:53.945 --> 00:20:55.320
And we don't need
the adjustment,

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.140
because all of the things
that have been assigned

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.685
to peak vehicles are
being directly related

00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:03.810
to peak vehicles.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:05.670
So it's a simple variation.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.950
And here, we have a
variable annual cost model.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:14.560
So these first two have all of
the costs, fixed and variable.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.020
But for some
applications, you're

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.790
only interested in
variable annual cost.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.330
And I've given the
example of minor expansion

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:25.020
in service, where you add
a little bit of service

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.550
or remove a little
bit of service.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.820
And you wouldn't expect to
incur fixed costs as a result.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.960
So here, we then only
consider the unit costs

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.960
of the variable portion of
revenue vehicle hours, which

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.120
is 37.13, and 2.57 for
revenue vehicle miles.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:49.410
Any questions on
these simple models?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.600
OK, as I mentioned before,
one of the key weaknesses

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.910
of these models is that they're
not sensitive to time periods.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.150
So it's much more expensive
to operate sort of on the peak

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.035
than it is off-peak.

00:22:03.035 --> 00:22:07.040
So if you were to use, say,
variable annual cost model

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.080
for bus routes 70
and 78 and now you

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.330
want to expand it
to go to Kendall,

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:18.590
or Lechmere, or somewhere else,
and you have a greater number

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.820
of revenue vehicle hours than
your revenue vehicle miles,

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.500
if you-- maybe if
you expand service

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.230
proportionally throughout the
peak and off-peak, you're fine.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.550
But if you only expand
service in the peak or do it

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.160
disproportionately
peak/off-peak,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.830
then this model will not capture
those differences very well.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.129
And for that, we need
temporal variational,

00:22:42.129 --> 00:22:42.920
which is our next--

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.500
AUDIENCE: Just a second, but
why wouldn't you capture it?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.830
Because suppose I had service.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.260
Suppose I had a bus in the peak.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.620
So now peak vehicles,
that gets impacted.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.370
But suppose I take fuel and
I say, OK, there is fuel.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.310
Fuel affects revenue miles, but
also it affects revenue hours.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.260
And I put fuel in twice, both
in the hours and the miles.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.080
Now I can also take
into account the fact

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.660
that the bus is sitting in
traffic and burning fuel

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.670
and also--

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.620
but I'm taking
that into account.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.370
So why is this model
necessarily [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So the questions

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.870
why does this model
not adequately capture

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.230
peak versus off-peak costs?

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:25.130
So it goes back to this
calculating average costs

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.210
by factor.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.399
So these are averages.

00:23:27.399 --> 00:23:29.690
You're taking averages of
all the vehicles at all times

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.840
of day and dividing by--

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.360
explaining them with
an explanatory variable

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.690
that is not necessarily
was directly causing it.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:44.000
And so especially driver costs
are going to vary a lot by sort

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.290
of peak/off-peak.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.740
And we're taking an average.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.980
So if you increase service
proportionately, you're fine.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.850
But the unit cost is not
reflecting the difference

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.200
between peak and off-peak.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.090
So it's the unit
cost itself more than

00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.334
the independent variable
that you put in,

00:24:00.334 --> 00:24:01.500
which is what you're saying.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.270
You're saying, I can measure the
independent variable precisely,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.440
so I can plug it in here.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.875
Well, but your
factor is average.

00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:10.740
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.190
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So the approach

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.670
of this model, which is an
extension of the first one,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.780
is to do everything that we
did except for driver costs,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.990
because these costs are very
sensitive to time of day.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:30.450
And for those costs, per
crew costs, we take the day.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.820
We divide it into
30-minute periods.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.290
And then we look at all runs.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:38.780
Now, a run is what a
driver does in a day.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.720
That's their shift.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.130
That's a sequence of
trips that are being

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:44.950
operated by a single driver.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.650
And we look at all
runs and all periods.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.350
And for each period, any
run that is at least this--

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.310
has at least 15
minutes in that period

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.800
gets included in that period.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.360
And then we compute the
average paid per vehicle hour

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.420
by dividing the daily pay by
the number of vehicle hours

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.500
over all runs in that period.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.420
So each of these runs is going
to have a different cost.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.450
Some runs are going to
operate more in the peak.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.670
And they're going to have
more overtime, for example,

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.430
or more spread penalties.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.950
And we'll talk about those now.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.900
And so those runs will
be more expensive.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.590
Other runs that are straight
are going to be less expensive.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.680
And you can calculate
an average for each 30-

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.000
or 50-minute period.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.990
So now we have an
average again, but it's

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.200
by time of day for a
small bucket of time.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.940
And then for each of those, we
find the minimum, the average,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.750
and the maximum.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.760
So we're not only going
to look at averages.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.820
We're going to also look at
the distribution of costs

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.140
along each period.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.555
And this is just an
equation for average.

00:25:56.555 --> 00:26:02.660
So what we have here
is the sum over all

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.850
runs in a specific period.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.790
This is the wage, the total
paid for that run, divided

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.560
by the number of
hours for that run.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.780
So we compute the average.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.600
OK, if we look at the driver
requirements for the MBTA back

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.610
in 1983, the early 1980s,
this is what we get.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.410
So many more
drivers are required

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.490
in the AM peak and the PM peak
than are required off-peak,

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:39.110
or early in the morning, or late
in the afternoon and evening.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.209
Why is that?

00:26:41.209 --> 00:26:43.000
We've talked a little
bit about it already.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.291
AUDIENCE: There's more service.

00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:47.064
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So you provide more service.

00:26:47.064 --> 00:26:48.730
Why do you need to
provide more service?

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.510
AUDIENCE: Because
that's when the--

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.650
AUDIENCE: More demand.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.290
AUDIENCE: --commuters
are moving.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:51.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Because there's

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.050
more demand for it, right?

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.850
So if provided the
same level of service,

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.349
then your buses
would be too crowded

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:58.120
and you would not
deliver enough capacity.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.430
What else?

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.055
AUDIENCE: They're
also in traffic more.

00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:01.895
So buses are out--

00:27:01.895 --> 00:27:03.520
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So every trip

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.170
that you run takes longer,
and stuck in traffic.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.790
And the dwell times are longer.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.890
OK, so if you need
more, if you need

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.480
to provide more frequent service
and each run that you do,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.790
each trip that
you run is slower,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.120
than that means that
you have a greater cycle

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.780
time and a greater
frequency, and therefore,

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.777
a greater vehicle requirement
from your first assignment.

00:27:29.777 --> 00:27:32.110
And of course you need drivers
the drive those vehicles,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:34.690
so your driver
requirement also goes up.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.150
Great, so what's
wrong with the time?

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.200
What's inconvenient about
the timing of the peaks?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.700
AUDIENCE: They're
eight hours apart.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:43.890
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
They are eight hours apart.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.595
And how long are
shifts typically?

00:27:45.595 --> 00:27:45.890
AUDIENCE: Eight hours.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.681
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Eight hours long,

00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:50.620
so if we hire someone to
start their shift at 6:00 AM,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.270
they can't cover the PM peaks.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.790
They only cover the AM peak.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.260
OK, so what do we do?

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.140
One option is to
hire part timers.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.390
So use full-time
employees for the base.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:07.880
And then hire part
timers for the peaks.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.800
That's the least expensive
and most efficient option.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.360
But unions don't like
it, because if you

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.930
have a high percentage of
part-time drivers, then

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.160
it's not to the benefit
of their union employees.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.320
If you don't allow
part timers or you

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.050
cap the allowance
on part timers,

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:33.130
then the agency is required
to hire full-time employees

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.790
to cover the AM and the PM peak.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.720
And if you only do
that, then that's

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.220
terribly inefficient, because
you're hiring for eight hours.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.020
Then you can only
operate two or three.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.540
That's all that you
need that driver for.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.660
But there is some arrangement.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.170
You can actually
have shifts that

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:54.890
have a break in the
middle of the day.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.100
And these are called
spread shifts.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.840
So some of these shifts
operate for two or three

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.930
hours in the morning, have
a long break during the day,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.050
and operate for two or three
hours in the afternoon.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:13.250
And often, these shifts
are paid a spread penalty.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.620
So in this example, what
we have in white here

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.700
are shifts that last between
10 hours and 11 hours.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.840
So the spread is the difference
between the check-out time

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.910
and the check-in time.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:36.360
And shifts in white here have a
spread between 10 and 11 hours.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:42.720
Those drivers are paid a
50% premium for any hours

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.900
above 8 hours.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.750
And then there are
these other shifts that

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.580
are between 11 and 13 hours.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.770
So 11, 12 in dark
gray, and 12 and 13

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.790
shaded diagonally, these
shifts are paid 100%.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.790
So they're paid double for
any hours in excess of the--

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.130
I guess in excess
of 11, in this case.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.740
So that's going
to drive costs up,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.520
because if you look at the
total pay for that shift

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:21.380
over the day, then the
unit pay per hour for each

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.140
of those drivers is higher.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.917
And if you look at any
time slice of the day,

00:30:26.917 --> 00:30:29.000
peaks are going to have
many more of those drivers

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.400
than off-peak.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.710
So the average across the
drivers on any bucket of time

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.965
that is 30 minutes wide
is going to be higher.

00:30:36.965 --> 00:30:39.050
AUDIENCE: Sorry, could you
explain maybe for like,

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.650
let's say I'm a driver that
runs the shifts with 12 hours

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.122
less than spread, 13
hours, the bottom one.

00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:46.830
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
This one, yeah.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] they're
driving, the peak ones--

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.740
like, when would I work and
what hours do I get paid for?

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:52.490
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Excellent segue

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.281
for the next slide.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:01.670
So here we have essentially
the runs by a driver.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.145
And you can see the--
if you draw a line here,

00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:07.910
this is 8:00 AM, so AM peak.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.970
And then this is 5:00
PM right around here.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:18.230
So you see that, if you draw a
line between 8:00 and 5:00 PM,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.310
these are the shifts that
start during the AM peak.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:25.200
And those shifts have
the biggest spreads.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.440
So any one of these rows
is an example of one run.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.550
And if you could be
one of these drivers--

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:37.760
so if you have this day,
you check in at 6:30.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.710
You have a pretty long
break during the day.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.850
And you check out at
8:00-- at 6:00 PM.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.440
So you do an hour in the PM.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.250
And you can have
longer ones too.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.094
There will be some rules that
prevent excessively long ones.

00:31:52.094 --> 00:31:53.510
AUDIENCE: And when
you were saying

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.896
I get paid 50% more
as that bus driver, do

00:31:55.896 --> 00:31:58.430
I get paid 50% more for the--

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:59.820
only the hours that I'm working?

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.070
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.000
AUDIENCE: OK, got it.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.490
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: And
that will vary by agreement.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:08.086
So that's specific to
this labor agreement.

00:32:08.086 --> 00:32:11.650
AUDIENCE: And during
in between the shifts?

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.470
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So
you are paid the spread penalty.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:16.006
And you are paid--

00:32:16.006 --> 00:32:17.380
there are a bunch
of rules. like,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.296
No matter how many hours
you work, you're paid

00:32:19.296 --> 00:32:21.660
a minimum of eight.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.897
There's a swing pay bonus.

00:32:22.897 --> 00:32:24.730
So if you start your
day somewhere different

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.980
than you end the day, then
you have to pay the person,

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.690
I think, 30 minutes extra
for their driving time,

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.180
or whatever, for getting
to the other location

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.920
where you potentially
left your car.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.640
So there are compensations
for all of these things.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.960
And the point here in
this cost modeling lecture

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.050
is that these drivers with
spread, with large spreads,

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:49.890
cost more.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.320
So we want to build
a cost model that

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.930
recognizes those
differences, especially

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.940
with regards to driver hours.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.730
So we extend service and
require more driver hours

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.770
more in the peak
than in the off-peak.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.250
Then we need to account
for those differences.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.570
Here is a graph by time of day
of the wage cost per platform

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.780
hour, just by hour, divided
by the base pay rate.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:19.760
So off-peak, you see that the
average is variables to one.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.130
But if you go to the
peak, then you're

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.790
paying an average
of, say, 25% higher,

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.490
because some of the drivers
are straight shifts,

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.990
but there's a mix
of drivers that

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.490
are spread, large spread,
and being paid some spread

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.280
penalties.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.970
So that drives the costs up.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:46.212
OK, here's an exercise
to solidify this concept.

00:33:46.212 --> 00:33:47.670
Oh, before that we
have a question.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:53.040
AUDIENCE: Sorry, is it uncommon
that the employees, they night

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.360
[INAUDIBLE] price.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.140
I mean that someone
starts working at night

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.600
and drives some buses or trains.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.500
And they go to sleep,
and after the day,

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.120
restart their work
in the morning?

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.120
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So for safety reasons,

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.400
a lot of labor
agreements require--

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.550
and any work rules
require a minimum amount

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.760
of break between
the end of a run

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.313
and the start of the next one.

00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:26.810
And that could be 12 hours.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:30.630
So you know, where that
person sleeps is up to them.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.070
I suppose most of them go home.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.100
Normally the rules
won't allow you

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.290
to have a run that, if
you end service at 5:00,

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.360
you won't be able to
check in at 8:00 again.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.865
If you did a full day
that end at 5:00 AM,

00:34:48.865 --> 00:34:50.489
you're probably not
going to be allowed

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.955
to start the next
full day at 8:00 AM,

00:34:52.955 --> 00:34:54.580
because that's not
a long enough break.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.790
And that would be unsafe.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I said
this because in Japan,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.770
it is very common to have some
place to stay and provide them.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:10.426
And also it enable us to
run the very late night

00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:14.220
[INAUDIBLE] services.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.762
So yeah, I'm just
curious about this.

00:35:15.762 --> 00:35:17.886
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I didn't know about that.

00:35:17.886 --> 00:35:19.590
I'm interested to
learn more about it.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.660
AUDIENCE: Would people
want to do that every day?

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.680
Or would they, like, maybe
expect to do that once a week?

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.290
AUDIENCE: It depends
on the shift,

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.744
but no one continue
that kind of--

00:35:28.744 --> 00:35:29.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah you'd--

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.409
AUDIENCE: --shift.

00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:32.304
AUDIENCE: --live at work.

00:35:32.304 --> 00:35:33.220
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what?

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.863
AUDIENCE: You would just live
at work and do your whole life

00:35:36.863 --> 00:35:38.282
just not doing anything else.

00:35:38.282 --> 00:35:39.228
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:40.985 --> 00:35:42.610
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I mean, these

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.980
are maybe cultural
differences for work rules

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.220
differences across cultures.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.685
I'd love to learn more about it.

00:35:49.685 --> 00:35:51.660
If you have any reference
that you can send me,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.860
that would be great.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.074
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:54.074 --> 00:35:55.990
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Any other questions?

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.810
Ari, I think you had a question.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.351
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was going to
say that based on Chicago, which

00:35:59.351 --> 00:36:01.651
runs overnight service,
there is so few enough shifts

00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:03.400
that, basically,
everything is [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.870
as a straight shift.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.870
But I think when you bid
for an overnight shift,

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.490
you basically get
all overnight shifts.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.115
You keep on that
rhythm so you wouldn't

00:36:10.115 --> 00:36:13.020
have an overnight and a day.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.050
And there are some operators
that really like the overnight

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.560
shift, because it provides--
they can care for kids during

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.809
the day, or just
they like that--

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:23.100
like working outside the peaks.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.540
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: I
don't know what the labor rules

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.404
are there, but some, personally,
they also get a premium

00:36:27.404 --> 00:36:28.070
for taking the--

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:28.946
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:28.946 --> 00:36:30.736
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
There are usually

00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:33.600
premiums for running on holidays
or running late at night.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.100
So the least desirable runs
might have an extra premium

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.740
associated to compensate
for the inconvenience

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.010
or the undesirability thereof.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:49.980
Great, so we have
an example here

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.890
where we've done this
exercise and we've looked

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.030
at all periods of the day.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.360
We've looked at the minimum, the
average, and the maximum unit

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:02.010
costs for drivers, so
screw, for peak, off-peak,

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.140
and the combination
of peak and off-peak.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.920
And we have six
different scenarios.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.860
And we want to choose the
unit cost for each of these.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.350
So let's go one by one.

00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.860
So what happens if we
want to increase the peak

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.540
and off-peak service
proportionally?

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.148
Which unit cost from this
matrix would you use?

00:37:24.148 --> 00:37:25.460
AUDIENCE: Combined.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So we're hearing combined--

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:30.030
agreement, yeah?

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.330
And from combining, would
you take minimum, average,

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.372
or maximum?

00:37:33.372 --> 00:37:34.790
AUDIENCE: Average.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.581
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Average combined?

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.820
Yeah, OK, and why is that?

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.420
Because it's proportional
on both ends.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.231
And we don't actually need
the temporal variation model

00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:46.730
for this.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:47.839
So we can go without.

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.880
What if it's a proportional
decrease in both peak

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.940
and off-peak?

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.056
Would we use the same one?

00:37:54.056 --> 00:37:56.940
AUDIENCE: Minimum combined?

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.523
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Some
people are saying the same one.

00:37:59.523 --> 00:38:01.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.525
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You're saying minimum combined.

00:38:03.525 --> 00:38:05.545
We have one minimum combined.

00:38:05.545 --> 00:38:07.128
What's your idea for
minimum combined?

00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:10.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.000
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Retracting, OK.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.166
AUDIENCE: When you say
minimum cost or average cost,

00:38:14.166 --> 00:38:16.600
is that for the peak period
or is that for [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.850
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So if it's peak,

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.200
it will be for the peak hours.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.980
If it's off-peak, it's
for off-pea, hours.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.110
AUDIENCE: No, I mean the--

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.526
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: But
minimum maximum hours, like,

00:38:24.526 --> 00:38:27.330
within the peak hours, then
there are some drivers that are

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.319
paid more on average and
others that are paid less,

00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:33.360
because some of them are--
have spread penalties,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.450
and others don't.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:37.170
So even in the peaks,
are straight shifts.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:40.810
And those are on the low end.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.340
Question?

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.881
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess, wouldn't you

00:38:42.881 --> 00:38:45.471
want to use-- like, if were
going to add to the peak,

00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:47.220
is it a bad assumption
to assume that it's

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.960
going to be more expensive
than your most [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.810
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
We're getting to that.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.615
So the third one is, increases
in peak period services only,

00:38:52.615 --> 00:38:53.115
so--

00:38:53.115 --> 00:38:54.390
AUDIENCE: But I
guess, even combined,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:56.431
like, wouldn't you want
to use the max or the min

00:38:56.431 --> 00:38:58.644
because it's incremental?

00:38:58.644 --> 00:39:00.060
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
The idea

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:05.222
is that, if you increase
things proportionally, then

00:39:05.222 --> 00:39:07.180
you're going to have the
same mix that you have

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.770
now but a little more each.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.450
If you add service both peak and
off-peak in proportion, which

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.060
means that, if there is twice
as much peak service, then

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.000
you're going to have twice
much more peak service,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.570
then you're going to have the
same distribution of spread

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.330
penalties, and therefore,
the same average costs.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.060
But now we go to the
next question, which

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:36.687
is, increases in peak period
services only, which of these

00:39:36.687 --> 00:39:37.270
would you use?

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:41.417
AUDIENCE: The max.

00:39:41.417 --> 00:39:43.250
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
We're hearing max.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:46.130
And I assume for
peak, max for peak?

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.755
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:46.755 --> 00:39:48.504
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Any other ideas?

00:39:48.504 --> 00:39:49.734
AUDIENCE: Peak average.

00:39:49.734 --> 00:39:52.410
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Peak average, two ideas--

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:53.370
OK, let's debate.

00:39:58.864 --> 00:40:00.280
AUDIENCE: All
right, so basically,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.490
if we're increasing in
the peak period only,

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:09.830
we're going to have to do
more of these spread shifts

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:10.330
to do that.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.579
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:13.784
AUDIENCE: And those are
our most expensive shifts.

00:40:13.784 --> 00:40:15.825
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yes, are you convinced?

00:40:15.825 --> 00:40:16.825
AUDIENCE: I'm convinced.

00:40:16.825 --> 00:40:23.950
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK,
good so great, so $45 right,

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.760
the maximum of the peak--

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.760
what if it's a decrease
in peak period service?

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.740
So now we're coming
back here and we're only

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.360
taking the top of the top off
and we're not giving anything

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.035
to the off-peak [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:40.035 --> 00:40:41.306
AUDIENCE: The inverse.

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:42.281
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:43.780
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Same, 45--

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.488
AUDIENCE: Maximum

00:40:44.488 --> 00:40:46.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--going down now, OK, great--

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:52.400
OK, increases in off-peak
period services only,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.830
so now we're leaving
the peak where it is.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.140
And we're decreasing service
off-peak-- so here and maybe

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:00.919
at night.

00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:02.210
AUDIENCE: Increasing, you said?

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.320
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Decreasing--

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.315
is it decreasing or increasing?

00:41:04.315 --> 00:41:04.590
AUDIENCE: Increase.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:05.381
AUDIENCE: Increase.

00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:09.086
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Let's start with increasing.

00:41:09.086 --> 00:41:13.000
AUDIENCE: Then maybe
minimum in off-peak?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, that's

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.220
actually the high end
of what it could be.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.100
So of the cells
here, yes, that's

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.496
the one that you should pick.

00:41:21.496 --> 00:41:24.570
You should use the
minimum off-peak.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.600
But it could actually
be closer to 0.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.020
If you're depending on the
cost structure and the spread

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:32.520
penalties, you will
be able to convert

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.160
some of the drivers that
are peak to spread--

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.390
to a non-spread shift.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.570
So you'll get straight
shifts from these drivers.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.210
And that may actually
compensate so much

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.050
that it's a free conversion.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:54.476
So what about decreases in
off-peak period service?

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.020
So now we are actually
decreasing the off-peak

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.400
and leaving everything the same.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.840
So what two things happen?

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.940
Presumably, off-peak
services are straight runs.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.380
They're not spread.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.710
So if you remove those
but keep the peak level

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.430
operation the same, then for
any of those that you remove,

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:20.030
you have to--

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.685
AUDIENCE: Add in
the most expensive--

00:42:20.685 --> 00:42:23.330
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: --add
in the most expensive ones.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.785
So what is the net effect?

00:42:25.785 --> 00:42:26.660
AUDIENCE: Adding $15.

00:42:29.495 --> 00:42:31.120
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It's probably

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.629
going to be close to 0 again
because of this effect.

00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:37.920
AUDIENCE: But can you explain--

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.628
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
And again, this

00:42:39.628 --> 00:42:42.234
depends on the specific
costs for the labor agreement

00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:43.900
and the spread penalties
and everything.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.590
But it gives you an idea.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:49.141
So if you only decrease
off-peak service--

00:42:49.141 --> 00:42:51.410
AUDIENCE: You're
getting rid of those.

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.785
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--then you have to remove a few

00:42:53.785 --> 00:42:56.950
of the straight runs and
not pay them the full day,

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:58.610
but you have to then get--

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.830
you have to convert some of
the existing spread runs to--

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] straight.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.810
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--from straight to spread.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.900
AUDIENCE: Well wait, why
is it at a cost of 0 then?

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.850
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Because you--

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:17.820
even though you are reducing
the number of driver hours,

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.430
you will increase the proportion
of the most expensive ones

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:22.954
only in the peak.

00:43:22.954 --> 00:43:25.120
AUDIENCE: So you might not
wind up saving any money.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:25.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Exactly.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.939
AUDIENCE: Where would
you put it in the matrix?

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:30.230
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Well, it's not in the matrix.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.560
But if anything, you would
look at off-peak minimum.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.826
But it's going to be in
the range of 0 to 30.

00:43:34.826 --> 00:43:36.700
And again, depending on
the specific numbers,

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.670
it could even be that
you have to pay more.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:41.377
Or many things can happen.

00:43:41.377 --> 00:43:42.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:44.585
AUDIENCE: --thinking it was
going to be like the occupant

00:43:44.585 --> 00:43:45.907
minimum and the peak maximum.

00:43:45.907 --> 00:43:47.740
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, it could be.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.240
That's a good idea.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.010
But again, it depends
on the specifics.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.480
And this is a cost model
that isn't so precise.

00:43:55.774 --> 00:43:57.940
AUDIENCE: You're saying,
because you're not actually

00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.370
increasing peak service,
but you're proportionally

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.210
increasing it.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:02.140
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Not proportionally, we're

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.300
just decreasing the off-peak
and not touching the peak.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.466
AUDIENCE: OK, but then, I
mean, proportionally, more

00:44:06.466 --> 00:44:07.820
of your hours are on the peak.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.800
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yes, exactly.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.141
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Exactly, yeah.

00:44:12.141 --> 00:44:12.640
All right--

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.780
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So that was a good.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.180
There's a mistake in this slide.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:19.960
Please fix it.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.510
It says here, "see page 8."

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.870
It should be, "see page 6."

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.630
OK, so from page six, the total
fixed cost to be allocated

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.730
is $44.6 million.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.770
And that is the sum of--

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.472
we want to allocate fixed costs.

00:44:39.472 --> 00:44:40.930
So that is the sum
of all the fixed

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:42.460
costs that appear on page six.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.790
There's 5.7, 3, and 35.9.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:48.970
That adds up to 44.6.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:54.380
And now we have here number of
buses operating on the peak,

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.330
on the base, on the
evening, Saturday

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:58.250
and Sunday, the
number of hours--

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.820
so peak average,
4.5, 6 base hours,

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.050
4 evening hours for a total
of 14.5 hours per week day,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:10.010
12 hours operating Saturday,
12 hours operating Sunday.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.470
And the objective
of this model is

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:16.310
to take the fixed costs
incurred by the agency

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:22.460
and allocate them
to vehicle hours.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.180
So let's do that.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.620
We have to do this allocation.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.690
And we can start with--

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.720
one way of looking at this
is, these evening buses,

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.440
250 evening buses are
also operating in the base

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.840
and in the peak.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.720
Then there's an
additional 125 buses

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.410
that are operating only in
the base and at Saturdays,

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.360
during Saturdays.

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.760
And then there's an
additional 400 buses

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.640
that are operating only in
the peak during the weekday.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.450
So let's allocate costs to
the 250, the additional 125,

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.330
and the additional 400 according
to how long they operate

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.300
and how much it costs
based on the unit costs

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.370
that we calculated
in this example.

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:15.760
So we start with 250 buses
across all time periods.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.100
What's the share of fixed
cost to be allocated to them?

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.040
It's 32%.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.150
It's 250 buses divided
by the total number

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.580
of buses, which is 775.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.520
That's 32%.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.660
32% of the total cost
is $14.4 million.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.970
That's how much money we want
to allocate to these buses.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.610
And how many bus hours are
operated in the whole year?

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.180
Well, there's 250 buses.

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.580
And we want to add
up the hours operated

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.040
during weekdays, during
Saturdays, and during Sundays

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:46.070
for the whole week.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.410
So there are
roughly 250 weekdays

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:51.460
in a year, 58 Saturdays,
and 57 Sundays.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.010
Those add up to 365 days.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.810
And there are 14.5
hours during the weekday

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.570
and 12 on the weekends.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.795
So we add those up.

00:46:59.795 --> 00:47:01.690
We multiply by the
number of buses.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:08.560
And we get 1.25 million bus
hours for the whole year.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.360
And if we divide
the $14.4 million

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.500
by 1.25 million bus hours,
we get an average cost

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.650
per bus hour of $11.52.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.430
And that's the base, which is
the only thing that applies

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.290
in the evening and Sundays.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.540
And it is a portion
of what applies

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:33.080
in Saturday, weekday days,
and peak, so only a portion.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.420
So now let's move to
the next 125 buses

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:41.890
operating on all time periods
except Sundays and weekday

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.060
evenings.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.820
So how much money do
we have to allocate?

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:51.250
The $44.6 million total divided
by the additional 125 buses

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.110
divided by the total
number of buses.

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.930
That's $7.2 million.

00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.040
How many total bus hours are
operated by those 125 buses?

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:05.200
Well, this is 10.5
hours excluding

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.210
the evening during the weekdays
times 250 weekdays plus the 12

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:13.390
hours on Saturdays
times the 58 Saturdays.

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.630
So that's 0.42
million bus hours.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:23.260
And 7.2 divided by 0.42
is $17.14 average cost

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.220
per bus hour.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.355
Do you follow?

00:48:25.355 --> 00:48:27.350
Any questions on this?

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.350
OK, now let's do the peak.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.210
That's the most expensive part.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:33.690
So how much do we
have to allocate?

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:34.750
It's $23 million.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:35.770
How do we get that?

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:44.800
44.6 total times
400 divided by 725.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.950
And how many annual bus
hours do we need to--

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.600
do we operate during the peak?

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:54.130
It's 400 additional buses only
in the peak times 4.5 hours

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.310
of the peak times 250 weekdays.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.610
And that's 0.45 million hours.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:07.270
And 23 million by 0.45
is $51.11 average cost

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.110
per bus hour, or per peak
bus hour, in this case.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:17.560
OK, so now we have unit
costs for peak, for the base,

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.430
and then the off-peak, for
the evenings' and Sundays'

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.110
operation, which is great.

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:29.530
So the variable vehicle
cost was $37.13.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.020
We had calculated that
from the previous model

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.030
that you can find on page six.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.870
And now we can
adjust these costs

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.150
by time period, which
is what we want to do.

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:44.540
We want to have a model that
is sensitive to time periods.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:50.320
So for Sunday evening service,
we will increase the $37.13

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.750
by $11.52.

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.670
For Saturday and
weekday service,

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.690
we want to increase the cost,
the base cost of $37.13,

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.300
by $13.97.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:07.420
And for weekday peak, we want
to increase it by $32.86.

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.110
And notice that when we look
at Saturday and weekday,

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.630
we have to combine
the two unit costs,

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:18.280
because we have a
portion of Saturday

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:23.410
and weekday-based service
is from the first 375 buses.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.990
And the portion of it is from
the additional more expensive

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:27.540
125 buses.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.560
And when we do peak,
the same thing applies.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:35.590
So we start with the 250
base buses at $11.52.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:38.260
Then we have 125 at $17.14.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.510
And then we have the peak
of the peak buses, which

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.570
are 400 times the unit
cost for those buses, which

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:45.230
is much higher.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.740
And that's the total
cost, the total unit cost

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.230
for a weekday peak service.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:52.010
Questions on this?

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.235
You have a question, Eli?

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.310
This is all sort
of written here.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:04.820
And all the numbers are
copied from previous slides,

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.220
so you should be able to
follow this on your own

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.601
if you're a little lost.

00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:10.100
But if not, come
see me after class,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.130
then we can talk about it.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.440
OK, so now let's
compare the models.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:17.020
We started out with a very
traditional simple model,

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:21.370
and the first one we gave,
which was full annual cost.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.970
And it had this factor
which accounted for the fact

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.780
that we weren't including
the peak vehicle, the costs

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.730
associated with peak vehicles.

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.610
So that was the first example.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.990
We also had in that page a
variable cost model, which

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:39.780
only accounts for
variable costs,

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.340
so it excludes fixed costs.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.920
And now we can look at
the peak period model

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.150
and off-peak period model.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:57.790
So we make an adjustment
to the first model, which--

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:01.700
to this variable cost
model with the unit

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.920
cost that we just calculated.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:08.800
So if we take the $37.13
of revenue vehicle hours

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.200
that was in our initial
variable cost model

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.590
and we add the unit cost
for peak revenue hours,

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:26.360
which is $32.86
from right here--

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.200
so that's the weekday
peak service unit cost--

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:34.370
then we get $69.99.

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:38.570
Now that becomes our
unit cost in the peak.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:46.280
And we have the 2.41.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.810
Give me a second here.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:51.600
That comes from page
six directly, I believe.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:58.530
Yes, so that's the
combination of 2.27 and 0.14.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:03.960
Because we're not counting
the temporal difference

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:06.830
on peak vehicle or
revenue vehicle miles.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:10.310
We're only doing it for
revenue vehicle hours.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:11.810
It's for driver cost.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:14.730
And driver costs were associated
with hours, not miles.

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.770
So that stays the same.

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.450
So this is our full
annual peak cost model.

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.810
And if we want to increase
peak-only service,

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.550
we use this model,
not the other one.

00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.980
And it will reflect
more faithfully

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.032
what the costs will be.

00:53:31.032 --> 00:53:32.740
We can do the same
with off-peak service.

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:37.140
So we take the $37.13.

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:42.060
And we can add the combination
of the portion of it

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.170
that is $11.52 and the
portion of it that is $13.97.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.290
Let's do that.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.162
So let me have--

00:53:49.162 --> 00:53:51.510
let's do that on the board
so that we have the example.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:54:17.440
So for off-peak period
model, we start out

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:26.080
with the base cost of $37.13.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:32.380
And then we add $11.52.

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.800
And that's going to apply
only for the fraction

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:44.780
of off-peak hours that are sort
of Sunday and weekday evening.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:49.870
So if we go back to $11.52, this
is Sunday and evening service

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.050
only.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.630
So the question is, how many
Sunday and evening service

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:55.020
hours are there in a whole year?

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.900
The proportion is this
one that I'm writing here,

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:12.890
1684 divided by 3,880.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:17.580
And I'll calculate
that too in a second.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:25.640
We also want to add the
other cost, which is $13.97.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:41.060
And the proportion of that
is 2,196 divide by 3,880.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:54.630
So that's 37.13 plus
about 5 plus about 7.91.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:56:01.800
And that comes out to 50.04.

00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:09.210
OK, so where do we get
1,684 and 2,196 from?

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:10.710
It's similar to before, right?

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:12.960
We just count how
many hours there are.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.270
So let's just do it quickly
here for the record.

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:20.820
So let's just compute
the bottom one, actually.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.650
And you'll get the
idea for the others,

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.040
because it doesn't make
sense to do all of them.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:33.670
So off peak hours--

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:41.700
so we have 10 off-peak hours in
the weekday times 250 weekdays

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.550
per year plus--

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.307
so this is weekdays--

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.740
plus 12 hours on Saturdays.

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.210
And we said there are 7--

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:56.770
or 58 Saturdays per year--

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.220
plus 12 hours on Sundays, and
we said 57 Sundays per year.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:22.230
And that comes out
to 3,880 hours.

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:28.122
So that's combinations of these
to get the 1,684 and the 2,196.

00:57:28.122 --> 00:57:29.460
Yeah?

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:34.050
AUDIENCE: So for
the 1,684, that's

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:37.159
Sunday evening service, right?

00:57:37.159 --> 00:57:39.200
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Right, so yes, exactly.

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.500
So that's Sunday
and evenings, right.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.180
AUDIENCE: And then the other
is Saturday and weekend base?

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.805
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yes, exactly.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.550
So did people follow
this allocation example?

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:59.570
So what we're doing is taking--
dividing the day into periods.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:02.120
Some periods, we recognize
are more expensive than others

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.020
throughout.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.080
Now, we have fixed cost.

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.710
And we want to allocate
them across periods.

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:13.220
And we want to allocate
more cost to the peak,

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.440
because that sort of costs more.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:20.840
So we then use these
unit costs to--

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.020
and we count how many
hours we provide off-peak

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.040
and during the peak.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.620
And we do things in proportions
to that, essentially.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.307
These are not the
only cost models

00:58:32.307 --> 00:58:33.390
that you can come up with.

00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:35.840
These are not the only
ways of allocating cost.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.150
But they provide an
example of how you

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:39.770
can go about allocating costs.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:43.520
Allocating cost is a science.

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.450
It's also an art.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:48.350
And you encounter
it in agencies,

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.245
because you have these huge
budgets, and huge expenditures.

00:58:51.245 --> 00:58:55.400
And many projects require
you to allocate to a portion

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.750
or allocate costs.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.120
And if you want to have a
cost model, you have to do it,

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.240
because your cost
model should reflect

00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:07.980
these different variables,
explanatory variables.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.830
The third and last type of model
that we are going to discuss

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:16.500
is the incremental
fixed variable model.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.120
It's somewhat similar to
the ones that we saw before,

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:24.540
but now we classify costs as
being variable, semi-variable,

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.080
and fixed.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.235
So we have a little more

00:59:29.235 --> 00:59:30.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:31.200
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
--precision--

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.180
AUDIENCE: ----[INAUDIBLE]
marked by--

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.500
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: --a
little more precision in how--

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.940
in what we consider
fixed or variable.

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.830
We also have the same
explanatory variables

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:43.280
that we had before, so
vehicle hours, vehicle miles,

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:44.850
and peak vehicles.

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:47.480
So now, the combination
of these are

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:50.350
nine different
explanatory variables.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:53.760
And we do the same thing
as we have done before.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.660
We have a schedule of expenses.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.330
These are our accounts
in your ledger,

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.230
so crew wages, vehicle
servicing, fuel, tires,

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:05.460
insurance, traffic stuff,
things like publicity, and rent,

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:06.510
and building maintenance.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.676
Everything is included here.

01:00:07.676 --> 01:00:11.220
So all of your budget is going
to fall into some category.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.960
It's divided among
these categories.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:21.030
So now you decide,
for each of these,

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:23.040
which of these three
resources apply

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.340
and which cost type you
consider this to be.

01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.000
So for example, crew
wages, let's associate

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.870
that with bus hours,
as we did before.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:32.820
And that's fully variable.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.520
So that, we should
feel comfortable with.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:41.380
Things like building utilities,
that shouldn't be variable.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.400
So that's a fixed cost.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.108
And we'll associate
that with peak buses,

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:46.420
because peak buses
is the one that we

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.780
say is a good proxy for
how big the agency is.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.590
So peak buses is, again, like
agency size, if you will.

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:57.050
So then there are
things in the middle.

01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:01.930
So publicity, well,
semi-variable, because if you--

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:03.970
so the extent that
you increase service,

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.345
there is going to be some
amount of additional publicity.

01:01:06.345 --> 01:01:09.430
It's not going to be
necessarily a linear proportion

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.590
increase with as you-- you
know, we add one more bus,

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:18.760
then you have that much more
marketing or publicity expense.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.850
Some of those expenses are
having an office and staff, so

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:24.730
some salaries, so
that portion is fixed.

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:26.530
But then there is
extra space that you

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:30.020
have to cover on each additional
bus, so that part is variable.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.320
So now we have a
semi-variable cost.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.270
And you can associate that,
in this case, with peak buses,

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.460
because for each peak
bus you have, then

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:43.990
that's how many buses you
have to plaster with ads.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.730
That gives you an example.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:47.800
So you can go through
each of these.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.830
Again, this requires judgment,
and therefore, each person

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:52.450
may do it slightly differently.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:55.930
But you use a schedule.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:59.200
And you then build your--

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.300
you calculate your unit
costs, much like we

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.370
did with the earlier examples.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:04.959
And you then apply the model.

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.250
But now we have more precision.

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:12.190
So if you have some
kind of new expense,

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.220
or you decide you're going
to save some money somehow,

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.490
then you decide,
what-- how am I going

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.740
to spend less or spend more?

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.481
Would that be a variable,
semi-variable, or fixed cost?

01:02:23.481 --> 01:02:25.855
Would I associate that with
vehicle hours, vehicle miles,

01:02:25.855 --> 01:02:27.310
or peak vehicles?

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.320
And then you would
use that unit cost

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:35.800
to bring the total costs
up or down from the agency.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.080
Even more detailed
models, you could just

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:43.840
go by expense category and do
your engineering-style sort

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.170
of budget if you want
to really calculate

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.670
exactly how much
cost you'll save,

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:53.240
or exactly how much
extra cost you'll incur.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.750
But these cost models
are applied more--

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.360
a little more
bluntly in projects

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.250
where you are
evaluating, especially

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.775
at an early stage,
what it would cost.

01:03:03.775 --> 01:03:05.150
And you have
different scenarios.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:08.832
And you want to quickly
know how much it would cost.

01:03:08.832 --> 01:03:11.550
OK, so questions
on cost modeling?

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.710
No questions on cost--

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:18.680
yeah, one question?

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.330
AUDIENCE: So in this case, you
would have more reliability

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:28.040
on the proportion of
each expense assigned

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.044
to each category?

01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:30.710
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Yeah, so you--

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:33.620
essentially, you're lumping
things a little less.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.650
You have more variables.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.545
So your unit costs
are more precise.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:45.070
And I think the ability to move
to more sophisticated models

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:49.680
is increasing now that
everything is computer-based.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.680
[INAUDIBLE], you had a question?

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:54.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:54.906
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Oh, the three of you

01:03:54.906 --> 01:03:55.910
had a question.

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:56.640
No, not you?

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.140
OK.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:57.610
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.570
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
OK, Ethan.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:00.550
AUDIENCE: Back on
Slide 11, you said

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.210
it's possible that
reducing driver

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:09.790
hours in off-peak periods
might have no effect

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:12.310
or could even potentially
actually increase costs.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:14.650
AUDIENCE: It could-- well,
yeah, it shouldn't increase.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.940
It shouldn't increase costs.

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:18.190
AUDIENCE: Well, I was
going to ask, is there--

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:20.875
is it ever the case that
off-peak service, when

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:24.010
there is really low
demand, exists simply

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:26.440
for the convenience of
scheduling shifts rather

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:30.867
than meeting maximum headways,
or anything like that?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.450
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Potentially,

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:36.020
but because driver costs are
not the only cost of operating

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:40.670
service, you would then also
agree to spend extra fuel

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:42.390
and extra maintenance costs.

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:47.600
And that is also a
significant portion of a cost.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.920
It's not just free.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.920
Or it's only-- only
this part may be free,

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.735
not the whole thing.

01:04:53.735 --> 01:04:57.860
But yeah, I think, if you
find yourself in a situation

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:04.790
where your labor agreement
requires you to have--

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:07.430
maybe there is a cap on how
much spread you can have.

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:08.930
So you have all
these straight runs.

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:11.390
And they're only
working for four hours.

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:15.500
And then you say, well, you
know, let's add service.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.530
And let's make the
off-peak service very good.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:21.170
So yeah, that could happen,
but it's a management decision.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:22.780
That's not something
with the science.

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.060
It's a policy
managerial decision.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.980
Yeah?

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.076
AUDIENCE: On the last slide
when you were talking about peak

01:05:32.076 --> 01:05:34.940
buses, if we're
decreasing [INAUDIBLE],,

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.450
is it indicative of agency size?

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:37.700
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.640
So in this example,
we only have three--

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.420
well, we have nine
exploratory variables,

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.500
which are the combination of
the three resource variables

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.710
and the three cost types.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:49.970
But if you go back to the
first example in this lecture,

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.250
we had three explanatory
variables-- bus hours,

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.910
bus miles, and peak buses.

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:56.910
And we have to assign everything
to one of these three.

01:05:56.910 --> 01:06:03.260
So of those three,
peak buses is something

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.820
that most closely relates to how
large your agency is, much more

01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.350
so than bus hours or bus miles.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:13.100
And if you had other
variables, then

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.980
maybe those would be even
closer to agency size.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.960
But in this example, we
only have these three--

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.460
yeah.

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.170
And why peak buses?

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:25.760
Well, because if
you have more buses,

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.510
you need a bigger
parking garage for them.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:30.920
You need a bigger refueling
and maintenance facility.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.050
You might need more
mechanics and more-- right?

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:36.200
So the many costs
that are mostly

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.970
fixed scale up with
how many vehicles

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:43.390
you have on your garage,
and how many garages you

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.790
have, and all those things.

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.360
Another detail which
I want to emphasize

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.310
is that, with regards
to the variable

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:56.380
and fixed, so again, if you
have to incur an expense that

01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.350
is more marginal, then you might
want to use a variable cost

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:06.170
model, because you may not need
another garage, for example,

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.390
for a few extra buses.

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.670
But at some point,
you do incur on--

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:13.790
you reach an investment
threshold, where, well,

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:15.860
now you've crossed the line.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.250
And you do need
an extra facility.

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:22.149
And you have to hire
people to run the facility.

01:07:22.149 --> 01:07:23.690
And that's going to
be-- that's going

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:25.230
to increase your fixed cost.

01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:30.320
So that happens in lumpy
fashion rather than variable

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.106
and scaling up [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:33.106 --> 01:07:34.480
We have an additional
10 minutes.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.750
And maybe it would
be a good opportunity

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:40.350
to discuss the first
assignment, which

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.910
I have not finished grading.

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.080
I'm sorry about that.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.170
I hope to have that
back to you soon.

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:52.470
But we might as well go over it
and just discuss the solution.

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:53.940
So let me switch to that.

01:07:56.450 --> 01:08:01.080
OK, so does everybody
remember the first assignment?

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.780
Or is that sort of back
in your [INAUDIBLE]----

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:10.090
you had some sample
data in a spreadsheet.

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:12.260
And you had to calculate--
the first question was,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.820
calculate statistics
by direction.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:22.640
So this is the spreadsheet, and
time of day, and running time.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.740
This data was given to you.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:30.000
And I like to use the
indirect function.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.060
I don't know if people will know
it or not, but it's convenient.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.979
So if you type the
range name in a cell,

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.660
then you can compute things as
a function of that range name.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:42.510
And that's very convenient.

01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:48.580
So I selected the
range B2 to B751.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.260
And that corresponds
to all the data

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:56.350
on this, all the data
on this first sheet.

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:59.450
And then I did the same
for direction, too.

01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:01.279
So therefore, when
I go to mean, I say,

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:03.590
equals average indirect of B4.

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:08.101
And I'm pointing the
mean to the range,

01:09:08.101 --> 01:09:09.350
which is a variable in itself.

01:09:09.350 --> 01:09:10.399
That's very neat.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.359
So you can do that for
average mean, again,

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:17.240
min, max, and percentile,
and then fill to the right,

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.850
because you have a
different range here.

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:24.122
So it'll reflect that.

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:26.394
So it's a little trick.

01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:27.560
So these are the statistics.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.390
This was very straightforward.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.459
Then Question 4, it starts
getting more at transportation

01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:35.540
itself.

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.960
This requires some judgment.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.350
So we're saying, what's
the running time?

01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:39.425
What's the recovery time?

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:40.550
What's the half cycle time?

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.200
And what's the cycle time?

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.399
So running time
should be something

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:48.470
that happens typically,
because this is what

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:49.850
you publish on your schedule.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.975
This is what's going to go
on your journey planner.

01:09:51.975 --> 01:09:55.460
So people need to
know what to expect.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.860
And therefore, running
time should be based

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.300
on the average or the median.

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:06.030
Of these statistics,
that you computed before,

01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:08.390
these should be the
two that you use.

01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:11.150
I usually prefer the
median, because the average

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:15.710
is affected by outliers and
by heavy tails on the right

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.180
quite a bit.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.050
So I usually go for the
median, or the 50th percentile.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.812
Recovery time-- so what
is recovery time for?

01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:28.460
AUDIENCE: For making up--

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.410
well, first of all, so the
drivers can go to the bathroom

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.600
and things like
that [INAUDIBLE]----

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.790
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Sure, yeah.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.880
AUDIENCE: --and then
second of all, to make up

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.670
for problems in the schedule.

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:39.700
So say I'm driving
out on this bus route.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.242
And it takes me eight minutes
longer than I thought it would.

01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:44.408
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I wouldn't characterize it

01:10:44.408 --> 01:10:46.350
as a problem with the
schedule per se, but--

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:48.890
so the schedule is a
deterministic decision

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.320
about how long it will take you.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.015
And the reality is
that the running time

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.530
is a stochastic variable.

01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.420
It varies from run to run.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.720
So you want to say--

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.550
you want to make
a claim about what

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.650
the typical running time is.

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:06.230
But then you have to have
some recovery time to account

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.010
for anything later than that.

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:10.400
And you recognize-- it's
a way of recognizing

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.800
that these running
times are stochastic.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.810
So the half cycle
time is how much

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:19.700
time you budget for
the run, including

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:20.990
those late ones, right?

01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.190
So I set that to a high
percentile, the 95th,

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:25.310
in this case.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:26.960
The reading was
suggesting that you

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.380
could use 15% times the
average, or things like that.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:33.230
When you have data, then
you should use the data.

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:37.760
So the technique of
taking an average

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.290
and multiplying
it by a percentage

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:42.659
is what the industry
typically does

01:11:42.659 --> 01:11:44.450
when you don't have
automatically collected

01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:47.180
data, when you
essentially send someone

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.200
out to drive behind the bus
or to do-- or a ride checker

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.060
to collect data on the bus.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.485
And you do five, or
six, maybe 10 trips.

01:11:57.485 --> 01:11:58.790
And then you get an average.

01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:01.675
And that's not enough to
estimate your high percentiles,

01:12:01.675 --> 01:12:03.800
because you probably didn't
see the high percentile

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.300
in those only 10 trips.

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.737
So therefore, you have to
rely on a different method.

01:12:09.737 --> 01:12:11.570
And then you could
multiply by a percentage.

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:14.840
But if you have data, then
you should use the data.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.580
And 10%, 15%, 20%,
whatever you use

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.571
might not be adequate
for a specific bus route.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.320
So because you have
data, you can actually

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.720
measure how variable it is.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.860
And therefore, high
percentile is a better choice.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.940
95% is 1 in 20, right?

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.870
So if you think of there
being 20 weekdays in a month,

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:42.020
then you're saying,
well, about--

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:46.300
for the 8:00 trip, I expect
it to be late about once

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.284
in a month.

01:12:47.284 --> 01:12:48.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it start out late.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:49.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
To start out late,

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.820
because it was-- yeah, for
there to be a knock on effect

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.710
on my next trip, essentially.

01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:56.990
And for every other
time of the month,

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:58.440
I expect it to run smoothly.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.250
So that's why 95 is a
typical choice here.

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.940
Lower numbers of percentiles
are common, especially

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.330
at high frequency service--

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.610
90, 85.

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:09.052
Question in the back, yeah?

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:11.010
AUDIENCE: So how do you
use the 95th percentile

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:13.270
for the recovery?

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:15.210
You said for the traffic--

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:17.251
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Exactly, the half cycle

01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:18.170
is the 95.

01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:20.120
And the recovery time
is the difference

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.990
between the half
cycle and the typical.

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.776
So on your journey
planner, you only

01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:26.650
put the running time,
but then between trips,

01:13:26.650 --> 01:13:29.350
you add the recovery time.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.680
And then the cycle time is the
sum of both half cycle times.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.420
So that's pretty
straightforward.

01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.940
Question 5 was,
how many vehicles

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.160
do you need to operate this?

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.200
And there is an
equation, which is maybe

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.740
the most important equation
in the whole course--

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.070
number of vehicles equals
cycle time divided by headway.

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:51.500
And you need to round up.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.000
So cycle time is 84 minutes.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.250
The headway we said
was 10 minutes.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:59.050
So that's 84 divided by 10.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:13:59.940
It's 8.4.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.580
Round up, that's 9 vehicles.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.380
OK, you need nine vehicles
to operate the bus route.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:09.390
Question 6 asks you
to plot the times.

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:14.250
Hopefully you labeled your
axes and did everything

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.140
like you should.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.040
And so here's time of day.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.220
And here is running
times in direction one,

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:22.080
running times in direction two.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.422
And we identify that not
all of these running times

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:30.130
come from the same
operating environment.

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:33.620
We can see that there are
some peaks and some off-peaks.

01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.966
And uh oh, we just
calculated everything wrong,

01:14:35.966 --> 01:14:37.340
because we mixed
up all the data.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.900
And we shouldn't have.

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:43.370
So the question was,
what are these periods?

01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.680
So AM peak going
from 7:00 to 9:00,

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.780
midday from 9:00 to 16:00,
and PM from 16:00 to 18:00.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:51.710
And we assume a 24-hour format.

01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.950
And now we have to
redo all the work.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:57.080
We have to compute
the same statistics.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.280
I've just changed the ranges and
copied the formulas from below,

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.379
and the fill to the right.

01:15:02.379 --> 01:15:03.670
And we have all the statistics.

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.720
So that's great.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.400
We repeat the calculation.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.230
And we get the vehicle
requirement by period now.

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:16.280
We still need nine vehicles
in the AM and PM peaks,

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.070
but it turns out that
we only need seven

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:22.040
in the base, between peaks.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:24.320
So that's great.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.620
What's the cycle time?

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.950
The cycle time, once
you've calculated,

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:30.380
you can flip this equation.

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.860
I could have an entire
lecture on this equation.

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:35.720
Believe, it gets-- you
can flip it around.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.390
And there is many ways of
interpreting this equation.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:42.410
But if you solve
for c, cycle time

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.840
equals number of
vehicles times headway.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.970
Now you don't round
any direction.

01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:50.360
So once you've decided
what n is, then

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:55.474
you solve this equation for
c and revise your cycle time.

01:15:55.474 --> 01:15:57.890
Because you rounded up, your
cycle time will have gone up.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:00.056
And therefore, your recovery
time will have gone up.

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:07.210
The revised cycle time is
90 minutes, AM and PM peaks,

01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:09.196
70 minutes off-peak.

01:16:09.196 --> 01:16:10.820
And the recovery time
is the difference

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:15.540
between the typical running
time and the cycle time.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:19.430
So then I asked, what if
you had done the mistake

01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.050
of using all the data combined?

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:24.590
That means that you're
fine on AM and PM peaks,

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:28.480
but you would be excessively
provisioning resources

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:29.780
in the off-peak.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:32.270
So your cycle time
was 90, because you

01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:33.770
said it was nine vehicles.

01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:36.740
And that recovery time would
be 30 minutes and a half,

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.690
which would be excessive.

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.970
AUDIENCE: It's fine if we
used the average instead

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:41.890
of the median, right?

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:43.181
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:45.300
I prefer-- I think median
is a better choice,

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:49.930
but both are fine, especially
if you remove outliers

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.650
from the average.

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:53.480
And this data didn't
have outliers.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.040
As you can see on
the graphs, it's

01:16:55.040 --> 01:17:00.950
very suspiciously clean
data, and very precise,

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.660
places where the
period begins and ends.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.540
The data you will
get for Assignment 3

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.830
does not look like that.

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:12.460
So all right, Question
9 said, now imagine

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:14.570
that this bus runs in a loop.

01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:16.080
It only has one turn.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.490
And I provide data.

01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:21.670
We have data here for
that combined operation

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:25.030
of running inbound, then
outbound, then coming back.

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:35.380
We said we have a
headway of 7 minutes.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:38.840
And we are running with a
fleet size of 10 vehicles.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:41.210
How reliable is this service?

01:17:41.210 --> 01:17:43.600
So we can compute
from the headway

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.910
the fleet size and cycle time
using this equation right here.

01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:49.490
And we have 70 minutes.

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:54.890
And what we want to do then is,
from all these observations,

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.260
you can think of this as
some sort of probability

01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.460
distribution.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:08.520
We have some distribution
of running time.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.780
This is probability density.

01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:15.200
And this is running time.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:22.900
And we said the
cycle time is 70.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:25.680
So 70 will fall
somewhere around here it

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.489
turns out, if you look it up.

01:18:28.489 --> 01:18:29.530
That's very close to 50%.

01:18:33.610 --> 01:18:38.320
The way I computed it used
the spreadsheets solver,

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.670
you will see.

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.500
There are different
names for it.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:45.540
So I said, calculate the
percentile of whatever

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.240
percentile I give you here.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.800
So initially, I set it to--

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.600
I don't know, maybe
I set it to 95.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:56.310
And it gave me the percentile.

01:18:56.310 --> 01:19:00.080
This percentile is running
on the AM peak data,

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.120
or whatever it is
on spreadsheet 9.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:05.000
And then I said, change
that percentile such

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.080
that the cell equals 70.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.050
And it solved it.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:15.740
And it gave 0.476 probability.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.520
Is that reliable, yes or no?

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.144
No.

01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:20.060
AUDIENCE: So what's that
probability refer to?

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:22.060
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That's the probability

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:27.000
that you can run in
70 minutes or less.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.406
And therefore, you don't
cause delays on the next trip.

01:19:30.406 --> 01:19:31.780
Your next trip
can begin on time.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:35.690
Sorry?

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:36.440
AUDIENCE: Not reliable.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:38.565
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Not reliable, thank you--

01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:42.360
OK, so Question 10 is
the challenge question.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:46.610
And now we have two variables.

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:50.120
So now you have recovery.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.940
You start at A. You go this way.

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:56.450
You reach B. You
do recovery there.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:58.520
And then you run back.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.410
So you have recovery
here and here.

01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:03.680
And we're asking
about times here.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.110
So we're saying,
what's the probability

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:08.200
with the same situation
of 7-minute headway

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.600
and a fleet size of 10 that
this trip can depart on time?

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:19.140
So for that-- there are
different approaches for this.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.630
How many of you
tried the question?

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:27.450
And how many of you think
that they solved the question?

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:28.965
Most of you, OK.

01:20:28.965 --> 01:20:32.190
AUDIENCE: Now with that answer.

01:20:32.190 --> 01:20:35.040
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: So it's

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.400
actually not that
difficult. Essentially what

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.320
you have is a
situation where you

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.760
have different cases, right?

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:49.500
So if you run here, and you
reached terminal B early

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.390
before your half cycle
time is completed,

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:56.490
then you will recover at B until
you reach your half cycle time.

01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:58.500
And in that case, the
only thing that matters

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.360
is the running time coming back.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.060
But there is a case where
you run here and it's late.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.115
And you depart immediately
from B. So for those cases,

01:21:06.115 --> 01:21:08.370
you have to compute
the probability

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:12.060
that the combination of
running this way and that way

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.810
is less than 70.

01:21:13.810 --> 01:21:16.050
So you have those two cases.

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:19.590
One way of doing that is to
take all the running times that

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:20.820
apply.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:23.970
I think this said at AM peak.

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:30.360
So direction one is on column
A. There are 200 of these.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.550
Direction two is on row one.

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:37.150
So I've done the transpose
and put it on a row.

01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:38.950
And then, for each
of the cells, we

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:41.960
can compute the
combined running time.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.520
So notice that, for the
first one, we're saying,

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.590
max of 35, which is
the half cycle time--

01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:54.400
I decided here arbitrarily
to split the whole cycle

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.080
time of 70 minutes in half.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:02.270
So I'm saying the half cycle
for the first run is 35 minutes.

01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:07.030
And so the time of
departure from B

01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:11.350
is going to be the maximum of
35 for cases where it was faster

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:15.670
than 35, or the running time
if it was longer than 35.

01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:19.870
And then we add the running
time in the return direction.

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:22.430
So we combine these
two distributions--

01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:25.570
that's called the convolution--
by adding all of these up.

01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:27.140
And all of these
are possibilities.

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.580
All the combinations of these
observations are possibilities.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.280
And then we repeat
the same thing.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.200
So we say, let's
assume this is 50%.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.940
And let's calculate
the percentile

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:45.500
on all the cells in that
matrix and ask the spreadsheet

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:50.420
to provide or solve for the
percentile that gives you 70.

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:56.420
And the answer is
0.418, so a little over.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:59.700
Then there was an 11th question,
which is very important.

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.060
It's not a number question here.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.520
But it said, there
is this person

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:07.560
who is watching these vehicles
recover at the terminal.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:13.240
And this person is annoyed that
service is not frequent enough.

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.940
And these drivers
are wasting time.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.810
And they're sitting
there not working.

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:22.670
And that person proposes
that you should run--

01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:23.821
this person is an activist.

01:23:23.821 --> 01:23:25.070
And they've gotten on the bus.

01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:27.920
And they've measured
the average time.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.880
And they say, you can
run this much faster.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.838
You don't have to wait.

01:23:30.838 --> 01:23:32.620
They're budgeting
for so much time,

01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:34.810
so you should run
this at average

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.380
with average running times.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.030
And it's your turn to
sort of argue back.

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:42.730
So hopefully you said that,
no, recovery time is important.

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:47.950
If you don't have recovery time,
then many trips will have--

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:49.390
will start late.

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:52.700
And if you're trying to take
your bus based on a schedule,

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.430
then it'll never
be there on time.

01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:56.390
And that would be--
that would mean that you

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:57.530
have to wait a lot longer.

01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:59.480
And it will be very
annoying for everyone.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.780
So that's it for Assignment 1.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.452
I hope you understood
all of this.

01:24:06.452 --> 01:24:07.910
If you have questions,
let me know.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.440
I will grade it and have it
back to you as soon as possible.
