00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.616
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.530
Welcome back to 6890.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.380
Today we start a series of
lectures on satisfiability.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.190
We saw a little bit
about satisfiability

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.220
in the first lecture.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.530
Now we're going to do it right,
and do it more intensely,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.710
and see a lot of examples.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.900
Today we'll just
see a few examples

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.680
of using SAT to prevent
NP-completeness or NP-hardness.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.190
But over the next lecture or two
we will see many more examples.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.160
And SAT is really the
most common problem

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.430
that everyone uses
to prove NP-hardness.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.090
So this is the moment you've
all been waiting for, I suppose.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.730
This is one of the
motivations for organizing

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.300
this whole class, so we
can tell you all about SAT,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.740
it's many variations, so
you get to learn them all,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.430
and then see lots
of different ways

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.110
you can SAT to
represent your problems.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.280
So without further
ado, let's get started.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.680
Today I'm going to give you
a whole bunch of problems

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.034
and definitions, and then we
will do reductions afterwards.

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:33.950
So there's going to be
a lot of problems here.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.200
You probably will have
trouble remembering them all,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.140
there are so many.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.742
But in particular,
the notes serve

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:40.200
as a useful reference,
like, here's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
all the versions you
might care about-- here's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.940
which ones are hard,
which ones are easy.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.150
So with that in mind,
get ready for the ride.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.170
So the original SAT
problem is you're

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:06.280
given a Boolean formula, which
is like over the operators

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.705
AND, OR, and NOT.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:10.330
And in case you look
at the literature,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.860
usually AND is the wedge, OR
is the v, and NOT is the neg?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.650
I don't know the
name of that symbol.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:31.530
And it's over n
variables x1, x2, xn.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.280
So usually, you're not
given true or false

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.070
so that you can construct
them by saying, x1 and not x1.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.820
That's never true.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.130
So that's false, for example.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.470
And then you could
negate that and get true.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.890
And the question is, can
you set the variables

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.070
to make the formula true?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.230
So that's the general problem.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.930
This is the very
first problem proved

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.304
to be NP-complete by
Cook and then by Levin.

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:09.220
So it's usually called
the Cook-Levin theorem,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.150
the satisfiability
is NP-complete.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.670
And I was looking at
the paper the other day.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.470
It doesn't actually mention
the notion of NP in that paper.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.470
I think that came later.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.760
But the notion is there.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:35.070
So I'll give you another
version of the same problem,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.700
essentially, called circuit SAT.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.650
This is a useful perspective
which we will see probably

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.750
not till next class.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.595
But another way
to think about it.

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:45.970
Also makes it the
NP-completeness

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.136
a little bit more intuitive.

00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:55.490
OK.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.390
This is kind of the algebraic
way of thinking about things.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.910
You have variables and
you write operators,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.630
and you use parentheses
and that sort of thing.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.530
But if you're more
graphically inclined,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.490
you could imagine you
have your excise as wires,

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.879
they're connected to gates--
this is an and gate, this is

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.140
an or gate, this is a negation.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.000
So you can imagine
something like this.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.890
So you can, generally, copy
your data and do various things.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.897
And then this is the output.

00:04:33.897 --> 00:04:35.855
And so this is what you
might call the formula.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.800
It is the AND of the
negation of the OR of x3

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.630
and the AND of x1 and x2.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.500
And then, pop off, it's also
ANDed with this thing again.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.490
So the one advantage
of circuit SAT

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.640
is you can reuse complex
computations, just

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.260
by copying the signal.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.460
Normally, in a formula,
you'd have to copy and paste

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.590
that chunk of the formula.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.910
So you could imagine this
lets you write formulas

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.650
slightly more efficiently.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.350
I think it doesn't.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.370
If you reuse things, you
can always write them

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.020
as a variable over here.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.892
Question.

00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:16.646
AUDIENCE: What about feedback?

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.020
PROFESSOR: Feedback
is forbidden.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.990
So this should be a
directed acyclic graph.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.510
Yeah.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.960
Good question.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.600
So it's an acyclic circuit.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.460
That would be another problem,
which is harder than an NP.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.170
So circuit SAT is
NP-complete when it's acyclic

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.495
and you can convert
between one and the other.

00:05:37.495 --> 00:05:38.995
And it's a little
bit more intuitive

00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:43.190
that you can write arbitrary
computations as a circuit.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.460
And then this is a question
of whether you can--

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.700
the existence of some
setting of the AIs

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.710
is the same thing
as saying, is there

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.440
some set of guesses that
will lead me to a yes answer?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.670
So that is intuitively
like NP and that's

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.680
roughly how you prove these
problems are NP-complete.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.210
You write the computation--
the checking computation--

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.330
to see whether your certificate
is a valid certificate

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.650
as a circuit or as a formula.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.770
And then the existential
quantifiers on the xi's let you

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.490
do all the guessing to see
whether they're-- and this is

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.180
biased, right?

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.640
It's trying to find a true.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.020
And that's exactly what NP does.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.760
It's trying to find a true path
that ends up answering yes.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.110
So yes and true
are symmetric here.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.430
So that's the extent of
the complexity theory

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.210
we'll do today.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.690
I'm going to give you
more versions of SAT.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.780
Next one is CNF SAT.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.870
CNF stands for
conjunctive normal form.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.770
I hope you all know
prepositional logic.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.990
Because we're going to
be doing a bunch today.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.210
So ANDs are also
called conjunctions,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.000
ORs are called disjunctions.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.240
This is old terminology.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.400
So conjunctive normal form
means that your formula

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.960
is an AND of clauses.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.470
What's a clause?

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.960
Well a clause is going
to be an OR of literals.

00:07:29.012 --> 00:07:29.720
What's a literal?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.450
A literal is going
to be xi or not xi.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.050
So these are variables.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.800
So variables are
possible literals

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.810
and the negations of variables
and literals, and that's it.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.030
And that is CNF SAT.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.350
So it's a special case of SAT
where your formula happens

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.740
to have this picture.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.390
And in general, you can
convert arbitrary formulas

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.130
into conjunctive normal form.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.710
It's a normal form, meaning
it's essentially unique.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.540
A minimal CNF formula is unique.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.240
So there's a known
transformation

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.684
to do that, polynomial time.

00:08:11.684 --> 00:08:13.100
That's how you
prove this is hard.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.100
Another view in this picture.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:23.190
We'll use CNF SAT a lot, usually
in even more specialized form.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.700
But already, one
useful view-- which

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:31.690
we saw a little bit in lecture
one, we'll see it again today--

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:36.320
is you can view such an
input as a bipartite graph.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:45.420
You have, let's say,
variables on the one side

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.540
and clauses on the other side.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.570
And then you have two
types of connections,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.300
a clause-- in general, a clause
is going to have degree three.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.650
And let's say the
dashed edges are negated

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.420
and the solid edges
are not negated.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.385
So this is a clause that
involves x1 or x2 or not x3.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.200
And in general, each
of these clauses

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.630
is going to involve some
number of variables over here.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.230
I said three, but I haven't
actually gotten to three yet.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.610
That is 3SAT.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.140
So the most common
form of CNF SAT we use

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:36.230
is called 3SAT, where it's CNF
SAT in the special case where

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:41.190
the clause is an
or three literals.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.101
And you can assume it's
exactly three or at most three.

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:47.350
So that's like saying the
degree of each of the clause

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.060
notes here is exactly three.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.370
And that's the
problem with it we

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.310
used for proving Super
Mario Brothers was

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.870
hard in the first lecture.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.280
So in my notes I have
things nicely indented.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.190
So we had CNF SAT, which
is a special case of SAT,

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.600
and then 3SAT, which is a
special case of CNF SAT.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.352
A special case of 3SAT that's
also hard is called 3SAT-5.

00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:14.060
I don't know that this
is super standard,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.310
but I found at least one
paper that gives it this name.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:26.610
This says that each
variable occurs in less than

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:32.250
or equal to five clauses, either
in it's positive or negated

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.280
form.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.390
So this is sometimes called
max five occurrence 3-SAT.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.500
And I think you can even make
them exactly five occurrances

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.710
if you want.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.071
But, at most, five occurrances
is usually what you want.

00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:45.570
Question.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.724
AUDIENCE: Is that
tight as 3SAT-4 NP?

00:10:48.724 --> 00:10:50.140
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.840
3SAT-4?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.150
I don't know.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.874
I would guess it's tight.

00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:59.040
Because there are a lot of
people that mention five,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.731
but I haven't seen a mention
that four is polynomial.

00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:02.230
All right?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.620
So we should figure that out.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.330
Other questions?

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.571
Or it's probably the same one.

00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:08.070
All right.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.450
Here's another
special case of 3SAT.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:15.410
Monotone 3SAT.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:32.075
This is where each clause is
all positive or all negative.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.110
So of course, if every
clause is all positive,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.460
then you could set all
the variables to true

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.720
and you'll satisfy.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.136
If all the classes are negative,
you set all the variables

00:11:48.136 --> 00:11:49.520
to false and you satisfy.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.974
But if half the clauses
are all positive,

00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:54.140
half the clauses are all
negative, then that's hard.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.700
That's called monotone 3SAT.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.940
I've actually not
seen this used,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.565
but I imagine it is helpful
in a few situations.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.680
This is definitely
the most common.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.659
Almost every proof
starts with 3SAT.

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:09.700
But it's really good to
know all the extra things

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.200
you can assume about your 3SAT
problem and it still be hard.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.320
I have more hard versions,
but before we get there

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.989
I'm going to tell you
about some easy versions.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:20.530
And question.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.080
AUDIENCE: Is monotone 3SAT-5?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.470
PROFESSOR: Another
good question.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.480
Monotone 3SAT-5, is
that NP complete?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.140
I don't know.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.010
Partly these were done
at different times.

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.280
Monotone 3SAT is mentioned
in Garey and Johnson

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.250
as done in 1978, presumably for
a particular hardness proof.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.610
3SAT-5 is probably
a very old idea.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.880
Probably this idea of
reducing occurances

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.010
goes to some logic thing.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.070
But the earliest reference
I found was 1998,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.690
and most people had forgotten
about monotone 3SAT by then.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.156
So it probably just
hasn't been considered,

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:58.030
but it might be easy.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.530
Yeah.

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:03.940
AUDIENCE: The construction
to limit to five variables--

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.327
should I believe work with the
monotone construction as well?

00:13:08.327 --> 00:13:08.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.770
Conjecture.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.650
Yes, it's hard.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:13.890
OK.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.570
But stay tuned for
a certain answer.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.250
So let me tell you
some polynomial time

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.350
versions of SAT.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.950
The three is tight
if you have a clause

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.050
being an or of two literals,
but otherwise they're

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.250
just like 3SAT-- or
just like CNF SAT,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.950
I guess-- then this
is polynomial time.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:48.800
And let me give you
a rough sketch why.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.670
So if you have an
or of two literals,

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.540
that's something like x or y.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.410
And the little bit of
propositional logic

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:04.480
you should know is the meaning
of, let's say, a implies b.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.600
Saying this should
hold-- and a and b

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:14.257
are either true or false-- is
the same as saying not a or b.

00:14:14.257 --> 00:14:16.840
Because if a is false, then the
implication tells you nothing.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.600
If a is true, then it better
be the case that b is true.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.114
So either a is
false, in which case

00:14:22.114 --> 00:14:24.030
you don't worry about
something, or a is true,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.910
and then b better
be true, as well.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.180
So these are the same--
maybe write triple

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.510
equals, for these are
equivalent logical statements.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.720
So we can apply
that here and say

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.740
x or y is the same thing
as not x implies y,

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.086
or not y implies x.

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:40.710
It's symmetric.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.400
But this is now just
a simple implication.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.020
If we ever set x to be
false, then y must be true.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.170
And every clause
can be converted

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.260
into such an implication.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.470
You can build a graph of
all such implications.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.620
And then, turns out, to
solve 2SAT, you can just

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.434
pick your favorite variable,
xi, set it to true,

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:01.100
follow all implications,
see whether you

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.310
get a contradiction.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.400
If you don't, then
the claim is there

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.490
is a satisfying assignment
where xi equals true.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.600
So you can try that
with xi true, xi false.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.340
If there's any hope,
then one of them

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.510
should say no contradiction.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.570
Then just run with that.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.380
And you can prove by induction
that won't get stuck.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.610
It won't make any
impossible assignments,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.440
unless there was no
assignment to begin with.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.450
So that's why 2SAT is easy
and one of the situations

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.510
you should be careful about.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:37.930
On the other hand,
MAX 2SAT is hard.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.070
So MAX 2SAT is
you're given a 2SAT

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.620
formula-- you're
given a 2CNF formula--

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.480
and normally, we ask for an
assignment to the variables

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.010
that satisfies all the
clauses, but if you just

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:59.060
want to satisfy k of them--
so satisfy k of the clauses.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.650
So usually you
want to maximize k,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.210
but let's say, for a decision
problem, I'll give you k

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.630
and I want to know, can you
satisfy k of the clauses?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.290
That problem is NP hard.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.950
So that can be useful.

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:14.630
If you can only
represent 2SAT clauses,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.820
but you can somehow get
a maximization thing in,

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.260
then you're golden again.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.440
But 2SAT alone is not enough.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.310
There are some other
easy-to-solve versions.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.990
This is essentially a
generalization of 2SAT

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.890
is Horn SAT.

00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:36.080
It's maybe a little
bit more surprising

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.450
the first time you see it.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.399
Again, it's a special
case of CNF SAT, which

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:43.690
you can tell by my indentation.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.180
Each clause has at most
one negative literal.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.270
So that means a clause is
going to look something

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:02.850
like-- has one negative?

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.001
Sorry.

00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:04.500
Sorry.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.000
Horn is the other way around.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.130
We will get-- that
problem is also solvable.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.040
But the one that's called
Horn SAT is-- there's

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.800
at most one positive literal.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.430
So that means
you're form is going

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:21.599
to look something like not
x or not y are not z or w.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:23.180
So there's one positive.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.910
The rest are all negated.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.540
And we can do some more
prepositional logic.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.650
So use De Morgan's theorem.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.615
This is the same thing as
the negation of the AND.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:39.900
OK?

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.880
And then we can apply
this helpful rule.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.490
And say this is the same thing
as if x and y and z are true,

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.000
then w better be true.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.680
And so you can use essentially
the same algorithm that

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.150
you're-- I mean,
slightly harder to check.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.360
If all three of these
things are true,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.460
then this one better be true.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.190
But it's always a guarantee.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.290
You know this thing must happen.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.850
Just like in 2-SAT, if x
happened to be set to false,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.059
then you know y must be true.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:16.058
So you can just follow
these implication chains.

00:18:16.058 --> 00:18:18.455
If you get a contradiction,
you know you're in trouble.

00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:19.830
If you don't get
a contradiction,

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.440
again, you can
prove by induction

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.630
that all will be well.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.216
And so you just
make sure every time

00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:27.340
you assign a variable you
don't get a contradiction

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.130
and you can satisfy
any Horn formula.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.780
So that's cool.

00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:46.250
So I didn't write
it on the board,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.060
but this is
polynomially solvable.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.800
There's a symmetric version,
which is called Dual Horn SAT.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.770
So this is the same thing, but
at most one negative literal

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.190
in each clause.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.200
And this is also solvable
in polynomial time

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.250
because you can just negate all
the variables in your formula.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.750
And then when you
get an answer, you

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.510
can negate all the
variables again

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.010
to get the solution to
the original problem.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.310
So because you can
solve Horn SAT,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.948
you can solve Dual Horn SAT.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.380
Cool.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:37.590
One more bad case I'll
mention now is DNF SAT.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.840
You might say, well, why do
we make things ANDs of ORs?

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.690
What about ORs of ANDs?

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.502
So DNF is disjunctive
normal form,

00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:48.335
meaning the disjunctions
are on the outside.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:05.012
So the formula is an
AND of OR-- sorry.

00:20:05.012 --> 00:20:06.220
AUDIENCE: It's an OR of ANDs.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.095
PROFESSOR: Other way.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:16.660
OR of ANDs of literals.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.540
We use some shorthand,
not-defined clauses

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.456
here because we don't
really use this problem.

00:20:20.456 --> 00:20:24.570
Because it's polynomial time.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.964
Why is it polynomial time?

00:20:26.964 --> 00:20:29.180
AUDIENCE: You can just
evaluate one of the ANDs.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.560
PROFESSOR: Just evaluate
one of the ANDs.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:30.810
If you--

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.710
AUDIENCE: If it's true.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:32.418
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:20:32.418 --> 00:20:35.020
It's true if any one
of these is possible.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.950
So you can just check for
obvious contradictions, like xi

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.510
and not xi.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.820
If that happens, then
that cause is impossible.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.770
Throw it away.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.770
If any clause has no
internal contradictions,

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.424
then just satisfy the clause.

00:20:46.424 --> 00:20:48.160
OK?

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.120
It's basically-- the answer is
yes whenever there is a clause.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.980
It could be of the empty
formula, no clauses.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.950
So writing-- you can also
write any formula into DNF.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.670
It's like an enumeration of
all the true possibilities.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.480
But it takes exponential
time to do so.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.400
So it's a funny asymmetry
between AND and OR.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.221
That's life.

00:21:11.221 --> 00:21:11.720
Yeah.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.369
AUDIENCE: I just want
to say, for Horn SAT,

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:16.410
even if you don't have
Horn SAT or Dual Horn SAT,

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.993
you might have a formula where
some renaming-- not necessarily

00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:21.410
all of the literals--
but renaming just some

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.210
of the literals will
put it in Horn SAT.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.190
And that's also in--

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.773
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:21:24.773 --> 00:21:26.270
Just negating some of them.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.260
Like, each time a
variable occurs,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.690
you have to negate all the
instances of that variable.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.190
But these are called
renamable Horn formulas.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.537
And it's also-- finding the
renaming is linear time.

00:21:37.537 --> 00:21:38.120
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.195
So some kind of renamable Horn.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.666
And by renaming, you just
mean negating, right?

00:21:47.666 --> 00:21:48.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.460
The term used in the
literature is renamable Horn.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:57.640
PROFESSOR: There exists
a negation of, let's say,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:08.390
some subset of the
variable's x such that Horn.

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.890
OK?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.200
That's the very concise version.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.866
So you get to choose some of the
variables to negate and make it

00:22:12.866 --> 00:22:15.795
a Horn clause that's
also polynomial time.

00:22:15.795 --> 00:22:16.980
Cool.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.683
Thank you.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.660
You might be wondering at
this point, how much-- I mean,

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.627
do I have to remember
all of these?

00:22:25.627 --> 00:22:26.960
And sometimes the answer is yes.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.244
But there is actually
a dichotomy theorem

00:22:30.244 --> 00:22:31.910
that will tell you
which versions of SAT

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.860
are polynomial time and
which versions are NP hard,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.930
and we'll cover that
in one more page.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.860
But I'm-- well, all of these
are involved in the statement

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.780
of that dichotomy.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.370
Not quite all, but most of them.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:47.940
So it's not exactly a shortcut.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.330
I would say a lot of
the time, the problem

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.760
you're working with
does not naturally

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.160
map onto ANDs and ORs.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.470
It sort of involves bits of
some sort-- there's a 0 and a 1

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.880
notion-- but they may not really
correspond to logical notions

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.580
of true or false.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.950
And the operations
you can do on them

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.730
may not correspond to AND or
OR, or anything nice like that.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.820
So the next two versions
of SAT are in that spirit.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.817
So this is usually, these
days, called 1-in3 SAT,

00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:39.650
but originally it was
called exactly-1 3SAT.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.010
So this is going to be a little
bit weirder to write down,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.950
but like CNF SAT, the formula is
the end of a bunch of clauses.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.490
So that part's the same.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.940
But now we're going
to make a clause

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.790
to be a relation on
three variables, which

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:19.950
is that exactly one of, let's
say, xi, xj, and xk is true.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.780
So this means it could be
true-false-false, xi is true,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.310
but the other two are false,
it could be xj is true,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.320
the other two are false, or
it could be that xk is true

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.000
and the other two are false.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.740
But those are the only
happy assignments.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.240
Question.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.797
AUDIENCE: Is it exactly one
of three variables or three

00:24:38.797 --> 00:24:40.430
literals?

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.060
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.809
The original statement
is its variables,

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:46.850
so that's how I wrote it.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.500
This is usually called monotone.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.440
These days it's usually
called monotone 1-in-3SAT.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.600
I don't know how
usually exactly.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.600
Sometimes it's called
all positive 1-in-3SAT.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:10.210
So let's say literals
equal variables.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.820
You could, of course,
if you want, consider

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.170
a more general version where
you can have negations.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:19.274
But you don't need
to, so why bother.

00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:21.190
That fact is usually
forgotten in most proofs.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.390
So you'll see in the
literature a reduction

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.220
from 1-in-3SAT with
negations, and they

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.178
have a negation gadget.

00:25:26.178 --> 00:25:29.210
It's like, you don't need
to have a negation gadget.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:33.220
So why not skip it?

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.010
But there you go.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.610
Now I'll just mention
I'm not a fan of the word

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:40.060
monotone here because here
we have monotone to mean

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.300
all positive or all negative.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.825
Here we mean all positive.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.750
Not ideal reuse of terminology.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.250
I think that's why sometimes
this is all positive 1-in-3SAT.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.684
Anyway, it's a bit of a mess.

00:25:51.684 --> 00:25:53.350
But that is the state
of the literature.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.310
So you get it all.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.730
All right.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:59.835
Here's another problem.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.000
Monotone not-exactly-1 3SAT.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.140
I should not have
any suspense here.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.410
This is NP.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.940
OK?

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.210
This is NP-complete.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.290
This is also NP-complete.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.560
But not-exactly-1
3SAT is polynomial.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.360
So I think you
know what it means.

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.040
A clause specifies that-- again,
we take an and of clauses.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:40.490
And we want zero, two, or three
of three variables are true.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.200
In other words, exactly
one of them is false.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.310
No.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.050
I don't mean that.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.880
Exactly one of them being
false would be 1-in-3SAT again,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.620
just by negating
everything, which we're

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.210
allowed to do if we want to.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.000
But this is different.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
This is saying, it could
be everything's false,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.074
or it could be one
thing is false,

00:27:03.074 --> 00:27:04.615
or it could be zero
things are false.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.820
But not two things are false.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.320
OK?

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.240
This turns out to be polynomial.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.790
And do I have-- oh.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.510
There's one funny
thing here, which

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.210
is if all your clauses
look like this,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.570
you can set all your
variables to false.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.970
So this is sort of
a trivial problem.

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.700
But to make it more
interesting, you

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.580
can say x1 equals true,
just to get you started.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.860
So there's no
trivial solution then

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.600
and it still turns
out this is easy.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.810
Because if you think
about this long enough,

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.220
as I did yesterday,
this will look something

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:57.630
like-- if you have
three variables,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.780
either they're all false--
then fine-- or if one of them

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.739
is true, then you better
have another one true.

00:28:03.739 --> 00:28:06.029
That's a way of saying if
there's at least one of them,

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:07.410
there better be at least two.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.280
That's what we want.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.120
This has to be true for
all shifts of i, j, k.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.370
So for each of i, j, k,
if one of them is true,

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.050
you want to imply
the OR of the other.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:22.910
And this is the same
as NOT xi or xj or xk.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.410
Don't need the
parentheses because it's

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.270
associative communicative.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:32.530
And that is a dual horn clause.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.840
And that's why
this is polynomial.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.340
Question.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.506
AUDIENCE: I think I'm
confused about the definition.

00:28:37.506 --> 00:28:40.240
Why can't they just
all be true then?

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.130
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.940
Let's say x2 is false.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.400
I should double check.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.710
I don't remember that in the
statement of the problem.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.250
We do not allow negations here.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:53.470
Once you allow negations,
this trick won't work.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.097
But if these appear
all in positive form,

00:28:56.097 --> 00:28:57.930
then we can convert
into the single negative

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.840
and get dual horn.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:28:59.340
Question.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.940
AUDIENCE: Are you allowed to
mix the zero, two, and threes?

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.180
Or does it have to be all
the clauses have to be--

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.300
PROFESSOR: All causes
look like-- all clauses

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.120
say, zero, two, or three
of these three variables

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.897
must be true.

00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:14.230
You can't have a clause that
says zero of these are true

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.990
and two of these are true.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.210
AUDIENCE: No.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.293
But if you have two of
these clauses that give you

00:29:17.293 --> 00:29:19.280
all those choices,
can you choose

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.290
one to be zero and then
have another one be two,

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:22.820
or whatever.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.550
PROFESSOR: For each clause,
it's an independent choice

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.320
whether you have zero, two, or
three of the variables true.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.270
Yeah.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.220
So this OR is local
to the clause.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.360
Other questions?

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.830
So it's still an AND of
things that-- it's just

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.050
we have a weirder relation.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.425
Instead of just taking the OR
of a bunch of things, which

00:29:40.425 --> 00:29:42.410
would be saying at least
one of them is true,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:47.720
now we allow zero or two or
three of them to be true.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.050
OK.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.290
One more version, then
we'll get to-- well, one

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:58.840
and a half more
versions-- then we'll

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.176
get to the dichotomy theorem.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.160
So x1 is Not-All-Equal-3SAT.

00:30:19.382 --> 00:30:20.840
I feel like that's
about all I need

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.570
to write down, other than the
fact that it is NP-complete.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.280
But just in case,
what this means is

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.770
a clause is something
like Not-All-Equal

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.700
of three variables again.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:43.410
And this is what I'm defining
is going to be the monotone

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:49.480
Not-All-Equal-3SAT--
which is also hard--

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:58.610
where these are variables,
not just literals.

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:03.710
So no negations in monotone
Not-All-Equal-3SAT.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.420
Again, the original
proof already

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.370
had monotonicity in there, so
there's no work to be done.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:09.870
Cool.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.970
So not all equal just
means that they're not

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:13.340
all the same values.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.720
So that means not all
true and not all false.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:23.580
Not TTT and not FFF.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.130
I really like this
version of 3SAT

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.120
because it's
completely symmetric

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.170
between true and false.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.596
I mean, not at the clause level.

00:31:30.596 --> 00:31:31.970
Every clause has
to be satisfied.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.886
Those are ANDed together
in the logical level.

00:31:33.886 --> 00:31:35.345
But the xi's are
treated completely

00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:36.886
symmetrically between
true and false.

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:38.510
You could just call
them red and blue.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.850
There's no reason to think
one is true one is false.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.780
You just can't have them all be
the same color within a clause.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.280
OK.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.822
So you could think of it as
a problem on hypergraphs.

00:31:48.822 --> 00:31:51.030
Three uniform hypergraphs,
you have all these triples

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.150
of things.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:55.060
You just want them to not
all be colored the same.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.740
So it means two of one, one
of the other two trues and one

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.950
false, two reds and one
blue, two falses, one true.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.294
They're all this--
those are all good cases

00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:04.460
and these are the bad cases.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.390
Cool.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.324
AUDIENCE: So this is
one or two in 3SAT?

00:32:14.324 --> 00:32:14.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.240
You can think of this
exactly one or two

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.320
in 3SAT, if you want to
phrase it in this style.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:20.820
OK.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.900
So ideally, you should
remember all of these.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.510
But I'll tell you the most
important ones are regular

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.560
3SAT-- that's at least one
of each thing is true--

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.340
exactly 1 3SAT, or 1-in-3SAT--
where exactly one of the things

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.140
is true, and adding
more things breaks it--

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.490
and Not-All-Equal-3SAT.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.750
Those are the three
important ones

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.190
to know from a lower
bounds perspective.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.830
These others are
to, like, be careful

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.871
that you don't fall into
one of these things that

00:32:46.871 --> 00:32:50.970
is polynomial.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.507
So occasionally MAX
2SAT is the one other

00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:54.590
that would be useful here.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.650
But remember these guys.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:57.572
They're super handy.

00:32:57.572 --> 00:32:59.780
Because what will happen
when you're proving hardness

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.460
is you fool around
and you try to find--

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.430
you build a gadget that
has two truths-- two

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.920
possible ways to satisfy it.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.860
Call one red and one blue
or one true and one false.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.850
And then you try different
ways to combine three of them.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.740
And you're trying to get--
you need some other things--

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.890
but you're trying to
get clause gadgets.

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:26.690
Trying to get them to--
when you combine three

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.910
wires into a little
gadget, you want

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.740
them to be constrained somehow.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.120
That in order to be
globally OK, something

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.172
must hold locally at
those three things.

00:33:35.172 --> 00:33:37.380
And it might end up being
a Not-All-Equal constraint,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.296
it might end up being
an exactly 1 constraint,

00:33:39.296 --> 00:33:41.930
or it might end up
being a 3SAT constraint.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.610
With some negations
to make it happy,

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.570
it should be one of
those to be hard.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.190
If you fall into something like
this, then that's not good.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:54.695
Question.

00:33:54.695 --> 00:33:58.913
AUDIENCE: So let's say, since
this Not-All-Equal thing--

00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:01.220
let's say you call
it red and blue.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.964
What if you add green?

00:34:03.964 --> 00:34:11.429
Then would there be-- would
Not-All-Equal 3SAT be NP-hard,

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.330
or would you need
4SAT or something?

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:13.996
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:13.996 --> 00:34:15.180
So what about ternary truth?

00:34:19.488 --> 00:34:23.949
I-- there might be a
problem on that in the PSET.

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:27.570
But in general, you would
have to go through the work

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.830
to check which problems.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.510
I think those are
pretty uncommon.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.429
So usually what you do is
if you have a gadget that

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.627
can be solved not two
ways, but four ways,

00:34:36.627 --> 00:34:38.710
is you call two of them
true and two of them false

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:41.570
and hope they behave
more or less identically.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.949
So that's the most common
answer, practically,

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.489
to what we do.

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.954
But it certainly is plausible
with three different values.

00:34:47.954 --> 00:34:49.370
Some of these are
going to be hard

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.560
but I don't know which ones.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.261
Hopefully all them, but
you have to be careful.

00:34:55.261 --> 00:34:56.719
And definitely the
next theorem I'm

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.850
going to talk about--
the dichotomy theorem--

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.500
would get more complicated
with three colors.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:13.760
Nice question.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:30.620
So let's do Schaefer's
Dichotomy Theorem.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:36.370
This is about which versions
of SAT are polynomial

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.870
and which versions
are NP-complete.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:42.070
With the right set up, every
problem you can think of

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.080
is either polynomial
or NP-complete.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.360
There's no things in between.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.540
These are called
NP-intermediate problems.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.490
So it's always going to be
one extreme or the other,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.040
as I'm about to set it up.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.920
And this theorem is by Schaefer.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.930
And in the very
same paper he proves

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.600
Not-All-Equal 3SAT and
1-in-3SAT are hard.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.020
Those are the original proofs.

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.340
So it's a great paper.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.290
I have looked at it many times.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.220
It's from 1978.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.319
So long time ago.

00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:14.360
But still quite readable.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.920
So I don't know how much-- all
the last problems we've stated

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.250
have this property, but
I'll make it explicit again.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.090
That's your formula is going
to be an AND of clauses.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:32.770
And now we're going to allow
general kinds of clauses.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.600
A clause is just going
to be any relation

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.185
on some number of variables.

00:36:39.917 --> 00:36:42.250
So there won't be any notion
of literal here because you

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.700
can put that in the relation.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:52.200
I'll call this a general
clause and say relation

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.345
on some variables.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.320
So relation is
something-- I give you

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.500
a set of truth values
for those variables

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.880
and we'll say yes or no.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.457
That's valid or it's invalid.

00:37:04.457 --> 00:37:06.040
You can think of a
relation as the set

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.290
of all assignments, their
variables, and make it true.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.716
But you don't have to
specify that, per se.

00:37:10.716 --> 00:37:12.090
You just sort of
know what it is.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:15.390
OK.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.880
So I mean, in
particular, it could

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.200
be the OR of three
variables, then we get 3SAT.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.070
Or it could be the Not-All-Equal
constraint on three variables,

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.750
then it's Not-All-Equal
3SAT, and so on.

00:37:27.561 --> 00:37:28.060
OK.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.620
We are going to--
so I guess, sorry.

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.800
The relationship should be given
to you as a Boolean formula.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.400
So it could be an OR, or
you can write 1-in-3SAT

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.489
as a Boolean formula.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.530
It's just little tedious.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.330
You could say, well it could
be this, or it could be this,

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.310
or it could be this.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.960
In general, I'm going
to assume that they're

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.680
given to you in CNF form.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
Sorry, that's redundant.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.110
CNF has form in it.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.420
Because any formula
can be made into CNF.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:02.010
So now CNF is an
AND of ORs, so this

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.629
is going to be an AND of what
we might normally call clauses,

00:38:05.629 --> 00:38:07.170
but we're already
in a clause, so I'm

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.420
going to call this subclauses.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:14.507
Starting to sound like legalese.

00:38:14.507 --> 00:38:15.340
I made up this word.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.240
It's not in the literature.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.010
So in general, your formula
is an AND of clauses,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.620
each one is your
sum relation, which

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.240
we're going to think of
as an AND of subclauses.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.448
Of course, it's really just
an AND of all the things.

00:38:25.448 --> 00:38:28.850
But this is trying
to be general.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.620
Because we're going to have
constraints in the clauses,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.890
in particular.

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:41.410
So then claim is SAT-- on
these types of formulas-- so

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.100
here's the difference, I guess.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.430
To define the problem, you
specify what kind of relations

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.120
that you allow.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.850
So in 3SAT, we say, OK,
so OR of three things.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.700
In CNF SAT, it's an OR
of k things for any k.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.810
In Not-All-Equal 3SAT, it's
not all equal of three things,

00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.310
and so on.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.570
So we give that up front and
then the decision problem

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:07.560
is well, I have
n variables and I

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.364
can combine them with these
clauses however I want.

00:39:12.364 --> 00:39:14.030
So we need some kind
of infinity, right?

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.640
If I gave you a
specific problem,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.600
then it's not going
to be NP-hard.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.410
Like, with these 10
variables, that's

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.360
never going to be interesting.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.690
So I give you the notion
of what causes are allowed,

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:28.170
what relations are
permitted, and then I

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:32.490
want to consider the class
of all possible formulas you

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.106
can build with
clauses of that type.

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.480
So you can think of this as
really more of a clause type,

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.840
like Not-All-Equal,
just to be precise here.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:43.760
And then we get
a version of SAT.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:56.190
And it's going to be polynomial
if one of four cases happen.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.140
At least one.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:58.990
Any one of these
will make it easy.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.100
We have seen almost
all of these.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:08.140
So first one is setting
all variables true

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.910
satisfies the formula.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.490
Well not just the formula,
but all formulas of this type.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:29.995
Or all variables false
satisfies all clauses.

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:33.350
OK.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.970
This is a statement over all
formulas with this clause type,

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:36.469
right?

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:38.260
So, a statement about
the clause types.

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:40.770
And it's one of the issues we
were having with not exactly

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.897
1 3SAT, because there the
clause type allowed everything

00:40:44.897 --> 00:40:46.980
to be false and it also
had everything to be true,

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.440
so it was doubly bad.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.729
But of course is if you
have clauses where this

00:40:51.729 --> 00:40:53.270
is true for all
the-- you could allow

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.394
different types of clauses.

00:40:54.394 --> 00:40:57.190
You could have Not-All-Equal
plus 1-in-3SAT, that

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.967
will also be hard, of course.

00:40:58.967 --> 00:41:01.550
But if all of your clauses have
this property, then of course,

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.716
you just globally set the
variables and you're done.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.951
OK.

00:41:07.951 --> 00:41:08.950
That was the first case.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.800
All right.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:29.400
So the next one is that
it could be the subclauses

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.705
are all Horn, or all dual Horn.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:44.429
So those are two happy
cases we saw before.

00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:46.220
I mean, we can think
of the overall problem

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.470
as an AND of the clauses,
which are ANDs of subclauses,

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.010
so if everything is a
Horn or dual Horn thing,

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.940
then we're happy.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:05.670
And next case is the
relations are all 2-CNF.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.410
So this would be the 2SAT case.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.830
If all the relations you're
working with are in 2-CNF,

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.455
then when we AND them together,
you still have a 2-CNF formula,

00:42:12.455 --> 00:42:15.770
so you can solve it by 2SAT.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:17.740
So these are all
things we've seen.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.660
There's one more
case we haven't seen.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.786
Is there a question?

00:42:22.786 --> 00:42:23.758
Yeah.

00:42:23.758 --> 00:42:26.674
AUDIENCE: Isn't 2SAT just a
subcase of the Horn and dual

00:42:26.674 --> 00:42:28.049
Horn thing?

00:42:28.049 --> 00:42:29.590
Because you're always
going to have--

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:30.465
PROFESSOR: It's true.

00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:33.810
2SAT is a special case of Horn.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.744
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:35.744 --> 00:42:37.702
AUDIENCE: You could have
one with two positives

00:42:37.702 --> 00:42:39.160
and another one
with two negatives.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.594
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's true.

00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:42.102
Yeah.

00:42:42.102 --> 00:42:43.560
PROFESSOR: Ah,
right, right, right.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.110
So I see.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:47.320
So 2-CNF, some of the
clauses are going to be Horn

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.300
and some of them are
dual Horn, I think.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.370
So it doesn't fall into
this because it's not

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:52.270
all one or the other.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:54.570
In general, those
combinations are bad.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.067
But 2SAT is always OK.

00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:57.650
Good question.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:10.855
OK Last case is
some linear algebra.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.000
This is one other
easy case of SAT

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.400
which doesn't come
up very often,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.030
so I didn't write it
as a separate one.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.280
So imagine equations like this.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:57.040
I take some number variables,
I x OR them together and I say,

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.290
that should be 0, or similar
thing, I set it equal to 1.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:05.200
Those are what I would call
linear equation over Zmod2.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.450
Because in Zmod2-- the finite
field in two elements--

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.590
addition becomes x OR and
there's no multiplication here

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.510
because it's a linear system.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.930
So we can solve these things
because z2 is a finite field.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.850
We can use Gaussian
elimination if-- even

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.170
if I have a whole bunch
of these equations,

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:28.650
I can solve them all using
Gaussian elimination.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.230
Or determine that
they're unsolvable.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:35.790
So that's another easy case
for SAT to be careful about.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:40.450
And the theorem is if you
have one of these situations--

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:41.780
so you can't mix these.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.360
If you have one
clause of this type

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.680
and another clause of this type,
your problem will be NP-hard.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:54.090
So in general, you say,
otherwise SAT is NP-hard.

00:44:59.565 --> 00:45:01.190
I guess it will
actually be NP-complete

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.690
here, the way we've set it up.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.320
Well, assuming the
relations are checkable.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.690
So these are the only cases.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.485
This is an easy case,
this is an easy case,

00:45:10.485 --> 00:45:11.360
this is an easy case.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.640
It could be that multiple
of these things are true.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.310
Maybe your 2CNF
and your all Horn.

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:18.460
That will also be
polynomial, of course.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.580
But if none of these
individually hold,

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.400
then your problem is NP-hard.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.023
Question.

00:45:23.023 --> 00:45:24.564
AUDIENCE: So how
does this generalize

00:45:24.564 --> 00:45:26.966
from non-Boolean fields?

00:45:26.966 --> 00:45:28.860
I'm sure the last one
is also still true.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:29.526
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:32.180
So we can go back to your
question about three colors,

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.790
and the answer is I don't know.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.340
As far as I know, there's
no theorem of that type.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.330
But there might be one.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.150
It's been 30 years.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.426
So it wouldn't be surprising.

00:45:41.426 --> 00:45:43.550
Certainly, you can-- some
of these positive results

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.320
will generalize.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.360
But I think even this one
would be a little tricky.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.202
AUDIENCE: So MAX 2SAT
doesn't fall in this?

00:45:52.202 --> 00:45:52.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.335
So here the goal is always to
satisfy all of the clauses.

00:45:56.335 --> 00:45:57.960
It's always the AND
of all the clauses.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.560
You could imagine a
MAX 2SAT-like theorem.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.410
My guess is most
problems will be hard.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:06.680
But as far as I know,
there's no such theorem.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.470
Yeah.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:09.678
AUDIENCE: Is there any way
to understand this theorem

00:46:09.678 --> 00:46:13.760
as making a geometric statement
about the relation being convex

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.930
and hypercube or something?

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.430
Like, is there any
sort of convexity

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.470
property encoded in this?

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:21.470
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.140
I would guess no.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.910
I know there is a
more modern take

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.309
on this that is more algebraic.

00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:30.350
So it's more like, if you
start with these things

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:31.724
and you can build
up in this way,

00:46:31.724 --> 00:46:33.560
anything you can
build up in this way

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.280
are the polynomial
solvable versions of SAT.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.036
Anything you can't build
up in this way is NP-hard.

00:46:40.036 --> 00:46:42.410
So if you're interested in
that, check the Wikipedia page

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:45.742
for Schaefer's
Dichotomy Theorem.

00:46:45.742 --> 00:46:47.950
But I don't think there's
a geometric interpretation.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.116
This one, obviously, has a
geometric interpretation.

00:46:50.116 --> 00:46:53.680
But I think the others
not, would be my guess.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.920
Yeah.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.420
AUDIENCE: So does
this say something

00:46:56.420 --> 00:47:00.260
about the complexity of
recognizing the clauses if you

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.750
interpret them as a language?

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.060
PROFESSOR: If I give
you the formula that

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:06.220
specifies the types
of clauses, can you

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.760
determine whether any
of these is the case.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.690
I would guess yes, but I
don't know of such a theorem.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.700
So another good question.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.130
So many questions
to think about here.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.460
It's definitely not
explicitly mentioned,

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.070
that I saw, in the
Schaefer paper.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.590
But it's been around for
a while so people may

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:28.101
have thought about that more.

00:47:28.101 --> 00:47:29.600
It definitely can
be a little tricky

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.010
to check which things are
of this type, practically.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.620
So it would be nice if
there was an algorithm.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.520
I would say-- so again,
practically speaking,

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.380
there was one hardness proof I
was trying to generate gadgets

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.400
computationally.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.170
So just enumerate
all possible gadgets

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.070
of a certain size
for my problem,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:55.970
and then see what formula
they were representing.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.660
And then we would
take that formula,

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.560
do a Karnaugh map-- if you've
ever done digital logic stuff--

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.110
and then from that, you
get a nice, minimal form.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.660
And then we would-- usually
we could just look at the map

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:12.360
and say, oh, that's
just equals, or that's

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:13.530
not equals or something.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.590
We were hoping for-- we
were dreaming for-- one

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.210
of these things or 3SAT.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.580
We never got the
gadget we wanted.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.750
So I think, with a Karnaugh
map, you could do this.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.950
But that's exponential time.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.719
PROFESSOR: So I
don't know for sure.

00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:30.510
I should probably check
the algebraic view.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.370
That might--

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.354
AUDIENCE: That's a
clever approach though.

00:48:34.354 --> 00:48:35.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.420
AUDIENCE: To do things
computationally.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.880
PROFESSOR: It's
definitely helpful.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.580
Because of course,
computationally, you

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.960
can only look at small gadgets.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.060
But hopefully there is a small
gadget and then a nice proof.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.216
So why do the hard work of
generating them yourself when

00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.590
the computer could
do it for you?

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.310
It doesn't work
for all problems.

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.830
Your problems need to
be locally isolatable.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.370
To not worry about
the big picture.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.290
Other questions?

00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:01.850
Cool.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:05.240
Well that's all the versions
of SAT you need to know.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.770
Because here we have the
universality theorem.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.150
There will be another
one or two that we

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.980
bump into but these are the
things you should all know.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.700
It's really helpful
when doing a proof

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.370
to not have to worry about
which version 3SAT you even

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.116
are going to use, and just know
that these are all out here.

00:49:21.116 --> 00:49:23.490
So that when you find a gadget
that happens to match one,

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:24.906
and then you say,
oh, well I meant

00:49:24.906 --> 00:49:28.821
to do a reduction from
Not-All-Equal 3SAT.

00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:30.570
That's why I wanted
to tell you all these,

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:34.800
although I know it's a lot
to take in all at once.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.075
Let's do some
reductions, finally.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.510
NP hardcore time.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:53.910
So the first one, I had
actually never seen before,

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:55.580
but it's in Schaefer's paper.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.805
So I thought it'd
be fun to cover.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.340
Here's a problem,
which is NP-hard,

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:05.760
and we will actually
prove this one NP-hard.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.240
2-colorable perfect matching.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:16.570
Let's say you're given a
planar 3-regular graph,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.030
every vertex has degree 3.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.650
And what you'd like to do is
2-color the vertices, a red

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:48.766
and blue, such that every
vertex has exactly one

00:50:48.766 --> 00:50:49.890
neighbor of the same color.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:00.250
OK.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:05.990
So if you look at a vertex
and it has three neighbors,

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.580
then-- let's say we
color this guy red,

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.610
there should be exactly
one neighbor that's red.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:12.766
And so you can think of
this edge as being red,

00:51:12.766 --> 00:51:14.890
and then the red edges will
form a perfect matching

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:15.779
in the graph.

00:51:15.779 --> 00:51:17.320
Every vertex will
be [? instant to ?]

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.029
exactly one edge.

00:51:19.029 --> 00:51:20.820
So that's the 2-colorable
perfect matching.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.160
It's kind of-- well, sorry.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.900
The red edges form perfect
matching on the red nodes,

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.470
and the black-- or
the white edges,

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:33.520
I guess-- form a perfect
matching on the white nodes,

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.950
black nodes, whatever.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.370
So it's like two
perfect matchings,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.010
one in each color class.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.430
So this is a nice problem.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.270
You can think of it
as SAT, in a sense.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.810
It's, again, just a local
constraint on the notes.

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:52.940
And so you can think of this
as being a clause involving

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.880
those four guys.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.860
I think, unless I
did something wrong,

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.880
you can think of it
as 2SAT and 4SAT,

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.940
or a special version
of 2SAT and 4SAT.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.185
Because-- is that right?

00:52:08.185 --> 00:52:09.140
Yeah.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:13.810
So let's say red is true.

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.047
So what we're saying
is if this guy is true,

00:52:16.047 --> 00:52:18.130
among these four nodes
there should be exactly one

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:20.070
other one that is red.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.790
On the other hand,
if this is black,

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:24.730
there should be exactly
one of them that is black.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:26.560
And so the other
two should be red.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.100
So in all cases, it's exactly
two and four of them are red.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.970
And it's symmetric between red
and black, so that seems good.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.190
So this is a special
case of 2SAT and 4SAT.

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:37.870
In case you were wondering
whether 2SAT and 4SAT is hard,

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:38.940
here it is.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:45.865
And I have the original
reduction by Schaefer here.

00:52:45.865 --> 00:52:47.020
Do I have any notes?

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.690
No, that would be too easy.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:55.220
So here's a gadget and
here's another gadget,

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.360
and then they're
pasted together.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.160
And I should
mention-- so Schaefer

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.455
claims that if you have
a planar 3-regular graph,

00:53:04.455 --> 00:53:05.330
this problem is hard.

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:06.820
But he doesn't prove it.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.510
He just proves it
for general graphs,

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:11.060
so I'm only going to prove
it for general graphs.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:13.970
Maybe we can think about
planar 3-regular case,

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:15.940
but not right here.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:20.180
So this will just make a graph
instance to that problem.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.780
So this gadget,
this is a k4 on--

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:27.090
and we're only
distinguishing x, y, and z.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.970
And it has to
form-- there's going

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:32.530
to be one red edge
and one black edge.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.230
So maybe like this,
and like this.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.570
Or like this, or like this.

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:38.550
It's going to be a rotation
of one of those assignments.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.570
So I believe the
claim is x, y, and z,

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:43.370
just looking at
those three vertices,

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:46.490
should be not-all-equal.

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.990
OK?

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:49.690
If two of them are red,
by symmetry-- there's

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.010
lots of rotational symmetry
here-- so maybe two of them

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:53.400
are red and one is black.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.400
Then this guy can be set
black and you're happy.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.530
It's actually forced for
that guy to be black.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:02.100
If two of them are black,
then these two must be red.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.170
And if all three of these
are black, you're toast.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.310
Because you should
have two of each.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:10.640
And if all three of them
are red, you're in trouble.

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:17.490
So this is a not-all-equal
clause gadget for this problem.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.890
So we're going to reduce
from Not-All-Equal 3SAT

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:23.630
to 2-colorable perfect matching.

00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:26.650
So we're representing a
Not-All-Equal clause like this.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:33.250
And now what we need is the
ability to copy data, right?

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.670
So these are three variables
that-- at the moment, yeah,

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.180
they can be red or blue.

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:39.330
But what we need
is that the same xi

00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:40.930
can appear in multiple clauses.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:42.379
Because we have a
bipartite graph.

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:44.420
If every variable appeared
in only in one clause,

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.340
the problem would
be really easy.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.590
So that's what this gadget does.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.680
The claim is this
gadget copies a value.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.250
And this, I think, requires--
so it says that these two

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:57.900
guys must have the same color.

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.760
And so what you do
is you just have--

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.520
for each Not-All-Equal
clause-- you

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.540
have one of these
Not-All-Equal gadgets.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.780
And then whenever you
have two variables

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.680
that are supposed to be the
same thing here, it's x and x.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.777
In our terminology, xi and xi.

00:55:11.777 --> 00:55:14.110
Then you're just going to
connect them with this gadget.

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.230
And that will force
them to be equal.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:17.780
Or over here we have y and y.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.160
So r here is Not-All-Equal.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.090
In our terminology, it'd
be NAE, xxy, and yzu.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:28.296
This would represent
that formula.

00:55:28.296 --> 00:55:30.670
So the thing to check, which
I will leave as an exercise,

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.265
because it seems-- at least,
I couldn't find a clean way

00:55:34.265 --> 00:55:34.765
to do it.

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:36.014
It seems a little bit tedious.

00:55:36.014 --> 00:55:40.960
That this forces equality
between the two ends,

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.615
not providing any
other constraints.

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:48.616
So that was a simple proof.

00:55:48.616 --> 00:55:50.120
One of few simple proofs.

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:51.260
Still some cases to check.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.549
Yeah.

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:54.465
AUDIENCE: Wait, you said
those general graphs,

00:55:54.465 --> 00:55:55.620
they don't [? tap in? ?]

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.328
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:55:56.328 --> 00:55:59.100
This is general graphs.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.490
So you might say, what about
planar 3-regular graphs?

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:07.830
Planar Not-All-Equal 3SAT--
when this graph is planar--

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.000
when the bipartite graph
is planar-- it's actually

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.030
easy to solve, polynomial.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.490
So you can't reduce from
planar Not-All-Equal 3SAT

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.120
because it's easy.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.280
But I would guess that
in this situation--

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:21.570
and we just proved this
is a more general problem

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.500
than Not-All-Equal
3SAT-- what we

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.920
would need at this point
is a crossover gadget.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.910
So that when-- and
this thing is going

00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:30.580
to end up with crossings--
if there's a gadget that just

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:33.030
communicates the information
across the crossover,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:34.620
without any other
constraints, then

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.870
we can just plug that in and
get rid of all crossings.

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:40.140
Then we have a planar graph
and that would prove this part.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.130
And then the other part is that
we have high degree nodes here.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.064
And so I'm guessing
Schaefer had in mind

00:56:46.064 --> 00:56:47.730
the gadget that takes
a high degree node

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:50.460
and splits it up into lots of
little lower degree nodes--

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.770
degree 3 nodes-- that
simulates the same effect.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.580
But I don't know either gadget.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:57.840
But that would be my
guess on how to-- that

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.340
would be the obvious
approach of how

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.954
to proceed to get that theorem.

00:57:00.954 --> 00:57:01.454
Yeah.

00:57:01.454 --> 00:57:02.870
AUDIENCE: The other
gadget is just

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:07.410
[? 1b ?] split into
degree 3 copies connected

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.067
by that gadget.

00:57:10.067 --> 00:57:10.650
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:11.640
Good.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.440
One gadget down.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.648
Now we just need a crossover.

00:57:15.994 --> 00:57:16.660
Other questions?

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:22.840
All right.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.840
I want to talk about two
families of problems--

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.160
a proof hardness for two
families of problems-- next.

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:32.530
One is called pushing blocks.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.810
These come up in lots of
different video games.

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.030
One of the first, I
think, is called Sokoban.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:43.860
This goes back to 1984 and this
is, I believe, the original CGA

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.510
graphics for Sokoban.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.640
And so you may have
played Sokoban.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.080
I think it's in Emacs.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.180
It's all over the place.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.590
Tons of implementations on it.

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.510
You are at a warehouseman, that
is what sokoban means literally

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:57.580
in Japanese.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.680
And you have these boxes.

00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.750
They're all one by one boxes.

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:00.541
You are one by one.

00:58:00.541 --> 00:58:03.150
There are some bricks
which cannot be moved.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:06.680
You have some target
locations and your poor job

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.190
is to move all these boxes
into the target locations.

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.940
Or rather, every
target location must

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.050
be covered by exactly one box.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.612
Boxes can overlap each
other, you can push a box,

00:58:15.612 --> 00:58:17.070
but you can only
push one at a time

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:18.370
because you're not that strong.

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:21.030
So you could not, for
example, push left here.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.700
But in general, your inputs
are up, down, left, and right.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.060
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.719
And you can only push
one block at a time.

00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:31.260
So if you push a
block into a corner,

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:32.970
it's never going to move again.

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:34.770
So often you have to hit reset.

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:36.370
There's a lot of
ways to get stuck.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.500
But this is a solvable instance.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.970
I think it's level five
in the original game.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:45.892
So this got started a
huge family of problems.

00:58:45.892 --> 00:58:47.350
There are tons of
other video games

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:49.000
that have pushing
blocks problems.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.080
This is one, in Legend of
Zelda: Minish Cap, which I think

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:54.070
is a Gameboy Advance game.

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:55.820
It's been a while since
I played this one.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.630
But here is a level
where you have--

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.580
it's in perspective
a little bit,

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:03.790
but this is really a 2D problem.

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.030
Everything is one by one.

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:06.330
Believe me.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:08.290
You have one by one blocks.

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:09.670
You're on ice.

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:12.220
So if you ever push a
block, it will slide off

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.530
to infinity unless it hits
something else, like a block.

00:59:16.530 --> 00:59:19.621
And your goal is to
get a block here.

00:59:19.621 --> 00:59:20.120
OK?

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.280
Anyone see how to do it?

00:59:23.893 --> 00:59:25.393
AUDIENCE: It's like
Ricochet Robots.

00:59:25.393 --> 00:59:25.850
AUDIENCE: Can you
walk without sliding?

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.140
PROFESSOR: It's a lot
like Ricochet Robots.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:27.990
Yeah.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:30.100
You can walk wherever you want.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.040
There is no block.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.460
So there's lots of free
space in this case.

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:39.250
So you can push this guy down
and then push it over and then

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:39.910
push it up.

00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:41.570
It's actually not that hard.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.236
At some point I was
thinking, well maybe

00:59:43.236 --> 00:59:46.270
I should stack up three
here so it ends up-- but no.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:50.662
It's just three pushes
and you're done.

00:59:50.662 --> 00:59:53.120
And if you watch the YouTube
video that's linked from this,

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.470
you'll see him spend
like 30 minutes

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:57.300
until he finds the
right solution.

00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.841
In the game, it's frustrating
because once you push them off,

00:59:59.841 --> 01:00:02.150
they disappear and you have
to leave and come back.

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.110
Anyway.

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:08.330
So out of all these games,
we've defined a bunch of models.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.090
Here's one aspect of the model.

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:12.850
So we have the
fixed blocks, which

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:16.590
are in red, the movable
blocks, which are in cyan here,

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:17.820
and the robot is blue.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.750
Everything's one by one.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:24.310
And in one model, which we call
Push, when you push a block,

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.980
it moves one step.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.180
That's the normal model.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.360
And that's like Sokoban.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:32.710
And I'll talk about
the two in a second.

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:35.900
In PushPush-- this is
like the on-ice version.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.840
So you're not on ice.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.060
You can still kind of
move and then kind of

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:42.300
counteract physics and
just move one step.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.530
But the blocks, they'll just fly
off until they hit something.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:49.090
So here, this block will
fly until it goes there.

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:52.290
In PushPushPush,
everything is so slippery

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:55.120
that if you hit a block and
it hits another block that's

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.620
movable, they will all
just keep going until they

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.896
hit an immovable block.

01:01:00.896 --> 01:01:02.659
AUDIENCE: But you don't slip.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.950
PROFESSOR: You still don't
slip in any of these models.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:06.699
So there's another
version where you slip,

01:01:06.699 --> 01:01:08.530
which has not been
considered so much.

01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:10.450
Although Ricochet Robots
has been considered

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:11.890
and that's in that genre.

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:12.390
Yeah?

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:16.192
AUDIENCE: Is there a model
where the block you first pushed

01:01:16.192 --> 01:01:18.150
stops and transfers its
momentum to the other--

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.950
PROFESSOR: Oh, cool.

01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:19.280
Yeah.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.290
Conservation momentum.

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:22.800
So this one hits then
the next one goes.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.509
That's probably--

01:01:23.509 --> 01:01:24.466
AUDIENCE: PushStopPush.

01:01:24.466 --> 01:01:25.560
PROFESSOR: PushStopPush.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.700
I would guess that's also
hard because this ends up

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.995
being the same proof.

01:01:28.995 --> 01:01:31.210
I'm guessing that works,
but we would need to check.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.610
That's a good-- yeah.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:36.630
The push-- push ricochet push.

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:37.130
OK.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:39.250
One other thing here
is the number two.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:41.430
You'll notice only
two blocks are moving.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.680
And normally here, two is
the strength of the robot,

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.672
meaning if there are
up to two in a row,

01:01:46.672 --> 01:01:49.130
you can push two blocks, but
once there are three in a row,

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.070
you can't push at all.

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:52.950
The idea here is the
same thing happens.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.570
So they're just too heavy.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:56.720
After you get up
to three of them,

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.750
then they'll stop sliding.

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.900
And same with PushPushPush.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.220
AUDIENCE: So Sokoban
is actually Push-1.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.080
PROFESSOR: Sokoban
is like Push-1.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.570
It's a little bit
more complicated,

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.990
as illustrated in this table.

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:15.400
So Sokoban is here and you can
only push one block at a time.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.529
There are fixed blocks.

01:02:16.529 --> 01:02:18.570
And in general, the models
that have fixed blocks

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.670
are highlighted in pink here.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:24.980
The slide thing is trying
to capture whether it just

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.600
moves one step or all the
way until it can't anymore.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.277
That's the max.

01:02:29.277 --> 01:02:31.110
And there's only a
couple of slide versions.

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:33.620
I haven't put PushPushPush
here because that

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.560
would be the only difference--
is what max means.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.800
But everything else
you just move one step.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.150
Then the other issue
is, what is the goal?

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.340
I mentioned in Sokoban you
have to cover every storage

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.700
space with a box.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:51.360
That is the only problem with
that flavor, in this list

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.040
anyway.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.810
All the ones that
are called Push--

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.990
the goal is just to get
the robot to a destination,

01:02:56.990 --> 01:03:00.450
like in Mario or
Zelda or something.

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:04.630
So that's the difference
between Sokoban and Push-1.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:09.090
Well Push-1-f, I suppose,
is pushing one thing

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.320
at a time with fixed blocks.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.490
That's identical to Sokoban
except for this issue of what

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.120
the goal is.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.581
Either just to get from
s to t-- the robot--

01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:19.955
or to get all the blocks into
a particular configuration.

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.050
OK.

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:27.340
Well there are some
other things here.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.260
We've talked about Push-k.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.970
Push-star is when k is infinity.

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.380
So when you push, you can--
your arbitrary strength--

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:36.230
you can push as many blocks
in a row as you want.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.940
PushPush-k, PushPush-star, then.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.410
We've talked about f. f is
when you have fixed blocks.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:46.400
Push-1-f, Push-k-f,
and Push-star-f.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.550
And then there's one
other variation here

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.390
that's been considered,
which is the x.

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:53.120
This is when the path
that the robot takes

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.320
must not cross itself--
must not revisit a square.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.840
This is-- there a
lot of video games

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.230
where after you leave a
square, that square disappears.

01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:05.070
It falls down into the
abyss and so you're scared.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.450
So to represent
those games-- there's

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.770
another reason we did that, but
I'll get to that in a moment--

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:13.741
there's Push-k-x
and Push-star-x.

01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:14.240
OK.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.573
Now let's talk about complexity.

01:04:15.573 --> 01:04:18.040
That's the right
two columns here.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.120
The reference and
the complexity.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.150
So all of these
problems are NP-hard.

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.650
OK?

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.160
But there's this
issue-- are they in NP

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.741
or are they PSPACE-Complete?

01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:30.240
Question.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:30.906
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:04:30.906 --> 01:04:32.610
What did you say
a fixed block is?

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.480
PROFESSOR: A fixed block is a
block that cannot be pushed.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.070
So it's just glued
to the ground.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:38.094
AUDIENCE: So this is
just whether or not

01:04:38.094 --> 01:04:39.120
there are some blocks
that are fixed.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:39.828
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:04:39.828 --> 01:04:42.260
In these problems, this
is a more general version

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:43.560
than this game.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.420
Here, you allow some blocks
to be specified as fixed.

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.490
Here, everything is
potentially movable.

01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:50.240
Although if you have
more than k in a row,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.370
it's like a fixed block.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:53.660
If you have a k plus
1 by k plus 1 block,

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.190
that's fixed, effectively.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.740
But you have a
resolution issue that you

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.340
can't make tiny fixed
blocks in this model.

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:03.790
And in this model there are
no fixed blocks whatsoever.

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.980
But here you can specify
some of them are fixed.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:09.560
A lot of versions.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.790
AUDIENCE: So push-star
has a boundary?

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:12.150
Otherwise you could just--

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.571
PROFESSOR: Push-star does
live in a rectangular box.

01:05:14.571 --> 01:05:15.070
Yeah.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:15.914
That is the one.

01:05:15.914 --> 01:05:16.830
AUDIENCE: Is it fixed?

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:21.450
PROFESSOR: You could think of
that as fixed blocks or not.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:24.050
If nothing is fixed, then you
can just walk off to infinity.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.060
Move all the blocks
away and then come back

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.143
and find your destination.

01:05:27.143 --> 01:05:28.312
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:28.312 --> 01:05:29.020
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:30.420
So they're all NP-hard.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.280
There's a few that are
known to be PSPACE-Complete.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.560
Push-Push, with a fixed
strength, is PSPACE-Complete.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:44.240
Or with fixed blocks, I think,
should also be PSPACE-Complete.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.890
That's not written here.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:48.250
But Push-Push-Star, all
we know is NP-hardness.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:56.050
Push-k-f, where k is at least 2,
is known to be PSPACE-Complete.

01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:02.160
But Push-1-f or Push-2,
without the f, are both open.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.720
And the reason we
were interested

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.450
in a non-crossing path is that
forces the problem to be an NP.

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.074
Because then you know
the solution path

01:06:09.074 --> 01:06:10.130
has polynomial length.

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:12.160
You can visit each
[? grant at ?] most once.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.070
So the hard part
here was to prove

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.630
that it's still NP-hard,
even with non-crossing paths.

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.479
We won't try to
prove that today.

01:06:18.479 --> 01:06:20.770
So those, we actually have
tight bounds of NP-complete.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.970
And Sokoban-- there's a
relatively old result--

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:25.220
1998-- that it's
PSPACE-Complete.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:25.720
OK.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.950
Let's do some reductions.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:30.870
So this first reduction
is amazingly cool.

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:33.120
It's by Michael Hoffman, 2000.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.540
This is Push-star with
a rectangular box.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.040
OK.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.200
So you're here.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.010
The outlined regions
are the blank space.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.190
Everything else is
filled with a block.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.370
But every block
is movable and you

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.060
can push arbitrarily strongly.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.350
So this is going
to be variables.

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.340
You're going to make
some choices here.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.130
These are the connections
between variables and clauses.

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.380
This is a bipartite
graph encoded

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:57.770
in binary in the obvious way.

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:00.070
There's variables
here, clauses here.

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:04.720
There's a hole exactly when that
literal appears in that clause.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.220
OK?

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.570
There's actually two rows
per variable, the true

01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.040
and the false.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.050
And then there's this gadget
here to connect the things.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.550
And then these are
the clauses where

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:15.800
we're going to check that
they were all set correctly.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.890
So let's go through it.

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:19.140
This is the schematic
diagram of what I just said.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.765
We're going to start here
in the variable block

01:07:20.765 --> 01:07:22.390
and walk through each
of the variables.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:24.740
Here's what the
variables look like.

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.930
You have two rows, the xi row
and the xi complement row.

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:31.369
That's another way
to write NOT xi.

01:07:31.369 --> 01:07:33.410
And you're going to count,
how many times does xi

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:34.690
appear in any clauses?

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:36.190
In the positive
form, negative form.

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:38.194
That's called ni and ni bar.

01:07:38.194 --> 01:07:40.110
And you're going to
measure out these lengths.

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:42.470
You can negate variables to
make sure that ni is always

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.230
bigger than ni bar.

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.550
So do that.

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.386
So in this case, ni is this
big, ni bar is this big.

01:07:48.386 --> 01:07:49.010
Measure it out.

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:50.051
This is your blank space.

01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:52.340
And what you're allowed--
what we will show you

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:54.980
you're allowed to do--
is either move up here

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:57.680
and move all the way
over here and then up.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.900
Or to move here and all
the way over and then up.

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:04.742
And this star is so that the
one block that's here could fit.

01:08:04.742 --> 01:08:06.200
And then you can
go over to this x.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.324
In general, in these gadgets,
the x is your target.

01:08:08.324 --> 01:08:09.426
x marks the spot.

01:08:09.426 --> 01:08:10.120
All right?

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.440
For the gadget.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.320
And then there's a
global x, which will

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.410
be at the end of the clauses.

01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:17.500
So what does this do?

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.649
Well if you think about
this connection block--

01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:21.729
this is the bipartite
graph encoded

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:25.830
as a matrix-- the number
of blank spaces over here

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.081
is exactly ni.

01:08:28.081 --> 01:08:32.097
So this is why, after you
push ni steps or ni bar steps,

01:08:32.097 --> 01:08:32.930
you'll have to stop.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:35.205
Because there are no blank
spaces to the right of you.

01:08:35.205 --> 01:08:36.830
Then the only thing
you can do is go up

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.663
because there are no
blank spaces below you.

01:08:38.663 --> 01:08:41.850
So in general, these gadgets are
super tight because above you

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:42.979
there's nothing.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:43.800
It's all blocks.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.759
And below you and left
of you, it's all blocks.

01:08:45.759 --> 01:08:46.883
There's nothing you can do.

01:08:46.883 --> 01:08:48.569
You put the next
variable gadget here,

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:50.979
so then that remains true.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.439
In your row, and
in your columns,

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.480
you're completely packed.

01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:57.130
So the only choice you have
is to do this or to do this.

01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:01.350
And you will fill the
row that you choose.

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.233
Exactly.

01:09:02.233 --> 01:09:03.020
OK?

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.384
So that's the variable gadget.

01:09:04.384 --> 01:09:07.010
AUDIENCE: What prevents
you from choosing both?

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.649
PROFESSOR: You
could choose both.

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:11.450
Or you could do a little bit
of one and then do the other.

01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.950
That's true.

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:14.033
But as we'll see, that
only makes your life worse.

01:09:14.033 --> 01:09:14.754
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:09:14.754 --> 01:09:15.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.180
Good question.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.319
So next, we enter
the bridge gadget,

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:22.970
which is these two pictures
and it looks like this.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:25.060
This is basically a
locking mechanism.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.790
So you start here-- I'll just
tell you're supposed to do.

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:30.380
You walk over through
this blank space,

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:35.270
then you push all of
these things down to here.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.970
So this basically prevents
you from going back

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:40.069
to where you were.

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:41.850
So you push all that down.

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:47.040
And then you go over here
and you tunnel down--

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:49.370
so I think you're moving
these blocks over to here.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:51.069
That's another kind of lock.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:54.920
And then you're pushing
this stuff down to here.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.780
And then you get there.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.690
So when all is said and
done, this will be down here,

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:02.180
this will be down here,
this will be over here.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.650
And so when you're in
the clause block-- again,

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:07.890
you have full rows to your
left, full columns above you.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.360
So there's nothing-- you can't
go up and you can't go left.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.880
That's the purpose
of this gadget--

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.740
is to connect this
thing to this thing.

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:15.610
If there was a teleporter,
it would be much easier.

01:10:15.610 --> 01:10:17.151
We could just leave
these all filled.

01:10:17.151 --> 01:10:21.290
But we want to get up to here,
but make sure this is all

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:22.600
filled at the end.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:25.050
So that's the sole
purpose of this gadget.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:25.550
OK.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.336
Now a clause.

01:10:28.336 --> 01:10:30.910
How do we do a clause again?

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:32.840
So you have-- there's
three spaces here

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.760
because this is 3SAT.

01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.880
You can move down one here,
and then move over two.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.590
These two blocks go here.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:40.140
And then you can get to the x.

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.550
Or you can go down here
and over and get to the x.

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.830
Or you can go here
and down, over.

01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:48.406
And this is possible if
there's a hole below you.

01:10:48.406 --> 01:10:50.280
This is possible if
there's a hole below you,

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.321
and this is possible if
there's a hole below you.

01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:54.410
These are aligned
with these things.

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:57.000
So with exact-- I
didn't quite align them,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.750
but these three columns
are these three columns.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.990
And if one of these
is unfilled, you'll

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:05.520
be able to get
from here to here.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.030
If they're all
filled, you won't.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.390
Because it will be full
columns all the way down.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:17.090
So that's a clause
gadget because things

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:23.000
were filled when you chose
that thing to be-- maybe

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.655
I-- did I get it backwards?

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:27.020
AUDIENCE: So you're really
choosing the opposite.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:27.728
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:11:27.728 --> 01:11:31.726
You're choosing the
thing to be not true

01:11:31.726 --> 01:11:33.850
and leaving the other one
to be as true as possible

01:11:33.850 --> 01:11:34.960
by not pushing it.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.220
So it leaves the hole so
that later you can traverse--

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.350
AUDIENCE: So that's why you
wouldn't want to choose both.

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.550
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:40.100
If you chose both, that
would be like making them

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.475
both of them not
true, and so you

01:11:41.475 --> 01:11:43.890
don't get any of the benefits.

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:45.220
OK?

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:47.680
That's Push-star.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.180
Cool?

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:55.640
OK.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.210
Let's do Push-Push-1 in 3D.

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:00.530
This is really easy.

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.940
This is almost like the
Super Mario Brothers proof.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.180
So it's just old drawing style.

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.930
And we've drawn sort
of the dual graphs,

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:11.890
so these paths are
little width-1 tunnels

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:13.284
that you can walk down.

01:12:13.284 --> 01:12:15.950
So you start up here and you can
either push this thing this way

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:17.410
or this way.

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.910
And so you're choosing which
way you'll be able to traverse.

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:22.880
Either you can go the true
way or the false way--

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.056
the opposite of wherever
you push that block.

01:12:25.056 --> 01:12:26.680
And so that cuts off
one of the things.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.700
Then that path is going to be
connected to all of the clauses

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:30.920
that it satisfies.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.915
That that literal
choice satisfies.

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.540
Then there's this
gadget to prevent you

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.720
from wrapping around
to the other side.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.599
Whichever one you come down, you
will block off the other path.

01:12:40.599 --> 01:12:42.640
And then you do that again
for the next variable,

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.848
the next variable, and so on.

01:12:43.848 --> 01:12:45.860
At the end of the
last variable, you

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.400
run through all the clauses.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.600
So how do the clauses work?

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.390
Very simple.

01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:54.730
If any of the literals
that satisfy the clause

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:58.320
were visitable, then you
could push this block over.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.112
And then later, when
you visit the clause--

01:13:00.112 --> 01:13:01.653
at the end, when
you visit the clause

01:13:01.653 --> 01:13:03.720
and try to traverse it--
if there's nothing here

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.126
when you push this
block down, it

01:13:05.126 --> 01:13:06.500
will go all the
way to the bottom

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.580
and you're trapped, never to get
to the finish line down here.

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:14.700
But if at least one of these was
in, then it will block this guy

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.530
and you can-- if that's
true for all the clauses--

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.300
then you can get
to the destination.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.340
So these are just
clause checking.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.209
And that's a very
straightforward 3SAT proof.

01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:28.250
In fact, the previous
proof is based on this one.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.477
And the next proof
is based on this one.

01:13:30.477 --> 01:13:32.560
And the Nintendo proofs
are all based on this one.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.206
This is sort of the prototype.

01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:35.705
Yeah.

01:13:35.705 --> 01:13:37.746
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
crossover gadget that--

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.000
PROFESSOR: So this is 3D.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.708
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.610
PROFESSOR: So
there's no crossover.

01:13:41.610 --> 01:13:43.610
But in 2D, we want
to get a crossover.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:45.850
So here's how we do 2D.

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:48.730
And this will work for
both Push and Push-1-- Push

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:50.100
and Push-Push.

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.600
The only place we're
using Push-Push

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.350
was this clause gadget, so let's
first get rid of that aspect.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:57.861
So here's something
called a lock,

01:13:57.861 --> 01:14:00.110
and you're going to have to
believe a little bit here.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.740
Your goal, let's say,
is to get from a to b.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:11.730
And this is what happens if you
try to go from a to b directly.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:13.610
There isn't much that
you can move-- well,

01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:22.600
you can maybe move i down, j
left, and like this, but-- yes.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:31.880
You can move i down, j left, e
down, f left, b down, but not c

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.194
left, because d is in the way.

01:14:34.194 --> 01:14:34.694
OK?

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.430
So you can't get from a to b.

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:45.449
But if you visit from u, and you
push this block out of the way,

01:14:45.449 --> 01:14:47.490
then you'd come back
through a, then you can do--

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.290
AUDIENCE: Push them over.

01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:49.748
PROFESSOR: You can
do these things.

01:14:49.748 --> 01:14:50.590
Push them all over.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:52.870
And then you have
room to push c over,

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:55.750
and then a can go all the
way down, and you're through.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:58.980
So this unlocks the lock.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.363
Then allowing a to
be traversal later.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.862
AUDIENCE: And going
backwards from v

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:04.740
to u would lock it again?

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:05.480
PROFESSOR: No.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.820
This is not a reversible gadget.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.700
It only works once.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:10.684
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:10.684 --> 01:15:11.850
PROFESSOR: You can't unlock.

01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:13.630
Once l's down, it's
permanently there.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.960
So now we're going to use
this in a clause as follows.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.460
So here's the lock
and then there's

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.050
this schematic above it.

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:24.920
So we have three
possible entries.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.384
This is xi or NOT xj or xk.

01:15:29.384 --> 01:15:30.800
And we're going
to use this gadget

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.976
to say, well if you come
down the true path from here,

01:15:33.976 --> 01:15:35.850
you're going to have to
push this block down,

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:38.450
which prevents you from using
the other half of the gadget.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:41.522
So either you move
y or you move x.

01:15:41.522 --> 01:15:43.730
From then on, you can only
do west to south traversal

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:46.340
or only north to east traversal.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.976
So it blocks the other path.

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.350
So this is--
because I don't want

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.590
to come down here,
unlock the lock,

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:53.340
and then go back on
a different path.

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.880
Because that's not something
that's necessarily true.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.300
So as you come
down one of these,

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.850
you force these gadgets to
be in a particular state that

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:03.720
will only let you come back
the way you came-- go back

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.600
the way you came.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.910
And then you can unlock
the lock and then

01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:08.500
this just connects back.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.000
OK?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.960
Then later, when we're
checking the clauses--

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.460
when we come through
all the clauses

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.043
to make sure that
they're true-- we're

01:16:14.043 --> 01:16:15.903
going to route those
from a to b, to a to b,

01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:17.235
to a to b for all the locks.

01:16:17.235 --> 01:16:18.860
And if they're all
unlocked, then we'll

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:20.800
be able to traverse
them, and otherwise, not.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.160
That's the idea.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.200
OK.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.920
Then we have the
issue of a crossover,

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.060
if we want to go into 2D.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:34.590
So we have-- here's a basic
crossover in the Push-1 model,

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.120
or Push-Push-1.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.500
If we're going to go from north
to south, then we will go-- OK.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.660
We can push this down.

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.170
But we won't be able
to go to the east then.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.920
OK?

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.420
And we're not able
to go to the west

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.840
because if we push this
block, it gets stuck.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.550
So we can go north to
south, that's fine.

01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:55.020
And we can also go west to
east, by symmetry, essentially.

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:58.100
But you can't go from west
to north or west to south,

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.850
or any of the
other combinations.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.890
This works as long as
you do one or the other.

01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:07.840
Once you do west to east, you
can't even do north to south.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.430
So that's why we call
it an XOR crossover.

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:11.930
It's not what we want.

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:15.070
But if we combine
things in this way,

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:18.280
we get a uni-directional
crossover.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:22.140
This is one where-- I better
check my notes-- you can

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:25.810
do with one of three things.

01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:29.720
You can do north to
south, if you want.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.450
And then you can
do west to east.

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:35.567
So you could just
do west to east.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.650
Or you could do north to
south, then west to east.

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:39.149
Or you could just
do north to south.

01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:40.890
Those are all possible here.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:45.100
So when we do north to south,
we prevent this particular thing

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.290
from being traversed.

01:17:46.290 --> 01:17:49.110
But we unlock this gate, which
later, when we go west to east,

01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:50.900
will allow us to do it.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:58.340
So we go here and then these
are called no-reverse gadgets.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.820
So once you push
this block back,

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:04.480
you can never go-- this
gadget becomes untraversible.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.997
So you come here, you push
this, push that, push that,

01:18:07.997 --> 01:18:09.830
and now you can never
use this gadget again.

01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:11.860
So it's like a single-use thing.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.010
So you can come here.

01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:14.520
If you tried to
do that, you would

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.689
get stuck because
this is a lock and it

01:18:16.689 --> 01:18:17.730
hasn't been unlocked yet.

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:20.780
So instead you've got to go over
here, go through this thing,

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.710
permanently destroy it, and
then unlock this gadget,

01:18:23.710 --> 01:18:24.730
and then you exit.

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.690
So that was north
to south traversal.

01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:29.290
We unlocked this gate and
we unlocked this gate.

01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:30.710
So if you're coming
west to east,

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:32.740
it could be this has
been done or not.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.210
So going west to east, maybe
you haven't visited this gadget.

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:37.740
Then you can just
go through here,

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:41.330
block off a later north to
south traversal, that's OK.

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.480
Then come over here and leave.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:46.620
And if you try to go
here, nothing happens.

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:48.340
OK?

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.440
Or it could be this has already
been done-- north to south--

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.230
and then when you're
coming from the west,

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:56.680
this has been unlocked, and
so you can open this gate

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.840
and come through here.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.760
This has already been used,
so you can't go that way.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.260
So instead you use this one.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.830
This has already been unlocked,
so you can get through.

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:08.987
And then you get out.

01:19:08.987 --> 01:19:10.570
So with just a little
bit of checking,

01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:12.510
those are the only
things you can do.

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:14.730
So when we have this
diagram-- I think

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:16.690
I have one here--
variables and clauses,

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:18.856
and you connect all the
variables to all the clauses

01:19:18.856 --> 01:19:21.350
they're involved in-- this
is a slide from lecture one,

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:24.790
but it's the same outline.

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:27.190
You know the order in which
these crossings happen.

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:30.900
Because you know I'm going to
visit variable i before I visit

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.870
variable j greater than i.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.750
So I know how to order--
and each of these paths

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.160
is really two paths,
one and then the other.

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.860
And so I know whether
I'm going to do north

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.220
to south before west to east.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:48.880
If not, I'd transpose the
gadget and exchange north-south

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.260
with west-east.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.260
And then I don't need
that they're both visited.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.720
I don't know which ones
are going to be visited,

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.130
but I could do one or the other.

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.421
Or if I do both, I know one
will come before the other.

01:19:57.421 --> 01:20:00.060
So that kind of crossover
gadget is enough

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.430
for Push-1 and Push-Push-1.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:07.600
And it's exactly mimicking
what we did with Super Mario

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.680
Brothers, we just had a
different variable choice

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.690
and a different clause and a
different crossover gadget.

01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:15.950
But other than that, it
was exactly the same.

01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:18.460
The gadgets were different,
but the proof structure

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:19.510
was the same.

01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:22.640
And that's our beginning
of 3SAT reductions.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:25.810
We will do many more next class.
