00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.820
ERIK DEMAINE: Welcome
back to 6.890.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.160
Today will be our last lecture
about pure 3SAT, so to speak,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.440
and we'll be focusing
in particular on circuit

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.240
SAT today.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.620
But before we get started
with more reductions,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.390
I want to highlight two styles
of 3SAT proofs that we've seen.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.030
This is orthogonal to
the circuit perspective

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.350
versus logic perspective.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.740
And I think it's interesting
to highlight the two

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.920
different approaches.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.450
So approach one I'm going
to call dual rail logic.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.950
These are not the usual names.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.260
We're making up names here.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.140
There aren't really names for
these types of reductions.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.825
And the other type I'm
going to call binary logic.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.590
These names come from actual
circuit stuff, real hardware.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.930
So for example, all the
Nintendo proofs we saw

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.780
are in the style of what
I would call dual rail

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.770
logic because the
variables have two outputs.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.120
And the idea is that
this one is activated

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.080
when x is set to true.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.130
This one is activated
when not x is set to true

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.050
or x is set to false.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.240
Never should both of
them be activated.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.310
So you have a separate
rail, separate line

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.180
for the true case,
and a separate line

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.110
for the false case.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.520
And this is usually called the
variable gadget that does that.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.100
And I'm going to make up
some more terminology.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.050
I'll call this semi-wires
to distinguish from wires.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.560
So over here in the
binary logic case,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470
this is sort of a
half of a distinction.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.470
It's a semi-distinction.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.660
This is my attempt to
unify things slightly.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.000
So the idea is that these
semi-wires, either they

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.020
get activated, or they
don't get activated at all.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.570
In the unactivated case,
nothing happens to them.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.360
So they're not
really interesting.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.160
In the binary logic
case, the idea

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.649
is that the wire gadget is
active in all situations,

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.440
but it can be active
in two different ways.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.690
You can either set
it to the true state

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.240
or you can set it
to the false state,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.080
and it represents both
sort of in one wire.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.640
Now, this distinction is going
to get a little bit of egg.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.090
But we saw an example
of this kind of proof

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.850
when we were talking
about crease pattern,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.610
flat foldability,
and p hardness.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.130
The wire was the
pleat, and the pleat

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.210
could be folded one
way or the other.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.370
But either way, the
information is right here,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.180
and the same wire gets
put into this gadget

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.400
whether you're true or false.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.890
Whereas over here you're
connecting to this clause

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.060
only the true half wire or
semi-wire goes to this clause.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.160
The false one goes to this
clause and to this clause.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.720
So there's a
distinction between here

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.419
where the wire's
been split in half,

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.960
and here where it's
all in one place,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.961
and the wire goes to the gadget
whether it's a true or false.

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:09.600
I think that's what
I wanted to say.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.830
My main intent here is to
highlight what kind of gadgets

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.470
you need.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.320
So we have a wire
gadget on this side,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.399
a variable gadget on this side.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:27.880
For binary logic you also need
a splitter or a split gadget

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.190
to make copies of the wire.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.850
So the idea is you
have one wire coming

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.280
in, there's some magic
split gadget which

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.370
makes two wires or three
wires, whatever, coming out.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.760
So then you can repeat
split however many times

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.600
that variable occurs.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.160
You can make a copy.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.800
In the non-monotone
versions of 3SAT

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.800
you may also need a
negation or not gadget.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.260
If you need negation, then
you'll need a negation gadget.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.000
In some cases you also
need a terminator gadget

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.095
in this perspective.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:23.160
A terminator gadget is just the
end of a wire, you might say.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.570
So if you want to
just not use a wire,

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.240
then you would put
a terminator gadget.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.980
And the idea of the terminator
gadget is it leaves it free,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.520
leaves the wire free to
choose true or false.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.837
Now, sometimes you can get away
without a terminator gadget.

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:40.420
For example, if each
of your variables

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.944
occurs exactly four times, then
you can just use two splitters,

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.610
make four copies, and
then connect those

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.340
directly to the clauses,
maybe with some negations.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.340
So in that case, you
wouldn't need a terminator.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.860
Over here we're
using a terminator

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.984
in a certain sense, which
is the edge of the paper.

00:05:55.984 --> 00:05:59.380
If a wire goes to the edge
of the paper it becomes free.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.344
So that's sort of the
terminator gadget here.

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:02.760
Though we didn't
make explicit, it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.435
was part of this overall plan.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.710
In both cases, in one
and two, you probably

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.790
need something
like a turn gadget

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.720
and maybe a crossover gadget.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.380
We've seen these
in various forms.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.210
In this case, the turn
gadget was very explicit.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.530
I mean it was also a
splitter and also in negator,

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.610
but in particular,
it changed the angle,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.470
and we needed that in order
to take this truth value

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.936
and send it up to clause
and aim everything right.

00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:50.310
And in general,
if you were doing

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.410
any kind of embedding
into two dimensions,

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.910
you're probably
going to need a turn

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.480
gadget so you can move your
wires or semi-wires around.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.800
A lot of the time people
might call this also a wire,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.590
so that's why.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.720
But I think it's
useful to have a word

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.170
to distinguish these kinds
of wires which are only

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.650
active or inactive, versus
the wires which are always

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.110
active but in two
possible states.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.170
Hopefully that clarifies or
makes more explicit the types

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.810
of proofs we've seen so far.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.700
Now, today we're going to
do a couple of circuit SAT

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.030
proofs, which all of this
applies to circuit SAT proofs,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.290
as well as SAT and 1
and 3SAT and that'll

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.230
equals SAT, that'll equal 3SAT.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.060
Circuit SAT you're
going to have-- I

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.570
guess in principle you
could do it dual rail

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.700
logic or binary logic,
although usually we

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.040
probably think of them in
this capacity in binary logic.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.840
And you're going to have wires.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.260
You still need
splits because you

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.300
need to be able to take
the output of a gate

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.750
and send it to
multiple other gates.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.480
In addition to a
not gadget, you're

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.350
going to want some other
universal logic gate.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.380
So we're going to talk
about that in a bit

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.525
after we see some examples.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:16.530
Our first example is
called Akari or Light Up.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:23.010
This is another Nikoli puzzle
like Sudoku and Numberlink

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.770
we saw last time.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.440
So here's a sample input
and a sample output.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.500
Ignore the black dots there.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.240
So you're given a grid.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.049
There's blank
squares and there's

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.940
obstacle squares where you're
not allowed to put anything.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.110
Some of the obstacle squares may
have a number between 0 and 4

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.919
on them.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.940
And that number represents how
many, among the four neighbors,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.570
edge neighbors of that
square, how many of them

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.640
should have a light?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.510
These blue circles are lights.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.590
OK, so like this one has zero
lights in those four positions,

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.670
this one has two, this one has
four, that's forced, and so on.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.680
A lot of the cells are free,
but whether you're lit or not.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.040
And then the rules
are so you can

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.050
think of a light
as a rook in chess,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.240
so it can see everything
horizontally in the same row,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.790
up to obstacles, and in the
same column up to obstacles.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:22.510
So this guy, for example, lights
this portion and this portion.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.650
This guy lights that portion,
and the thing here, and so on.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.460
And the goal is, first of all,
to light the entire board,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.480
so that's why it's all green,
it's all lit in that way.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.020
And no two lights should like
each other, because then it's

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.086
too bright I guess.

00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:41.580
I don't know.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.650
So no two rooks can
attack each other

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.290
would be another perspective.

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.610
I think those are the rules.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.650
So you've got to satisfy
the number constraint.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.290
You can only place lights
in the blank squares.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.470
You have to light everything,
and they can't see each other.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.140
So this is a valid solution.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.490
This is puzzle one on
the Nikoli website,

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.337
and there's a ton more
if you want to play.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.878
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying they can't

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:08.039
be in the same NOR column?

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:10.080
PROFESSOR: I mean they
can be in the same column,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.660
but they have to be
separated by an obstacle.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.850
So they can't see each other
within a sort of sub-column

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.040
or within a sub-row as
given by the obstacles.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.110
Cool.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.950
So that's the
problem, and now we're

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.120
going to prove that
it's NP-complete.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.610
This is the nice proof
because it's relatively simple

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.180
and it illustrates a kind
of circuit SAT and style

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.390
reduction.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.030
So for starters, and I
would say most SAT proofs,

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.100
a good starting point
is a wire gadget.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.900
You want to think about can
I make some construction that

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.280
has ideally exactly
two solutions, one

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.910
to represent true, one
to represent false.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.840
So here are a variety
of ways to do wires.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.960
And this is a fairly
flexible kind of game.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.030
The basic one looks like this.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.120
Most of things are going to be
obstacles to tie it down, make

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.080
it easy to separate gadgets.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.617
But here we have two
blanks squares, a one,

00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:05.450
two blank squares, a
one, two blank squares.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.820
That's sort of a
simple kind of wire

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.830
because you know from this one,
either x or x prime is a light.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.510
Exactly one of them is.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.860
So that forces alternation.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.580
Done.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.110
Why?

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.865
Because if we choose x, we can't
choose x prime because then

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:24.690
they're in the same sub-row
and all the way down the chain.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.160
So in general, if
x is true, the idea

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.710
is that the x's are the lights.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.250
If x is false, then the
x primes are the lights.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.970
Now, that's a basic wire.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.340
But part of the wires
we need a turn gadget.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.030
So this is a 90 degree turn.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.500
Just check that
this is still lit.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.500
If these guys could not see each
other, I think this is black.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.710
It's also OK.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.260
The alternation's
forced by the one.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.430
But some flexibility.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.130
And let's see.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.620
The other fun thing you could
do is spread out the x and x

00:11:59.620 --> 00:11:59.910
prime.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.284
If you put a bunch
of zeroes here

00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:03.370
to force that there's
no lights here,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.470
because this has to be
lit again, one of these

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.400
has to be active, and the
ones force an alternation.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.480
So this is helpful because if
our wires just look like this,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.050
and this will come
up again today,

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.880
then you're forced to be
congruent to zero mod three.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.470
First your width has
to be a multiple of 3.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.610
And this can be an issue.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.290
If you have a bunch of gadgets
each of the different sizes--

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.920
maybe one is 5 by
5, another 3 by 3,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.162
and other fun
prime numbers, then

00:12:32.162 --> 00:12:34.120
you might have trouble
actually getting gadgets

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.120
to meet edge on.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.660
Maybe there's a
gap of one or two

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.520
or something
between the gadgets.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.600
But if you have a
set up where you

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.590
can adjust the wire lengths to
be any integer, that's good.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.030
You can do this
most of the time,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.140
but then when you're
getting close to the gate,

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.080
if you're off by
one or two or three,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.950
you just make it a little bit
longer and you're all set.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.340
AUDIENCE: The unfilled
one can also just

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.936
have a crossover gadget then?

00:13:02.936 --> 00:13:03.810
PROFESSOR: Ah, sorry?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.226
AUDIENCE: Since
you have nothing--

00:13:05.226 --> 00:13:08.377
it's very natural to have a
crossover gadget by putting

00:13:08.377 --> 00:13:09.690
two of them orthongonal.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.150
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.316
You can make a crossover
gadget easy in this set up.

00:13:12.316 --> 00:13:13.820
I think that is a future slide.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.840
So we'll do crossover in a bit.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.770
Let's start with-- yeah, you
can very easily do crossover.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.976
We won't need a crossover here.

00:13:24.976 --> 00:13:27.390
That's what I mean.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.092
So we definitely need
splitting, though.

00:13:29.092 --> 00:13:30.550
In general, whenever
you have wires

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.091
you've got to be
able to make copies,

00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:34.700
because if your variable
only appears in two places,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.800
3SAT is easy, our circuit
SAT is probably easy.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.530
So here is a splitter.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.990
This is the main mechanism.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.180
I guess these ones and this two.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.800
So these ones force
an alternation

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.850
between here and here.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.310
These have to be
opposites of each other.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:14:00.350
And then the two-- so if
both of the x's are present,

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.120
if this is absent,
then these two

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.830
have to be present by the ones.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.040
And so by this two,
that's all there is,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.260
and therefore this is absent.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.676
So these guys have
to be the same.

00:14:08.676 --> 00:14:10.700
These guys have to be opposite.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.230
And conversely, if this
is present by these ones,

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.490
these have to be
absent, and by this two,

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.530
this has to be present.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.356
So this is almost
sort of a-- well,

00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:21.730
you could also
put some ones here

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.650
I guess if you felt like it.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.510
Anyway, if you think
about the parity

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.810
here, when we're represent a
signal coming into a gadget,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.810
there's x on the left
and x prime on the right.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.350
So that means coming out here
there's not x prime on the left

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:44.290
and x on the right, so this
actually a negated copy of x.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.600
And up here with some turns,
we have a regular copy

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.809
of x and a regular copy of x.

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.974
This is actually a fairly
common thing that happens.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:53.310
When you try to split maybe
you also get a negated copy,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.550
or instead you get
a negated copy.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.110
This is actually
great because it

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.685
kills two birds with one stone.

00:14:58.685 --> 00:15:00.060
You could use this
as a splitter.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.500
It kind of makes 3D
copies of your signal.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.480
But you could also use it
just as a negation gadget, as

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.540
a not gate.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.080
I think I have a slide
of those done explicitly.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.580
Yeah.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.230
So here we're effectively
using a terminator gadget.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.369
We're saying, well, we could
throw away this negated copy

00:15:20.369 --> 00:15:22.160
because we already have
two positive copies

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.820
and that's enough
for a splitter.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.980
So if we just end this wire
here, great, we've got a split.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.620
Or if we throw away the
two copies of x and we just

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.850
want the negated copy of x,
then ends up looking like this.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.710
So we get a split
gadget and a not gate

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.280
essentially for
free out of this.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.290
You could just
present this gadget

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.410
and say, oh, I also
have terminators,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.210
and then you know
that you get these.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.070
But for fun, he drew them
and I'll show you them.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.340
I won't show you them
in future proofs.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.840
Cool.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.155
So let's see, what do we have?

00:15:57.155 --> 00:15:59.300
We've got a wire.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.130
We've got a split.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:00.900
We've got a not.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.290
We've got a terminator.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.760
We need some kind of clause
or some kind of logic gate.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.210
And then possibly we
also need a crossover.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.990
We have turns.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.530
Next up is a gate.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.220
It's sort of a mega gate.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.860
I'm guessing McPhail tried
various little configurations

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.890
and then found one that
did interesting things.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.290
It actually does two
interesting things at once.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.710
So we have x coming in on
the left and y coming in

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.820
on the right, so both of
them have this x prime and y

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.780
prime, then negated copies.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.240
And then we've got
some fun stuff in here.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.430
So let's start with
maybe the bottom,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.200
which is supposed to
be an OR of x and y.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.832
So let's say that they are
both false, for example.

00:16:51.832 --> 00:16:54.290
And in general, we're going to
have to check all the cases,

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.870
but I won't do all of them.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.710
So let's say this is absent.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.165
This is absent, meaning the
it's lit from the other end.

00:17:00.165 --> 00:17:02.540
AUDIENCE: If it's false it
means that x prime is present.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:02.980
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh, right.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.480
Sorry.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.230
If they're both false-- I
though it was good-- then

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.800
both of these are present,
and therefore, we're

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.849
going to get hopefully
that this one's absent

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.280
because the OR of false
and false is false.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.060
So the claim would
be that A prime and B

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.560
prime must be activated.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.976
AUDIENCE: If they
weren't then you

00:17:22.976 --> 00:17:25.397
couldn't light both A and B.

00:17:25.397 --> 00:17:26.230
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.230
These are at best OR'd together.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.020
At most, one of
these is present.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.930
These regions both
need to be lit.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:39.010
So we're going to need
at least one of them

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.450
to be on, but once
one of them is on,

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.580
we know that z is absent, and
then the other one must be on.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.480
Right, this too.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.430
Good.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.410
And then we should
up here get x NOR.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.660
So when these were
both false and present,

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.970
these were present,
these are absent,

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.880
and therefore, this is present.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.310
And the x OR of zero
and zero is zero.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:09.120
The x NOR is 1, so that's good.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.730
So in general, you
check all the cases

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.260
and confirm this is the case.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:16.470
Again, by putting terminators on
here, we can get either x OR y,

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:22.820
or x NOR-- x NOR
y-- it sounds funny.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.665
That's great.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.580
This is the one that
we really care about.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:34.040
The OR gate-- well, so
different answers to this.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:40.370
But you should know, and we'll
talk more about this later,

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:46.800
NAND-- or let's say
NAND gate is universal.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:52.565
And a NOR gate by
itself is universal.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.930
They're just good
things you should know.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.950
They go back at least 50 years.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.360
AUDIENCE: What does
universal mean?

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.160
ERIK DEMAINE: So universal
means that from those--

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.830
if you're just given
a bunch of NANDs,

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.020
then you can construct
any logical get you want.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.040
I will talk about
that more in a moment.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.820
So this OR is
particularly interesting

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.930
because we already have
NOT, and so from OR and NOT

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.534
we can make NOR-- it's
just the NOT of the OR.

00:19:23.534 --> 00:19:27.220
And so from that, we should
be able to make anything.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.120
Which is great,
except for one thing

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.700
which is the crossover gadget.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.810
So in the case of Light
Up, crossover gadget

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:35.070
is easy to construct.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:39.220
But because we have
x OR anyway, we

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:44.070
can use this fun fact that--
this is the symbol for x OR.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:49.030
If you have x OR gadgets, you
can make a crossover gadget

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.590
for free.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.310
So this communicates
x to x, y to y.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:54.620
There's four cases.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.610
I won't check all of them.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.430
But that's cool
because we have x NOR,

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.420
we can negate it and get x OR.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.480
And then we can take three of
them, plugging them together,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.920
and we get a rather
complicated crossover gadget

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.974
if I expanded it out.

00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:11.390
There is a simpler one, but
we don't care about simplicity

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.890
here.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.160
These are just constants, and
we just care about polynomial.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.403
So that's Light
Up as empty heart.

00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:20.986
AUDIENCE: Do we need
crossover gadgets

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.230
in general for circuit SAT?

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.900
Is planner circuit SAT hard?

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.900
ERIK DEMAINE: Please wait.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.580
Yeah.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.069
This is something-- well, yeah.

00:20:30.069 --> 00:20:32.110
I want to talk about that
after the next example.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.820
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.320
ERIK DEMAINE: Which we'll get
to an answer to that question.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.930
Which as far as I know hasn't
been explicitly raised before,

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:43.230
but the answer is basically, you
don't need crossover gadgets,

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.510
and for all the
cases I can think.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:50.540
So that was Light Up is NP hard.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.419
It's also in NP because a
certificate is just where do

00:20:53.419 --> 00:20:54.210
you put the lights.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.920
There's only polynomial
number of places to put them,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.141
and checking it is easy.

00:20:58.141 --> 00:20:58.640
Cool.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.880
So NP-complete.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.690
Oh, here's for fun an
overall construction,

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.180
which McPhail worked out.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.690
So putting all the pieces
together and possibly using-- I

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.380
think here there's
maybe no crossovers.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.290
So in general, with Circuit
SAT you can construct sort

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.050
of any Boolean formula
you want once you

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:23.050
have a universal set of gates.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.130
But yeah, you can work
through details here.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.570
It's easy to convert
between AND and OR

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.310
just by negating the
inputs by De Morgan.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:40.520
So you've got x OR y is NOT
x and NOT y or vice versa.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.190
So as long as
you've got NOT an OR

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.900
you can construct AND and
vice versa by negating things

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.150
appropriately.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:53.800
So that's what he's doing here
for getting some ORs and so on.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.900
And because there's
two copies of x-- well,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.220
x is sort of getting split here.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.850
I guess you didn't
have to split x.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.262
You could just connect directly.

00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:04.970
This is a pretty nice
clean construction.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.682
It could actually make decent
resize puzzles with it.

00:22:08.682 --> 00:22:11.448
AUDIENCE: So you end up with
the wire carrying the formula

00:22:11.448 --> 00:22:13.367
just by doing all
these combinations?

00:22:13.367 --> 00:22:14.200
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.146
AUDIENCE: And then
what do you do?

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:16.354
ERIK DEMAINE: Ah, good point.

00:22:16.354 --> 00:22:17.070
Thank you.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.470
There was one more point to this
picture, which is this zero.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:26.750
This should be an OR of x
false, and this OR or this AND

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.610
and blah, blah, blah,
which is this thing.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.490
AUDIENCE: So if that
wire's carrying true,

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.690
then you don't need to put
a light next to the zero,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.320
otherwise you would
have to, and that means

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.420
the puzzle can't be solved.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.253
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:40.339
So for this puzzle
to be solvable,

00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:41.880
we better not put
a light here, which

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.540
means it has to be here, which
corresponds to this formula

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.887
being true, I think, if
I got that parity right.

00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:49.470
Or either way.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.680
You could put a one there and
force there to be a light.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.820
So this makes the puzzle
feasible if and only

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.310
if this formula's feasible.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.810
Because the wires
are unconstrained,

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.500
except by setting this
thing equal to one.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.590
So this is a special kind of
terminator, you might say.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.240
A true terminator.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.410
You want to force the thing
to be true in the end.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.785
That's usually
pretty easy to do.

00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:14.010
Terminator's usually one
of the simplest gadgets

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.680
to worry about.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.200
But yeah, you do need it.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.020
For circuit SAT you
need-- let's add that.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.379
Circuit SAT you need let's
say a true terminator.

00:23:29.379 --> 00:23:30.920
There are other ways
you could do it.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:37.790
Cool.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.150
Other questions about Akari?

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:42.840
All right.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.030
So our next topic
is Mine Sweeper.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.311
This is from our poster.

00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:48.060
We did Super Mario
Brothers, and Bruce Lee

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.450
did Rush Hour, so Mine Sweeper's
the last one on the poster.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.950
Let's prove it hard.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.097
We're actually going to cover
two proofs about Mine Sweeper,

00:23:58.097 --> 00:24:00.180
because there are sort of
two natural problems you

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.490
might ask about it.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.530
The first problem
is consistency.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:08.940
So this is I give
you a set up, I'm

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.380
going to give you a partially
solved board that you're not

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.400
given the x levels.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.370
So just a regular
instance of Mine Sweeper.

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.610
Maybe you're told where
some of the bombs are.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.120
It won't actually matter,
because all the bombs that I'll

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.481
draw here are
drivable from this--

00:24:24.481 --> 00:24:26.230
I should mention the
rules of Mine Sweeper

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.760
just in case you haven't played.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.250
Anyone not played Mine Sweeper?

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.020
I'm not willing to admit it.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.260
The numbers here representing,
among all your vertex

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.664
neighbors, all eight neighbors,
how many of them are bombs.

00:24:38.664 --> 00:24:41.080
You don't want to click on the
bombs because then you die.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.350
So your goal is from
this partial information,

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.114
these blank squares
represent zeros.

00:24:45.114 --> 00:24:46.530
From this partial
information, you

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:49.800
want to figure out
where the bombs must be.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.050
And here's a very
familiar looking wire.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.860
We can't just have obstacles
that are wild cards.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.780
So we have to put
numbers if we don't

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.555
want there to be bombs there.

00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:06.930
That makes the gadgets quite
a bit trickier to work with.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.710
But this looks pretty similar.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.850
We've got these ones,
which force an alternation.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.900
Exactly one of these two is
a bomb, so if x is present,

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.600
x prime is absent
and vice versa.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.610
And then this one forces--
I guess actually this one

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.930
forces these to be opposite.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.690
So that forces the
alternation down the line.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.040
So again, there are exactly
two solutions to this wire

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.660
gadget for where
the bombs could be.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.490
And so the Mine Sweeper
consistency problem

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.840
is I give you some picture
involving these things,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.015
and I want to know is
there a solution-- is there

00:25:41.015 --> 00:25:42.640
a placement of the
bombs that satisfies

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.830
all of these constraints?

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:50.640
Now, you might ask why is that
the problem we care about?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.340
And one reason if you're
playing Mine Sweeper,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.570
you'd like to know, for
example, could there

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.350
be a bomb at this position?

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.080
So could there be a
bomb at this position?

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.190
I could solve that
problem, potentially,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.950
if I could solve Mine Sweeper
consistency by saying,

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.520
let's put a bomb there as part
of the partial information.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.750
Is that consistent
with everything else?

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.310
So add a bomb to the
partial information.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.320
Is that a consistent
configuration?

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.430
So if I could solve Mine
Sweeper consistency,

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.020
I could play Mine
Sweeper very well

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.137
by just testing which
are bombable positions.

00:26:26.137 --> 00:26:27.970
If they're not, possible
to be a bomb there.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.940
Actually click there
and get more information

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.470
and cook until done.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.920
Now, maybe you could solve
Mine Sweeper in a different way

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.150
than using consistency.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.190
But one way to solve it
would be consistency.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.690
Question?

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.300
AUDIENCE: By consistency you
don't mean unique solution.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.550
ERIK DEMAINE: I do not mean
unique solution, right.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:43.790
Yeah.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.390
So when you actually
want to solve the game,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.210
you'd like there to
be a unique solution.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.590
That's a problem we
will get to in a moment.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.065
AUDIENCE: So a blank
board, unfilled information

00:26:52.065 --> 00:26:53.800
is consistent.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.550
ERIK DEMAINE: Yes.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.980
Completely blank
board is consistent.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.380
And it wouldn't be interesting.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.060
As you're playing,
you imagine you've

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.210
gathered some information,
you add a bomb.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.956
You want to say is
this consistent.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.705
It says yes, like
you're in a blank board.

00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.496
And you're like could
there be a bomb here.

00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:10.060
Of course there could be.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.460
Then that's not a safe move.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.250
So if you could solve this,
you could identify safe moves.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.310
Turns out you can't solve it,
so it doesn't directly help you.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.230
Yeah.

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.282
AUDIENCE: So there doesn't
always exist a safe move.

00:27:23.282 --> 00:27:25.490
ERIK DEMAINE: There doesn't
always exist a safe move.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:28.910
AUDIENCE: What good
is it, kind of,

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.859
to know whether [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:31.650
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.890
I would say consistency
is the wrong problem

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.130
to solve for Mine Sweeper.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.290
But it was the first
problem solved.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.290
The gadgets are
relatively easy, which is

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.560
going to be fairly complicated.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.830
And then we'll get to the
right problem for if you

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:47.959
wanted to solve the puzzle.

00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:49.750
At this point it's an
interesting question.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.374
You just want to know
is it consistent.

00:27:51.374 --> 00:27:54.057
Did the computer cheat would
be one other perspective.

00:27:54.057 --> 00:27:56.140
Or you could imagine some
adversarial Mine Sweeper

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.655
where you only decide the
bombs as the person is playing.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.260
So here, just even telling
whether your opponent

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.410
is cheating is hard.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.400
So that's another perspective.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.920
Let's finish this proof.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.830
We have a terminator, which
is actually a little bit

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:17.540
tricky here.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.680
You can't just end with
ones because that would

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.280
force this guy to be a bomb.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.090
So you end with
these threes, which

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.970
force-- these guys are already
bombs because of this picture,

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:30.590
and then exactly one of those
will still have to be a bomb.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.290
And then we have a splitter.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:34.880
It's a similar picture to Akari.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.030
We have this two, which
forces exactly to two of these

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.055
to be present, and these
ones force alternation.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.520
Now, I'm orienting these
arrows for the splitter

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:54.400
and defining true to be when
the pointy end of the arrow

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.730
is present.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.000
So that means this is
actually a negated copy,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.509
and these are unnegated copies.

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:03.050
But that's only from
the orientation.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.040
This gadget's actually
symmetric, fourfold.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.370
But if you put these
arrows in, which

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.450
you would do if you were
actually following a circuit,

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.830
their circuits are directed
acyclic graphs remember.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.270
So this is negation, which is
good because it gives us a NOT,

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.690
it also gives us a split.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.830
You can also end these
two things and get a turn.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.300
So great, three gadgets in one.

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.750
So we already have NOT.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.740
This is another way to do NOT.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.770
And it's interesting here
because with Akari we

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:39.600
could stretch wires to any
length, any integer length

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.360
that's sufficiently long.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.224
Here, we're forced in this
modulo three picture, normally.

00:29:46.224 --> 00:29:47.890
But when we do something
like a negation

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.670
here we get kind of messed up.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.520
We're no longer in the
same position modulo three.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.790
We should be off
by one I believe.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:01.240
So the idea is if you do
two negations in a row,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.840
then you can end up
shifting by exactly two

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.630
and still have the same signal.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:11.220
So you can see here
we have xx bar,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.980
but down here we have it
shifted two positions over.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.210
Or I guess it's more impressive
over here, so x bar x.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.800
And normally this would repeat
in this kind of pattern.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.031
So it actually shifted
by one position.

00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:30.530
Good.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:32.440
That's actually what I want.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:39.550
So see the pattern here, here,
here, here, and shift by one.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.480
Yeah, or two the
other direction.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.580
OK, so that's good.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.460
That lets me adjust
my wire length.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.760
These are also often
called shift gadgets.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.700
They just let you shift by one.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.242
And whenever you have gadgets
that force certain modulo

00:30:54.242 --> 00:30:56.200
constraints, just having
the ability to add one

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.430
is great because then you can
break all switch constraints.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.388
You no longer have to
live in a mod three grid,

00:31:00.388 --> 00:31:03.120
whatever, if you don't want to.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.330
So this is important.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:09.370
In general-- I'll add
it to the list here.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.590
When you're dealing
with wires you

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.290
may need some kind
of shift gadget that

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:18.820
lets you fix parity issues,
or in this case, a mod three

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.310
parity.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:24.550
OK, here is a more
complicated gadget,

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.990
which I will not go through.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.980
It looks scary.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.200
It's not actually
a ton going on.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.470
It's a lot of gadgets
we've already seen.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.860
It uses a slight-- I've
mentioned a turn gadget.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:35.990
This is another
way to do a turn.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.190
There's a few redundant
gadgets in this paper

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.950
because it's fun
to make gadgets,

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.280
so I want to have more.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.590
So there's, for example,
just a turn gadget here.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.907
There's a splitter here.

00:31:46.907 --> 00:31:47.740
Another turn gadget.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.240
This is reflectionally
symmetric around the x-axis.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.140
There's basically
just a turn here,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.250
so x is just getting copied
and negated into here.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.190
z is getting copied
and negated into here.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:07.090
This is the output value,
which is getting copied around

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.760
into here.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.430
And then a little bit of
magic happens here and here

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.180
to get these to interact
in the right way.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.170
And it's essentially
just checking cases

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.330
to see that this computes
an AND of these two inputs.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.642
But a little bit complicated.

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:26.350
AUDIENCE: Is coming
up with these gadgets

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.280
harder than checking them?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.960
ERIK DEMAINE: Good question.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.700
It's unclear.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.890
Often when you're
designing things,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.110
you have a lot more control,
and it could potentially

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.990
be easier to design hard
problems than to check them.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.230
Because we know it's
NP-complete to check this,

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.857
in a certain sense.

00:32:44.857 --> 00:32:47.190
I mean, of course, in this
case there's only four cases,

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.550
so it's not really that hard.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.200
But yeah, when you're
designing things

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.594
you have in mind a certain
connectivity structure,

00:32:53.594 --> 00:32:55.260
and then it's a matter
of getting things

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.530
to resolve in the grid and not
have things overlapping and so

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.450
on, which is a different
kind of constraint.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.040
I might say it's a more fun one.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.354
I would call designing these
puzzles meta puzzles, and to me

00:33:07.354 --> 00:33:08.020
that's more fun.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.470
But of course, I'm a
theoretical computer scientist.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:13.910
That's why we're here.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.090
Anyway, fun to
answer that question.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.130
So here's a fun thing.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:26.355
I hadn't seen this paper
before by Goldschlager in 1977.

00:33:26.355 --> 00:33:28.230
They were worried about
p completeness, which

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.870
we haven't talked about yet.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.200
But in particular, they
gave these two pictures.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.550
This one we've seen.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:39.480
If you have an x OR gadget,
you can construct a crossover.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.870
Now, we don't have an
XOR gadget in this case,

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.920
but we have an AND
gadget or a NAND gadget.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.930
This is the funny way of
writing NAND, NOT of an AND.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.240
And if you have NAND gadgets
you can construct an XOR.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.770
So if you plug this picture
into each of these three

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:59.270
pictures you get a kind of
ugly thing, but it's planar

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.100
and it implements a crossover.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.640
Which means if you have NAND,
you get planarity for free.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:12.530
So I'm going to call
this planar circuit SAT.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.870
It's like catch, this, I
think is also a made-up term.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:24.469
I haven't seen it
in the literature.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.510
Because it's a little bit
vague what it could mean.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:34.230
But let's say we're
given a planar directed

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.515
acyclic circuit.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:47.885
And let's say all
gates are NAND.

00:34:50.509 --> 00:34:51.550
Then this is NP-complete.

00:34:58.604 --> 00:34:59.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:03.230
ERIK DEMAINE: Ah, right.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.090
Sorry.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:05.980
And at the end you
want it to be true.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.180
Thank you.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.293
So you have let's say the
sources are unconstrained.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.410
So those represent
the variables.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:23.086
And there's a sync,
which is set to one.

00:35:23.086 --> 00:35:24.710
And we could say
there's just one sync.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.000
So you have some
starting points.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.500
Those are completely free
to choose true or false.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.740
And then at the end
you have a sync.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.580
I guess it just has one thing
probably coming into it.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.670
Wouldn't make sense otherwise.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.706
And we set this to be one.

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.330
So that's just like
satisfying formula,

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:48.530
but drawn as a Boolean
circuit, and it's planar.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.770
Now, we're going to see
more versions of planar SAT

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:55.050
next class, but this one
as far as I know is newish.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.070
It's essentially
argued in this paper.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.590
Say, hey look--
this paper was not

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:04.450
talking about NP-completeness,
but the K paper says,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.130
hey, we've got these
two things, so as long

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.560
as you have NAND you've
got crossovers for free.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.630
So you don't have to worry about
planarity, which is good news.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.680
So no crossover gadget needed.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.547
There is one.

00:36:16.547 --> 00:36:18.380
It's actually not that
hard in Mine Sweeper,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.740
but it's nicer when you
don't have to do it.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.230
Questions?

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.953
I guess I did talk
about termination.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.660
We do need a true
terminator here

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.090
because we're doing circuit SAT.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.490
That's really easy.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.770
In fact, this would do it.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.440
Just ending with all
ones means, in fact,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.790
if there's zeroes out here, that
means this has to be a bomb.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.840
And so that sets it to one.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.070
So there's a true terminator
for Mine Sweeper consistency.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.410
But as we've seen
in various ways,

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.190
Mine Sweeper consistency
is probably not

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:58.490
what we want to
actually play the game.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.210
The algorithm I
gave you is one way

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.250
to think about playing the
game where you add a thing

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.370
and you check for consistency.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.810
That's also a little
bit weird where

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.156
you're assuming that
the input is consistent,

00:37:11.156 --> 00:37:12.530
and then you add
one bomb and you

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.488
want to see whether that
makes it inconsistent.

00:37:14.488 --> 00:37:16.340
That's a special case
of this instance.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.439
Maybe not as hard as
the general picture.

00:37:18.439 --> 00:37:20.480
Everything was consistent
up until the moment you

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.140
added one new bomb information.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.930
These pictures don't
look exactly like that.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.200
Another thing I want to
point out in these gadgets

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.210
is let's say the number of x
and x bars is not the same.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.080
Maybe this negation, this
equal numbers of x and x

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.770
bars over here, but
there's one extra x bar.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.330
What that means is
local to this picture,

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:51.810
the number of bombs
that get used varies.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:55.630
There's either one, two, three,
four bombs if you choose x,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.960
or there's five bombs
if you choose x bar.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.330
And one of the minor
things in Mine Sweeper

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:04.830
is that the total number of
bombs is given to you as input.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.330
So that actually also
kind of messes things up.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.970
Anyway, luckily, this
problem was solved.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.460
It was actually independently
solved by multiple people.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.620
It's claimed in Bob Hearn's
PhD thesis, though never

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.360
got fully written up.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.230
And then it got published, so no
reason to write it up anymore.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.010
So here is their proof.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:29.600
Both this proof and
the previous one

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.650
appeared in Mathematical
Intelligencer.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.130
So they draw the gadgets
slightly differently,

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.560
and so far everything
looks about the same.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.370
They're not going to use a phase
changer in this form at least.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.900
So they're going to draw
the wire gadget like this,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.820
and the idea is that
you would copy it,

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.130
you get things mod
three, that will turn out

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.409
to be OK for them.

00:38:49.409 --> 00:38:51.450
But what they really want
is that in each diagram

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:54.210
there are equal number
of x and x bars.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.800
Why?

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.410
And also what are they proving?

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:02.800
So this is what they call the
Mine Sweeper inference problem.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:11.090
But it's also what you might
just call Mine Sweeper.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.937
I want to solve this puzzle.

00:39:12.937 --> 00:39:14.520
What does it mean
to solve the puzzle?

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.728
Well, it means you're given
this partial information.

00:39:16.728 --> 00:39:18.780
You want to know am I done?

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.840
Did I solve it?

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.510
Can I solve it?

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.330
Can I figure out where
all the bombs are?

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.470
This is like there
being a unique solution.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.410
So I want to conclude
that, OK, I can figure out

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.530
where all the bombs are.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:37.400
So can you figure
everything out?

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.230
So again, the reduction is from
something like circuit SAT.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.365
It's going to be a reduction
from circuit unSAT.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.180
Unsatisfiability.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.570
So satisfiability you
want to set the variables

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:13.522
so that the outcome is true.

00:40:13.522 --> 00:40:15.730
You might say, well, I could
try to set the variables

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:16.990
so the outcome is false.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:18.810
That's the same problem.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.700
That won't change.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.910
Just put a NOT at the end.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:26.620
Unsatisfiability means that you
cannot satisfy this formula.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.020
There's no way to set
the variables to make

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.870
the output true.

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:39.410
There does not exist
choices for the x ANDs, such

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:46.420
that some f of xi's equals 1.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.099
If we do some-- who knows,
this is called De Morgan?

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:50.640
Probably not.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.790
Another fun fact is
NOT there exists,

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.280
NOT is the same thing as
for all or however you

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.000
want to write it.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.100
So if we put this
negation over to here,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.730
this turns into
universal quantifiers.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.030
These are extensial
quantifiers to for alls.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.000
So this is quite a
different problem.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.920
3SAT is about do there exist
settings for these n variables

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.360
such that this comes
out to be true.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.600
Now we're saying no matter
how you set the variables,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.019
this comes out to be
true or false I guess.

00:41:40.019 --> 00:41:41.310
But again, that doesn't matter.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:44.062
You can just put the negation
inside f if you wanted to.

00:41:44.062 --> 00:41:45.770
So the key difference
here is we switched

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.950
the quantify direction.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.200
This is such a big difference
that this problem is not

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.830
NP-complete, unless
NP equals coNP.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.720
This problem is coNP complete.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:09.830
Recall coNP are the problems
where you can always given

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:10.670
no certificate.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.170
Whenever the answer is no,
I can give you a short proof

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.230
that the answer is no.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.060
How would I tell you that the
answer to this question is no?

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.880
I would give you a
satisfying assignment.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.600
I'd give you xa to xn,
where f ends up being 1,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.930
then you know this is not true.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.260
It's very hard to
prove yes here.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.960
I mean you might have to check
all possible exponentially many

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:33.240
assignments to the xi's.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.420
Of course, we don't know
whether that's possible.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.650
That's coNP completeness.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:43.120
It's the same NP versus
p problem, but negated.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.050
Cool.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.580
So claim is Mine Sweeper
inference is coNP-complete.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.620
And in general, the
proper statement

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.910
is Mine Sweeper
is coNP-complete.

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.530
Mine Sweeper consistency
is NP-complete,

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.420
but Mine Sweeper the game,
I want to solve the game,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.700
is coNP-complete.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:01.540
Cool?

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.500
This will be one of the few
cases where coNP arises for us.

00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:08.440
Yeah.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.320
AUDIENCE: Where does
coNP lie on this?

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.827
We don't know?

00:43:11.827 --> 00:43:13.660
ERIK DEMAINE: In my
one-dimensional diagram,

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.170
you can think of NP and coNP
lying in the same space,

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.900
but maybe like in a
parallel universe.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:22.320
I think.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:30.340
People always draw
this picture, NP, coNP.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.290
P is here, and this
is NP intersect coNP.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:38.140
And some people think that's
the same thing as P. Who knows.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.950
So there are parallel universes,
one about positive problems,

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:45.240
one about negative problems.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:49.256
But in some sense,
equal complexity.

00:43:49.256 --> 00:43:50.880
In this class we
think about reductions

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.088
as being one call reductions.

00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:53.530
You take your
problem, you map it

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.080
so that the output when
you solve this new problem

00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.640
has exactly the same solution
to the original problem.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.080
If you instead think about
multi-call reductions

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.870
where you can make calls to an
oracle that solved the target

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.450
problem multiple times and
then do stuff with it--

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.450
you could, for example,
call that thing,

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:12.630
then negate the answer
and return that.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.280
In that universe NP and
coNP become the same thing.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.380
Or NP-completeness
and coNP-completeness,

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.580
which are about reductions,
become the same thing.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:23.900
So that's the only
thing holding them apart

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.620
is that we're not allowed
to negate the answer.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.336
So I view them as
almost the same,

00:44:28.336 --> 00:44:30.960
but obviously they're different
and you have to distinguish one

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.420
from the other.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.570
But in terms of difficulty
they're about the same.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.010
The difference between NP
and coNP versus p space

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.360
is totally different, or x
time, or the other things

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.470
in my one-dimensional diagram.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.970
Yeah?

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.237
AUDIENCE: Would p equals
NP imply p equals coNP?

00:44:45.237 --> 00:44:46.820
ERIK DEMAINE: If p
equals NP, then I'm

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:54.590
pretty sure NP equals coNP,
because in polynomial time

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:57.470
you can do-- yeah. p is
closed under a complement,

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.090
because you can solve
the problem then negate.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.620
So I should say NP and
coNP are different.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.650
But NP-complete and
coNP-complete are very close,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.670
let's say.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:10.390
There's sort of dual-- for
every problem over here,

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.790
the corresponding problem
over here is like the hardest,

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.420
and they're sort of
symmetric or something.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.090
All right.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.430
Phew.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.380
Back to Mine Sweeper.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.130
So here is the
coNP-completeness.

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.190
We have wires just
like before, but I'm

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:29.920
drawing them differently.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.190
Because part of the
issue here is we

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.410
are told how many
bombs there are,

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.090
and we don't want that
information to help us.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.470
So we want every diagram
to have an equal number

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.116
of, say, x and x bars.

00:45:42.116 --> 00:45:43.740
So if we set it with
x or set it with x

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.790
bar, we use exactly the
same number of bombs,

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.990
Which means knowing what
gadgets are glued together

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.410
we can just add up how
many bombs each one has.

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.879
That will be the total number
of bombs given to the puzzle.

00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:57.920
And that shouldn't give
you any extra information

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.544
because all of these
pictures will have

00:45:59.544 --> 00:46:01.710
equal number of x's and x bars.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:06.830
So here we have wire,
terminator, and turn.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.340
Pretty similar to
before, but now checking

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.090
that everything has equal
number of x's and x bars.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.997
I think this turn,
for example-- no,

00:46:15.997 --> 00:46:17.330
that one happens to be balanced.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:18.955
Some of these gadgets
are not balanced.

00:46:18.955 --> 00:46:21.520
This one almost certainly.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.360
OK.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:30.150
So in this case, they construct
a NOT gate and an OR gate.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.870
And then they also
build a shifter.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.430
This is a different
kind of shifter.

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.690
It still has width and multiple
of 3, but we're taking the wire

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.990
and shifting it
perpendicular by one unit.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.240
With turns you can simulate
the other type of shifter,

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.440
but this turns out to be
the only one that they need.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:53.250
So let's talk about
that first, let's say.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:47:00.270
So if x is set by this two and
this bomb, this one is not set.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.300
This four already
has three of them,

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.849
so it effectively becomes a one.

00:47:03.849 --> 00:47:05.890
So then these two have to
be opposites from each.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.750
This is sort of where
the shift happens.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:11.725
And then because we have to
deal with these bombs that

00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:12.480
are left over.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.270
Let's put some more in.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.550
And then this is five, so
there's already four here,

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.730
and so that forces
an alternation there.

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:21.900
So same idea, but
with some bombs

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.562
added in to fill the
space, let's say.

00:47:26.562 --> 00:47:31.620
Got to do a one here, and
a one here, a one there.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.370
This is a problem.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.684
I can't put a one here.

00:47:34.684 --> 00:47:36.350
That would force this
guy to be present.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.245
So that's probably why
that bomb is there,

00:47:38.245 --> 00:47:40.370
because we don't want to
have to say how many bombs

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.940
are adjacent to this corner.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.790
With regular wires you
don't have corners.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:45.010
Good.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:47.740
But when you're doing a shift
you have sort of corner.

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.640
Same thing with the turn
gadget that we already saw.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.360
OK.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.310
I think NOT is also
pretty intelligible,

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.910
but it's fairly complicated.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:00.310
It essentially involves making
another copy of the signal

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.590
just so we get an equal
number of x's and x bars.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.665
Because we saw in the previous
reduction with a NOT gate,

00:48:06.665 --> 00:48:08.720
we had this one isolated guy.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:10.450
That would be like this one.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.650
And so if you just have
this picture, yeah,

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.090
it would negate things.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.240
And again, this is
designed to be mod three,

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:23.929
so there's three, six-- that's
hard to do-- nine, 12, 15.

00:48:23.929 --> 00:48:26.220
So things are nicely aligned
on the mod three boundary,

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.160
but they end up with
these three dudes.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.510
They end up flipping the signal.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:33.179
Here's x, here's also x,
which is like the reverse

00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:34.220
because it's on the left.

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.310
But this would have an unequal
number of x's and x bars.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:41.710
There's too many
x's in this row.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.510
So we end up splitting off a
negated copy here, basically,

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:46.580
to balance things out.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.371
And now if you count
all the x's and x bars

00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:50.600
they should be equal.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.840
Cool.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.380
And then they build an OR gate.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.480
So it's again, looks
fairly complicated.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.490
Probably pretty
simple in essence,

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.140
but I don't feel like
checking all those cases.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.825
What is annoying is that this
thing is not mod three aligned.

00:49:07.825 --> 00:49:11.600
Mod three aligned
would be here or here,

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.030
with the output always
in the middle finger.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.570
But instead it's here.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:17.690
And so they used the
shift gadget over here

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.780
to offset that by
one, and similarly

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.130
in all three pictures.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.970
And then you get an OR
gate with proper alignment.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.820
Everything works
out in mod three.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.440
OK.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.630
Cool.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.900
So we have NOT and we have
OR, therefore we have NOR,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:40.980
and therefore we can build
any logical gate we want.

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:45.620
An so we have turns, we
have shifts that we need,

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.035
we have NOT, we have--
did we do split?

00:49:48.035 --> 00:49:50.892
I think we did split
on the previous-- nope,

00:49:50.892 --> 00:49:52.190
we didn't do split.

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.810
OK, then let's do split.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:57.790
So we need to copy our wires.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.990
This is a more complicated
version of the previous split.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.670
Again, with an extra
thing thrown in.

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.310
Like this is not needed.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.790
You don't have to put this here,
but it adds an extra x bar.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.520
So there's actually
two of those things.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:16.150
And so together that offsets
all the extra x copies

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:17.560
that are on the inside.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.200
And so that forces, again,
equal number of bombs,

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.700
whether it's x or x bar chosen.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.220
So we can just
count how many bombs

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.410
are needed in this picture.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:30.400
Cool.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.340
This is, again, a
symmetric version.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:36.850
So if you're thinking of,
let's say, this as the input,

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:40.980
and these two as the output,
than negation happened.

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.800
So if you don't want
negation to happen,

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.270
just put a big NOT gate there.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:49.992
And in this case they
give a crossover gadget.

00:50:49.992 --> 00:50:51.450
In particular
because it's not that

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:56.330
hard to give a crossover gadget,
but it's also not necessary.

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.760
So you could do
crossover explicitly,

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:06.170
but in fact, I just looked
on Wikipedia earlier today.

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.910
We already know that planar
circuit SAT with NAND gates

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:10.900
is hard.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.294
So can we build NAND?

00:51:12.294 --> 00:51:14.960
And so I looked up in Wikipedia,
how you build NAND out of NORs.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.320
And the answer is this.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.790
And that's planar.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.220
So we're done.

00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.790
You take this picture, you plug
it into each of these guys.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:24.520
And you take that
picture and you plug it

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.330
into each of these guys.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.700
Make sure to preserve
planarity all the way through.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.870
It does.

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:34.040
And then from-- I should know
that's you construct NAND out

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:34.540
of NOR.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.820
It's exactly from De Morgan law,
because this is just negation.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:42.596
So cool thing is all
these constructions

00:51:42.596 --> 00:51:43.970
preserve planarity
which means we

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.740
can add to our definition
of planar circuit SAT.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:53.370
All gates are NAND
or all gates are NOR.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:01.620
This is nice because when you're
solving next p set or whatever,

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.470
you can just take
planar circuit SAT,

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.980
if you happen to construct
a NAND gate you're done.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.190
If you happen to construct
an OR gate you're done.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.270
No crossover needed.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:14.950
You'll still need turns,
and maybe a shift,

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.350
and maybe a terminator.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.990
You won't need NOT if
you build NAND or NOR.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:24.250
You'll need a split, but you
don't need a crossover anymore.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.730
This is cool.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.240
As far as I know a new result,
but I mean obviously implicit

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.250
in all of these things.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.750
Yeah.

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:34.900
AUDIENCE: Do you know if there's
any sub-problem, I guess,

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.930
is that where you don't
have universal gates

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:43.060
and you can't be planar
and get it so hard?

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:44.070
So maybe you can--

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.320
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh, interesting.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.861
AUDIENCE: You can
split wires and you

00:52:46.861 --> 00:52:50.542
have a variable that has the
negation of it coming out,

00:52:50.542 --> 00:52:51.625
but that's all you can do.

00:52:51.625 --> 00:52:52.600
No other NOT gates.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.130
ERIK DEMAINE: My guess is
that all such problems are

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.090
polynomially solvable,
but maybe that's something

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:01.965
we could think about.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.280
Certainly plausible
that you don't

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.710
need to be able to construct
all Boolean formulas in order

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:09.800
to be hard.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.380
But my vague sense/experience
playing around

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.260
with weird other
gates, most of them

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.170
are all equivalent to
splits if they're not

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:21.990
universal-- something
like a split.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:24.610
Maybe with some like
five operand operator,

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.080
you could do something cool.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.490
But usually they degenerate
to other split-like things

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:34.090
or clause-like things.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.880
But if you don't have both, you
don't get enough to be hard.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.380
We should prove a
theorem like that,

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:42.530
but I would guess that you
need something like this.

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.910
Now these are not the
only universal gate sets.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:50.170
I think in a moment I will
have a-- if you are curious

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.569
about more of what
universal gate sets are,

00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:54.110
these are usually
called functionally

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.266
complete or functional
completeness.

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:57.640
If you look at
that on Wikipedia,

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.380
this is an excerpt
from Wikipedia,

00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.140
you see NAND and NOR are
the only, among arity two

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.539
operators, so you have
two inputs, one output.

00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:08.080
NAND and NOR are
the only things that

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.630
by themselves are universal.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:13.140
But once you allow two different
gates you can do other things.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:15.740
So these are
particularly interesting.

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.260
This is false I think.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.310
It's called [INAUDIBLE], and
this is called top, it's true.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:26.504
And so these are slightly
unusual ways for me

00:54:26.504 --> 00:54:27.670
to think about writing them.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.960
Here we have, of
course, AND and NOT.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.710
But this is right
implication, which

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.230
is like not the left
thing or the right thing.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:38.710
We talked about
that in the past.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:41.020
That by itself is not
enough, because you can just

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.160
follow implication chains.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.876
But if you also have
false, that is universal.

00:54:45.876 --> 00:54:48.290
So that's kind of funny.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:52.690
And this is XOR I think.

00:54:52.690 --> 00:54:56.430
XOR is the same as saying that
the two things are different.

00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.462
And this is XNOR.

00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.170
So those by themselves
are not universal,

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.461
but if you have some other
kind of one-way implication,

00:55:02.461 --> 00:55:05.890
then that gives you
any logical formulas.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.040
Now, whether these in the planar
version are hard, I don't know.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:13.370
But I know that Ds in the
planar version are hard.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.474
OK, back to Mine Sweeper.

00:55:15.474 --> 00:55:17.640
They drew a picture of how
everything fits together,

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.142
so it's maybe nice to
have the big picture.

00:55:20.142 --> 00:55:22.350
But let's in particular
think about what the decision

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:26.005
question is and make sure--
I mean I claim this is coNP

00:55:26.005 --> 00:55:28.630
and then we're doing unSATs, but
we should actually check that.

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.810
At this point we've just
simulated a circuit.

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:33.490
We haven't thought about what
we're trying to solve overall.

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.920
Now, we want to know whether
we can derive everything.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:41.712
So we compute our formula
and then the output is here.

00:55:41.712 --> 00:55:43.420
And at this point
there's just a terminal

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.030
there saying I don't
know what it is.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:47.805
Different from the
previous proof.

00:55:47.805 --> 00:55:51.040
The previous proof said that
should be one at the end,

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.460
and then you have to figure
out how to fill in the things.

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:56.900
Now we're saying, I
don't know what's there.

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:59.200
Can you figure out what's there?

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.960
And if it's the case
that no matter how

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:06.280
you set the variables
you always get false,

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.320
then you know what
this wire looks like.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.420
You know that it's false.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.260
And in fact, you can
figure out everything.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.635
If you know what
all the XI's are

00:56:13.635 --> 00:56:15.650
you can just run
through the circuit.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:19.200
So you can figure out
the entire diagram.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.070
But in general, just
asking the question,

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.870
can I figure out this square?

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.860
Is there a bomb or not?

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:27.350
In order for there
not to be a bomb,

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.800
you would have to
solve this problem.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:32.690
You need to determine
that no matter

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:36.020
how you set the things
you end up with a zero.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:39.860
Or the adjacent position
it would be the opposite.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.010
So conversely, what I
really care about-- that

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.720
was the wrong direction.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.240
I'm given a circuit
unSAT instance.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.235
I want to turn it into
a Mine Sweeper instance.

00:56:48.235 --> 00:56:55.410
So I do that, and then the
question is-- get this right--

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.960
can you derive whether there
is a bomb in this square?

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.270
Can you determine that there
must be a bomb in this square,

00:57:03.270 --> 00:57:04.130
for example?

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.160
That would be a slightly
cleaner version.

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.090
And that will be true, if and
only if no matter what you do,

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:13.420
there's a bomb in that square.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.680
Which is like saying
no matter what you do,

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.210
this formula comes out to zero.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.230
So any kind of inference
question like that

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:25.550
is going to require you
to solve this problem,

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:27.430
or rather, this
problem can be reduced

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:30.820
to any inference
problem like that.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:35.150
It's easy to get backwards here,
so hope I got it all right.

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.350
And that's coNP completeness.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.257
Reductions look
the same for coNP.

00:57:40.257 --> 00:57:41.840
We just start with
different problems.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:46.870
Cool.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:52.380
So that was Mine Sweeper
and functional completeness.

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.900
I have one more-- well,
sort of two more proofs.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.830
Only one that I will talk
about in detail for Candy Crush

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:04.850
and soon enough, Bejeweled.

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:07.740
But let's think about Candy
Crush is the modern version.

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.510
I'm guessing you've all
played, but in case not,

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:12.260
please don't play.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.830
It's very addictive.

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:16.850
But on the slides
we're allowed to.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:22.540
So you have a grid of
colors, colored candies.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:26.530
And a move in this game
is to take two candies

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.190
and switch their order.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:31.620
I guess in this picture
I did these two.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:34.380
If you switch these two
you get this picture.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:38.270
And the mechanics of the
game, the physics or whatever,

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:40.950
is whenever you have
three or more candies

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:45.300
of the same color in a row
or column, or in a row,

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:47.040
then they disappear.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.455
And anything above them falls.

00:58:48.455 --> 00:58:50.682
So like this red
candy ends up there.

00:58:50.682 --> 00:58:52.640
In this case, there were
no more candies above.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:55.098
In the real game usually there's
always more candies above.

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:59.210
But if we're in a small game
this won't-- if we're in a big

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:00.930
game and looking
at a small window,

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:03.430
we know everything
about what will fall.

00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:06.356
AUDIENCE: Do you need to
make them fall or do they

00:59:06.356 --> 00:59:07.730
automatically fall
once you get--

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:09.313
ERIK DEMAINE: They
automatically fall.

00:59:09.313 --> 00:59:11.700
Yeah, so they are
forced to fall.

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.380
It's all I get to
do is make this move

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.060
and then stuff happens.

00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.050
So I make this move
and then anything

00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:20.329
that-- any three in a
rows or more disappear.

00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:22.120
And then if that makes
more three in a rows

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.800
they will disappear and so on.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.940
And my hands are
off at that point.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.640
Once the chain
reactions are finished--

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.660
not all games work this
way, but Candy Crush

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:31.980
happens to work this way.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.750
Once these things are finished,
then I can do another exchange.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.340
And when I do an exchange
I must make three in a row.

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.895
I can't just swap
these two guys.

00:59:40.895 --> 00:59:41.770
It's not interesting.

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:44.320
AUDIENCE: What if it's like a
T pattern or like non-linear?

00:59:47.342 --> 00:59:48.300
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, OK.

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.800
In this picture
we'll never have Ts.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.360
It will always be three in a
row, and never a four in a row.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.370
With four in a row, magical
striped candies happen

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:57.980
and you don't want to know.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.430
So potentially you can get up to
five in a row with these rows,

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.860
but in these reductions
that won't happen.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.850
So we don't care what
the rules say there.

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:08.560
We're only going to
get three in a rows.

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:11.130
There is a weird
catch in this proof.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:15.530
I'm going to mention two proofs
from 2014, so all very recent.

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.810
I guess the game isn't that old.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:22.170
And in this proof we're going
to assume if-- in general, there

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.400
may be multiple three
in a rows at once.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.090
And the proof is going to assume
that they are resolved bottom

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.890
to top, so you do the
bottom-most one first, things

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:35.170
fall, then you do the next one,
things fall, do the next one,

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.410
things fall.

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:38.100
That's not how the
actual game works.

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:42.510
In the game, they all
disappear simultaneously

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.840
and then stuff falls.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.670
OK, but ignore that
for the moment.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.412
The next proof will
change the model.

01:00:47.412 --> 01:00:49.620
OK, this is a much easier
one to think about and draw

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.720
the pictures.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.310
So in that model, here's
a variable gadget.

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.310
The starting point's the
same, picture top and bottom.

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.170
And the idea is
either you exchange

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.920
these two to make
three, or you exchange

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.550
these two to make three.

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:07.900
And the consequence is either
the right column falls by three

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.560
or the middle column
falls by three.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.930
And that's all you can
do local to this gadget.

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:13.107
So that's easy.

01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:14.440
Things are going to get messier.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.100
OK, so you have this picture,
variable gadget for XI.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.360
Above it I'm going to make
one of these two gadgets.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.887
Actually, both of them,
but one at a time.

01:01:27.887 --> 01:01:29.470
So in fact, it will
actually look kind

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.380
of like this, stacked on
top of the variable which

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.070
is down here.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:33.410
So variables down here.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:38.415
Either the center column falls
or the right column falls.

01:01:38.415 --> 01:01:41.160
Now, the idea is this is
going to eventually connect

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.650
to a clause, and this
variable-- I should

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.220
say this is not for
circuit SAT, this

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.600
is from 3SAT-- regular old 3SAT.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.252
So that variable
appears in a clause

01:01:51.252 --> 01:01:52.960
either in positive
form or negative form.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.160
Positive, use this gadget.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.080
Negative, use this gadget.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.540
So in the positive case,
if this falls by three

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.470
we get this picture, and
then these disappear,

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:06.520
and so this guy falls one more.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.810
And the idea is that's going
to trigger something off

01:02:08.810 --> 01:02:09.380
to the right.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.060
That will be next slide.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.130
That will be the wire gadget.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:18.030
If the center column fell by
three, nothing would happen.

01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:20.680
The purples-- so I
should mention how

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.170
these gadgets are constructed.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:25.890
There's a four color sort
of checkerboard pattern

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.220
in odd rows.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:29.400
It's alternating orange,
green, orange, green.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.540
In even rows it's alternating
red, yellow, red, yellow.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.270
And then in a few places we're
going to put the purple ones,

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:37.130
because purple's best.

01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:40.940
And all the action is going
to be in the purple candies.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.900
These guys are just out
there-- and the real game

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.670
has six colors.

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.920
We're only using five of them.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.204
So cool.

01:02:47.204 --> 01:02:48.620
These guys are
just sort of filler

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.700
to make sure nothing
else happens.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.730
But still things fall vertically
in a nice controlled way.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:00.640
OK, so if these fall
by three, the purples

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.210
don't align so nothing happens.

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.840
In this case, if the
center one falls by three

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.660
we get alignment, and
that falls by one.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.030
So great.

01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:16.430
Also note, these gadgets
stack somewhat nicely.

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:20.170
In that other than this
three gap-- in reality,

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.760
more candies will fill in here.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.790
I drew it this way
so you could see how

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.020
much the columns actually fall.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.490
Remember, this all sort
of happens in one move.

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:32.690
So this falls, these clear,
then this will clear,

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:35.240
and stuff happens.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:35.890
It's annoying.

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:40.100
So, so far everything's
good because each of these

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:44.550
has fallen by one in addition
to the original three.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:49.535
But in this case, this
follows by an extra one,

01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.915
and I think you need to
add an extra candy here.

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:54.450
I'm a little unclear in the
details on how to do that.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:58.540
It's mentioned in the
paper, but without details.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.242
Anyway, in the end we
will have a bunch of these

01:04:01.242 --> 01:04:02.450
stacked on top of each other.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:05.085
Each time the variable
occurs in various clauses

01:04:05.085 --> 01:04:06.460
we're going to
have some positive

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.800
and some negative ones.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:11.190
And we want the same variable
trigger-- ah, that's right.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:14.060
There will be-- well, OK.

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:14.560
Yeah.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:17.270
I'm going to leave it like that.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:22.270
So at this point we have
a purple thing triggering

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.280
something to the right.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.780
So now I'm going to show
you how that part works.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.870
This is the wire.

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:27.444
So the wire itself is like this.

01:04:27.444 --> 01:04:29.610
And the idea is that when
there's a purple one here,

01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.750
a chain reaction happens.

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.160
And it happens in this way.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.850
As soon as there's a purple
candy here, this clears,

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.900
which makes these
two fall by one,

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.800
which clears that, which
makes this fall by one,

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.790
and triggers the next thing.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:51.330
This one, some stacking happens.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.260
Let's see.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:56.910
So overall, I think this one
is actually better behaved.

01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:00.340
This falls by one
here and then two.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.870
So overall these
columns fell by two.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.500
This column has
fallen so far by one,

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.349
but it's about to
fall by a second one,

01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:09.140
because this will always
trigger something.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.700
And so these do stack
nicely, because you always

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.430
clear exactly two columns.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:16.490
The worry is that the gadget
above it will be skewed.

01:05:19.579 --> 01:05:21.120
Let me give you one
more gadget, then

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.370
I'll tell you-- no,
actually, I think

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.450
at this point I should tell
you how things fit together,

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:29.060
which is this picture.

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:41.765
So we have variables down
here in the lower left.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.105
Then let's worry about
one thing at a time.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:57.485
These are the
connection gadgets.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.390
I don't think I
told you their name.

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:06.380
But they are your
connector gadgets.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.350
This is making a 90 degree turn.

01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:10.070
From the falling
action we're going

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.710
to get a purple in a
particular position, which

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.755
causes rightward motion.

01:06:14.755 --> 01:06:21.760
And then the wires that you
saw basically go in some angle

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.470
off to the right.

01:06:27.924 --> 01:06:29.590
I want these all to
be non-intersecting.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:36.830
And there's sort of two of them.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:41.490
There's going to be the true
case and the false case.

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:44.370
And then way over
here somewhere,

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:51.930
we're going to have a clause
where these wires all attach.

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:53.770
And then above it
we're going to have

01:06:53.770 --> 01:07:01.540
a reward where you get tons
of points, and et cetera.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:05.155
So let me tell you
what happens next.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.500
It's a fun way to
draw the picture.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:14.420
So above these we'll have
some other connections.

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:19.480
I should not do it
in the same pattern.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.930
I should not do it like that.

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:21.590
Yeah, sure.

01:07:21.590 --> 01:07:23.582
Connection, connection.

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:31.910
OK, again, diagonal lines.

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:33.270
Great.

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:34.080
Not quite diagonal.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.030
It's an angle.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:36.572
We have a clause.

01:07:36.572 --> 01:07:37.530
Everything connects up.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:40.730
Above the clause is a reward.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:51.360
And then I move boards,
and that's the picture.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.280
And above the
variables, we just keep

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.510
adding more connections
connected to some clauses.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:08:01.470
And there's not just three
variables, of course.

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:04.910
There's n variables down here,
and we use some, three of them,

01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:06.530
and then connect
that off to a clause.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:10.360
And they're all just stacked--
I happen to draw the clauses

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.360
one on top of the other.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.100
That shouldn't happen.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.980
So there's some
extra space here.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.240
This is more over to the right.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.374
So that none of them will
interact with each other.

01:08:19.374 --> 01:08:20.040
That's the goal.

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:29.689
Except there's some issues,
like notice this wire gadget,

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.979
notice dual rail logic.

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:34.825
Either this is active
or this is active.

01:08:34.825 --> 01:08:36.200
And we hope that
not both of them

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.325
are active, although that
can actually happen here.

01:08:38.325 --> 01:08:40.350
I'll get to that.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:44.609
So when this activates,
notice this goes

01:08:44.609 --> 01:08:47.300
on top of a variable gadget.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.310
Now, a wire by itself
is kind of good.

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:52.410
We've seen it removes two
things from every spot.

01:08:52.410 --> 01:08:56.500
So things don't shift too much.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.149
And furthermore, we should
hope that either this activates

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:01.060
or this activates.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.850
So this will shift by
a consistent amount

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:04.670
in either case.

01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:10.109
But the wire may get messed up
because the variable actually

01:09:10.109 --> 01:09:13.260
removes three things
from one of the columns.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:21.130
So we need a better wire
gadget, which looks like this.

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.420
This is a super wire gadget.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.520
It's really cool.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.399
It works no matter how
you use it, kind of.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.670
So this is what it
looks like in general.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:31.330
And this is regular use.

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:34.529
So as before, if
we trigger this,

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:38.760
then this triggers, and this guy
falls by one, just like before.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.450
But now also, if there's
a variable down here

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.310
and this column falls
by three-- or sorry.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.500
If this column falls by
three, so the same picture,

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:52.195
the things fell by three,
still everything works out.

01:09:52.195 --> 01:09:54.390
These two fall.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.690
These two fall but they
meet a different dude.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:00.380
But there were a bunch of guys
to meet up with, so it's fine.

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.620
And I clearly drew the
output in the wrong place.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.561
The output should
be here I think.

01:10:07.561 --> 01:10:08.060
Yeah.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.600
So in this picture
the output was here,

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.120
also it shifted by one.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.550
In this picture the output
is here, not up there.

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:18.340
So in both cases it triggers.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.840
And finally if the middle
column fell by three

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.840
before this gadget
activated, then this,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.360
again, triggers this time
with this guy being different.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.360
Instead of this one matching,
this one's matching.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.220
That still triggers these guys
and this is still the output.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:38.374
So this is a
different wire gadget

01:10:38.374 --> 01:10:40.040
that works in three
different scenarios,

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.050
depending on what
happened below it.

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.290
So that's good news.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:47.590
That lets us do
this type of wire.

01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:50.160
And in general, we're going
to have a chain reaction all

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.090
the way down here until we
get to the clause from bottom

01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:57.020
to top.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.750
And this we'll resolve.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.996
And let me show you the clause.

01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:06.490
I think details are
a little bit messy.

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:10.340
There's a little
locking mechanism here.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.980
But basically the idea is
all of these things come

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.570
in, x1, x1 bar, x2, x2 bar.

01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:20.390
All of the half
wires or semi-wires.

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:24.270
And so we expect one
of these to activate.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:27.830
Maybe you don't do that,
but that would be weird,

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:30.190
and you won't end up
satisfying the clause.

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:36.310
So if this one activates, then
these align, and you're happy.

01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:38.902
In general, if you can
get this column to fall,

01:11:38.902 --> 01:11:41.110
you're going to be happy,
because above this thing is

01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:42.090
this reward gadget.

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:45.940
And if this column falls by
one, you get a million points.

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:49.270
And every clause has its own
reward of a million points,

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:53.010
and million here is like
n squared or something.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.634
So you really want to get these.

01:11:54.634 --> 01:11:56.800
And the only way to do it
is to satisfy the clauses.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.330
The only way to
get all the point

01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:01.010
is satisfy all the clauses.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:05.030
Now, the goal in this
game, I didn't mention,

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:07.800
is to maximize the number
of points you can get

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.520
for a given number of moves.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.640
Usually in Candy Crush you
have a limited number of moves.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.350
So the idea is you're just going
to have enough moves to set

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.130
each of the variables right.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.250
If you end up setting one
of the wires directly--

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:22.490
you can trigger any wire
by doing a little flip.

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:24.830
You can say I'll
trigger this one wire.

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:27.470
But that will satisfy,
at most, one clause.

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:28.930
Whereas if you do
it on a variable,

01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:30.905
you're going to satisfy
a bunch of clauses,

01:12:30.905 --> 01:12:33.760
and that's clearly better.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.440
So that's a bit of an
argument you need to make.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.120
It doesn't help enough.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.860
You could even set this wire
and this wire, an xy or an x bar

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.360
wire.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.280
But the claim is
that will never buy

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.140
you as much as setting
an entire variable,

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.550
and here's the reason why.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:59.012
I drew this picture
simply to say

01:12:59.012 --> 01:13:01.470
for every clause we're going
to have this picture connected

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:02.680
to some variables.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.950
In fact, every time
you have a clause,

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:08.110
you make a million
copies of the clause.

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:10.070
And million is like n.

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:12.670
So that it's really
worth setting the var--

01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:15.654
every variable appears
in millions of clauses.

01:13:15.654 --> 01:13:17.320
So you really want
to set the variables.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.480
If you just satisfy
one measly clause

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.470
and get one measly million
points, it's not worth it.

01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:25.960
But if you can get a million
times a million points, whoa,

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:29.430
a trillion points.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:31.840
So that's why you should
only set variables, not

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.731
set wires directly.

01:13:33.731 --> 01:13:34.230
OK.

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:40.010
I think I have roughly
covered this proof, except I

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.770
didn't go up the chain.

01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:46.044
Here, setting x1 bar doesn't
do much except setting one

01:13:46.044 --> 01:13:48.460
or the other of these ends up
shifting all of these things

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.150
by one, which ends of
clearing this, which shifts

01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:53.750
all of these columns by one.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:56.370
And basically things look
really spread out here,

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:58.180
but as you work
your way up, they're

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:00.110
coming more and
more into alignment.

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:03.630
The idea is as long as things
resolve from bottom to top,

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:11.215
you-- it doesn't-- then first
you figure out whether x1

01:14:11.215 --> 01:14:12.090
satisfies the clause.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:14.590
If it doesn't, it
sets things up for x2.

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.370
And then maybe x2
satisfies the clause.

01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:18.260
If it doesn't, it sets
things up for x3 here.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.810
They're spread out even more.

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:22.360
But by the time you've
done these things below,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.020
that thing will be ready.

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:30.080
So that was the first proof.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.660
The second proof--
sorry, before interlude.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.570
Candy Crush is based
on a variety of games.

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:40.590
Most famous is Bejeweled,
but there is a long history

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:44.010
of-- even Tetris is in there.

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:46.610
There's a long history
of match three games.

01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:48.600
And pretty much all of
these are NP-complete.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.266
I don't know the
details of all of them,

01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:54.300
but there's this paper by three
authors a little bit later

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.390
in the year that proves
basically all of these games

01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.692
are NP-complete, even when
you're not given a move limit.

01:15:00.692 --> 01:15:01.650
So this is interesting.

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:03.970
And Bejeweled, the goal is
just to maximize your score.

01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:06.386
You don't necessarily have a
limit on the number of moves,

01:15:06.386 --> 01:15:08.530
unlike Candy Crush.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:11.890
And also in some levels
candy Crush is like that.

01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:14.902
So here it was very crucial
that we only had enough moves

01:15:14.902 --> 01:15:16.110
to trigger all the variables.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:18.852
We didn't want to be
able to do other things.

01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:20.560
So here's a different
proof, and I'm just

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.737
going to give the high
level picture, basically.

01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.570
This is cool, because
even just figuring out

01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:31.400
whether you get this one
gem, this one candy is hard.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.660
In order to do so,
you have to line up

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.070
all of these things
for each clause.

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:40.850
And here's the reduction
from exactly one of 3SAT.

01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:43.480
So only if exactly
one of the variables

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.659
get set correctly does this
shift to the right level,

01:15:46.659 --> 01:15:49.200
and only when all of these are
shifted to the right level can

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.107
you trigger this wire to go all
the way here and get that guy.

01:15:52.107 --> 01:15:53.690
And it's the only
way to get that guy.

01:15:53.690 --> 01:15:54.780
You can't do it directly.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:57.250
It can only be triggered
from the left-hand side.

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:58.976
And there's also a
sequencer over here,

01:15:58.976 --> 01:16:00.350
which forces all
of the variables

01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:03.770
to get set before this happens.

01:16:03.770 --> 01:16:06.720
So it's a little tricky,
because you don't want it to be,

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:09.490
you could say half of them,
and then trigger this,

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.220
and then things happen to
align in a cheating way.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.270
The details are complicated,
but they actually

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.290
implemented their reduction.

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:19.870
So this is it.

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:25.290
Now, as it says here, there are
4,000 rows above and 2,000 rows

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:25.790
below.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.470
So it's a large construction.

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.560
And this is for this formula.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.410
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:37.440
I can clean it up a little
bit, remove the-- again,

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.710
there's a background
checkerboard pattern here.

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:44.730
So if I generate instance then
things are little bit cleaner.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.200
And I think highlighted in red
are the moves you can make.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.960
So here's the first variable.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.790
You could either-- let's
do the simple one first--

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:56.750
move this guy with this one, and
then trigger, trigger, trigger.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:59.210
All this happens without
you able to do anything.

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.670
And that will move
some stuff up top.

01:17:02.670 --> 01:17:10.460
Or we can move this one
here, and then this is fun.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.480
The variable goes
down and it just

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.580
keeps-- it goes down, basically,
to where the x1 bar is,

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.430
down here, and then it triggers
that guy, and maybe that guy

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.310
also.

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:24.563
And that one.

01:17:24.563 --> 01:17:25.469
And--

01:17:25.469 --> 01:17:28.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:30.970
Just lots of stuff happens.

01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:32.820
Anyway, eventually
we'll get down to x2

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.640
and we'll be able to set
it one way or the other.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.942
So the details are obviously
a little bit complicated,

01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:39.400
but clearly they've
been explicitly

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.608
worked out because they can
even play the game, which

01:17:41.608 --> 01:17:44.030
is pretty awesome.

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:46.490
Anyway, and they also
have the greatest URL,

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.142
candycrush.isnphard.com.

01:17:48.142 --> 01:17:53.410
We should try to get other
things not as nphard.com.

01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:55.120
That is Candy
Crush and Bejeweled

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.117
and all of its
friends are NP hard.

01:17:59.117 --> 01:18:00.700
That's it, unless
there are questions.

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:07.950
So we've just started to
scratch the surface on the idea

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.520
that planar graphs are
hard, and next class we'll

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.950
see planar versions of
3SAT and one and 3SAT.

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:16.780
If we weren't using here, this
is using a non-planar thing.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.490
So that helps with a lot
of proofs, especially

01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:22.320
ones that happen in the plane.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.340
So we've seen it with
planar circuit SAT.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.440
But next we'll do planar and
3SAT, planar one and 3SAT,

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440
planar not all equal SAT,
those kinds of things.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.600
And again, be able to avoid
crossovers, which is nice.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.150
Cool.
