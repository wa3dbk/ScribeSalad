00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:26.740
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.244
Today we go back to fun with
hardness proofs in games.

00:00:31.244 --> 00:00:33.660
It's been a while since we've
done many games and puzzles.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.710
So today we're
going to talk mostly

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.480
about this one paper, which
has a ton of results in it,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.590
by Giovanni Viglietta.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.000
"Gaming's a hard job, but
someone has to do it!"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180
What's particularly
cool about this paper

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.240
is it shows a bunch
of metatheorems,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.860
which you can think of as
general techniques for proving

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.600
hardness.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.460
And I'm going to talk
about essentially

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.460
two main metatheorems,
although there'll

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.110
be a few different versions--
one for NP-hardness

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.640
and one for PSPACE-hardness.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.930
And this'll be our first
real PSPACE-hardness

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.900
proof other than lecture one.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.360
And the proofs here
aren't very hard,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.970
and the fun part is applying
them to various games.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.115
And they apply to a
lot of different games.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.015
So metatheorem we're using
here in a somewhat vague sense.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.230
This won't be a formal
theorem, because it's

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.740
hard to state all
of the assumptions

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.190
you need about your game.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.660
But it's sort of-- think of
it as a roughly true theorem.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.910
We're not going to state all
the assumptions you need.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.130
But the general setup
for metatheorem one

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.510
is that you have a player-- or
the paper calls it an avatar,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.690
you know, a little
guy walking around.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.205
You're traversing
a 2D environment.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.780
So you're not allowed
to have crossovers.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.115
From a given start location.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.729
And given that setup, if you
have two features in your game,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.610
one is called
location traversal,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.950
and the other is called
single-use paths.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.970
Then your game is NP-hard.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
That's the metatheorem.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.440
So location traversal
means that there

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.300
are some locations on the board
that you have to visit in order

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.320
to win the level.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.940
So there's no target location.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.777
Your goal is to visit
all of the locations.

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:41.360
Once you do that,
potentially you win.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.026
Or maybe there is
also a target location

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.465
you have to get to at the end.

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:44.965
Question?

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:46.839
AUDIENCE: Does planar
mean you're on a plane,

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.134
or like a planar graph
kind of environment?

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.050
PROFESSOR: Either way.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.690
You could be sort of in a grid.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.850
You could be in a planar graph.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.930
It's vague.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.060
But the goal is
two-dimensional, so the point

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.260
is we don't need crossovers
for this reduction.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.400
So location traversal, you have
to visit certain locations.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.382
Single-use paths, you
can only use them once.

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:11.590
They're traversable, but
once you traverse them once,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.020
they're no longer traversable.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.770
So from this, you
can get NP-hardness.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.690
Any guesses how?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.880
What should I reduce from?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.060
AUDIENCE: Hamiltonian.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.460
PROFESSOR: Hamiltonicity, yup.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.357
AUDIENCE: All paths
are single-use?

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:28.940
PROFESSOR: No.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.915
Not all paths are single-use,
although it will work here.

00:03:32.915 --> 00:03:35.040
The idea is that you mark
some paths as single-use,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.510
others not.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.620
So reduction from planar,
let's say, max degree three.

00:03:49.727 --> 00:03:50.310
Hamiltonicity.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.450
And so the idea is whenever I
have a vertex in my Hamiltonian

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680
graph, I'm going to turn
that into a location that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.030
must be traversed, because we
want to visit all the vertices.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.770
So there you go.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.340
That's where to put them.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.329
And whenever I have an edge,
I'm going to convert that

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.630
into a single-use path.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.020
And because I'm maximum degree
three and each of these edges

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.010
is single-use, once I
use one of the edges

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.980
and it disappears, and
then I use another edge,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.060
and I get the treat
that was in that node,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.054
and then I use another
edge and that disappears,

00:04:42.054 --> 00:04:44.220
it's a really bad idea for
me to use the third edge,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.844
because then I'm
trapped there forever.

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:49.000
So I would have had to have
already solved the puzzle.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.910
I would have had to already
get all of the vertices

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.050
before going here.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.550
So there was no reason
to traverse that edge.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.890
Therefore, you're effectively
doing a Hamiltonian path

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.990
from the given start
position, which

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.190
we know how to reduce
from Hamiltonian cycle.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.810
And because we can do planar
graphs, this is planar setup,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.180
max degree three
is critical for not

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.700
being able to revisit a vertex.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.200
OK?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.140
We've seen a very similar
proof to this back

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.900
in the Hamiltonicity lecture,
but there, the assumption

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.930
was that there was a time
limit, plus collectibles,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.950
plus location traversal.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.680
This is another way to do
the same kind of proof.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.340
And it makes it a little
easier to be convinced

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.457
that your proofs work perfectly,
because with time limits,

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:33.790
you're very sensitive to timing.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.350
Every edge has to be
exactly the same length.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.810
Here we're adding
single-use paths

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.360
instead of that to force
you to finish the level.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.190
The claim is also it makes
the puzzles more fun.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.450
So that's, of course,
up to interpretation.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.870
But at the very least,
using this proof,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.790
we can get a whole bunch more
games that we haven't seen.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.840
So one of them is Boulder Dash.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.150
How many people have played
Boulder Dash, let's say?

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.650
Yeah.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.590
Only-- not very many.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.150
I used to play this in
C64 days, Commodore 64.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.090
But you are walking
around these boulders.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.310
You can hold them up, but as
soon as you let go, they fall.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:12.900
And if they fall
on you, you die.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.490
So you don't want
that to happen.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.520
And the goal is to collect
all the diamonds, roughly,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.570
and then to get it
to a target location.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.540
There's some weird physics
about how boulders fall.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.009
But basically, here
are the two gadgets.

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.050
Location traversal, you
just put a diamond there,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.860
and then you have to get it.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.320
And then this is
a single-use path.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.280
The idea is you can
come from either side,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.510
push this out of the way.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.110
The boulder is then in the way.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.440
So if you then tried
to traverse it,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.700
you can't turn around the
corner, so you get stuck.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.200
OK.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.000
So once you have
those two gadgets,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.470
you get an NP-hardness proof.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.760
So Boulder Dash is NP-hard.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.534
Lode Runner.

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:54.200
How many people have
played Lode Runner?

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.210
A few more.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.660
I used to play
these in, I think,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.760
Apple IIe days or something.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.490
Well, originally C64 again.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.030
So you have this guy who walks
around, has to collect all

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.734
the parts again, these things.

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:12.150
And the fun thing about Lode
Runner is you can dig a hole,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.410
and then the monsters fall in.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.800
They'll drop their
diamond if they have one.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.540
And they might be able
to climb back out.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.670
Eventually, that
square will refill.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.170
So it's a timed thing.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.460
And so based on that
kind of physics,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.800
we can build the
two gadgets again.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.280
You put gold wherever you
want to make the thing.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.786
And this is a
single-traversal gadget.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.410
This is after it's
been traversed once.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.069
You get stuck in the hole.

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.610
But if there's a monster there,
you can actually stand on it,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.180
dig the hole, let the guy fall.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.300
This will regenerate.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.530
This guy's stuck, but now you
cannot traverse this thing.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.690
There's no jumping in this game.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.420
You can't jump over there.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.460
You have to get to the
other side by falling.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.070
And that's only possible in
the initial configuration.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.921
So Lode Runner's NP-hard.

00:07:58.921 --> 00:07:59.420
Questions?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:02.910
Cool.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.050
Also, Legend of Zelda II,
Adventures of Link is NP-hard.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.061
On the one hand, we
have single-use paths

00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:13.060
illustrated on the left.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.070
And location traversal
we're going to do by keys.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.250
If you get enough keys,
you can open enough doors.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.625
At the end of the
puzzle, there's

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.782
going to be a whole
bunch of doors.

00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:25.500
Let me get this one going again.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.235
For single-traversal
paths, there

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.080
are actually these
bridges that disappear

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.970
after you traverse them.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.720
So you can do some
amount of jumping,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.964
but if you make it
really long, you

00:08:34.964 --> 00:08:38.520
will be prevented from
re-traversing that path.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.230
So we're going to put
a key at each vertex.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.549
And then at some
finishing location,

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.880
we'll have end doors,
one for each vertex.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.910
And that should do Zelda II.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.410
OK.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.560
So that is metatheorem one.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.190
I want to tell you
about a slight variation

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.110
on this metatheorem, and then
another result based on it.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.550
So metatheorem two is
same kind of setup.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.421
So slightly different.

00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:50.920
Yeah.

00:09:53.902 --> 00:09:55.420
I'll keep a little
bit of suspense

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.280
about why we care about this.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.700
Instead of single-use
paths, suppose

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.486
that you could
build tokens, which

00:10:04.486 --> 00:10:05.610
are things you can pick up.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.390
And for this
reduction, let's say

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.710
you can only pick up one at a
time, though it won't matter.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.690
And toll roads, where you have
to pay with a token in order

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.410
to traverse the edge,
this essentially

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.590
can be used to simulate
a single-use path,

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.710
but it's a slightly different
perspective in that you can

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.625
visit an edge if
you-- well, what

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.250
we're going to imagine doing is
putting tokens at the vertices,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.022
but just one at each vertex.

00:10:30.022 --> 00:10:31.730
When you pick up that
token, you can then

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.710
traverse one of
the incident edges.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.190
So again, every edge
will become a toll road.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.500
And every vertex will
become a location traversal

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.170
point that has to be traversed.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.930
And it will have one token.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.870
And so you can use this
same kind of proof.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.390
It's just a
different perspective

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.900
on the same kind of thing.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.830
And we can use this to prove
that Pac-Man is NP-hard.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:01.840
This is the motivation.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.060
So again, you have to get
all the dots in Pac-Man.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.590
So you, in particular,
have to get that one.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.680
When you get that one, this
edge becomes traversable.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.370
So this is a somewhat
generalized version of Tetris.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.980
You have lots of houses for
the ghosts, lots of ghosts,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.210
obviously.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.210
The algorithms that the ghosts
follow doesn't matter too much.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.020
The only constraint is that
ghosts change direction

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.670
if and only if
the state changes,

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.280
like you turn them into--
I forget the names of all

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.030
the modes-- but you turn
them into the blue mode

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.820
or they turn back, then
they will switch direction

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.699
in their tunnel.

00:11:37.699 --> 00:11:39.240
And that is the only
setting in which

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.350
ghosts will reverse direction,
double-back on themselves.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.860
They never
double-back otherwise.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.690
And given that setup, if we
make these edges really long,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.750
we can make sure that the ghosts
always stay within their edge,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.800
because you're basically
alternating between switching

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.420
the state, turning the
directions of the ghosts,

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.010
traversing an edge, and then
doing it again and again,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.382
so that the ghosts always
sort of go back and forth.

00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:04.340
If you happen to capture
one, it doesn't really

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.048
change its location
much, because it just

00:12:06.048 --> 00:12:07.710
goes back to the house.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.730
But you obviously need one
of these in your possession.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.190
You end up using
the token right away

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.200
to traverse one of
the incident edges,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.180
so you can actually get across.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.210
But it's long enough, so that
by the time you cross over,

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.520
the ghosts have reset.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.090
So that is metatheorem
two applied to Pac-Man,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.330
in case you were wondering.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.380
This is, I think,
quite clever, to get

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.610
these things to work out.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.970
OK.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.410
NP-hardness, we're used to that.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.250
The next metatheorems are
about PSPACE-hardness.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.070
And before I get there,
I need to tell you

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.220
a little bit about some
basic PSPACE-hard problems.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:53.580
Like, we have SAT and
Hamiltonicity for NP-hardness.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.820
For PSPACE-hardness, there are
a couple of natural problems.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.330
First, let me remind
you, because it

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.110
was lecture one that
I defined PSPACE,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.665
these are all problems
solvable in polynomial space.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.050
And so we're measuring
space instead of time.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.690
This is contained
in exponential time,

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.650
because there are, at most,
exponentially many states

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.600
of a polynomial space machine.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.100
And it contains NP.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.140
In particular,
every NP problem can

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.780
be simulated on
a PSPACE computer

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.080
just by trying all possible
options for the guests,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.640
but backtracking
and throwing away

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.217
the information from
the other guests' paths,

00:13:43.217 --> 00:13:45.300
and just keeping one bit
of state, which is, did I

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.070
find a yes solution yet?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.610
So you can turn any NP
machine into a PSPACE machine.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.190
So it's somewhere in between.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.720
The other fun fact
is that it equals

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.485
non-deterministic
polynomial space.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.680
So non-deterministic
in the sense of NP.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.185
If you add guessing to a PSPACE
machine, that doesn't help you.

00:14:08.185 --> 00:14:11.310
You can always simulate it
with a deterministic machine,

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.610
at most, blowing up
the space by a square.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.870
So if you had SSPACE before,
you have S squared space after.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.080
Our polynomials are
closed under squaring.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.770
So this is especially useful
for showing that a lot of games

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.868
are in PSPACE.

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.326
It's a lot easier,
usually, to give

00:14:29.326 --> 00:14:32.140
a non-deterministic
polynomial space algorithm.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.660
You have the freedom to
guess whenever you like, just

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.910
like with proving
containment in NP.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.950
And if you prove
containment in NP space,

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.860
you are also proving
containment in PSPACE.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.526
This is called Savage's theorem.

00:14:44.526 --> 00:14:45.320
OK.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.150
So that was just some
recall from lecture one.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.100
And now let's talk
about some sort of base

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.790
problems,
PSPACE-complete problems

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.220
that we can reduce from.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:13.140
I would say the most
obvious one is to simulate

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.595
a polynomial space algorithm.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.180
You can relax it
slightly to say,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:29.360
simulate a linear space
algorithm or a Turing machine,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.270
if you prefer that.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.280
Of course, you are
PSPACE-complete if you

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.710
can simulate all algorithms
that run in polynomial space.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.630
And there are some proofs
that work that way.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.910
It takes some simple
model of a computer,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.200
like a Turing
machine, typically.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.601
Like your reading and
writing cells on a tape.

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:46.100
And you're doing
whatever you can do

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.450
in that linear amount of space.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.590
And just simulate those
transitions one at a time.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.470
But it's usually pretty
tedious to do that.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.800
I don't think we will
see any proofs directly

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.550
of simulating a Turing machine.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:06.770
Usually simpler way to go
is a problem called Q SAT.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.100
It's actually
usually called QBF,

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.500
and sometimes called TQBF,
and occasionally called Q SAT.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.780
But I'm growing
on the name Q SAT,

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.967
because we can specify things.

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:20.800
It's consistent with
our naming terminology.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.550
We can say Q 3SAT, and
we can say Q 1-in-3SAT,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.680
and we can say planar Q SAT.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.870
Whereas QBF, usually people
mean Q 3SAT, I guess.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.550
But this is a little more
explicit what kind of SAT

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.870
we want.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.700
So we're adding the letter
Q, which is Quantified.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:43.900
So the general problem is,
given a fully quantified Boolean

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:58.710
formula, you want to
decide, is it true?

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:09.349
That's the T in TQBF,
if you prefer that term.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.940
So for example, here is
a quantified formula.

00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:25.710
It took me a little
thinking to come up

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.980
with one that is actually true
and in not a quite trivial way.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.536
This is a 2SAT formula.

00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:34.160
And so in particular,
you can read this

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.350
as x implies y, and y implies x.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.970
And we're saying
for every x, there

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.914
is a y, such that
this is satisfied.

00:17:42.914 --> 00:17:43.580
And that's true.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.589
Namely, y equals x would
be the correct choice.

00:17:47.589 --> 00:17:49.630
But it's not totally
obvious, given that formula,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.254
that it's true.

00:17:50.254 --> 00:17:52.310
And in general, given
such a formula-- probably

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.950
not with 2SAT in here,
but with 3SAT formula--

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.760
it's going to be
PSPACE-complete.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.520
To contrast with SAT,
essentially, there

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.610
are a bunch of There
Exists at the beginning.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.530
With Q SAT, you can have For
Alls in addition to Exists.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.510
That's what we're changing.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.090
And we can simplify
things a little bit.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:24.600
We can assume a
prenex form, which

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.760
just means that all
the quantifiers are

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.510
in the beginning, and then
we have a 3SAT formula,

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.440
or whatever.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.310
And we can assume that
the quantifiers alternate

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:44.503
between For All and There Exists
just by adding in extra dummies

00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:46.502
if we happen to use a
bunch of For Alls in a row

00:18:46.502 --> 00:18:48.001
or a bunch of There
Exists in a row.

00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.850
But really, the hard case is
when you have lots of both,

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.750
and they are interwoven.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.160
So it's not enough
to look at formulas

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.847
that have a bunch of For Alls
and then a bunch of Exists.

00:18:57.847 --> 00:18:59.430
You have to think
about the case where

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.388
there are lots of
alternations between the two.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.522
We'll talk more about that when
we get to two-player games,

00:19:06.522 --> 00:19:08.450
because that relates
to two-player games.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.110
But for now, we're going to
stick to one-player games.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.690
And this is just something
we need to simulate

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.770
by our single player.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.470
So now the question is, what
forms can this formula take?

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.430
Because we have lots of forms
of SAT that we know are hard.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.080
And pretty much all of them
remain hard in this setting

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.350
as well, when you add
in the quantifiers.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.790
And in fact, there is a
Schaefer-style dichotomy

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:50.150
theorem, like we
had with SAT and NP.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.150
And basically,
this quantified SAT

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.810
is polynomial if and only if
the types of clauses you allow

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.340
are all Horn clauses, or
all dual-Horn clauses,

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:11.660
or all 2SAT clauses, or a system
of linear equalities mod 2 X

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.060
or and x nor
quality constraints.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.630
Those could all
be solved before.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.390
They can still be solved in
this setting in polynomial time,

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.300
even with alternating
quantifiers.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.910
So that's cool.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.810
However, it is no
longer polynomial time

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:30.420
if your clauses are satisfied
when you set the variables all

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.040
true or all false.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.380
Because we have these For All
quantifiers now, being all true

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.510
is not the panacea
that it was before.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.500
So that's one case.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.150
And otherwise, you
are PSPACE-complete.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.140
All other versions of SAT
are PSPACE-complete-- sorry,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.430
of Q SAT.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.430
So it's almost the same
as the Schaefer theorem,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.830
but there's one
case that differs.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.230
It's hard where
it wasn't before.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:07.490
So that's cool for general,
from a formula perspective.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.030
But we, of course,
typically care

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.720
about planar bipartite graphs
expressing those clauses

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.150
and their variables.

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:19.030
And good news is
everything works as before.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:28.850
So planar Q SAT and planar
1-in-3 Q SAT are hard.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.110
Planar not all equal.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.890
Q SAT is also going to be
easy like it was before.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:41.010
But planar Q SAT, we can use
the usual crossover gadget.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.820
What that crossover
gadget does, it

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.370
forces some variables
to be the same,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.100
but it also creates
new variables.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.240
And those variables
need to be quantified.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.590
All you need to do to
simulate our old proof

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.120
is put a whole bunch of
existential quantifiers

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.759
at the end of the
quantifier list.

00:21:55.759 --> 00:21:57.300
So for every new
variable you create,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.510
you put There Exists at the
end for those variables.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:02.310
And we know those
variables are forced

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:08.010
to be equal to other copies of
variables that are given to us.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:12.390
And so it stimulates the
old planar SAT proof,

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.750
but in a quantified setting.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.700
And that was actually
done by Lichtenstein

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.780
in the original
planar SAT paper.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.060
It also talked
about planar Q SAT.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.980
And then once you have
this problem is hard,

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.560
the same reaction we had for
1-in-3 Q SAT also just works.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.580
So with the same idea.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.400
So there are some base problems.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.730
Now we can do so reductions.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:41.470
First we'll prove a theorem.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.190
And then we'll apply
that metatheorem

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.730
to a bunch of different games.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.455
One-player games.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:08.710
So for next metatheorem, we're
going to have a similar setup.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.910
We're traversing a
planar environment.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.330
But this time we are
given a start location

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.110
and a destination.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.540
Because we're no longer going
to have the location traversal

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.970
goal, we need to add
some kind of goal.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.970
Otherwise, you've solved
the game by starting.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:39.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.530
So it's a path traversal.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:48.680
Get from A to B. And
what we're going to need

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:54.400
is a door plus a pressure plate.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:06.990
So the idea is that there
is an obstacle, a door,

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.600
which is either open or closed.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.140
And there's a
pressure plate, where

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:16.740
if you step on a pressure
plate marked open--

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.230
so you're walking
along here, you

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.945
step on this square,
that will open this door

00:24:20.945 --> 00:24:23.050
and make it traversable.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.880
As you go across it, you're
forced to open the door.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.670
And there's going to be another
pressure plate marked closed,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.600
which, as you traverse it,
you step on that plate,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.550
it forces the door to close.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.360
So in order to get to
the other side here,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.382
usually this is in
some kind of tunnel.

00:24:40.382 --> 00:24:42.340
So in order to get from
this side to this side,

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.130
you must close this door.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.480
And we have more than one.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.715
So there are many such doors.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.420
I'll say A, B, C.
And this is going

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.230
to say Open A. This is
going to say Close B.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:59.490
And we can furthermore
assume that there's exactly

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:04.536
one open and exactly
one close for each door.

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:05.960
OK?

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.400
So maybe I should
have written A here.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.749
So this is the
complete story for A.

00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:13.290
And there's a similar open and
close for B, an open and close

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.380
for C. And otherwise,
you can just walk around.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.240
And your goal is to
get to destinations.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.570
Sounds pretty simple.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.590
And this is a very
powerful metatheorem.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.260
This is PSPACE-complete.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.130
This applies to a lot of games.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:35.670
But before I get to what
games it applies to,

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.720
let's prove that this is indeed
PSPACE-complete by a reduction

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.270
from Q 3SAT.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.230
We won't even need planar here.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.730
We won't need planar,
because we can

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.920
open doors kind of remotely.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.690
When I step on this button,
which could be far, far away,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.920
I open this door.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.200
So effectively, the connections
between variables and clauses

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.780
can be crossing.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.280
There's no restriction
on that here.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.390
So you're going to see a few
different proofs like this.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.600
We'll see others
in future lectures.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.170
But this is a typical prototype
for how to reduce from Q3SAT.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.670
You have your start location,
you have your finish location.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.580
Your goal is to
traverse this thing.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.300
It's sort of like a circuit.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.180
And then you have these blocks
which represent quantifiers.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.740
We'll talk about
those in a moment.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.600
In the end, you exit here.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.330
And you have to satisfy
this formula in order

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.390
to get through.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:54.710
If you get through, then you are
able to enter this quantifier

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.980
gadget.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.930
And these are kind of
in a nested structure.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.555
You can think of this
quantifier gadget

00:26:59.555 --> 00:27:02.780
as calling this one by
traversing this path.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.700
You're recursively calling
the rest of the formula.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.450
And then this is sort
of the return value.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.190
Yes, I did it.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.580
I succeeded, I got a yes.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.700
So for the existential
quantifier,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.205
what this is essentially
doing is, say, OK, I

00:27:16.205 --> 00:27:17.580
don't know what
x is going to be,

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.150
I'm going to let
the player decide

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.010
between two different paths.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.860
Set x to true or set x to false.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:25.400
So there'll be two
ways to go here.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.960
And then you'll exit
along the same path.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.430
But x will be set
one way or the other.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.630
Recursively, you want
that formula to be true.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.130
And if that happens,
then the player

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.040
will be able to come back here.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.920
And if you successfully set the
rest of the formula to be true,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.670
then it means the
overall formula is true,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.600
because you just wanted to check
that there was at least one

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.410
setting for x that made it true.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.360
And so this is just
a direct connection.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.530
On the other hand, for
the universal quantifier,

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:54.990
this a little bit trickier.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.810
And it's drawn at a
very high level here.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.740
You need to check
both settings of y.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.500
So what you're going
to end up doing

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.530
is if you enter
this gadget, you're

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.330
first going to set y to
true and exit out here.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:13.060
And then recursively,
the rest better be true.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.380
If it is, you come back here.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.300
When you come back
here, you mark the fact

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.310
that you got one
setting correct.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.450
Then you set y to false,
or the other setting.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.220
And then you go out here again.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.050
And if the formula
is again true,

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.230
you'd be able to come back.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.850
And if you've accumulated
two correct answers internal

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.360
to this gadget, you know that
the overall formula is true,

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.670
with a universal
quantifier here.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.280
And then you'll be able to
return out to the caller.

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.500
So that's sort of the
recursive algorithm

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.840
view of what's going on here.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.990
Let's do that with
pressure plates.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:52.037
So it looks a little bit messy,
but the idea is very simple.

00:28:52.037 --> 00:28:53.620
It's to implement
exactly what I said.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.500
First, these clause gadgets,
these are 3SAT clauses.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.290
And what we're going to do
is just have three doors,

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.889
and you have to-- this is drawn
in the reverse order of what

00:29:02.889 --> 00:29:03.430
it should be.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:04.970
It's going right
to left usually,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.090
but it also works in
the other direction.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.214
If any of these doors is open,
you can get to the other side.

00:29:10.214 --> 00:29:11.880
And in order to get
through all of them,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.760
all the clauses
must be satisfied.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.590
So that's the 3SAT part.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.630
Really easy in this setting.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.210
Where door open means that
the variable was set true.

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:25.640
In fact, we will have both
an xi and an xi bar door.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.030
And so you use the
corresponding literals there.

00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:33.830
Cool.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.660
So now this is an existential
quantifier, an easier case

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.360
to think about.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.730
So let's say we come in
from the left, as in here.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.140
And that's coming into
this part of the gadget.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.352
And we have to give
the player a choice.

00:29:48.352 --> 00:29:50.560
They can either take the
top path or the bottom path.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.460
Now, there's a worry that maybe
you go a little bit this way

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.340
and then double-back.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.839
But that's not going
to be possible.

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.900
We need to argue that.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.220
And negative means close,
and positive means open.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.220
So if I come in here, the first
thing I do is close the A door.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.640
That's going to prevent
me from later coming back

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.580
through this way.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.500
I can only have one
door for each button.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.080
But I want a literal to be
able to appear in many classes.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.580
So in fact, I'm going to have
several copies of x here.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.020
So this is the first
occurrence of x1 bar,

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.370
and the first occurrence
of x2 bar, and so on.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.660
I want to open all
of those doors,

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.180
so I can use individual copies
of the variable up there.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.290
And then I'm going to close all
of the positive versions of x.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.550
This corresponds to
setting x to false.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.100
And then at the very
end, I open the B door,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.350
which lets me go through here.

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:50.710
The reason you can't
mess up this gadget

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.549
is if I went part way
and then doubled back,

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:55.090
I would immediately
close the B door,

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.040
which means I can't really
exit this way, which

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.290
means I'm going to have to
go all the way through here

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.210
and reset all of the variables.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.250
And this is exactly
the complement of this.

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:07.830
And so exactly one of these
will be fully traversed.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.130
The other one will be nullified.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:13.370
And then that corresponds
to existential quantifier.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:14.020
Question?

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.322
AUDIENCE: The doors
start in a closed state?

00:31:16.322 --> 00:31:18.780
PROFESSOR: Let's say all the
doors start in a closed state.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.960
Although, I don't think--

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.254
AUDIENCE: Can you close
things more than once?

00:31:22.254 --> 00:31:22.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.760
Sorry.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.410
One important thing is if
you click on Open when it's

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:27.970
already open, nothing happens.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.450
If you click on Close
when it's already closed,

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:30.158
nothing happened.

00:31:30.158 --> 00:31:32.369
So you can close multiple times.

00:31:32.369 --> 00:31:33.660
It doesn't make it more closed.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:34.700
It's just closed.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.366
AUDIENCE: Stepping
on the Close and then

00:31:36.366 --> 00:31:40.290
going back and opening
B seems to work?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.929
PROFESSOR: So you could do some
of this and then double-back.

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:43.470
You're right.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.160
B will open up again.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.820
But by traversing all of these,
you undo all of the things

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.520
you did up there, because
these are complementary.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.340
So you've fully traversed one
as the last thing you did.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.470
That's going to be
the one that sticks.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.000
Yeah.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.760
So that's pretty nice.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.870
And on the other hand, here
is a universal quantifier.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.275
Not that much harder.

00:32:05.275 --> 00:32:06.650
But this is
essentially-- there's

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.650
one door inside here
which is keeping track of,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.520
am I going through this
for the second time?

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.580
So in this case,
there's no choice.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.630
We just have to
try both settings.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.080
The first thing we do
is set x to be true.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.450
That's this setting.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.710
And we also open
door-- or sorry,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.510
we close door D. Oh, right.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.010
Sorry.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:29.770
Your other question is, do the
doors start open or closed?

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.270
I don't think it
matters, because we

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.860
have these close things in
the beginning, essentially,

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.597
everything gets closed
at the beginning.

00:32:35.597 --> 00:32:37.930
So here we're going to close
D, which is our final exit.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.096
That's where we want to get.

00:32:39.096 --> 00:32:41.080
So that's going to be hard.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.810
We have to get to
the open D spot.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:45.760
Then we set x to our setting.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.549
Then we open A. And now
we're allowed to go here.

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:51.340
You could try to go
this way, but it's just

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.590
going to close a couple doors.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.990
So it doesn't really help you.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.300
So we recursively call
the thing with x true.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.490
If it comes back with the
thing being satisfied,

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.980
we can't go through here,
because D is closed.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.730
So we're going to have
to go through here.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.540
We open B. We
immediately go through B.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.750
We immediately close B. So it's
like that's a one-way gadget.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:17.320
Now we set x to false, the
opposite of this thing.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.930
And we can't go backwards,
because B is closed.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.430
Now we open D. So if we
can get through again,

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.730
we'll be able to exit.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.540
We can't immediately turn back,
because again, B is closed.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.560
We open C, visit C, close C.
So another one-way gadget.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.210
And we also close A to
prevent other weird things

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.810
from happening.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.570
So now we go through again.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.600
If we get back with D open, then
we can return and we're happy.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.187
And this gadget in the actual
construction, keep in mind,

00:33:45.187 --> 00:33:46.770
what's happening
here is we are making

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.980
an exponential-length puzzle.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.550
The length of the solution
is going to be exponential,

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.670
because you have to try
both settings of all

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.480
the universal quantifiers.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.590
So any gadget is going to be
visited many, many, many times.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.550
But each time, we're completely
resetting x, resetting x again,

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.800
and then returning.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.180
So we'll revisit, will
reset x to true, and then

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.940
later to false, and so on.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.860
But we are checking all the
possible assignments for here.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.040
And we're letting the player
non-deterministically guess

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.159
assignment for the
existential quantifiers.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.699
So that is pressure
plates in the abstract

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.652
PSPACE-completeness.

00:34:25.652 --> 00:34:27.376
AUDIENCE: Sorry for
another question.

00:34:27.376 --> 00:34:29.909
In our usual sense of
reduction, you usually

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:33.564
think of a polynomial
size thing that we make.

00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:34.230
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.900
Yeah.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.870
I didn't mention
it, but there are

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.672
different notions of reductions
for PSPACE-completeness.

00:34:40.672 --> 00:34:42.130
But for the most
part, we will just

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:44.110
use the same notion of
reduction we did before,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.850
which is the running
time of the reduction

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.040
should be polynomial time.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.800
So here we're given a
formula which is expressed

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.940
in this kind of succinct form.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.980
And we're producing
a level whose

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.250
size is polynomial in that.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:05.580
Now, the actual
execution of the game,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.070
the trace of what happens,
or the certificate that

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.150
is solvable, that has
exponential length.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.650
But we're not talking
about MP here,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.358
so we don't need
polynomial certificates.

00:35:14.358 --> 00:35:17.220
But the reduction
itself is polynomial.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.560
And again, of course, you need
to preserve the yes/no answer.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.030
So that's our
notion of reduction.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.530
Question?

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.330
AUDIENCE: Is there a way
to make this reduction work

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.810
where you just
have toggle plates

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.200
rather than-- so that they're
not marked with Open or Closed,

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.630
but just change the
state of the door?

00:35:37.297 --> 00:35:39.130
PROFESSOR: Let's come
back to your question.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.470
I have a proof that
does essentially that.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:45.140
I was wondering the same thing,
but I'm not totally sure.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.980
So let's come back to that and
try to figure out the answer.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:55.420
So this applies to
many, many, many games.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.900
Here is an example of an
RPG, one of the earliest--

00:35:58.900 --> 00:35:59.830
Eye of the Beholder.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.150
I think it's officially
DND-licensed.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.180
It has a small number
of pressure plates.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.930
Here you are.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.784
You touch the pressure
plate, and this door opens.

00:36:08.784 --> 00:36:09.284
Ta-da!

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.860
We don't know to what
extent these things exist,

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.684
but reasonable to
assume you have

00:36:16.684 --> 00:36:17.850
this kind of infrastructure.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.630
And then PSPACE-complete.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.040
Even back in the early '90s.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.590
A lot of first-person
shooters have pressure plates.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.050
Doom doesn't have
literal pressure plates,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.905
but it has triggers.

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:34.060
There's like walls that
if you walk through them,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.850
something happens.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.745
A block can appear, or
a monster can appear.

00:36:36.745 --> 00:36:39.370
If you make a block appear, that
will essentially close a door.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.869
If you make a block
disappear, which

00:36:40.869 --> 00:36:43.040
is also possible on the
general script editor,

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.170
then you can do
all this in Doom.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.380
Quake is the first
one I know that has

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.309
actual physical representations
of a pressure plate.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:53.100
You touch this-- it's
a little hard to see,

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.320
but this drawbridge is opening.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:59.230
And a little more far.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.560
Adventure games.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.220
It's hard to define the
generalization of an adventure

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.920
game, but one definition
is that there's

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.610
an older engine for
adventure games called SCUMM

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.810
for all the old Sierra games.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.977
This, I think, stands
for Maniac Mansion.

00:37:15.977 --> 00:37:17.810
That was the original
game they read it for.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.130
But if you ever played Monkey
Island or Space Quest XII,

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:22.480
which that doesn't exist.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.070
But there was Space
Quest IV where

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:28.594
they time-traveled to the future
and played Space Quest XII.

00:37:28.594 --> 00:37:30.010
It's a very good
game, by the way.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.270
A lot of these are actually
freely available now.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.630
And anyway, it's an engine.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.680
It has a very restricted
set of scripting languages.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.160
And in particular, it
lets you do, effectively,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.010
the style of pressure
plate things, where

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.810
if you talk to
someone, then they

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.050
make you go to a new
place, and they open up

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.680
some other traversal
options, or vice versa.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:56.490
So you have to take this
a little bit liberally,

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.800
but you can
essentially implement

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.330
these kinds of things,
because you have rooms.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.350
Here you don't even
need planarity,

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.430
and you can implement
pressure plates.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.070
So that's cool.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.760
A little more literally
pressure plates.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.950
Prince of Persia, one of the
first platform PC video games,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:16.960
I guess.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.900
I don't know exactly
the right qualifiers.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.119
This, I think, they
even did motion capture.

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:23.160
It's one of the first
instances of motion capture

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.727
for video games in the very
early days of graphics.

00:38:26.727 --> 00:38:29.310
And you see in particular, this
was a pressure plate literally

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:32.360
that opens up that door.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.250
So that's pretty cool.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.860
One catch is that pressure
plates-- in this game,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.400
you can jump, so maybe
you skip a pressure plate.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.710
But if you put a pressure
plate on the top of a ledge

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.210
that you have to climb up, that
will force you to touch it.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.740
So that's Prince of
Persia, PSPACE-complete.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.200
All of these games pretty
much are in PSPACE,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.740
because the state of the
game is some polynomial space

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:02.130
thing-- which things have been
pressed, or opened, or closed.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:05.060
The total space of the
game is usually polynomial.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.850
Each thing has some,
at most, linear number

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:08.600
of bits of states.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.030
So the overall
thing is polynomial.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.827
Or I should say
constant number of bits.

00:39:13.827 --> 00:39:14.660
That doesn't matter.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.480
I get to take a log.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.385
And so you're just traversing
this giant state machine.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.220
To store the current
state of the game

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.270
only requires polynomial space.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.660
And at best, you're making
a non-deterministic choice

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.160
at each step, of whether I push
this button, or that button,

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.700
or wait.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.380
As long as you
discretize time, you

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.990
get an easy NPSPACE
algorithm for pretty much all

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.550
single-player video games.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:43.030
Not quite all, but all the
ones I've talked about here.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:45.160
Cool.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.990
So that is metatheorem three.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:57.280
But this issue of having to
force someone to pressure plate

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.460
is a little bit restrictive.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.330
And that you can
definitely get rid of.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:06.350
And this is what Giovanni calls
buttons in metatheorem four.

00:40:32.185 --> 00:40:33.810
If instead of doors
and pressure plates

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.610
you have doors and buttons,
you get PSPACE-completeness.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.740
Now, this is a little
bit more restrictive

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:49.640
in that we're going to allow
a button to, let's say,

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:55.890
open or close three doors.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.630
So pressing one button
has a bulk effect.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.300
It affects three things at once.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.152
This has since been
improved down to two.

00:41:03.152 --> 00:41:04.610
But that hasn't
been published yet.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:08.720
So I am going to cover the
published version, which

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.890
is this one, where
you manipulate

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.441
three doors for every
button that you press.

00:41:13.441 --> 00:41:15.190
And here we're drawing
it with the buttons

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.477
on the sides of the walls.

00:41:16.477 --> 00:41:18.560
There are many, of course,
physical manifestations

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.580
of this.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:23.000
And the proof is a reduction
from pressure plates.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.230
Question?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.760
AUDIENCE: The buttons are
allowed to close one door

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.500
and open another?

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.670
So you can see that here.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:31.745
One button will close
some doors, open others.

00:41:34.415 --> 00:41:36.740
This is one gadget.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.220
Here's the gadget
on the top-left,

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.850
and this is a sample
execution going left to right.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:44.155
This simulates a pressure plate.

00:41:44.155 --> 00:41:46.030
And in this case, you
can enter from the left

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.664
and go to the right,
or vice versa.

00:41:47.664 --> 00:41:50.080
Although, in the proof, we
actually only need one of those

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.580
traversals.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:55.140
So you could just stick with
the top half of the gadget.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:58.600
And the white means open,
the black means closed here.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.460
So the initial state is supposed
to be A is open, B is closed,

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:02.710
C is closed.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.280
So you come in here.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.414
If you want to
traverse, you have

00:42:06.414 --> 00:42:07.580
to hit one of these buttons.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.570
Let's say you hit the top one.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.820
And we're going to
do this plus or minus

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.580
x, which is the actual thing
you wanted this pressure plate

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.120
to do-- open or close door x.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.000
If this wasn't open for x,
there would be a plus x here.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.550
But then also, we
will close the door

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.390
we just came through
and open the door

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.750
to go to the next spot.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:28.170
Then you go to the next spot.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.920
Let's say you press
the bottom button.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.754
Because that opens C. And
you want to go forward.

00:42:35.754 --> 00:42:37.170
So it's the only
one that opens C.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:40.110
This one would have
closed C. And we also

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.582
closed D and opened B, which
gets us to the next stage.

00:42:43.582 --> 00:42:45.040
And let's say we
press this button,

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.870
because this is the only
one that opens D. Then we

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.570
close C and open A.
The point of that

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.670
is to reset the gadget to
its original state of open,

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.990
closed, closed, open.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:43:01.070
And then along the way, we
also activated x in the way

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.480
that we wanted it
to be activated.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.210
So that was pretty easy.

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.980
Now we have buttons which
you can press or not.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.240
But when you press them, it
activates three things at once.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.470
And this also exists
in many video games.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.110
Here were a few that I found.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:21.862
We have the original
Tomb Raider,

00:43:21.862 --> 00:43:23.570
and I think all the
Tomb Raiders probably

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.220
have some notion of switch,
which opens, in this case,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:26.820
one door.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.690
But you could imagine
generalizing to more doors.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.220
We have Sonic the Hedgehog here.

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.480
When you press that
button, it opens that door.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.860
You can use that to
simulate the same effect.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.722
And this game,
Lost Vikings, which

00:43:37.722 --> 00:43:39.180
I barely remember
playing, but I do

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.330
remember in particular that
the main character here

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:43.445
is called Erik the Swift.

00:43:43.445 --> 00:43:45.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.170
And you see him pressing a
button which, in this case,

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.060
actually opens two doors.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.770
So that's pretty compelling.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.550
And in general, tons
of video-- I mean,

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.440
almost every video game
with some puzzle element

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.500
has buttons in it.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.235
So now you know a ton of video
games that are PSPACE-complete.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.490
Questions?

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.730
All right.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:16.020
So the next metatheorem
is going to be

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.340
a specific kind
of implementation

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.800
of that same construction.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.610
It's more of a physical
realization of a door.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.950
It's a door that can
be opened or closed.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.730
And it has various ways to
interact with that door.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:32.824
If it's open, you can
traverse through it.

00:44:32.824 --> 00:44:34.490
If you go through the
clause connection,

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.274
you are forced to close
the door, in which case

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.190
you can't traverse it.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.410
If you go through
the open connection,

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.993
you can either just
go through, or you

00:44:40.993 --> 00:44:43.320
can open the door if you want.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:45.815
That doesn't really-- you
don't need this connection,

00:44:45.815 --> 00:44:48.150
but a lot of gadgets
will end up doing that.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.650
So this is just
one bit of state.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.820
Door is open or closed.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.710
And we can simulate
this kind of thing,

00:44:54.710 --> 00:45:01.040
or simulate the previous type
of pressure plates if you have

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.390
a door, and an open
pressure plate,

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.740
and a closed pressure plate.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.970
We're just sort of remapping
that into this gadget.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.410
When you go through
the open traversal,

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.750
that's just visiting here.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:18.200
And when you go through
the traverse connection,

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.640
that's going through the door.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.770
And when you go through
the close connection,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.450
that's visiting
that pressure plate.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.470
And vice versa.

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.620
So you can take the
previous reduction,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.929
translate it into this view.

00:45:28.929 --> 00:45:30.970
Of course, you're going
to end up with crossings,

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.280
and it will be kind of ugly.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.080
But you can do this.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.830
So as long as you have
a crossover gadget,

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:40.350
doors-- this is called a
door gadget-- by themselves

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.294
are PSPACE-complete.

00:45:42.294 --> 00:45:44.710
So we'll call this
metatheorem five.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.260
I mean, this is very similar
to metatheorem three,

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.220
just like two and one
were very similar.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.090
But just give it another name.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:04.830
Doors plus crossover
are PSPACE-complete.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.800
So this is sort of a
reinterpretation, if you will,

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.060
of the original Viglietta paper.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:14.990
Viglietta's a co-author, but
this is the Nintendo Games

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:16.800
paper.

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.230
So this is-- you can think
of as a simplification

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:24.100
of that previous metatheorem
with pressure plates.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.560
And then that has been
implemented in even more games

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.940
than you've seen so far.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.935
So one of the first
ones we did was Legend

00:46:31.935 --> 00:46:36.120
of Zelda-- A Link to the Past.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.810
So a few things going on here.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.650
But this is basically
the door gadget.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:42.919
And then you're done.

00:46:42.919 --> 00:46:45.210
There are lots of ways to do
crossovers in Zelda that's

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:45.800
not too hard.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.730
We showed a hook-shot
version some time ago.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.500
But anyway.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.120
So there are these
notion of doors in Zelda.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.120
These are currently
in the closed state.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.240
And when you walk through
this in the open state,

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.820
you'd come out on
the other side.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.080
And so in particular,
the to traversal

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.640
is going to be whether this
door is currently open.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.220
Now, getting back
to the question,

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:13.620
in Zelda-- A Link to the
Past, you only have toggles.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:19.460
If I press this button, all the
doors labeled one switch state.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.370
But you can't jump and then
land on the thing again.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:24.380
In this case, you
are falling down.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.530
The drawing isn't clear.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.230
This is the 2D drawing
of falling down a tunnel.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.290
And then the only thing
you can do is walk down.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.960
And then you hit a teleport,
and you immediately go here.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.900
So this is one way to
get traversals to work

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.250
by preventing backtracking.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:44.340
Sorry-- getting toggles to work
by preventing backtracking.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.785
So the intent of
this gadget is there

00:47:46.785 --> 00:47:48.370
are doors labeled one and two.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.250
And it should always be
exactly one of those is closed.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:56.430
Either the one is closed or the
two is closed, but not both.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:01.230
And in Zelda, all the
games are initially closed.

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.890
So this is annoying.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.700
So we have to build
this initialize gadget

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.890
through all of these doors,
where you come in here.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.061
This is the end.

00:48:12.061 --> 00:48:13.310
These are one-way teleporters.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:14.690
You can't go up here.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.130
So you have to go
here, toggle two.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:18.640
Then go to this
teleporter, go here.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.992
This is a block, so you
have to go over this way.

00:48:21.992 --> 00:48:23.950
We're going to chain all
these gadgets together

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:26.780
through these initialize
paths, so that all of the doors

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.670
are initially in
the closed state,

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:32.180
with one closed and two open.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.140
And then there's a
crystal-something

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.570
that you break.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.100
And it flips.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.050
All of these blue blocks
become these, and all of these

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.990
become blue blocks.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.770
And that only happens once.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.340
So now, basically, the
initialize paths are destroyed.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.185
So now think of this
as being untraversable,

00:48:49.185 --> 00:48:51.560
and this is traversable.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.140
OK?

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.720
So now, if the doors open,
door number one is open,

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.110
then we can traverse it.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.930
That's cool.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.330
Let's look at the closed paths.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.800
The closed path-- exactly one
of these is going to be open.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.340
So if the door was
already closed,

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.060
that means two will be open.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.110
We go down here.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:11.740
We teleport to here.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.220
And then again, because
two is the only thing open,

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.620
we go out through
the close exit.

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.270
On the other hand,
if the door was open

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.140
and we're trying to close it, we
have to be forced to close it.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.890
And indeed, we'll
go through door one.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.079
Can't go through door two.

00:49:29.079 --> 00:49:29.870
We'll go down here.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:30.920
We'll toggle door one.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.080
Now door one is closed.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.890
And so is two.

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:37.190
We'll teleport to here.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.670
Remember this is blocked now?

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.090
Now we're forced to
switch two as well.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.860
So we're effectively
simulating the effect

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.690
of doing two doors with
one choice of a thing.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:49.570
First we flip one,
then we flip two.

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.670
Then we teleport here.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:54.120
One was open.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.040
We flipped everything.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.123
Now two is open, and we
go out through the closed.

00:49:57.123 --> 00:49:58.800
So in both cases, we
exit through close.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.300
Yeah?

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.350
AUDIENCE: How do you
ensure that the blocks only

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.700
get flipped once?

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.878
Because the crystals can be
hit as many times as you want,

00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:06.790
right?

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.890
I had forgotten that detail.

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.680
Essentially, we want to
just put a one-way gadget.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.559
So when you hit the
crystal-- I mean,

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:17.600
either you hit it or you
don't but if you hit it,

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.890
then we have a cliff that
you fall off of and visit

00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:21.210
the rest of the game.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:23.290
So you can't go back
and flip the crystal.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.470
If you don't flip the
crystal, then the gadget

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.580
will break in other ways.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.560
If you didn't flip
everything, you

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.240
won't be able to traverse again.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:31.810
Yeah.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:35.760
I should have that
drawn, but I don't.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.319
OK.

00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:37.860
So there's just one
crystal, and it's

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.710
hidden in between
the initializer

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.500
and the rest of the traversal.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.490
OK.

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:45.810
So what haven't we done?

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:47.310
The open case.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.800
So maybe we come
in the open door.

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:53.840
Well, we're not going
to have a choice.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.050
Either it's already open.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.540
Then we'll go through
here, teleport to here.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.360
And we can go through
the one, and we're out.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.920
Or it's closed, in
which case two is open.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.980
Then we can't go here,
so we go down here.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.260
We toggle one, we toggle two.

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.720
And then we go out here.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:11.970
And now one is open.

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:12.980
So it's kind of cool.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.371
When we're going
through open, we

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:15.620
know that we'll end up opened.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.424
And so we'll go out the open.

00:51:17.424 --> 00:51:19.090
When we go through
the closed traversal,

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.880
we know we will end up closed.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.990
And so we will always
go out the closed exit.

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.790
And traverse is just
completely separate.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:27.290
Cool?

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.620
So this is a door
in Link to the Past.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.200
And so that's a good
example of toggles.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.290
If you, again, have sufficient
crossovers and so on forced,

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.490
I think you could argue this is
more generally letting you deal

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:54.110
with toggles as long as you
can, right next to a toggle,

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.230
put a-- after traversing
it, you essentially

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:59.680
have-- say you have a one-way
gadget before and after it,

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.710
in a certain sense.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:02.707
Here in Zelda, there's
only two levels.

00:52:02.707 --> 00:52:04.540
So we can't make you
fall off another cliff.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.570
But it's the same thing
with the teleporter.

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:10.070
We have a one-way right before
it, a one-way right after it.

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.194
You could only hit it once,
then you're essentially

00:52:12.194 --> 00:52:13.710
doing toggles.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:14.210
Cool.

00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.930
Next one is Donkey Kong Country.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:24.920
This is a recall of the
physics of Donkey Kong.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.700
You can jump around and
kill enemies and stuff.

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.980
But the main goal is to get to
a destination other than points.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.360
There are these bees which
kill you if you touch them.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.240
There are ropes and
things you can climb.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.100
And there are also barrels
that you can throw at things.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.840
And there are three main Donkey
Kong Countries, 1, 2, and 3.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.630
And they each add an
additional feature.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:51.330
But none of them
share that feature.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.140
So there are three different
PSPACE-hardness proofs, each

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.495
with an additional feature.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.980
This is Donkey Kong Country 1.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.190
Let me tell you the notation.

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.800
We have these bees,
which are stationary.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.150
So those serve as
obstacles you can't touch.

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:08.410
Then there are these
bees highlighted in red.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:09.700
They're not red bees.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:11.110
That's different.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:15.230
But they are moving,
according to this arrow.

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:18.590
So you imagine this whole
thing shifting over to here,

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.730
and then shifting all
the way over to here,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.870
and back and forth.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:24.700
And this is naturally occurring
in Donkey Kong Country.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.265
You have bees which have
some horizontal path

00:53:27.265 --> 00:53:29.110
that they traverse.

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:30.870
But we're going to
generalize a little bit

00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.744
and allow the bees to
move different amounts.

00:53:32.744 --> 00:53:35.140
This one only moves a
little bit back and forth--

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.810
I guess between here and here.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:39.510
All right.

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:44.850
Then there's this additional
feature, which is this tire.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.110
And the tire, if you
land on it, you basically

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:49.880
bounce back up very high.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:51.790
And that's going to be annoying.

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.290
From the traversal
standpoint, we're

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.414
going to be in this barrel.

00:53:54.414 --> 00:53:56.980
It's going to shoot us-- we're
forced to shoot straight down.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.800
And if we hit this
thing, we are basically

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.310
stuck in this
connected component.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:02.310
There's bees everywhere.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.570
We can't get out.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:04.070
OK?

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.630
On the other hand, if
the tire were up here,

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:12.720
then if we shoot down,
we can time it right,

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.360
wait for the bees to be
going to the right here.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.550
And then we can run
down here and fall down,

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:20.010
and go through the traverse out.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:24.010
Because of these bees, which are
going to go most over to here,

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:28.300
we can't go out through the
open setting from traverse.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.020
But if we come from
the open setting,

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.690
because these bees are
going to go way over here,

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:36.520
we can run over and push the
tire up to this position.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.080
So if you land on
it, you bounce.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:42.280
But if you come from the side,
you can push the tire however

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.050
much you want.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.764
So that will be pushing
it into the open state.

00:54:46.764 --> 00:54:48.430
And these bees will
go right up to here.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.806
And that's as far as we can
push it, right on that ledge.

00:54:50.806 --> 00:54:52.846
Because you don't want it
to fall down the ledge,

00:54:52.846 --> 00:54:54.880
which also happens in
Donkey Kong physics.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:55.380
OK.

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.680
So that's open.

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:59.020
You don't have to
open, but you can.

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.320
Now, close.

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.510
You have to close the door.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.060
And this corresponds
to coming through here.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.710
If there was a tire here, if
we were in the open state,

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:11.400
we have to push the tire
off of the edge here.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.680
And then it will roll
down to that position.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.130
And if we time it right, the
bees will be right over here.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.520
And then we can jump around.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.124
You can climb the rope.

00:55:21.124 --> 00:55:23.290
And if you're really fast,
you're climbing the rope.

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:25.684
And these bees are
really slow, rather.

00:55:25.684 --> 00:55:26.600
Then you go over here.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.724
This might not be to scale.

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.475
Maybe you want to
widen the section here,

00:55:29.475 --> 00:55:31.350
so that you have more
time to climb the rope.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.020
But that's just
constant factors.

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:36.370
Either you allow me
to slow down bees,

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:39.670
or you stretch this
diagram a little bit.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.170
OK?

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:40.980
So that's close.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.396
In order to get
from here to here,

00:55:42.396 --> 00:55:44.215
you must push the
tire off the edge.

00:55:44.215 --> 00:55:45.840
And then it will roll
to exactly there,

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.760
preventing you from traversal.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.350
So that's a door.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.370
Donkey Kong Country
1 is PSPACE-complete.

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.830
What about Donkey
Kong Country 2?

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.420
It has no tires.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.580
But it has the balloon.

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:04.340
The balloon-- normally,
balloons go down,

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.600
as you might know, from gravity.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.990
But if you have
these air currents,

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:11.940
the balloon will rise.

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.890
And when you're on
the balloon, you

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:15.760
can use it as sort of a ledge.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.620
It may still go
down, but you can

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:20.142
control whether it falls to
the left or to the right,

00:56:20.142 --> 00:56:21.600
according to whether
you press left

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.440
or right on the controller.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:28.200
So this is actually
the closed state.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.390
Again, there are these bees.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:31.560
They're moving a little bit.

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.646
But if you time it right,
you can get down here.

00:56:33.646 --> 00:56:35.270
But if you land on
the balloon, there's

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:36.690
no way to get
beyond this barrel.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:39.470
And so you're stuck.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:40.900
If the balloon is
out of the way,

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.550
it will end up being
here at position A.

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.330
Then when you shoot
from this barrel,

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.910
you end up in this barrel,
and you get to traverse out.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:50.030
So that's good.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.265
Again, these barrels
is a forced shot.

00:56:52.265 --> 00:56:56.280
So you can't make any decision
at those types of barrels.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.030
OK.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.340
Good.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:03.080
So the idea with the open
clause is that there's

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.400
a little bit of rope here.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.409
So you would climb
this rope, jump.

00:57:06.409 --> 00:57:08.450
When the bees are over to
the right a little bit,

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.530
they get over to here.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:14.290
Then go on this balloon,
push it over to the left

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:20.020
here, and then jump back out,
and grab the rope, and leave.

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.270
And if you get the
balloon to here,

00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:26.140
it will settle to this position,
so that you've successfully

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.520
opened the gadget even
though you couldn't get here

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:30.370
from there.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:32.960
On the other hand,
the close is going

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.370
to force you to reset that.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:37.890
So we get shot over this
way, shot down here.

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:39.890
Now, it could be we just
get shot, shot, shot,

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:40.890
and we're out.

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:45.770
But if there was a balloon
here, we will land on it.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:48.790
In order to get to this
barrel or the next one,

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:50.770
we have to push
the balloon over.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.530
Then we can go here or go here.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:57.444
And we'll end up getting shot
to this position and out.

00:57:57.444 --> 00:57:58.860
But because of
these air currents,

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:04.530
the balloon will go up to
here in Donkey Kong physics.

00:58:04.530 --> 00:58:06.070
And so when you
do close, you are

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.150
forced to put the
balloon back here, which

00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:10.010
is annoying for traversal.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.120
So that's a door.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:12.620
Question?

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.893
AUDIENCE: Is there any reason
you need the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:14.893 --> 00:58:15.392
at the top?

00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:19.370
PROFESSOR: Why do
we need this exact?

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:21.340
I don't remember.

00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.570
I was wondering that as well.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:25.880
Yeah.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.651
What it does do is force a
particular sort of timing

00:58:28.651 --> 00:58:30.900
maybe, about whether it's
to the left or to the right.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.887
But not sure.

00:58:33.887 --> 00:58:34.970
I'll bet there's a reason.

00:58:37.827 --> 00:58:39.410
But this figure was
drawn by Giovanni.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:42.580
Cool.

00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:44.080
What about Donkey
Kong Country 3?

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.440
Well, Donkey Kong Country 3
has neither balloons nor tires,

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.800
but it has tracking
barrels, with a T on it.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:57.320
So tracking barrels,
if you land in one,

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:00.460
you can then slide
it left or right.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:05.230
And when you leave it,
you always get shot up.

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:09.190
And even if you jump out
and then, say, go over here

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.720
and fall, the tracking
barrel tracks you.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.307
So if you're coming
from traversal

00:59:14.307 --> 00:59:16.640
and you get shot down here,
if the tracking barrel's out

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.940
of the way, then I traverse.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:23.039
Then I'm forced to go down here
and leave via the close exit,

00:59:23.039 --> 00:59:24.080
which is not what I want.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.602
I want to leave according
to the traversal exit.

00:59:26.602 --> 00:59:28.060
Now, this has some
leakage, but you

00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:30.270
can show this leakage is OK.

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:33.090
You can go from traverse
in to close out.

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:35.289
But that won't end
up helping you,

00:59:35.289 --> 00:59:37.830
because you were already close,
so you knew you could already

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.630
get to close out.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:43.270
So this is the closed state when
the tracker barrel's over here.

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:44.800
This is the open state.

00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.091
When we're in the open state,
we come through traverse.

00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:48.425
We can jump out and leave here.

00:59:48.425 --> 00:59:50.810
So that's good.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:56.760
On the other hand, if we
come via the open position,

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:59.990
we can go get shot down here.

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.800
And if the barrel
was there, we're

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.349
going to have to
move it over here.

01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:04.390
I guess we don't have to.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:05.390
We could leave it there.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.190
But we are able to
bring the barrel over

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.800
here and leave through open.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.650
And now we're in the open state.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.260
That's good.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.360
On the other hand, if
we come from close,

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.290
if it's currently open, we
will be shot into the barrel.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.230
And then to get
over here, we have

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.370
to bring the barrel
over here, putting it

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.680
into the close state.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.910
Now, this is the relevant part,
where the tracking hurts you.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:30.550
You go in here.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.530
You'd like to just jump
out and get out here,

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:36.380
but because it's a tracking
barrel, if you jump out here,

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.580
the barrel will come over anyway
even though you don't go back

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.540
into it.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:43.020
So if you leave
through the close exit,

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.170
you have to bring the
barrel over to the right.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:49.272
So that forces the clothes,
preventing traversal.

01:00:49.272 --> 01:00:50.480
That's Donkey Kong Country 3.

01:00:55.530 --> 01:01:01.560
But there's one Nintendo
game that rules them all,

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.940
and that is Super Mario Bros.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.805
And for the first
time, we are announcing

01:01:07.805 --> 01:01:12.120
a PSPACE-completeness
result for Super Mario Bros.

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:15.710
So the Nintendo paper
and another paper

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:19.370
by Giovanni, which I
will talk about next,

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:22.900
was prevented at Fun with
Algorithms earlier this summer.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.860
Two people were there.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.325
And then we started
talking, oh, we

01:01:28.325 --> 01:01:31.000
should really prove Mario Bros.
is also a PSPACE-complete.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.510
So this is our
current reduction.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.060
You may recall another
crossover gadget

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.460
that involved invincibility
stars, or mushrooms,

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.224
or something.

01:01:41.224 --> 01:01:42.140
Those are consumables.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.830
We can't afford consumables
in a PSPACE reduction,

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:47.030
because we have to visit
the same thing many times.

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:50.950
But using Mario physics,
we designed this crossover.

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:54.210
You're going to be small Mario
throughout this reduction.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:58.440
If you come up here and you
run, you will fall here.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.690
And if you come over there,
you run, you'll fall here.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.740
But you can't jump
around and land here.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740
You'll end up down here.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.671
And that's larger than
your jump distance.

01:02:06.671 --> 01:02:07.170
OK?

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:09.790
So as long as you can't
glitch through walls,

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:12.780
this is a valid crossover
and it's reusable.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:13.907
It's a one-way crossover.

01:02:13.907 --> 01:02:15.240
You can only go from up to down.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.990
OK.

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.975
Now the door.

01:02:20.975 --> 01:02:23.430
The door's a little bit weird.

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:27.520
But it has actually been built
by modifying the Super Mario

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.020
Bros.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:35.680
ROM, so it does exist in the
physics of the real Mario.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.240
This doesn't have to be
length, but this is a fire bar,

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.484
which is normally rotating.

01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:42.400
But if it has size one,
then it doesn't really

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.850
do much rotating.

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:45.850
So these are things you're
not allowed to touch.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.660
The version we
implemented has fire bars.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.840
Those do exist in the ROM.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.570
But even if you have fire
bars that are much bigger,

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:59.153
you can still do all the things
you need to do in this gadget.

01:02:59.153 --> 01:03:01.490
It's just a lot harder
to do correctly.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.740
I was trying it earlier today.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:07.069
And then we have this guy.

01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:09.110
I forget what they're
called, but they're dropped

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:10.891
by the cloud thing in the sky.

01:03:10.891 --> 01:03:13.140
You can also create them at
the beginning of the level

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.420
even though that doesn't
appear in the true levels.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.976
You can make a new level that
has these guys initially.

01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:22.350
It'll just be the case that
there's also a cloud floating

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.710
around at the top.

01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.390
But if you shield
from that, you're OK.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.850
So there's one of these
guys, and he can basically

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:33.860
be walking back and
forth here or over here.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:36.150
And you can flip
that by if you hit

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:39.330
this block with
the right timing,

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:42.540
this guy will end up bouncing
and walking over here.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.109
And practice.

01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:44.400
You have to hit it a few times.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.224
Sometimes he'll walk back over.

01:03:46.224 --> 01:03:48.390
But if you get the direction
that he's facing right,

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:50.050
he'll jump up and
then keep going.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.530
And then he'll be over
in the other side.

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:53.292
OK.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.000
But you can't just
reach everything here.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.012
If you are on the open side,
you can hit him if you want

01:03:58.012 --> 01:03:58.970
and put him over there.

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:01.600
That's going to be
the open setting.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.497
The traversal requires
you to go through this way

01:04:04.497 --> 01:04:06.080
without the ability
to hit this thing.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.810
And so if the spiny guy
is over on the left,

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.720
you will die, guaranteed.

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.770
We checked.

01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.279
And otherwise, you
jump-- if he's not there,

01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:18.320
if it's on the right side,
then you can traverse.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.770
So this is the open
state that's drawn.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.140
So this is the tricky part.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.510
We need something that's
untraversable by the player

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.170
but traversable by the monster.

01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:28.580
And this could be a fire
bar that's rotating.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.250
If you time it right, you
could still rush by it.

01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:34.040
And of course, close.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.660
Close, we need to force this
guy to be on the other side.

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:38.785
And so we do the same thing
that we did on the left

01:04:38.785 --> 01:04:39.930
to go through to close.

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:42.430
Just like on the left, this guy
has to be on the other side.

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.840
So first, you can knock
him over to the other side.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.040
And then you can go back
and jump through there.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.385
So Super Mario Bros.
is PSPACE-complete.

01:04:50.385 --> 01:04:50.885
Yeah?

01:04:50.885 --> 01:04:53.360
AUDIENCE: What was the advantage
of the rotating fire bar?

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.217
PROFESSOR: Oh, it's more
naturally occurring.

01:04:56.217 --> 01:04:58.050
In real Mario, there
are rotating fire bars.

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:01.660
There's never this single
fire just floating in midair.

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.030
Fire bars can float in midair.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.260
In all the levels that
exist in Super Mario Bros.,

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.030
fire bars are a fixed length.

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.640
We have six fire
things or whatever.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.330
But in the ROM, it
has support for making

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.019
fire bars of arbitrary
length or up to some size.

01:05:20.019 --> 01:05:22.560
So you can make this in the ROM,
or you can have it rotating.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.620
And then it's a more
intense experience.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:27.410
AUDIENCE: Why are there
fire bars [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.760
that they're hitting?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:31.950
That's dealing with glitches.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:32.450
Yeah?

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:34.908
AUDIENCE: What is the shell
guy dropped by the cloud thing?

01:05:34.908 --> 01:05:36.300
Or I don't know the game.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.810
PROFESSOR: Oh, in the game,
the cloud is up there.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.110
And every few seconds,
he throws one,

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:44.290
and it falls in some
kind of random spot.

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:48.290
And then he traverses left and
right like a regular turtle.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:51.870
But in this, we're assuming
that you can have him initially

01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:53.520
appear there.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.890
So he's not thrown by the cloud.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:57.170
There would also be a
cloud throwing spiny guys.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.330
We're assuming that
this guy can just

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:02.662
be there from the beginning.

01:06:02.662 --> 01:06:05.137
AUDIENCE: So it
drops more than one?

01:06:05.137 --> 01:06:05.970
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:08.303
It drops one, and then drops
another, and drops another.

01:06:08.303 --> 01:06:09.290
I think it's unlimited.

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.750
I mean, there might
be a practical limit

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:15.490
given by the memory of an
NES, which is pretty small.

01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.715
But I think it limits to like
eight creatures on screen

01:06:18.715 --> 01:06:19.590
at once or something.

01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:23.460
But we're generalizing
that as well.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.760
Are there questions?

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.670
OK.

01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:28.400
I have one more proof
I want to cover.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.510
And this is the other Giovanni
paper, and Fun with Algorithms

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:32.800
is here.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.660
And it's about Lemmings.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.460
If you haven't
played Lemmings, it's

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.820
sort of the first
real-time strategy game.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:42.062
So you have these characters
which appear periodically.

01:06:42.062 --> 01:06:43.770
Then you can click on
characters and make

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:44.590
them do different things.

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:45.780
You can make them build bridges.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.238
You can make them
dig horizontally.

01:06:47.238 --> 01:06:49.877
You can make them
dig vertically.

01:06:49.877 --> 01:06:51.210
And so going through that again.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:55.450
Here we're making this guy
climb, and then digging down.

01:06:55.450 --> 01:06:57.990
And then digging left.

01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:59.160
And then digging down.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.210
And then they can dig
left to switch directions.

01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:02.740
And then make them
dig down again.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.582
And then build bridge
and dig through.

01:07:04.582 --> 01:07:06.290
This is, I think,
level two or something.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.310
It's quite challenging.

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.510
And your goal is to get as
many lemmings as possible

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:12.010
to the exit.

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:14.060
And the way you do it is
you select the ability

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.851
you want, and then you
click on the lemming

01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:17.070
that you want to do it on.

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.720
And otherwise, they
are walking around.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.575
So how many people
have played Lemmings?

01:07:21.575 --> 01:07:22.950
Yeah, this is more popular one.

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.366
If you haven't
played, you should.

01:07:24.366 --> 01:07:27.320
It's really hard, though.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.660
I was reading Wikipedia.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.160
Sarah, one of your
favorite authors,

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.680
Terry Pratchett was
playing Lemmings.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.220
He wrote a book that is
clearly inspired by Lemmings.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.350
And then he said he
had to delete Lemmings

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:41.457
from his computer and override
it in order to stop playing.

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:42.290
It was so addictive.

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:43.456
There are a bunch of levels.

01:07:43.456 --> 01:07:45.331
It's fun.

01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:46.830
There are many free
versions as well

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.380
that have duplicated the
Lemmings physics and so

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.410
on, with new levels, and there
are level editors, and all

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:53.740
that good stuff.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.860
So you might expect this
game is pretty hard.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:00.750
Here we're going to
prove PSPACE-hardness.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:05.030
There was the first paper
by a Graham Cormode,

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:08.919
which showed NP-hardness and
conjectured PSPACE-hardness.

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.210
So this was the results before.

01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:13.720
So there are all
these abilities.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.050
I haven't defined all of them.

01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:17.219
I'll show you just
a few of them.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.760
If they're unlimited,
normally you're

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.970
given a limit to
how many you have.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:23.600
But even when they're unlimited
and you have arbitrary time,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.920
the game is still in PSPACE,
because again, the state

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.800
is polynomial number of bits.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.720
OK.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.779
There's another thing I didn't
mention, which is hazards.

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:36.620
These are traps.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.330
If your lemming
goes there, you die.

01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:43.220
So those are also important
for some of the proofs.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:47.461
And so Graham showed that if you
have diggers and a time-bound,

01:08:47.461 --> 01:08:48.960
then you get NP
equal to time-bound,

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.800
you actually get
NP-completeness.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.029
And you can convert that
into other abilities.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:57.430
But the [INAUDIBLE] new
results are this one.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:01.470
We're going to focus on this
column, which is given builders

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.399
and bashers, either unlimited
or given an exponential number

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.939
of them-- because we need to
run for exponential time--

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.640
and hazards, and
just one lemming,

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.090
the game is PSPACE-complete.

01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:16.877
Another result in the same
paper that might interest you--

01:09:16.877 --> 01:09:18.960
but we're no longer in the
Approximation section--

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.930
is APX-hardness for
any ability you want.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:29.290
And a polynomial number
of lemmings, and time,

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.390
and hazards.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.229
And it's based on this
weird thing about hazards

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:36.040
that if you have many lemmings
go through a trap at once,

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.490
then only one of them dies.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.891
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:38.891 --> 01:09:40.265
Because the trap
has to activate,

01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:41.790
and it takes a certain
amount of time.

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.870
So if they're really bunched
up, then most of them

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:44.536
can get through.

01:09:44.536 --> 01:09:47.944
So you can use that to reduce
the number of lemmings.

01:09:47.944 --> 01:09:50.569
And you're trying to approximate
how many lemmings get through.

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:51.069
OK.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:52.279
So that's fun.

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.582
But I don't have
those pictures here,

01:09:54.582 --> 01:09:56.540
because the PSPACE-hardness
is kind of the more

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:58.130
impressive technical thing.

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.250
And it's already
quite complicated.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:04.780
So in order to really
get this proof right,

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.840
Giovanni went through
an incredible effort

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.740
of documenting Lemming physics
at a pixel-by-pixel level,

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:13.810
because it is pretty
weird, especially

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.980
when you start using
the bridge building.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.790
If you've ever
played this game, it

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.026
will stop at kind
of weird moments.

01:10:20.026 --> 01:10:21.650
So here is the physics
of what happens.

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.600
In general, the lemming is
represented by a pin right

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.220
under its left foot.

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:26.930
I don't know.

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:29.240
Maybe that's the right foot.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.645
And that pin should
always be on the ground.

01:10:33.645 --> 01:10:35.686
If it's not on the ground,
the lemming will fall.

01:10:35.686 --> 01:10:36.894
If it falls too far, it dies.

01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:38.470
But that's not relevant here.

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:43.040
So the general walking-- all
lemmings start as walkers.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.016
And what they do is
basically move left to right.

01:10:46.016 --> 01:10:46.890
There's an animation.

01:10:46.890 --> 01:10:48.670
But mostly, this pin
is moving one pixel

01:10:48.670 --> 01:10:49.894
to the right at a time.

01:10:49.894 --> 01:10:51.310
And so it's visiting
these things.

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.120
Once it sees, oh, there's no
longer an obstacle beneath me,

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.040
I'm going to fall
this amount, and then

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.690
I will fall one pixel at a
time until I hit the ground.

01:10:58.690 --> 01:10:59.730
So there's a gap here.

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:02.950
That won't be important here,
but this is the real physics.

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:07.910
If I hit a step-- and this is,
at most, eight pixels up-- then

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:11.422
I will rise up and go over.

01:11:11.422 --> 01:11:13.630
But if I have two big a
step, more than eight pixels,

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:17.180
then when I hit the wall,
I will switch directions.

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:20.940
So in this case, he will hit
here and then climb back up.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:23.195
That is the regular
walker physics.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.510
Now, we're going to
use two abilities.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:31.150
One is called basher.

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:36.100
And there's some animations here
of what happens with bashers.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.280
In general, it's
horizontal digging.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.510
But it's kind of weird
horizontal digging.

01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:42.700
There's this particular
pattern that you dig,

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:48.150
which ends up tunneling a
big horizontal rectangle more

01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:49.060
or less.

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.970
But the way it tells
whether it's finished

01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:52.710
is it looks at
these four positions

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:55.730
right in front of the dig mask.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:59.140
And if at least one of them is
solid, you will keep digging.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.256
If they're all empty,
you will stop digging.

01:12:01.256 --> 01:12:02.630
That's important,
because we need

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:05.320
to see exactly when these
things stop happening.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.140
Then you return
to being a walker.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.150
So if everything is normal,
you just dig through.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:13.387
Here, that position was
when all four were empty.

01:12:13.387 --> 01:12:15.220
One was empty, but then
all four were empty.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.080
And so then you stop
digging and keep walking.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:18.580
OK.

01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.740
But there's also
this notion of steel.

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:22.530
Any pixel can be
marked as steel.

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:24.212
It's a separate,
independent bit.

01:12:24.212 --> 01:12:26.420
Usually there's some graphics
to indicate your steel.

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.800
But here we're
going to use blue.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.750
And there's this
one steel check.

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.685
And if that position
is steel, you

01:12:34.685 --> 01:12:35.980
will immediately stop digging.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.646
Or you will stop
digging when that start

01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:40.190
position hits a steel pixel.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.175
So we're going to use
that in the proof.

01:12:42.175 --> 01:12:45.730
But that's how bashers work.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:47.510
Next we have builders.

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:49.900
These are building
the staircases.

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:52.450
And there's this subtlety
that the solidity check

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:55.330
are these three points.

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:59.500
If any of them is solid,
it will stop digging.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.290
And if this one's solid,
you'll also switch directions.

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.050
There's also a limited
number of stairs,

01:13:05.050 --> 01:13:07.216
because you can only fit
so many in this little bag.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.197
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:09.197 --> 01:13:10.530
That won't matter for the proof.

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:12.300
We're always going
to stop before we

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:17.610
hit the 15 stairs or so, 10
stairs, something like that.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.410
So you can see it
in action here.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:22.980
You place the step.

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.960
The initial step overlaps
your feet by two pixels.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.850
And then you do this offset
of two to the right, one up

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:32.340
until you hit
something like that.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.330
And then in that
case, you turn around,

01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:37.260
because you hit the
wall, so to speak.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.870
But notice there's
this big gap here.

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.120
OK.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.900
So now we want to
use metatheorem five.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:52.244
We want to build a door
and crossover, I guess.

01:13:52.244 --> 01:13:54.660
I don't know if I have the--
I do have the crossover here.

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.150
It's not so hard.

01:13:56.150 --> 01:13:58.740
First we just need to be
able to move lemmings around.

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.210
And they move in
a very simple way.

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:00.760
So yeah.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.658
AUDIENCE: How did he check
all these pixel things?

01:14:03.658 --> 01:14:09.022
PROFESSOR: [LAUGHS]
That's a good question.

01:14:09.022 --> 01:14:10.480
Definitely one
thing he did is look

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.250
at one of the clones of lemmings
and read the source code.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:17.440
How that clone was done to mimic
exactly the original lemmings

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.290
I'm not sure.

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:21.030
So I don't know
whether this has been

01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:26.630
compared against disassembled,
original Lemmings code or what.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.630
I'll follow up with him.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.340
I was talking to
him earlier today.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:30.840
OK.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.820
So we are only going to
give the player the ability

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:37.560
to do builders or bashers.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.160
And we want to prevent the
player from doing builders

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.380
in random places.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.320
So these red things are traps.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.710
If you ever at any point
decide to become a builder,

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.100
your dot will not be here.

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.490
Your dot will be above.

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.980
And then it will be touching
the trap, and then you die.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.840
So these red things
are to prevent you

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.560
from building anywhere.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.070
You also can't bash
anywhere, because let's say

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:02.540
this is all steel.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.214
OK.

01:15:03.214 --> 01:15:05.130
Or actually, I think the
whole background here

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:09.170
is steel except in specific
places in the gadget.

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:10.610
So this is a small thing.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.760
This basically let's
us ascend slightly.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.718
Because lemmings only
like to go left and right

01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:19.850
and there's no jump
ability, we want

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.480
to be able to build a graph.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.160
So this will let us
go up a little bit.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.970
This will let us go
down a little bit.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.710
This will let us change
directions into going up,

01:15:27.710 --> 01:15:29.350
change directions in going down.

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:31.330
This is a crossover,
because lemmings will just

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:32.130
proceed to the right.

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.963
There's no way to make
them change direction

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:35.810
unless they hit something.

01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:38.790
So that's basic lemming driving.

01:15:43.215 --> 01:15:45.340
These are not explicitly
stated in the metatheorem.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.964
You see here the vagueness
of the metatheorem.

01:15:47.964 --> 01:15:49.380
We need the ability
for the player

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.030
to choose whether lemmings
go one way or another way.

01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:54.734
We need that, for example, in
the existential quantifier.

01:15:54.734 --> 01:15:56.400
But in general, we
were kind of assuming

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:59.560
that the player has this kind
of agency to choose directions

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.410
of lemmings.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:03.710
So for that, we need
a kind of fork gadget.

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:09.450
And you can either do a build
immediately followed by a bash,

01:16:09.450 --> 01:16:12.610
or you can do a bash
in order to get down.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:14.090
So if I do a build
and then a bash,

01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:16.530
I will stop building and
then just make one step.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.680
Because if I made a second step,
I would die from the traps.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.550
That will let me choose
to go to the top path.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:24.960
Or even if this is already
there, I could bash it away.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.560
Or if it isn't there, just wait.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.431
And then I will go down here.

01:16:28.431 --> 01:16:28.930
OK?

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:30.960
So no matter what the
state of this gadget is,

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.520
I can either take the top path
or go down to the bottom path.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.840
Because here I have
unlimited bashes and builds.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.990
So those are the two states.

01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:44.860
This is the non-steel part.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:50.800
We need that for
the bash to succeed.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.300
So it ends up bashing, but
because it's all empty here,

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.291
you immediately stop bashing.

01:16:59.291 --> 01:16:59.790
OK.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:00.940
That's the fork.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.096
And finally, the door.

01:17:03.096 --> 01:17:06.610
So if the door was
open, you go through it.

01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:09.120
If it's closed, you die, even
if you try to build a bridge.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.680
If I go this way, I
can either fall down,

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.960
or I could bash it away
and then open the door.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.810
But I still fall to the bottom.

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.410
If I come from here with a
closed door, fine, I can exit.

01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:22.860
If it's an open door, I
better build this thing.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.040
If I build too far,
I'm in trouble.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.682
But if I build just once
and then immediately bash,

01:17:27.682 --> 01:17:28.890
then I will get to the right.

01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:30.590
What did I just
do in rapid fire?

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:34.090
That was the closed path,
where I must put this

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:36.350
back in in order to survive.

01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.050
The open, I had a choice.

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:39.130
I could bash it.

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:41.480
In either case, I end
up to the open exit.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.060
And for traversal, you will only
survive if this is not there.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.950
And you get out.

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.510
So lots of crossing paths.

01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:51.680
But you can see why you need
this pixel-by-pixel analysis

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.030
to really be sure that this
gadget does exactly what you

01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:56.020
want.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.540
And that is a door for Lemmings.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.052
And therefore, Lemmings
is PSPACE-complete.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:02.380
Pretty epic.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.740
And that's all for today.

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.850
Yay, video games.
