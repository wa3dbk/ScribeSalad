00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:26.690
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.840
So today we start a new
topic, but in the same spirit

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.570
of PSPACE completeness
of puzzles.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.690
We're going to talk
about a general theory

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.750
called Constraint Logic.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.530
This was the topic
of the Ph.D. thesis

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.200
here by Bob Hearn, which later
turned into this book-- Games,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.920
Puzzles, and Computation.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.580
And constraint logic
is a big theory.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.450
But today we're going to focus
on one particular aspect of it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.860
called nondeterministic
constraint logic.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.180
Nondeterministic like NP.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.690
And that is specifically
about puzzles

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.780
and PSPACE completeness.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.110
So non-deterministic constraint
logic-- usually called NCL.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.490
And it's a very
useful infrastructure

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.830
for proving PSPACE
hardness results,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.010
for puzzles, originally
motivated by sliding blocks,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.420
but we will get
there in a moment.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.570
You've seen it very
briefly in Lecture 1.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.030
I'm going to go through it
again more slowly and clearly

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.870
and define everything.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.660
And then we'll see lots of
hardness proofs based on that.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.630
So we start with the
notion of a machine.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.060
We won't use this term too much.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.250
But the idea is we start
with an undirected graph.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.470
Think of this as a
model of computation.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.960
So your computer is
an undirected graph

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.390
of red edges and blue edges.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.110
Red edges have weight 1.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.260
Blue edges have weight 2.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.860
And then a configuration
of that machine--

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.320
or a constraint
graph in total-- is

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.460
an orientation of that graph.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.690
So it's really a directed
graph with red and blue edges.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.870
And you have to satisfy the
constraint that at every node,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.110
the total incoming weight
should be at least 2.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.580
So either at least one blue
edge or at least two red edges.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.070
So this should be a
satisfying assignment.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.790
This one has two red edges.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.520
This one has actually one blue
edge and an additional red edge

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.830
coming in.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.055
But in general we have--
so, a constraint graph.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:51.390
It's going to be a directed
red/blue graph satisfying,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:02.660
I'll call it the
inflow constraint,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:17.790
that for every vertex, the
total incoming weight is

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.670
greater than or equal to 2 where
red is a 1 and a blue is a 2.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.160
And then we're interested
in reconfigurations

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.300
of constraint graphs by
reversing one edge at a time.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.740
So let's look at a vertex here.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.510
This guy has total incoming
weight of three-- one

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.510
from the red, two from the blue.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.000
And a move we're
allowed to do is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.180
say, reverse an edge like this.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.929
So now we have a total
incoming weight of 4.

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.470
4 is also greater
than or equal to 2.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.870
So that's a valid move.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.080
Now we could also
reverse this edge.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.240
We couldn't before.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.750
If we had done it
in the beginning,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.583
there would only be a
weight of 1 coming in.

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:07.460
But now that we have these
two units of weight coming in,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.764
we can redirect this--
at least local to this

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:11.180
vertex-- we can
redirect this guy.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.310
It'll only make
this vertex happier.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.790
The validity of this
move depended on what

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.470
that vertex looked like.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.987
So in general, we start
with some constraint graph.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.570
We're going to do a
sequence of moves.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.680
At all times we should
have a valid constraint

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.290
graph, meaning you satisfy
the inflow constraint.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.790
So those are the
rules of the game.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.060
And at each move, or
at each time step,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.880
you can make any
valid move you want.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.260
That's the
nondeterministic aspect.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.495
And that mimics most puzzles.

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:43.870
You're not told
which move to do.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.250
You get to choose
which move to do.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.170
Guess which move
to do, if you like.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.920
So the NCL problem
is, I give you

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.750
some crazy network like this.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.984
And I want to know, can I
reverse a particular edge?

00:04:55.984 --> 00:04:57.400
That's one version
of the problem.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.360
There are actually two decision
problems we can think about.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.892
That one is the most useful.

00:05:03.892 --> 00:05:05.100
Or most common, I should say.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.440
Can you reverse a specified
edge given the constraint graph?

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.990
Meaning is there a
sequence of moves--

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.750
and the last move is
reversing the target edge.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.060
Another problem
would be, can you

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.460
reach a desired other
constraint graph?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.080
So I give you an
entire configuration

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.480
and another orientation of
the graph that's consistent.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.570
And to in some sense, that
gives you more information.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.315
I don't just say I
want to flip this edge.

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:56.190
It will actually be, I
want to flip this edge

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.080
and no other edges is going
to be the typical setup.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.790
But in general, I give you
one configuration and another.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.331
And I want to know, can I get
from here to here by a sequence

00:06:04.331 --> 00:06:06.430
of single-edge reversals.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.930
Yeah.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.380
AUDIENCE: Does the graph
[INAUDIBLE] degree 3?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.970
PROFESSOR: It will
always be max degree 3.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.750
So you can assume that.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.270
In fact, we will show
both of these problems

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.336
are PSPACE complete for
three regular graphs.

00:06:24.336 --> 00:06:26.460
Although what I've drawn
here is not three regular.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.350
It has some vertices
in degree 1.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.210
You can actually
assume max degree 3.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.830
And you can assume
that there are only

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.520
two types of
vertices-- and those

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.982
are red, red, blue
and blue, blue, blue.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.510
So even just for these
two types of vertices,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.060
both of these problems
are PSPACE complete.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.789
Yeah.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.821
AUDIENCE: Do degree
1 vertices also

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:56.010
have to satisfy the
inflow constraint?

00:06:59.144 --> 00:06:59.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.817
This would not be valid.

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:04.650
We'll show how to
simulate degree 1 vertices

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.400
with or without the
inflow constraint.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.899
Yeah.

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.952
AUDIENCE: Is the
problem given the graph,

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:11.397
find a valid configuration?

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:12.980
PROFESSOR: That's a
different problem.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.690
Given an undirected graph,
find a valid configuration.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.360
That problem is NP complete.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.020
We'll also prove that.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.710
That's called constraint
graph satisfiability.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.190
So that's an analog of SAT.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:47.360
So this is, given
undirected red/blue graph,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.337
find a valid orientation.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:51.420
So that's a good question.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.340
At present, there aren't very
many NP hardness reductions

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.500
that use this problem.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.490
But I think maybe
there should be more.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.170
It's a need.

00:08:05.062 --> 00:08:07.270
This was not our original
goal with constraint logic.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.460
So we sort of forgot
about it until recently.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.090
We thought it would
be cool to do more.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.590
AUDIENCE: So the
separation suggests

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.286
that you can't get from
any valid configuration

00:08:16.286 --> 00:08:17.730
to any other valid
configuration?

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.438
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:18.438 --> 00:08:21.370
So in particular, for
lots of different pairs

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.780
of configurations
of the same graph,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.930
you cannot find a path
from one to the other.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.177
And deciding whether you
can is PSPACE complete.

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:30.260
I mean, that implies there
are lots of no answers.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.208
AUDIENCE: So what
prevents you from being

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:35.620
able to do it intuitively?

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.900
PROFESSOR: Hopefully it will
become more and more obvious.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.110
I don't have a great
intuition why it's

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.570
hard, other than it's hard.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.090
I mean, you tend to get
nice path connectivity

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.370
in continuous spaces.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.760
This is a very discrete space.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.720
And there's a lot
of hard constraints

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.264
that's like rough intuition.

00:08:56.264 --> 00:08:58.180
AUDIENCE: You'll probably
get into this later,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.030
but can you give us some
brief motivation of why

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.030
we care about this problem?

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.660
PROFESSOR: The
motivation is a lot

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:09.030
of puzzles can easily simulate
these kinds of pictures.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.930
And in particular, you
basically need two gadgets.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.990
And we'll also prove that this
is hard for planar graphs.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.590
So you don't even
need a crossover.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.657
For planar red/blue graphs,
with just these two types

00:09:22.657 --> 00:09:24.740
of vertices, the whole
problem is PSPACE complete.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.682
So the ultimate
motivation is to prove

00:09:26.682 --> 00:09:27.890
your problem PSPACE complete.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.577
If it falls into the
category of games like this,

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:32.660
you just need two gadgets.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.840
And you get a proof
by two pictures.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.470
So that will lead to some very
efficient PSPACE completeness

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.970
proofs.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.400
Of course, to get there we first
need to prove this theorem.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.340
And I'm going to do
that first so you

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.144
see where all this
comes from, so you

00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:48.310
don't have to understand it.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.150
I think it's helpful in case
you want to generalize it.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.140
OK.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.880
So let me tell you about
these two types of vertices.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.150
This one is called
an AND vertex.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.680
And this one is
called an OR vertex.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:14.130
Because if we think of the
two red edges as inputs,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.219
and think of the
blue edge as output,

00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.760
this picture is
supposed to represent

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.320
that 1 and 1 equals 1.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.940
And this picture is supposed to
represent that 0 or 0 equals 0.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.460
And if we do some more moves,
like if I flip this edge,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.810
now I have total
incoming weight of 3.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.560
That's still not enough
to flip this edge,

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.610
because 0 and 1 is 0 still.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.604
And I could flip it back.

00:10:42.604 --> 00:10:43.770
Maybe I flip the other edge.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.620
Also 1 and 0 is 0.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.260
Still can't flip this guy.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:51.050
But if I flip both of them up
top, if both of the red guys

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:58.580
are incoming, then I can if I
want to flip the bottom edge.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.650
But I don't have to right away.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.240
So I could go from here to here.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.340
But this is sort
of a slow AND gate.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.190
I put in the two 1 inputs.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.990
I don't yet have a 1
output, so to speak,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.910
where 1 here is
represented by 2.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.380
You get the idea.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.740
OK.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.240
So let me write
down the definition

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.865
to make that slightly cleaner.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.998
So I'm going to define
the activation of an edge,

00:11:25.998 --> 00:11:27.123
or an edge being activated.

00:11:35.622 --> 00:11:40.470
An input edge is going to
be active if it's incoming.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:51.840
And an output edge is
active if it's outgoing.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.710
This is a symmetric.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.900
Incoming and outgoing
always clear.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.460
Either you're going
into the vertex,

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.080
or you're going
out of the vertex.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.910
But just by labeling
these inputs,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.180
I'm going to say these edges are
sort of interesting if they're

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.120
pointing in.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.100
This edge is interesting
if it's pointing out.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.190
These correspond to the one
bits in a Boolean logic.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.260
And what we say for an AND
gate-- property of an AND

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.150
gate-- is that the
output can activate--

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:31.400
doesn't have to-- only if
both inputs are active.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.400
So in this language you can
see that it's an AND gate.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.760
You need both of the inputs.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.370
The AND of the input should be
active in order for the output

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.330
to activate.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.880
And so that's why we do
this asymmetric thing.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.500
Another reason to do this
asymmetric view of inputs

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.710
and outputs is if
you have two vertices

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.540
and an edge between them.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.750
It was asymmetric to
begin with, right?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.290
This edge from this guy's
perspective is outgoing.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.412
From this guy's
perspective, it's incoming.

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:09.620
That's annoying to deal with.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.310
I want the edge to
either be active or not.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.750
And if this is the output
edge of this vertex,

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.080
and it's the input
of this vertex,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.670
than this edge is active.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.741
And the other direction
would be inactive.

00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:25.240
OK.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.220
But it's active from
this guy's perspective.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.900
And it's active from
this guy's perspective.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.320
So while this may
seem asymmetric,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.302
it actually makes the
picture more symmetric.

00:13:32.302 --> 00:13:32.801
Yeah.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:35.507
AUDIENCE: Can't have a red
edge being the output, though.

00:13:35.507 --> 00:13:36.410
Right?

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:37.368
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:13:37.368 --> 00:13:40.300
With these gadgets we never
have a red edge being output.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.720
Imagine red being blue.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.780
OK.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.690
So that is active.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:57.860
And AND, you have sort
of delayed outputs.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.270
You can think of
this same vertex

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.850
if you relabel these
guys as outputs,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.540
and this guy as an input.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.179
It's just a perspective change.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.470
It's just changing terminology.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.630
So it doesn't actually
change what happens.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.810
But from this perspective.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.360
You essentially are splitting,
or fanning out, a wire.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.750
So if you have a
signal here of true--

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.720
so this is an active input
now-- that both of these

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.150
can be active if
they want to be.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:23.610
They don't have to be.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.980
But if it's false, then both
of these have to be inactive.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.850
This is inactive.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.090
Both of these have
to be inactive.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.750
And there are lots of
configurations of this guy.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.450
So maybe some of them point in.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.250
So the split.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.359
That's the same vertex that's
a relabeling of who's active

00:14:41.359 --> 00:14:42.150
and who's inactive.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:15:02.350
The outputs can activate
only if the input is active.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.270
And really, I should be
saying if and only if.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:10.171
But I'm being a
little concise here.

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:10.670
OK.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.920
So that's a SPLIT vertex.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.280
And then the other
vertex type is an OR.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:19.230
So this is really the second
vertex type out of three.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.490
Third out of three.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.330
Whatever.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.770
So this of course
looks very symmetric.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.990
I mean, there's no clear notion
of inputs or outputs here.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.520
But if you define two
of them to be inputs,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.040
and the other one
to be an output,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.620
then that output is the
OR of those two inputs.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.520
This edge can activate only
if this edge is active,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.890
or this edge is active, or both.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.770
So it's an inclusive OR.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.140
Probably have some animations.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.740
Like if I flip this
guy, now this one

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.640
can choose to activate.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.800
I could also have both of them
in, or just one of them in.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.142
But in order for this one to
now go back out and deactivate,

00:15:56.142 --> 00:15:57.850
this when would first
have to deactivate.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.050
So that's ANDs and ORs.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.240
You get some sense for why
this is a Boolean logic.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.220
One point to make at this
point is that I do not

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.120
have a NOT gadget.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.730
And in fact, NOT gadgets are
impossible in this universe.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.370
Because we're always talking
about outputs can activate,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.540
but they don't have to, it's up
to the non-deterministic player

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.820
to choose whether to activate
an output, or when to do it,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.560
NOT is impossible.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.860
Because a NOT would
be something like,

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:43.810
this edge cannot activate if
this other edge is active.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.160
This output cannot activate
if this input is active.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.225
That would be the idea.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:17:00.155
Maybe output is inactive
if the input is active.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.270
And that kind of constraint
is impossible to represent

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.170
with a lower bound
on incoming weight.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.440
Maybe if you had an upper
bound, you could do it.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.260
But with a lower
bound, you're always

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.115
happier to have inputs active.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.040
So if it worked with
the input inactive

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.099
that the output could
activate, then it

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:26.130
should also work with
the input active.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.335
NOT gates are impossible.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.340
So that's a little
bit annoying, but it

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.220
won't be too much trouble.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.430
We've in some sense dealt
with that in other proofs.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.710
Before I get to these
hardness results,

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.270
let me tell you a
few other vertices

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:47.250
that are helpful, and can be
simulated with ANDs and ORs.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.520
So one of them is
a choice vertex.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.180
This is sort of like an
exclusive OR, in a sense.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.100
So two of these edges
must be incoming--

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.990
in the symmetric picture--
two of them must be incoming.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.270
At most, one of them
can be outgoing.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.020
And this can be simulated
by expanding this

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.910
into a little triangle.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:15.260
So if this guy is outgoing,
then both of these

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.470
must be pointing to it.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.580
And once both of these
are pointing out,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.589
then the blues must
be pointing in here,

00:18:23.589 --> 00:18:25.380
because the red would
not be enough to make

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.970
either of these vertices happy.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.540
If this guy's making
that guy happy.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.690
So if one of them is out,
the other two must be in.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.340
We'll see how to use
this in a second.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.910
But it's useful to have
red, red, red in addition

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.861
to red, red, blue;
and blue, blue, blue.

00:18:41.861 --> 00:18:42.360
OK.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.725
Now one issue that arises here,
as you're probably guessing,

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:49.350
especially when I did this kind
of transformation where I said,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.470
oh, three red vertices.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.294
That's just like this picture,
except these are now blue.

00:18:54.294 --> 00:18:56.210
That's not going to work
so well from whatever

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.040
they're attached to.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.430
Now luckily, we
can deal with this.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:04.160
The more direct
version is if we're

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.730
trying to build some Boolean
formula like an AND of ORs,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.975
the inputs are in the bottom.

00:19:08.975 --> 00:19:11.260
Because these are the
inputs to the AND.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.150
The AND wants its
input to be red.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.200
But the OR is providing
an output which is blue.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.420
How come we convert a
red edge to a blue edge?

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.790
Luckily, we can do it.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.190
As long as we have
an even number

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.540
of red to blue
conversions, we can

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.780
fill in this gadget in
between, and it works.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.820
So basically this is in
a forced configuration.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.635
I think it can't change at all.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.195
At least from this
position, it can't change.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.409
What we need at this stage is
that these guys can point out--

00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:50.950
both of them.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.834
So you always get a
weight boost of one

00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:55.000
from both of these vertices.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.890
And so now if this
guy's pointing in,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.020
that's a total weight of 2.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.810
And so then this
guy can point out.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.660
Of course, as this
guy is pointing in,

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.360
this guy can point out.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.760
And it's symmetric
on the two sides.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.225
So maybe you do try to
mess with this gadget.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:09.940
Although I don't think you can.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.640
What we need is that you are
allowed to leave it like this,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.620
and you get a bonus point
for each of those vertices,

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.510
and all is well.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.230
And we'll see later how to make
an even number of conversions.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.620
Now one thing I should maybe
mention at this point also--

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.480
this is sort of a
technical detail--

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.430
but if you used to think of
this as a single edge, when

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.230
I reversed it-- let's say
it was pointing up before,

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.820
and I make it point
down-- this vertex

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.690
will see that
effect immediately.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.740
This vertex doesn't see it yet.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.160
So it's kind of an even
more delayed reaction.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.110
Because we subdivided
an edge into two parts,

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:50.040
we can flip one side without
having flipped the other side.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.750
The way I would view this is in
the original constraint logic

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.560
graph, we used to have
an edge pointing up.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.360
We change it into
an undirected edge.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.860
It has no orientation because
it doesn't benefit either side.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.520
It's pointing away
from both ends.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.760
And then we choose to
direct it the other way.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.940
So this is an alternative view
of a move in a constraint graph

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.360
that used to be you're
reversing an edge.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.350
Another view is that you
can change a directed edge

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.360
into an undirected edge.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.818
And you can change an undirected
edge into a directed edge.

00:21:21.818 --> 00:21:24.500
So these models are
almost identical.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.190
In fact, you can prove they're
exactly the same power.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.770
And they're called
asynchronous constraint logic.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.260
So if you were worried about
that, you don't need to worry.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.260
I won't prove here that
they're identical power,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.050
but it's not hard.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:54.550
Yeah.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.928
AUDIENCE: What was the thing
where [INAUDIBLE] that you

00:21:56.928 --> 00:21:58.146
can't flip those colors?

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.581
Cause you can flip
the colors, right?

00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:02.569
But you can flip
the two red arrows

00:22:02.569 --> 00:22:03.110
AUDIENCE: In.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.390
AUDIENCE: Inwards.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.809
And then you can flip the
blue to cover the top node.

00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:08.350
AUDIENCE: Basically
flip all of them.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.350
AUDIENCE: So the thing--

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.236
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:11.236 --> 00:22:12.850
AUDIENCE: And the
best you can do is--

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.891
PROFESSOR: You can't put
flip these red guys yet.

00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:17.440
Are you going to flip
this blue guy first?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:17.940
But how?

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.820
AUDIENCE: Well, you
can't do anything first.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.150
Nothing can happen first.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.441
There is another configuration.

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.269
But from here, I
think it's rigid.

00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.810
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.770
PROFESSOR: There's
nothing that can change.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.840
You can't flip this guy because
this guy would be unhappy.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.440
Therefore, you
can't flip this guy.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.710
Therefore, you can't
flip these guys.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.758
Therefore, you
can't flip this guy.

00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:43.100
So I think you get a cycle,
and nothing can happen first.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.570
But we don't need that here.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.780
We will need it later.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:48.141
That's why I wanted to mention.

00:22:48.141 --> 00:22:48.640
OK.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.030
So we can convert reds to blues.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.930
So now we can chain
things together

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.210
and build a CNF formula.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.200
As long as we
represent-- so here

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.850
we're going to use a choice
gadget to say-- so right now,

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.740
nothing is activated.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.160
Our goal is to
activate that edge

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.660
at the top that's
going to represent

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.860
that Boolean formula, the
satisfiability of that Boolean

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.440
formula.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.660
We use a choice gadget to say,
look, either W can activate,

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.600
or Wbar can activate.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.000
We need some notion of negation.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.960
And this is how
we're going to get

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.500
our negation, which is normally
called dual real logic.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.650
You have one
channel representing

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.980
X, one representing Xbar.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.980
We have this extra
straggler, which we basically

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.970
don't care about.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.800
Right now it is taking
the weight somewhere.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.960
But you can push it up.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.320
If we plug-in a suitable
terminator down there,

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.200
which we'll need to talk about.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.880
But then, other than
red/blue conversions,

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.880
then we are basically
doing an OR.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.640
We have to do an
OR of three things,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.790
and we only have degree 3.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.052
So we do an OR of two things.

00:23:47.052 --> 00:23:48.010
That gives this output.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.750
Then we take an OR
of the other thing.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.160
So now this output is
the OR of three things.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.830
We convert it into a red edge.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.020
This is a reference to
the gadget we just saw.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.400
And then we can
take an AND, here

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.900
we're taking an AND
of three things.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.775
In general, it would be
an AND of end things.

00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:04.070
We build a binary
tree of those ANDs.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.510
And so that edge can
reverse if and only

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.100
if that formula is satisfiable.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.610
Assuming we know what to
do with degree 1 vertices.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.260
So this represents CNF.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.570
Let me tell you what to
do with degree 1 vertices.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.630
Here are three
different gadgets,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.740
depending on what
you want to do.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.090
On the one hand, this is an
unconstrained blue terminator.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.400
All the vertices are
happy even locally.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.800
And so this edge
can go up or down.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.500
I think that's pretty clear.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.650
This guy already has
two incoming edges.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.890
Everybody has at least one.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.322
And the point here is
it's three regular.

00:24:43.322 --> 00:24:45.030
So this is actually
a kind of classic way

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.370
to make a three regular graph
out of a degree 1 vertex.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.530
On the other hand, we can
do the same thing with red.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.930
And actually, the reason I
wanted two incoming edges here

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.513
is when I recolor
them red, that still

00:24:56.513 --> 00:24:58.040
makes this vertex satisfied.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.679
So this guy can go up or down.

00:24:59.679 --> 00:25:01.970
Now you might say why do I
care about a blue terminator

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.011
separate from a red
terminator, because I already

00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:05.690
have red to blue conversion.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.960
Because red/blue
conversion-- assume

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.510
that the number of red/blue
conversions was even.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.950
And this is how I'm
going to make it even.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.100
If it's not even, I'll take
any of my degree 1 vertices

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.180
and add an extra red/blue
conversion there.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.490
Now it will be even,
because it was odd before.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.410
But I need either a
red or blue terminator,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.460
whatever I didn't have before.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.520
So this is where we'll get that.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.310
And it's easy to do.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.980
In the middle we have
a different thing.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.300
This forces this edge
to be pointed down.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:43.620
That's useful in some
scenarios for example.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.890
So back to this picture.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.610
One thing I've done is we
have these floating edges

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.390
that we want to throw away.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.339
We can just use a red terminator
unconstrained for that.

00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:54.880
So that guy can do
whatever he wants.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.040
That still lets you choose
W or Wbar to be true.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.910
If I shrink this picture a
little bit more and put here,

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.740
this is I guess a
free terminator.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.550
I don't care whether
this guy's used also.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.480
But I would really like
this edge to be directed up.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.530
This is, of course,
locally invalid.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.180
You have to put in a satisfying
assignment to make this go up.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.410
So this is how we can
prove that constraint graph

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.540
satisfiability, finding an
orientation is NP complete

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:35.570
if we use that
terminator on the top.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.630
In the undirected
form, this thing

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.090
will force this
edge to be up, which

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:42.060
means it will force this
thing to be satisfied,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.555
or there won't be a
valid orientation,

00:26:44.555 --> 00:26:45.930
which means there's
no satisfying

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.370
assignment to that formula.

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.370
So that's one way you
could use the terminators.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.578
We'll use them in other ways.

00:26:50.578 --> 00:26:53.330
AUDIENCE: Can we just use a
[INAUDIBLE] red terminator

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.958
instead of the red-- to
do a red [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:56.958 --> 00:26:59.549
instead of the slightly more
complicated thing we actually

00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:00.049
did?

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:01.548
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
red terminator

00:27:01.548 --> 00:27:04.785
has a vertex with
three red edges.

00:27:04.785 --> 00:27:05.660
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.760
But maybe that's relevant.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.710
So this is going
to expand to this.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.210
And that requires a
red/blue conversion.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.910
There we go.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.010
That's why.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:24.525
So we're actually already
using a red/blue conversion

00:27:24.525 --> 00:27:32.000
of this style in here.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.500
All right.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.300
Let's move on to more
interesting things.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.540
So that was constraint graph
satisfactions NP complete.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.500
Let's go to the reconfiguration
problems being PSPACE complete.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:52.050
So now I want to do a sequence
of moves and flip one edge,

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:54.490
or reach a desired
configuration.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.080
We'll start with just
flipping one edge.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.130
We're going to follow the
same kind of prototype

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.220
that we saw last class, with
[? Viglietta's ?] Proof, where

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.320
we're going to reduce from QSAT.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.970
So we have this alternating
set of quantifiers, variables.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.440
And then we have
some Boolean formula.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.070
We'll assume it's in CNF
form, because we just

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.090
showed how to do CNF formulas.

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:19.680
And we're going to
represent variables

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.130
by two rails, x and x bar.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.210
And these things are essentially
nested inside each other,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.950
and there's some
magic mechanisms

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.030
to glue them together.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:34.110
So in particular, let's see.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.940
At the end here, so
suppose these variables,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.101
the idea is that one of
them will be pointing up

00:28:40.101 --> 00:28:41.600
and the other will
be pointing down.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.430
That corresponds
to x being true.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.440
If y bar is pointing up
and y is pointing down,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.880
then y bar will be true.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.640
In other words, y will be false.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.050
So then this thing will
do its computation.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.390
And then the output
wire is this one.

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.450
So we'll be pointing
out of the CNF logic,

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.680
if and only if that formula
without the quantifiers

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.241
was satisfied.

00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:02.740
OK.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.110
Now here we have an AND gate.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.590
And we have a signal from
this gadget saying basically,

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.910
all the variables are set.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.200
And here it's called try out.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.850
We'll see what that means.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.700
Basically I want to check
whether this thing is true.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.300
And if the try out
is pointing out,

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.390
and the satisfy thing
is pointing out,

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.880
then this guy can
point to the left.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.660
And so that will
tell this gadget

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.800
that yes, it is satisfied.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.950
So when activated, and this
thing has become satisfied,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.630
then we will report
back to that gadget.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.880
In general, each of the
quantifier gadgets--

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.130
this is an existential one,
this is the universal one.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.910
Don't look at them in
too much detail yet.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.870
But there will be one input
here, which is a try in.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.770
And there'll be an output,
which is a try out, to say,

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.200
when I'm told by the previous
gadget to do something,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.210
I'll do something.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.530
Then I'll tell the next
gadget to do something.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:00.412
And if that gadget reports
back with a positive answer,

00:30:00.412 --> 00:30:02.620
in this case, I just return
that positive answer back

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.330
to my caller.

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.550
So this is the input
and the output.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.900
And same thing for universal.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.250
It's going to have a try in.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.920
It's going to
activate a try out.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.140
Then if it gets a satisfied
end, stuff will happen.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.120
And eventually we might
output a satisfied out.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.870
So these things are
supposed to just chain

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.650
together left and right.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.080
So let's look at each
gadget individually,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.580
and in particular, you will
see this triangle pattern--

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.170
the blue, blue, red triangle--
in a few different places.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.980
That's a useful
construction by itself.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.200
Let's think about that first.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.170
It's called a latch.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.930
It's like a one-bit memory.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.920
Currently the latch is locked.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.920
When this edge out is
pointing to the left,

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:47.370
then nothing over
here can change.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.560
There are actually two
possible states here.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.950
But if this is
pointing out, this guy

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.460
can't flip, which means
these two can't flip,

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.180
which means this one can't flip.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.910
OK.

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.840
I guess this guy could reverse.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.870
But that's all.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.410
So this is in a state where
A can output something,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.270
but B cannot.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.690
Now I can flip it to the
other symmetric state,

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.190
where B can output
something and A cannot.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.120
But to do that, I first
must unlock the gadget,

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.050
unlock the latch by
flipping this edge.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.900
If I can flip this edge,
then everything becomes free.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.370
Now I can flip this edge.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.480
And then I can flip
B actually now.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.660
Both A and B can output, which
is kind of a weird state.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.100
But in particular, I
can flip this edge.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.350
And then maybe put A back.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.340
That will let me flip this guy.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.790
And now this guy's
happy from this edge.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.155
And so I can relock the
gadget if I want to.

00:31:48.155 --> 00:31:49.470
If I click hard enough.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.940
So now we're back
in a lock state.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.050
And now B can output.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.340
It could choose to not output.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.560
But B can output.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.430
A cannot.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.340
So when the gadget
is in a lock state,

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.350
we get at most one signal from
A or B. And it can't change.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.702
When we unlock, then we can do
crazy stuff, have both of them

00:32:10.702 --> 00:32:11.410
output, whatever.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.060
But then when we relock, we know
that only one of them is on.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.384
And that's our one-bit memory.

00:32:17.384 --> 00:32:19.300
At this point, it's a
nondeterministic memory.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.860
You can basically set it to
a nondeterministic value,

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.301
and then lock it down.

00:32:23.301 --> 00:32:23.800
OK.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.030
This is great for
existential quantifiers.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:28.620
That's basically all we need
for an existential quantifier.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.580
When we're told do
something, we're

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.200
going to convert
that blue to a red.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.949
So right now this
vertex is happy,

00:32:41.949 --> 00:32:44.240
because we haven't told the
next gadget to do anything.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.790
This edge is
pointed to the left.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.180
So this thing can go up or
down, whatever it wants.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.780
So basically we are free
to unlock this and set it

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.720
to either value.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.890
So where x is pointing out,
or x bar is pointing out,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:32:59.980
or neither.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.050
But the direction of
this edge will sort of

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.030
keep track of which
thing is being set.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.580
Then the next thing can activate
only when this is pointing out,

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.410
which means the latch is locked.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.450
So when we activate
the next existential

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.000
or universal quantifier,
or the overall formula,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.711
we know both that
we're told we're

00:33:20.711 --> 00:33:22.210
activated from the
left, which means

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.626
all the variables
to the left have

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.420
been locked into their state.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.600
And we know from this
AND gate that this

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.820
has been locked into its state.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:34.170
So it has only x or x bar set.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.174
And then we can proceed.

00:33:35.174 --> 00:33:37.340
And for existential quantifier,
that's all you need.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.300
That there's some
value, some setting

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.405
for x, that satisfies the rest.

00:33:41.405 --> 00:33:43.780
And so if you get satisfied
from the rest of the formula,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.930
you know you are satisfied.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.680
And so here we're using
the nondeterminism

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.840
of the player to make the right
call whether to set x or x bar.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.590
That's the easy case.

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.580
The harder case is the
universal quantifier.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.240
Here we actually
use two latches.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.910
And there's a bunch of lines.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.190
So what's the idea?

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.679
This is viewed as
a split gadget.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:18.440
So if we activate here,
we can do that only

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.340
with this pointing down.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:20.840
OK.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.880
Fine.

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.095
And this points over.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:32.239
For the computation to
proceed, to do a try out,

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.230
we need that we are
active from the try in.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.000
But also, this latch
must be locked.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.530
This is the locking
mechanism of that latch.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.100
So when both of
these are incoming,

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.070
then we will call the
rest of the construction.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.679
Again, this is just setting
x or x bar, just like before.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.670
But we're making
copies of x and x bar.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.870
So this is a split gadget.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.780
If we have this set, we
can set both this copy

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.600
of x and this copy of x.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.240
If we have this one set, we
can set this copy of x bar

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.440
and this copy of x bar.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.890
So those are splits.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:05.440
OK.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.450
So now, what about this latch?

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:14.020
So this is the locking
mechanism of that latch.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:19.820
And what we're saying
is that if x bar is set,

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:28.100
and the formula is satisfied,
then we can unlock this latch

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.980
and set it to something.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.510
Now we will want to set
it so that this edge is

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.220
pointing down.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.740
Initially this edge will
probably be pointing out.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.130
It doesn't have to, though.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:42.840
So we don't really
care about this edge.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.465
It doesn't bias
anything, this edge.

00:35:44.465 --> 00:35:46.590
Because we're going to have
a blue thing coming in,

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.830
so we don't really care
which way this edge goes.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.470
We really want to set this edge.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.240
So if you're the
nondeterministic player,

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.400
and suddenly this
latch is open, you

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:59.060
will want to rearrange it
so that it points down.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.560
Why?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.143
Because we want to
satisfy this thing.

00:36:01.143 --> 00:36:03.850
And this is an AND of
this edge and that edge.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.200
So what this is saying is
we can turn this latch on,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:13.030
meaning pointing down here, only
if for the false setting of x,

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.820
we get a satisfied thing.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.820
Cause here again, we're
taking a satisfied thing

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.460
and splitting it into two parts.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.270
And so satisfied in is true.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.790
And x bar is true.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:26.280
Then we can activate this
latch and set to the new thing.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.170
Now what do you do?

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.130
Now we're going
to lock the latch,

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:33.850
and then roll back the
entire computation.

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:34.896
Undo everything.

00:36:34.896 --> 00:36:36.520
In this world,
everything's reversible.

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.071
If you can reverse an edge,
you can also put it back.

00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:39.570
OK.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:41.180
So now unwind everything.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:46.600
Come back to this place and
unlock this latch again.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.080
And now set x to true
instead of false.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.430
And then once this is
locked in the true state,

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.204
we can again activate tryout.

00:36:57.204 --> 00:36:59.120
And now we're going to
come back through here.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.411
We don't care about this latch.

00:37:00.411 --> 00:37:02.000
We're now going to
use this vertex.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.580
This is the AND of being
satisfied and having

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:05.680
x being true.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.710
So if we're satisfied
with x true,

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.360
then this edge will be
pointing to the left.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.510
And if we already
remembered the fact

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.940
that when we set x to
false, we also got true,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.680
then this AND will be true.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.060
And then we can output that.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.110
OK?

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.636
So this is why you don't want to
reduce from QSAT all the time.

00:37:23.636 --> 00:37:25.760
There are these annoying
gadgets you have to build.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.490
But now once you
have this, we just

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:29.938
need to build ANDs and
ORs, which is much easier.

00:37:29.938 --> 00:37:31.930
AUDIENCE: If we
have nondeterminism,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.500
do we ever have to
roll back things?

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.217
Can't we just set
it to the right one?

00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:36.800
PROFESSOR: No.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.717
With the universal
quantifier for all--

00:37:38.717 --> 00:37:39.550
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.300
PROFESSOR: You need
to check both of them.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.385
Yeah.

00:37:42.385 --> 00:37:44.093
AUDIENCE: Do you need
to build crossovers

00:37:44.093 --> 00:37:45.240
for this gadget to work?

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:45.570
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:46.611
We would need crossovers.

00:37:46.611 --> 00:37:47.610
But we'll get there.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.900
So we're not yet
doing planar graphs.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.070
At this point, I think we have
proved by this construction

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:59.250
that for nonplanar graphs,
and only AND and OR gates,

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.610
we have PSPACE completeness
of flipping one edge.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:04.110
OK.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:09.460
Now what if you wanted to
go from one configuration

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.070
to another?

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:16.340
Then I could just
put a latch here

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.470
that's unlocked by this thing.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.240
The goal usually is,
can I flip this edge.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.080
Because if I can
flip this edge, that

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.740
means the whole formula is true.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.550
So all the quantifier
constructions.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:31.100
If I put a latch here, and
I can activate the latch

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.520
and then change
its state, then I

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.585
could roll back
everything else, and I

00:38:35.585 --> 00:38:36.960
would back to the
original state,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.680
except the latch is flipped.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.810
And that will be possible
only if the formula is true.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.390
So that's how you can predict
the entire configuration.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.490
Nothing will have
changed, except this one

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.170
edge, two edges.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.670
Whatever.

00:38:51.612 --> 00:38:53.315
So next question is planarity.

00:38:53.315 --> 00:38:57.430
But for nonplanar
graphs, we're good.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.200
Here's a crossover.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.850
It's a little bit annoying, I
mean, to check all the cases.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.670
But this is going to be
a blue, blue crossover.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:14.820
So basically these
three edges will

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.600
be in the same
orientation, roughly.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.457
And these three
edges will be-- I

00:39:21.457 --> 00:39:23.790
mean I can't say they're
always in the same orientation.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:26.680
Because there's a
transition period.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.700
So I think they
could both point in.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.970
That's like an undirected edge.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.220
But if this guy's
pointing to the left,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.810
then this guy must
point to the left.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:35.190
Why?

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:36.650
Cause this points to the
left, and both of these

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.840
are pointing to the left.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.700
This is pointing
either up or down.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.425
Let's say it's pointing up.

00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:44.550
That will actually have to
do with the other edges.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.280
But if it's pointing
up, and this

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.220
is pointing left-- oh, notice
here I have a degree 4.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.350
It's another gadget.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.920
Please wait.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.400
But this is the
usual constraint.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.880
There must be a weight of
at least two coming in.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.270
And so if both of these are out,
then both of these must be in.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:06.320
If this is this way, then
this must be to the left.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.840
So if this is to the left,
then this must be to the left.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.290
And by the same argument,
this must be to the left.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:13.260
So that's how you
transition horizontally.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.850
And it's a similar
thing vertically.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.590
If this is pointing
up, then both of these

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.890
must be pointing
into that vertex.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:25.019
And this guy's either
pointing left or right.

00:40:25.019 --> 00:40:26.310
That depends on the other edge.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.639
But let's say it's
pointing to the right.

00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:30.680
So if that's pointing to
the right, both of these

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.090
are pointing to the
right, which means

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.020
both of these are pointing
out, which means both of these

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.960
must be pointing in.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.820
And so if this is pointing
out, this is pointing up.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.620
I mean, it depends.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.440
If this is pointing up,
then this is pointing up.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.480
Or this is pointing up.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.740
One of them, depending on
the state of this edge.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.640
But then you can use that again
to prove this is pointing up.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.530
So it could be they're both
pointing in here or here.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:57.530
But that's like an
undirected edge.

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.830
And so if you believe in
asynchronous constraint logic,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.140
this is simulating
the crossover.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.270
So except we have degree 4
red, red, red, red vertices.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:15.180
So we need one more
gadget, which is this one.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.060
This essentially
simulates, of course,

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.087
the edges here are blue.

00:41:21.087 --> 00:41:22.670
That's why I've drawn
off to the side.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.336
Now here we have to
be a little careful,

00:41:24.336 --> 00:41:26.690
because we need that the
red/blue transitions do not

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:27.660
introduce crossings.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.951
Because if we did, we'd have
to use a crossover gadget.

00:41:29.951 --> 00:41:32.400
And we'd get in this
infinite recursion.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.260
But you can just stick this
on here and turn it red,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:39.260
and connect it to this guy,
and similarly over here.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.009
And you convert them all the
red without any crossings.

00:41:43.009 --> 00:41:44.800
And I think I won't go
through this gadget,

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.040
but it simulates the
constraint that at least two

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.860
of these edges must be
pointing into the gadget.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.040
Cool.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.570
So that was a blue,
blue crossover.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:00.150
If you have a red,
blue crossover,

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:04.427
or red, red crossover,
again convert red to blue,

00:42:04.427 --> 00:42:05.260
and then back again.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.620
One more version.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.810
So we just did planar
graphs, or PSPACE complete.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:23.370
If you draw your
planar graph in a grid,

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.410
naturally you would
also want the ability

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.670
to just take an edge and
go left or make a turn.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.980
So do we need turn gadgets
and straight gadgets?

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.000
The answer is no.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.700
We can use ANDs and ORs.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.610
Actually we can just use ANDs
to simulate wires and turns.

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:43.300
So suppose this is one of
the gadgets that takes inputs

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.320
from two adjacent sides
and outputs on one

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.830
of the other adjacent sides.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.600
Then it's always going to
look like this pattern,

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.370
all of the instances of the
AND gate are rotations of that.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.810
I think no reflections.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:02.770
So first we build these fillers.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.810
These fillers, I guess we'll
give them some initial state

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:11.740
where we get to choose.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:17.420
So maybe I think I want all
these edges to be pointing out.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.720
So I'm going to set
everything to 0.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.610
It's going to be
0 and 0 equals 0.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:24.820
So that's locally
consistent within the cycle.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.820
And it means that this
edge is free to point out

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.540
if it wants to.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.776
So in particular, I guess I want
these four wires to be zeroes.

00:43:33.776 --> 00:43:35.150
And so then this
one could be 01,

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.670
and still consistent
with the ANDs.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:39.830
And so that means when
I put that box here,

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.240
this is one of those
filler gadgets,

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.130
that I have one unit
of flow-- because those

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.130
are red edges-- pointing out.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.980
And so in particular here,
if I have a unit here,

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.580
I get a free unit from the
side, and therefore the AND

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.550
will be the same as the input.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.560
So I put two by two blocks here.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.390
I also have a
similar two by three

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.650
block, which I put
in these chunks.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.900
And then this will just
copy whatever value

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.472
is here, up there.

00:44:08.472 --> 00:44:09.930
Again,
nondeterministically, we can

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.270
have both of them pointing
in, but this one can point out

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.660
only if this one can point in.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.560
This can activate only
if this can activate.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.390
That's a straight.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.537
Turn is similar.

00:44:21.537 --> 00:44:23.370
And if you want to do
an actual computation,

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.600
you put whatever gadget
is you want to compute,

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.950
and use these to copy the data.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.162
Question.

00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:31.106
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:32.500
Do you have [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.000
I'm sorry.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.460
The square filler into the top
right of the straight grid.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:35.960
Yeah.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.100
AUDIENCE: There's a
terminator at the input--

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.300
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.080
You mean there's an
edge here which doesn't

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.163
have anything on the side.

00:44:41.163 --> 00:44:41.731
That's true.

00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:42.230
Yes.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.940
So that's this little thing.

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.840
So in this particular world,
this won't work for all proofs,

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.410
but it's sort of an example
of what you could do.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.310
There needs to be an input
here which you ignore.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.864
So it's like a degree 1 vertex.

00:44:55.864 --> 00:44:56.530
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.729
And then we can [INAUDIBLE]
everything's OK.

00:44:59.729 --> 00:45:01.940
PROFESSOR: I mean,
the point is you

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.550
have to only build
one gadget-- or two

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.827
gadgets, the AND and the OR.

00:45:04.827 --> 00:45:07.160
But it has to have this feature
that when you stick them

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:12.280
on the-- you stick
an input to this gate

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.060
into a non-used neighboring
side from this gate,

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.570
then it just works.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.110
So we'll see an example
where that happens.

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:20.610
Yeah.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.050
AUDIENCE: Can you turn right?

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.750
PROFESSOR: I'm
guessing to turn right,

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.800
we might actually need the
reflected form of the AND.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.670
But most gadgets, if it works
one way and you reflect it,

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:35.620
it also works.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.790
So yeah.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:38.295
Good.

00:45:38.295 --> 00:45:38.980
One more.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.146
AUDIENCE: Silly question
about what nondeterministic

00:45:41.146 --> 00:45:42.350
means in this case.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:44.870
Since we've been using
nondeterministic to mean

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.875
you can guess correctly.

00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:48.460
And to mean that the [INAUDIBLE]
aren't being reflected.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.355
So what exactly does it mean?

00:45:50.355 --> 00:45:51.980
PROFESSOR: What was
the second version?

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.710
The edges--

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.057
AUDIENCE: About the edges
taking a while to transfer.

00:45:55.057 --> 00:45:55.640
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.890
No sir, that was asynchronous.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:59.599
Asynchronous is that
they take awhile.

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:01.265
Nondeterministic is
that the player gets

00:46:01.265 --> 00:46:02.880
to choose which edge to flip.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.310
They're related.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.370
I mean, asynchrony
kind of comes out

00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:09.656
of this form of
nondeterminism that we have.

00:46:09.656 --> 00:46:10.780
But they don't have to be.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:12.280
The way I originally
set the models,

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.880
when you flip an
edge instantaneously.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.520
In both the gadgets that we
build, like the actual AND

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.789
and OR gates we build
for real problems,

00:46:20.789 --> 00:46:22.580
they will actually take
awhile to activate.

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.490
You'll like pull some
things in, and stuff

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.940
happens before you can
pull some things out.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.649
So we will naturally
get asynchrony.

00:46:31.649 --> 00:46:34.190
The way is originally set it
up, it was just nondeterministic

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:36.700
and having instantaneous flips.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.360
But they're the
same, so you don't

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.420
have to worry too much
about that distinction.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.770
OK.

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:50.780
One more gadget before I
go to actual reductions.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.992
And this is the definition
of a protected OR.

00:46:53.992 --> 00:46:57.150
I call it protector OR.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.950
Cause more ORs is better.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.296
But protected OR
is the proper name.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:09.100
Protected OR gadget
looks like an OR gadget.

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:18.550
So we're going to have
two inputs, one output.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.530
And these are going to be
labeled which are which.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:28.880
I want that at most one
input is active at any time.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.310
What I mean here
is that if I ever

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.820
have the state where
both of these are active,

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:42.440
then the entire
universe explodes.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.705
And I give no guarantees.

00:47:43.705 --> 00:47:45.330
I mean, not only does
this gadget fail,

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:48.740
but all gadgets everywhere
could self-destruct.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.990
Because we're going to
build some gadgets where

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.930
you really only want
one of these two things

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:53.970
to be pointing in.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:57.270
If they both point
in, then the framework

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.464
that separates
gadgets may shatter.

00:48:00.464 --> 00:48:02.130
And then gadgets are
no longer separate.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:03.255
You can't argue about them.

00:48:03.255 --> 00:48:06.690
And literally
everything falls apart.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.130
So we'll see some
examples of that,

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.580
but this sort of foreshadowing.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.040
It turns out we can set
things up so that you never

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.130
have both things
pointing into an OR.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.910
Because we can build a fully
fledged OR out of those

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:23.550
protected ORs.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:30.900
So this gadget acts as an OR
where these two are the input

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.340
say, and that's the output.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.270
But it does so only
using protected ORs.

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.219
Now it uses a blue
to red transition.

00:48:38.219 --> 00:48:40.510
So we have to again inspect
the blue to red transition.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.150
This is where I wanted
that this is rigid,

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.560
that you cannot make
any moves in here,

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.186
because that makes me
happy about this OR.

00:48:49.186 --> 00:48:50.685
This is the only
OR in this picture.

00:48:50.685 --> 00:48:53.400
And I might worry, maybe I
could flip one of these edges,

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.490
and then I have two
inputs activated.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.530
But because no edges can
flip from this state,

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:02.360
in fact, this guy will
only have one pointing in,

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.080
so no matter how you label
the inputs and outputs,

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.800
it is a protected OR.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.520
OK.

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.350
So that part is fine.

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:14.114
And now this simulates an OR.

00:49:14.114 --> 00:49:15.280
Do we want to go through it?

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.340
Hm?

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.089
AUDIENCE: Which of the
inputs [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:22.721
PROFESSOR: So this is one input,
and this is the other input.

00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:23.220
Oh.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:23.820
For these ORs?

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:25.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:28.942
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
guess-- well, let's find out.

00:49:28.942 --> 00:49:29.650
I don't remember.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.340
So let's say this
guy is pointing in.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:39.430
So if this is also pointing
down, then this can point up.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.890
But if this is
pointing down, this

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:45.830
must point up and to the left
in order to satisfy this node.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.080
So if this is coming in, this
one must be pointing out.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.730
So I'm going to say
that's the output.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.740
These are the two inputs.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.860
I'm guessing
symmetrically, yeah.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:01.470
If this one is pointing
into the vertex,

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.340
then that must mean
both of these red guys

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:04.840
are pointing into
that vertex, which

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.105
means this guy must be
pointing out of that vertex.

00:50:07.105 --> 00:50:10.400
So if this one is active for
this guy, this guy's inactive.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.750
And vice versa.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.330
So this is protected
from those two.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.780
Similarly over here.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.200
But if this is active, and this
is down, and this is active,

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:27.490
and this is pointing up, then in
particular, this can point out.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:31.100
And this guy's satisfied.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.020
So then this edge can
point to the right.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.721
And then this one
can point up here.

00:50:34.721 --> 00:50:35.720
And this can point here.

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.270
So the AND actually
outputs a yes.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.610
So if the left is activated,
then C can activate as well,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.730
and symmetrically.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:44.980
So this simulates an
OR, but it's guaranteed

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.930
that these two guys are happy.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:47.584
Yeah.

00:50:47.584 --> 00:50:48.250
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.290
I just want to understand
the motivation for this,

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.225
just to make our
gadget-building lives easier?

00:50:51.225 --> 00:50:51.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.340
This is just to make our
gadget-building lives easier.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.510
It's so that I can now say
that deciding whether a planar

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:03.300
graph can do a sequence
of moves and flip an edge

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:09.800
is hard for AND
and protected OR.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.210
So that's a stronger statement.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.470
Now I only need to
build a protected OR.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.140
In general, we want to reduce
the complexity of our gadgets

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.210
as much as possible for the
hard part, which is actually

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.630
analyzing a real problem.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.130
Yeah.

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.370
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.239
So is protected OR
easier to build than OR?

00:51:24.239 --> 00:51:26.030
PROFESSOR: Protected
OR is easier to build,

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:29.440
because you don't need
to worry about the case

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.233
for both inputs are active.

00:51:31.233 --> 00:51:31.775
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:31.775 --> 00:51:33.524
PROFESSOR: So you could
have any behavior.

00:51:33.524 --> 00:51:35.190
You might have the
correct OR behavior,

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.240
or you could have any
other behavior, including

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.610
self-destruction.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:42.190
Or universe
destruction, I guess.

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.295
So it could only
be easier to build.

00:51:44.295 --> 00:51:45.920
AUDIENCE: This is
for future reduction?

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.550
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:48.300
In fact, the very next
reduction, I think.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.480
Or the one after that.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.261
Close enough.

00:51:50.261 --> 00:51:50.760
All right.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.910
Let's do real
reduction, shall we?

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:56.790
So all of this stuff
that you just saw

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.010
was built for one problem
initially, and then

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.190
happened to be useful
for a lot more.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.500
And that's sliding
block puzzles.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.390
So these are a bunch of examples
of sliding block puzzles.

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:11.130
You have blocks-- let's
say typically rectangles--

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.050
and you're an
agent from outside.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.320
You can pick any block
you want and slide it

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.740
along some non-colliding path.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.156
So I can move this over, and
then move this over, and then

00:52:20.156 --> 00:52:21.150
move this guy down.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:24.540
In this case, the goal is
to move this block to here.

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.750
Because there's a-- well, I
think that's just the goal.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.500
These puzzles go
back to the '20s.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.190
Martin Gardner wrote about them.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.120
And in his article, called
"Sliding-Block Puzzles,"

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.860
he says these puzzles are
in want of a general theory.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:42.480
And there is no general
theory because they're PSPACE

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:42.980
complete.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.140
There's no way to easily
tell whether a puzzle's going

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:47.598
to be solvable or not, which
is annoying for puzzle design,

00:52:47.598 --> 00:52:49.052
but there you go.

00:52:49.052 --> 00:52:51.260
Here's an actual instance
of the puzzle I showed you.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.080
Dad's Puzzle, where
you take this one.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.413
You're supposed to move it here.

00:52:54.413 --> 00:52:56.640
This optimal solution
has 83 moves.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.080
And in general,
number of moves is

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.120
going to grow exponentially,
because the problem is PSPACE

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.352
complete.

00:53:03.352 --> 00:53:05.310
And here's the proof that
it's PSPACE complete,

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:06.350
in two pictures.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:09.710
We need an AND gate
and an OR gate.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:14.810
And the point is, so here the
notion of edges being active

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:19.050
is maybe reversed from
what you think about.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:20.800
This edge is currently inactive.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:24.350
And if I slide this
block out by one,

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:29.010
that activates that edge,
meaning it points up.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:30.720
So right now the edge
is pointing down.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.410
If I move this block down,
then the edge is pointing up.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.542
So it may seem backwards.

00:53:34.542 --> 00:53:36.250
But if you don't think
about it too much,

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.540
it's actually very clear.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.470
What I mean to say is that in
order to move this block down

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.730
by one, I must first move
this block left by one,

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:50.470
and this block down by one.

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.510
So for this guy to be sucked
in, this guy must be kicked out,

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:54.990
and this guy must be kicked out.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.900
Because then I can slide
this block over one.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.090
And then I can slide
this block over and down.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.260
Then I can slide this
down and then this down.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.260
With that sequence of
moves, I can move this in.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.450
But I needed enough
room to do it.

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:09.530
So that's an AND gadget,
an asynchronous world.

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:13.120
And the OR gadget, this guy will
be able to move in if and only

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:16.240
if at least one of these guys
moves out, because if say,

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.100
this one moves out,
this could move down,

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.670
this guy can move over,
and this can move down.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.000
And if the other one happened,
this guy can move over too.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.390
And then this can move down.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:29.624
At this point we don't
need a protected OR.

00:54:29.624 --> 00:54:31.040
Now you have to
think a little bit

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:33.370
about how these gadgets
are fit together,

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.550
but I guess that's
the next slide.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:40.840
Before that, here we have 1
by 2 blocks and 1 by 3 blocks.

00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.960
That's not satisfying
because it's not tight.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.750
One by one blocks
are polynomial,

00:54:44.750 --> 00:54:46.780
so we can't do
one by one blocks.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.870
But it's turns out just
1 by 2 blocks are enough.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:54.880
And these were found by a
semi-automatic computer search.

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.530
And I programmed it
[INAUDIBLE] to analyze.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.480
In particular, these dots
mean that there will always

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:06.990
be one of the blocks
overlapping that position.

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:09.910
So like even if this
guy moves out by one,

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:10.926
this is still occupied.

00:55:10.926 --> 00:55:13.050
And so you could use that
analysis to help cut down

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:17.420
the search and see that actually
all of the gray tiles cannot

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:23.260
move at all, assuming that you
don't have boundary effects.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.491
And only the yellow
tiles can move.

00:55:25.491 --> 00:55:27.490
And that kind of highlights
where the action is.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:30.385
Again, if this guy slides
out, and this guy slides out,

00:55:30.385 --> 00:55:31.760
then you get this
chain reaction.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:32.980
And this can move down.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:36.850
It needs two units of space.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.570
And then this guy can move down.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.840
And similarly, if this one moves
out, or this one moves out,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.410
this guy has some freedom
about how he moves.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.330
And there's a couple
extra units to gain.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.830
Then this guy can move out.

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:51.734
Now this is a protected
OR, it turns out.

00:55:51.734 --> 00:55:53.650
It's not going to be
obvious from the picture,

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.120
but if both of these move
out, the whole gadget

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.580
can fall apart.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.780
So this is the genesis
of protected ORs.

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:05.465
But I won't go into
the details here.

00:56:05.465 --> 00:56:07.090
I guess I don't have
a figure about how

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:08.360
the gadgets fit together.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:11.940
But essentially these
corners interact.

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:14.930
Because here we're vertical
and here we're horizontal,

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:17.530
you get a little nexus
where nothing can move.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:20.150
So as long as the
overall boundary

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.460
is fixed-- the big
rectangular box that we're

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.460
fitting in-- you get
this chain reaction

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.320
that because this point
is always occupied,

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.310
even if this slides
up or down one,

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.630
you transfer the
rigidity of this edge

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:34.980
to the rigidity of this edge.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:37.860
And so you get that all of the
gadget boundaries are rigid,

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.900
and it's just the action
in the yellow tiles,

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.830
because of these
dots, basically.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.570
And I think one thing
that might go wrong

00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.111
here is if you could
move out by two,

00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:48.840
then who knows what
happens, right?

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.165
Or is this guy could actually
suck in an additional spot

00:56:52.165 --> 00:56:54.270
equivalently.

00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.770
OK.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:58.500
So sliding blocks.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.300
Now I said one by
one blocks are easy.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.850
But here's a slight
variation where it's hard.

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:08.690
In a graph, suppose
you have tokens.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:12.080
And a move is to move
a token along an edge.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.620
But at all times
the set of tokens

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.750
must be an independent set.

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.700
You can never have
two adjacent tokens.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:21.512
So this is what you might call
reconfiguration independence.

00:57:21.512 --> 00:57:23.470
And it's a reconfiguration
problem in the sense

00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:27.890
that I'm interested
in two solutions

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.177
to the independence set problem
of the same size, in fact.

00:57:31.177 --> 00:57:33.760
And I want to know, is there a
sequence of moves that converts

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.780
one solution to
the other solution.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.040
In this case, by
moving it into one

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.020
of the vertices and
independence set along an edge.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.530
And here you can very
easily simulate an AND.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.480
This guy can move down
only if this moves out

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.160
and this moves out, because
of these constraints.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.670
And an OR, this
guy can move down

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.120
only if this guy can
move here or here.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.000
And to move here, this
guy must move out.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.495
And to move here, this
guy must move out.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.540
So you can see, you
get really short proofs

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.982
of PSPACE completeness.

00:58:03.982 --> 00:58:04.940
Just need two pictures.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:14.390
For fun and somewhat relevant
in particular to your p-set.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.520
Let me mention another
reconfiguration problem.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.080
I don't have a figure
for it, but this

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:31.370
is reconfiguration 3SAT.

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:35.220
So suppose I give you two
solutions to a 3SAT formula--

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:37.110
two satisfying assignments.

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.570
And my move is, flip a
variable from true to false,

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:40.950
or vice versa.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.330
I want at all times to be
a satisfying assignment.

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.970
I claim it is PSPACE complete to
find a sequence of such moves.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:53.840
This is originally approved by
[? Papadimetriou ?] and a bunch

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:56.420
of other people--
[? Gopala, ?] [? Colitis, ?]

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.830
and [? Mineva. ?]

00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:00.690
But there's actually
a really easy proof

00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:04.340
once you have nondeterministic
constraint logic, which

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.850
is-- so we're going to simulate
nondeterministic constraint

00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:12.290
logic using this
reconfiguration problem.

00:59:12.290 --> 00:59:16.740
So in order to represent an
edge in our constraint graph,

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.400
we will just make
that into a variable.

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.987
And true for that
variable means the edge

00:59:23.987 --> 00:59:26.070
is pointed one way, and
false means the other way.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:30.450
You just decide economical
orientation for each edge.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:45.700
And then if we have an OR
vertex-- call the edges x, y

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:51.740
and z-- then the constraints
are that x must be in,

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.380
or y must be in,
or z must be in.

00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.320
That's an OR constraint.

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.630
And "in" here means I write x
or x bar, according to whether

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:04.584
in is the positive or the
negative orientation--

01:00:04.584 --> 01:00:06.000
the true or the
false orientation,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.630
however you decided this.

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:12.680
So that's a 3SAT clause.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:23.370
And an AND vertex,
say, x, y, and z,

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:28.010
is going to be two
constraints, two clauses.

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.660
If x is out, then y must be in.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:36.340
And if x is out,
then z must be in.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:36.840
OK.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.700
So that's two clauses.

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.380
We AND them together,
we can convert a implies

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:45.600
into a not x out
or y in, as usual.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.914
So these are 2SAT clauses.

01:00:47.914 --> 01:00:49.830
You take the conjunction
of all those clauses,

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.150
you get a 3SAT formula.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:57.310
And that exactly represents
that the configuration is valid,

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:01.100
that it satisfies the
inflow constraint.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.100
And so reconfigurations
in the constraint logic

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.474
are identical to
reconfigurations

01:01:04.474 --> 01:01:06.190
in the 3SAT instance.

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:08.050
Very nice simple
proof found by Sara.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.860
So now you get the sense that
constraint logic is really

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.930
just a very simplified version
of reconfiguration 3SAT.

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:19.750
We have some very
specific constraints

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:22.250
on what we need to worry
about, some very specific types

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.740
of vertices we
need to implement.

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:25.980
And that's it.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.230
So of course you could simulate
all of reconfiguration 3SAT,

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:32.500
but your life is going to be
a lot easier by simulating

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:35.170
this special case.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.595
And you've seen already
a few examples of that.

01:01:38.595 --> 01:01:39.095
OK.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.300
Next problem.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:43.840
Rush hour.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.673
This one we actually
covered in lecture one,

01:01:45.673 --> 01:01:49.290
so I just remind you that
here the blocks can only

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.310
move in the direction
but they're oriented.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.640
And again, you can build
an AND or protected OR.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.740
In the setup, this result
was proofed previously,

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.390
but here's a
constraint logic proof.

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:03.490
Again, we do protected OR.

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:07.400
Now this is 1 by 2
blocks and 1 by 3 blocks.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.430
That's as far as we could get.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.950
This is a picture
here we actually

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:14.290
see how things come
together at the corners.

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:16.460
So this is clearly a
locked configuration.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.610
That's good.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:22.290
And then Trump and
[? Cidibrasi ?]

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:26.520
came up with a purely
1 by 2 car version.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.560
It's more complicated.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.770
And they had trouble getting
just a single gadget.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:34.210
So they ended up doing
two AND gates using,

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.644
I guess, rotational
symmetry here.

01:02:36.644 --> 01:02:37.560
Two AND gates at once.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.050
But of course, this is really
a split viewed from below.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:43.600
So if you just
throw away that end,

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.530
and they have a way
to terminate things,

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:47.400
then that is just an AND gate.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.200
And similarly, they had to
glue two OR gates together.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.390
But that also can be
used to build an OR gate.

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:56.884
They built something
related to an OR,

01:02:56.884 --> 01:02:58.550
but in particular,
it is a protected OR.

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.050
And so that's enough.

01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:01.980
In fact, these actually
act as latches,

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.682
if you wanted to
be more efficient.

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:05.140
But you don't worry
about that, you

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.680
can use them as
protected oars, and then

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:08.179
build latches out
of that, and build

01:03:08.179 --> 01:03:10.110
all the things we've done.

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:12.190
So that's cool.

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:14.130
An open problem in
the world of Rush Hour

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.000
is what about 1 by 1 cars.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.410
Now this is a little
weird, because 1 by 1 cars

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:19.900
don't have natural orientations.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.730
But if each car is
marked whether-- I mean,

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:24.330
you can see where
the headlights are.

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:28.730
So you know whether it's going
horizontal or vertical only.

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:30.990
It's open whether this
problem is PSPACE complete.

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:33.110
In the same paper, they
do a computer search

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.110
to find the hardest
5 by 5 puzzle,

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:37.340
and the hardest 6 by 6 puzzle.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.180
I think with just one
blank space in here,

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.405
the first move is to
move this up, this up,

01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:44.480
this right, this right, this
right, this down, this over.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.590
The first chain of
moves, so to speak.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.670
But it's 199 moves
to solve this.

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:51.130
This puzzle is 732 moves.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.170
And it's drawn here.

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:57.060
That's the longest
puzzle that's 6 by 6.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.369
So it seems to be growing
exponentially, maybe.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.410
So maybe it's PSPACE
complete, but we don't know.

01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:06.080
Triangular Rush Hour.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.640
You can do that too.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.390
Again, there's an AND
gate and an OR gate.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:11.830
Here we had to build a straight.

01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:13.650
But then everything
fits together.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:14.150
Question?

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.712
AUDIENCE: I was just gonna
ask what is the goal in those?

01:04:15.712 --> 01:04:16.930
Like, there wasn't--

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:17.960
PROFESSOR: Oh.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:18.460
Right.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.760
What is the goal.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.437
I mean, if you put the
final edge of the reverse up

01:04:22.437 --> 01:04:24.020
in the corner
somewhere, then there'll

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.900
be one car which can escape
through a little slot

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.870
in the exit.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:29.940
That's the usual
Rush Hour setup.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.447
If and only if
that edge-- Sorry?

01:04:31.447 --> 01:04:33.030
AUDIENCE: The pictures
didn't specify.

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.050
PROFESSOR: The pictures
did not specify.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:36.890
It's true.

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.420
Oh, and these ones.

01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:42.050
I think it's like
one of these cars

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.850
is going to go out
through the right.

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:46.200
But I forget.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.520
I think it might be the
second row, or the first row,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.776
something like that.

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:53.010
OK.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:54.652
So, cool.

01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:55.610
Here's another problem.

01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:57.568
Turns out to be related,
though it doesn't seem

01:04:57.568 --> 01:04:59.252
like the same sort of puzzle.

01:04:59.252 --> 01:05:00.710
This is called a
hinged dissection.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:02.260
It's a chain of
blocks that folds

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.468
from one shape-- in this
case, equilateral triangle--

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:05.840
to a unit square.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.510
Goes back to even before 1900s.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.420
But this one's from 1900s.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.890
Early 1900s.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.200
And so that's cool.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.660
In particular, there's a motion
that avoids self-intersection.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.840
And we proved a few years
ago that for any two polygons

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.150
of the same area, there is
a finite chain of blocks

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:27.660
that can fold one into the
other without self-intersection.

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.320
So great.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.130
Problem solved.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.390
But that's good for if you get
to design the hinge dissection.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:35.750
But what if you have some
existing hinge dissection

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:39.130
that someone came up with?

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.400
So this is earlier work.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.760
But it's a chain of these
right isosceles triangles--

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.580
128 of them that can fold into
any letter of the alphabet

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.220
and any number and a square.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.500
So you can follow the six
into a square into an eight

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:51.930
into a nine into a zero.

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:52.930
That's cool.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:53.690
Open problem.

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:56.570
Can you do it without
self-intersection?

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.210
And it would be great if we
had an algorithm to tell us.

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:01.040
But it's PSPACE complete.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.410
So if I give you a hinge
dissection, and I want to know,

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.350
can I get from this
configuration to that one

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:11.290
without collisions, you can
simulate essentially Rush Hour.

01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.780
This is a gadget--
the hard part here

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.550
is to make everything connected
in one connected hinge

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:18.890
dissection.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.550
And it can simulate this
block sliding to the right

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:26.730
or not in this kind of way,
avoiding collisions locally.

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:28.750
And so now it's just
each of these blocks

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:31.980
can slide left or
right or up or down.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.690
And they have some weird shapes,
but it ends up working out.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:37.920
So that's kind of a cool result.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.410
This is before we proved hinge
dissections actually exist.

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:42.230
It was discouraging, maybe.

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.600
But when you're constructing
your own hinge dissections,

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.640
it's a lot easier
to avoid collisions.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.200
All right.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.860
Pushing blocks.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.970
Remember this table
from Lecture 4, I think.

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.500
So we did a lot of the
NP hardness proofs.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.750
But there are some
PSPACE hardness as well.

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.700
And I'm going to
cover these two.

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:06.800
So Sokoban first,
and Push 2F, second.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:09.540
So remember, Sokoban
is this puzzle

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:12.740
where you want to get the blocks
into the target locations.

01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.154
And you are walking around.

01:07:14.154 --> 01:07:15.570
You only have the
strength of one.

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:17.810
You can only push
one block at a time.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.440
So I think this is
Level 5 apparently,

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.190
in the original classic.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:27.690
So this is a little bit
awkward in some ways,

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.460
because in constraint
logic, you're

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.380
supposed to be able
to flip any edge.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.210
In Sokoban you have an
agent who's walking around.

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:39.250
So we're going to cut a
lot of tunnels in the walls

01:07:39.250 --> 01:07:42.420
so that the agent
can go anywhere.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.960
And then also, these blocks are
exactly where they want to be,

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.780
meaning there is a target
location where that block is.

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:54.071
There's only one block
that's in the wrong spot.

01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:56.570
And so we're going to use our
configuration to configuration

01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:01.891
thing to say, I want to solve
the QSAT formula, which lets me

01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:03.140
move one block out of the way.

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.140
So I can move one block
that's in the wrong spot

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:08.120
down to a good spot
that's in target location.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.956
And then unroll everything.

01:08:09.956 --> 01:08:12.330
And then all the blocks are
back where they wanted to be.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:14.470
And the one guy that
we needed to move

01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.630
got to where he needed to go.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:18.189
That's Sokoban.

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:23.214
And the rest is mostly
this AND and OR gadget.

01:08:23.214 --> 01:08:25.630
The idea is, because these
guys are where they need to be,

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:28.770
if I move the D to touch the
A, you're permanently screwed.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.520
You can never
separate them again.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.189
And so you'll never be
able to fill some spot,

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:37.529
because D in particular,
can no longer be useful.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.600
But every block
needs to be used.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:46.460
And so let's see, in
order to move V down,

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.084
we must move- or, sorry.

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.250
That's the other way around.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:53.720
In order to move C to the left,
we must first move B and E

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.282
up one, and A and D left one.

01:08:55.282 --> 01:08:57.240
And you can check that
you can actually do that

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:01.010
by moving this out and moving
this over, and then pushing E

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.319
up, and then pushing B up.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.750
Then C can move in.

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:08.100
And it is reversible
if you check carefully.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.660
And for an OR, we just separate
these a little bit more.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.774
So separately each
of them could move.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.149
And then this guy could move
in and you won't be trapped.

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:18.390
If you just tried to
move this directly,

01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:20.130
then you'll never be
able to get in here.

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:22.370
And so these guys are sort
of locked in position.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.372
And that's bad news.

01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:24.580
Or they could only get worse.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.620
You could move A in here, but
then you're really in trouble.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:31.670
Now once you do that, you might
have some parity issues because

01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:34.359
of the widths of these gaps.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:37.880
But you can build this
kind of extra-long tunnel

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.750
to change parity.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:40.750
We talked about tunnels.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.370
You also need turns.

01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:44.310
And then you can simulate
constraint logic.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.130
This is one of the weirder
constraint logic proofs.

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.410
It's not directly mapping
because of the agent issue.

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:52.240
But it turns out to work.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:52.840
OK.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.540
That was Sokoban.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.320
Next one is Push-2F.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.130
I will not cover
this one in detail

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:01.420
because it's quite
a complicated proof.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.110
But I will tell you
that we can simplify it,

01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:05.410
now that we know what we know.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.786
This is a fairly old proof.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:07.730
2002.

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:10.800
So it predates last lecture.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.680
It predates the
[? Viglietta ?] paper.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.650
So what we've constructed in
this case is a lock gadget.

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:22.430
This is just like the final
meta-theorem from last class.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.100
We have an unlock traversal
where you could come in the U

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.850
and actually come back
out the same place.

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:30.730
It unlocks the thing, so you
could then go from I to O.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:36.261
Or if you go from LI to LO,
you're forced to lock the door.

01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:36.760
Sorry.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.740
It was called a door
in the last class.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.060
So that actually has a door.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:44.710
Now we needed a door
and a crossover.

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:46.980
And you can build a
crossover like this.

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.960
I think at this point
we have a crossover.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:53.010
So left of this line would be a
PSPACE completeness proof using

01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:56.171
the [? Viglietta ?] framework.

01:10:56.171 --> 01:10:57.670
We didn't have it
at the time, so we

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:01.340
did this part of the proof
also to build an AND and an OR

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:01.840
gadget.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.110
We're essentially
doing the 3SAT thing.

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:07.830
And we're just checking
that all of the things that

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.290
need to be true are
true for AND and OR.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:13.050
This reminds me of the
reduction from three

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.580
coloring to one of the other
pushing blocks problems.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.125
Push-1X, I think.

01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:19.500
We'll just check that all the
things that need to be true

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.270
are true.

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:21.630
So that's the rough sketch.

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.713
But there are a lot of
details getting it to work.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:27.260
It'd be great to solve
Push-1F in the same way,

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:30.140
but that remains
an open problem.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:30.640
All right.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.540
That was pushing blocks.

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.830
Next we have rolling blocks.

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:37.900
So this is a class of mazes.

01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:42.820
So this is how you usually
are given the input.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.630
What this means, the red
things here are fixed.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.810
And the green thing
is actually a 1 by 1

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.780
by 2 block sticking
out of the board.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:52.260
And so it was in this position.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:55.280
And you can roll it over
along one of the edges,

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.150
and it ends up occupying
this rectangle up here.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:02.390
And you can keep rolling your
goals to get to t sticking up.

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.810
And it's not so easy.

01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.250
Hence the dot, dot, dot.

01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:10.430
So that's the traditional
rolling block maze.

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:13.310
And if you have a lot of
rollable blocks, in this case,

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:15.060
all the blocks are rollable.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.410
So these red things are
actually sticking up.

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.630
And the green ones are
obviously lying in the plan.

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:23.800
And the 1 by 1 squares
mean that it's sticking up.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.080
Then it's PSPACE complete
to roll a particular block,

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.844
because in order to
roll this thing down,

01:12:31.844 --> 01:12:33.510
you have to make space
here, which means

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:35.010
this has to have rolled up.

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:39.740
Which means-- well, so if this
rolls out, and this rolls out,

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.320
it will be like here and here.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.110
Then this can fall over,
replacing that rectangle.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.060
This can fall over,
replacing that rectangle.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.540
So that's this and this.

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.440
Then this guy can roll
down, so it comes here.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.510
And then this guy can stand up.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.230
And this guy can fall over.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:55.230
So you get that picture.

01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:57.180
And so it's AND game.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.700
And this one is an OR gate.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.010
I think I won't go
through all the things,

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:04.850
but if either this one comes
up, or this one falls over,

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.050
then this one can come down.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.850
And you can show in
this case that it's

01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:11.610
essentially impossible,
or never useful,

01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:14.190
to make any of the
red towers fall over,

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.980
which lets you argue about
gadgets independently.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:18.480
Cool.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.370
That's a pretty recent result.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:28.490
Oh, in this proof they also--
it took me awhile staring at I

01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:30.570
guess these gadgets
to think, oh,

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:31.900
do these actually fit together?

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.720
This fits together.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.420
But if I rotate this
one 180 degrees,

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:37.800
the A's will not match up.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.840
And so you need a shift gadget.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.930
And you also need a
sort of straight gadgets

01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:48.390
for just indicating information
without any stuff going on.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:50.270
OK.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:52.080
Getting near the end.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:52.860
Plank puzzles.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.710
These are ThinkFun puzzles,
under that name River Crossing.

01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:59.110
Although they predate
that a little bit.

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:02.822
So here you have again,
an agent moving around.

01:14:02.822 --> 01:14:05.260
So we're going to have to do
some work to get rid of that.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.130
And you can, for example,
walk along a plank.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:09.530
Then you can pick that plank up.

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:11.321
And you can only carry
one plank at a time.

01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:14.730
And you can place it, as long
as this is a length two plank,

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:17.920
as long as there's another dot
that's exactly length 2 away,

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.290
you can drop it down.

01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:21.132
And then he walked
here and walked here.

01:14:21.132 --> 01:14:22.840
Then that pickup, that
unit-length plank,

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:23.770
put it down here.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.256
And I get to this
picture, then I

01:14:25.256 --> 01:14:28.897
can walk here, walk here, pick
up this plank, put it down.

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:31.230
But I also could have walked
back to pick up this plank,

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.852
walk over, drop
it somewhere else.

01:14:32.852 --> 01:14:34.310
But I can only
carry one at a time.

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.700
You want to cross the
shore, cross the river.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:44.200
This is PSPACE complete by
nondeterministic constraint

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.520
logic.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.370
And there's stuff going on here.

01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.360
I mean, rough idea,
imagine you can sort

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.640
of teleport to some extent.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.910
If this guy can move
over here, and this guy

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:03.080
can move over here, then let
me show you a bigger picture.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.090
This is a bunch of
gadgets stuck together.

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:09.990
But also what we see are
the navigation mechanism.

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:14.875
There's a length three guy here,
and a length three guy here.

01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:18.050
The length threes are the ones
that go around each gadget.

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:18.932
This is one gadget.

01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:20.640
There's all these
length three distances.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.690
There are no other
length three distances.

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.950
What that lets you do
is grab this, move it,

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:27.075
and basically you can
walk around the boundary.

01:15:27.075 --> 01:15:29.700
Then you can also walk along the
boundary, grab this other guy,

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.000
and move it somewhere else.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.830
So you can walk
along the boundary

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.085
and carry an additional
length three thing with you.

01:15:37.085 --> 01:15:39.210
So that turns out to be
helpful in that when you're

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:40.960
trying to traverse
a gadget, you need

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.810
to be able to enter
from this side,

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.650
and also enter from that side.

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:47.100
And you can set up those
planks to make that possible.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.210
I'll just wave my hand
and say that is possible.

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:51.570
It's a little hard to
see in these diagrams.

01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:56.820
But you're getting
NCL reduction again.

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.700
And I have two examples
of non-puzzles.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.820
Sort of real world
problems reduced

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.360
from nondeterministic
constraint logic.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.300
One of them is
dynamic map labeling.

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.660
So there's a whole
field of map labeling.

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.600
One of the typical setups is
that you have points, features,

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.750
cities, whatever that
need to be labeled.

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.660
Labels are usually
model by squares.

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.740
Because if you scale
things, if they

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:23.060
were rectangles of fixed size,
you'd turn them into squares.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:26.440
And typically you want to have
that square, one of its corners

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.510
should be at the dot.

01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:30.410
So it's easy to read.

01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:32.640
But now, suppose things
are changing in your map.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.300
Maybe you're adding points,
or your zooming out,

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:35.890
or zooming in.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:38.300
You'd like to continuously
change the labels

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.920
and you don't want any
labels to intersect.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.015
So you could think of
zooming out on Google Maps.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.640
I'm not going to talk
about the zooming

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:49.110
out, although this paper proves
that that is PSPACE complete.

01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:52.470
Question is, how many labels
can I preserve and be able

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.950
make a continuous change.

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:56.370
Simple example is
maybe you add one city.

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.910
In order to be able to add
one city and add a new label,

01:16:58.910 --> 01:17:01.517
probably something has
to move out of the way.

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:03.600
And then you can get a
nondeterministic constraint

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.750
logic argument.

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.250
I love this figure,
because it shows

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.730
all the gadgets and the
ways that they fit together.

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:13.780
This is a nondeterministic
constraint graph.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:17.330
And an AND gate here.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.150
The pinks are the inputs.

01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:21.970
So if this square
can move over here,

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.360
then this one can
move up to here.

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:26.490
And if this one can
move over to here,

01:17:26.490 --> 01:17:30.080
this one can move down to here,
then these two can move left.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.440
Then this one can move left.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:33.420
It overlaps both of
these, so both of these

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.180
have to move out of the way
before this one can move,

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.311
and that one can move.

01:17:36.311 --> 01:17:36.810
And so on.

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:38.530
You can see how to build
a wire, which is just

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:39.529
a chain of these things.

01:17:39.529 --> 01:17:42.950
There are these special obstacle
blocks which prevent you

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.020
from doing anything else.

01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:47.350
cool.

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.170
And then OR is actually easier.

01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:52.110
You just chain these
two things together.

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:58.450
And it doesn't matter
which one is the input.

01:17:58.450 --> 01:18:00.420
This guy can be in
one of three locations

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.240
according to which
one it's directed in,

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.940
which corresponds to the blocks
being away, out of the way.

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.810
So continuously
changing map labelings

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:15.980
is going to be hard pretty
much however you slice it.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.110
And finally, this problem
is even more complicated,

01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:22.360
but it's a well-studied problem
in computational geometry

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.740
of searchlights.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.220
So there are these dots.

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:30.770
And imagine you have
a laser pointer.

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:34.570
And so you can shoot a ray
in any direction of light.

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:40.031
And if the laser hits
the spy, the spy dies.

01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:40.530
OK?

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:44.380
Your goal is to
eliminate all spies.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.150
You have this
yellow region, which

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:48.070
is where all your treasure is.

01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:50.790
And you want to make sure there
are no spies in the treasure

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:51.600
region.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.610
So normally this is a
finding-the-spy problem.

01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:57.280
If you ever see they
spy, you can capture him.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.950
But the spy can move around
really fast while you're

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:01.160
moving your lasers around.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:03.940
So how do you sweep your
environment with lasers?

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:06.120
Turns out it's PSPACE
complete to make sure

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:07.890
this region is empty.

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:10.220
And I won't go
through the proof.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:15.070
But it's an
orchestration of laser

01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:16.870
continuous reorientations.

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:18.600
And you end up with
ANDs and OR gates,

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.450
and crossovers-- that's
this gadget-- and then

01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:26.100
the nondeterministic constraint
logic's happening down here.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.630
You end up clearing all of
this space pretty easily.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.580
And then there's this
little extra spot

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.440
that will only be cleared if
you get an appropriate laser

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:35.110
from this guy.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:37.730
Then you could sweep up
to there and make sure

01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:40.960
that it's clear without--
the worry is that there's

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.930
a bad guy over here, and
he somehow sneaks back

01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.340
into the other region.

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.030
That forces some of
the lasers to stay

01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:47.944
where they are, and
ends up simulating

01:19:47.944 --> 01:19:49.360
nondeterministic
constraint logic.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.210
Pretty epic proof.

01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:53.270
But I will leave it at that.

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.900
And that's all for today.
