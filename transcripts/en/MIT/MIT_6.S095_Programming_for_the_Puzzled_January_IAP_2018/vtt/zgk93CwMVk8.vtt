00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
SRINI DEVADAS: So, so
far we haven't really

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.810
done much with the
data structures

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.494
outside of Python lists.

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:15.910
We looked at two
dimensional lists

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.490
but, you know, they
are still lists.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.220
And so this particular
puzzle that we're

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.920
going to do today, I--

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.350
has a graph structure
associated with it.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.730
So for the first time,
at least in this class,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.750
we'll be looking at
traversing graphs,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.820
and we're going to do
this in a recursive way.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.930
And, also, we'll have
a graph representation

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.680
using dictionaries.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.990
So most of you have
probably seen dictionaries.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.370
If you haven't, I'm
going to explain them.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.110
They're essentially
ways that you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.480
can index into
lists, not just using

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.850
nonzero integers, indices, zero
through n, or what have you.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.530
But things like
strings or tuples,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.610
and so they're just more general
and-- they're more general data

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.160
structure than Python lists.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.040
And so they're very
convenient when

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.570
it comes to representing
graphs and traversing graphs.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.160
So the puzzle we can
look at is, as always,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.770
is a little bit contrived.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.040
It's about weekend
dinner scheduling.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.950
So you have a bunch of friends.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:46.630
And let me draw your
social network here,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.440
or someone's social network.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.620
So we won't name names,
but each node in this graph

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.740
represents a friend,
and a couple more.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.630
And so that's the set
of friends, a through h,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.750
and that won't be particularly
interesting as a graph.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.970
If it just had nodes,
you want to add edges

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.240
to it, what do these
edges represent?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.420
Well, you like all
of your friends,

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.740
but your friends don't
necessarily like each other.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.110
And so an edge between nodes--

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:42.810
so nodes are friends, and an
edge between a pair of nodes

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.261
implies a dislike relationship.

00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:47.760
All right.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.220
So b dislikes c,
and it's symmetric.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.250
I mean, you could argue
that dislikes is not

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.050
necessarily symmetric, but
we'll just call it that.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.610
That implies that c
dislikes b as well.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.360
So this is not necessarily
a directed graph.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.010
Some of the time,
especially when

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.390
you're doing group planning,
going from point A to point B,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.150
you have to take into
account one-way streets,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.460
and so you have directed graphs.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.000
But many a time, you can get
away with undirected graphs.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.840
So you just-- the existence
of an edge between B and C

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.250
implies that in a traversal, you
can get from B to C or C to B,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.710
and there's no direction there.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.349
And so I'm going to fill
in the rest of this,

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.515
and then get to the question
that we want to answer.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.390
And so that's your--

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.370
your friend graph.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.120
And it also has these six or
seven dislike relationships.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.220
And your job is to, well,
keep all your friends happy.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.600
And the way you're
going to do that is by--

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.000
is by having a couple of
parties on the weekend.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.580
So this is a regular weekend.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.480
Let's call it Friday
and Saturday--

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.360
Friday and Saturday
night parties.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.980
And the only constraint--

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.450
actually, there's
two constraints.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.899
There's-- the two constraints
that you need to follow are

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.860
satisfy when you have
these two parties.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.420
So you have your Friday party
and your Saturday party,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.370
is you can't leave
anybody out, right?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.455
So you-- effectively, they're
constrained as each friend--

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.930
--comes to--

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.640
--exactly one party.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.160
No one gets left out,
no one comes to both.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.870
So that's fair.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.860
And then the second constraint
as you can probably guess

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.325
is no pair--

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.460
--of friends who
dislike each other,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.549
they're not friendly,
they're your friends,

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:18.840
can be invited on the same day.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.100
And so you want an
algorithm that is

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.870
going to give you a schedule.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.660
And, obviously, the schedule
is not necessarily unique.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.690
I mean, if you had a bunch of
happy-go-lucky low overhead

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.530
friends, you know, they
all like each other

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.992
and you could just randomly
break them up into two groups.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.450
You can think of
it as a partition.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.590
A partition is a
grouping where--

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.710
then you have anything in a
set of nodes, for example,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.620
and you partition it,
you're essentially

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.140
saying you're breaking
it up into two groups,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.000
such that each node
is in exactly one

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.136
group, and each node--

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:25.510
and then we have
another property

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.430
associated with
the partition that

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.730
corresponds to the edges
between these nodes.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.190
But we'll get to that in just--

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.435
just a minute.

00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:34.310
Yeah, go ahead, Fadi.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.740
AUDIENCE: How are we going
to deal with the-- with FGH,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.031
because we only have
two parties and--

00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:41.530
SRINI DEVADAS:
That's exactly right.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:48.670
So-- so the purpose of this
puzzle is to determine whether

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.600
you can actually do this or
not, and so you are certainly

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.480
welcome to--

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.370
when you write a
computer program--

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.150
or when we write a computer
program here, it might say,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.060
no can do, you know, find
a different set of friends

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.640
or maybe identify
a problem case.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.980
You know, there's one
person who dislikes

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.750
all of your other friends.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.850
Maybe you should drop
that person, right?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.580
And so you can imagine that--

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.970
that you would
not necessarily be

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.130
able to satisfy these two
constraints for all graphs,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.670
right?

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.670
And so that's really the
essence of the puzzle.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.610
For what kind of graphs?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.260
And this, it turns out that a
fairly famous kind of graph,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.270
does--

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.870
does this puzzle have
a solution, right?

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.010
And so you-- you
have to look at this

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.110
and you kind of go, and
the first thing that

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:51.640
occurred to you was, hey, if I
had F, G, and H, if I invite F

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.010
on Friday, I have to
invite G and H on Saturday.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.130
But then G and H don't
like each other, right?

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.650
So that's a problem, right?

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.380
And so in this
particular case, you've

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.180
identified this cycle that
indicates that this problem is

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.650
not solvable.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:18.610
But, let's say, that
somehow you've placated G

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.640
and you patch--

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.400
they're patched up.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:21.970
All right.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.050
So-- so you end up having a
fairly complex graph structure

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.750
that looks like this, right?

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.460
And now what happens?

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.494
Now, is there-- is there a
solution to this problem,

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:34.885
to this particular puzzle?

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.150
I mean, A can come on any day
so let's ignore A. All right.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.520
A is easy.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.820
Suppose you invite-- you
can try and figure this out

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:57.620
by saying let's go ahead
and invite B on Friday.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.750
So what does that imply?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.910
That immediately implies that?

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.490
C is on Saturday, right?

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.330
What does that imply?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.770
D is on Friday, right?

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.135
So you see-- you see
how this is going to go.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:13.010
What does that imply?

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.140
E and F are on--

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.380
are on Saturday.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.340
So I have E and F
on Saturday, OK?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.100
And then what does that imply?

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.810
That F being on Saturday
implies that G, H, and I

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.530
have to be on Friday, right?

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.810
And then I-- don't forget
A. So let's just stick

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.610
A in here to even things out.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.250
All right.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.910
So-- so we kind of
did an algorithm here,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.340
we executed an algorithm, right?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:52.590
And it turns out that graphs
that can be partitioned

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:55.440
in this manner are--

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.680
I have a special name.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.815
They're called bipartite graphs.

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:03.180
Bipartite graphs.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:03.930
I'll write it out.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.940
And that-- the reason they're
called bipartite graphs

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.120
is if you have a
bipartite graph,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.935
you can always draw
it in this fashion.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:37.990
Where you have A,
C, E, F, and then

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:49.470
you have B, D, G, H, I, such
that you never see edges

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.900
like this or like that.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.170
All the edges go
from left to right--

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.990
or right to left.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.460
They're undirected.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.390
OK.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.030
So that's really
a bipartite graph.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.490
And if I draw this out--

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.350
oop, don't need that.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.262
C goes to B and
D. A goes nowhere.

00:11:13.262 --> 00:11:19.594
E goes to D. And F goes to
a bunch of different places.

00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:20.094
Yeah.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.987
So you're allowed to have--

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.320
this will still be a bipartite--

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.620
I won't-- this is not
the graph that we had,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.050
but it's not that--

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.140
the edges can be crossing edges.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.920
OK.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.770
They just all have to
go from left to right.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.470
You just can't have an
edge between A and C,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.990
or C and A. You can't
have an edge between D

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.560
and H, et cetera.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.270
All right.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.790
So you want to-- you have
to be able to separate out

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.830
the nodes such that there are
no edges in this set of nodes,

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.480
and no edges between
this set of nodes,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.380
and no edges between
that set of nodes.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.250
And this is just a
topological property

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.988
that corresponds to
bipartite graphs.

00:12:06.988 --> 00:12:10.690
And there's another
property that essentially

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.600
is equivalent to our
puzzle, which says,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.480
bipartite graphs
are two colorable.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.860
And it's obvious
as to why a bipar--

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.500
bipartite graph
is two colorable,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.350
and what does it mean
to be two colorable.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.800
Well, you need to
color each node

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:37.960
with two colors, in this case,
Friday and Saturday, such

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:54.940
that no pair of nodes
with an edge between them

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.780
have the same color.

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:00.760
So exactly equivalent to
what we've talked about here.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:10.320
So our goal now is to discover
whether a bipartite graph--

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.000
or a given graph, excuse me--

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.690
is bipartite or not.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.459
Once you know that a
graph is bipartite,

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:18.000
you know it's two
colorable, you know

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.820
it's a solution to our
problem, to our puzzle problem.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.422
OK.

00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:25.380
And, of course, in order
to do this, and if you

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.650
had a graph with--

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.590
you had thousands of friends
and, perhaps, tens of thousands

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.040
of edges, and you need to
discover it's not your dinner

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.822
problem, maybe.

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:38.280
But you need to discover whether
the graph is two colorable

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.140
or not, then you need to write
a computer program for this.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.060
You need a graph representation.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.255
You need to do this traversal,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:13:47.255 --> 00:13:47.880
Go ahead, Josh.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.282
AUDIENCE: If a graph
is two colorable,

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:51.240
is it always bipartite?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.090
SRINI DEVADAS: Yes.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.150
They're equivalent definitions.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.320
Absolutely right.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.740
Because what would happen
is if you can color it,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.300
then it means that you can take
all of the red colors, you--

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.230
red could be equivalent
to Friday, and--

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.420
and then blue could be
equivalent to Saturday,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.070
and all of the red colors could
be placed on the left, and--

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.170
and the blue on the right.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:17.670
Fadi.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.600
AUDIENCE: But then a graph
with no edges is one colorable

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.862
but also, by definition,
considered bipartite?

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:23.860
SRINI DEVADAS: Yes.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.630
That's it.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.570
That-- there's always
pathological cases,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.190
and they're usually things
that get swept under the rug.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.820
But one colorable is--

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.290
it is considered two colorable.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.770
You can color it the two colors,
that's really what it is.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.540
Let's talk about cycles to
get a sense for this property.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.080
So immediately I
think you recognize

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.820
that when you have
something like,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.890
I forget what it was
exactly, FGI or FGH,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.240
whatever, that if you
had a cycle like this,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.300
that a graph is not
bipartite, right?

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.550
A three cycle is not bipartite.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.650
Is any cycle a problem?

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.480
If I have a cycle
in the graph, which

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.700
means that I can go from one
node back to the same node

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.837
through a sequence of edges and,
obviously, traversing nodes,

00:15:27.837 --> 00:15:28.670
do I have a problem?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.090
Is that can be immediately
declared that the graph is not

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.720
bipartite?

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.219
Yeah.

00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:34.660
Go ahead, Julia, why not?

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.485
AUDIENCE: Well, like an
even cycle if it was,

00:15:37.485 --> 00:15:38.772
for example, A, B, C &amp; D--

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:39.980
SRINI DEVADAS: Ah, beautiful.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.420
That's exactly what
I wanted to bring up.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:47.610
So if I had something
like A, B, C, D, right?

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:56.090
That's clearly a cyclic graph,
and I could put on A and C

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:02.550
on here, and B and D up
here, and clearly there's

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.310
no edge between A and C,
there's no edge between B and D.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.650
There's an edge between
A and B, there's

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.350
an edge between C and
D, and there's also

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:15.160
an edge between A and D and
C and B. So as I mentioned,

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.460
you're allowed crossing edges.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.220
They all have to go from
left to right or right

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.400
to left, whichever way
you're looking at it.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.900
So interestingly enough, I
mean, this is two colorable.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.270
But when you get to--

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.710
when you get to odd cycles--

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.440
so I'll draw one out here--

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:42.075
in the middle, and let's say
I want to mark these nodes--

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.000
--the names, but let's say
that you have a five cycle now.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.500
All right.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.510
If you have a five
cycle, think about it.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.330
You-- you are going to
go-- color this red.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.830
So let me just go
ahead and say this

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.770
is red, which means
this needs to be blue,

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.599
that needs to be blue.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:08.530
This blue implies this needs
to be red, which now implies

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.849
that this needs to be blue.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.420
And it's like, whoops,
that's a problem, right?

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.810
So, interestingly
enough, the odd evenness

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.020
of the parity of
a cycle determines

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.480
whether a graph is
bipartite or not,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:32.030
it doesn't mean that a graph
that only has four cycles in it

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:39.560
is necessarily
bipartite, because there

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.150
could be other reasons
for it not to be--

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.430
not to be bipartite.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.752
Because you don't know about
the other cycles in the graph.

00:17:50.752 --> 00:17:51.710
I mean, they could be--

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.420
you say it's only
up to four cycles.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.400
Well, there could be
a three cycle in it,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.560
and things get pretty
complicated when

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.857
you have things like that.

00:17:59.857 --> 00:18:01.190
There's a lot of cycles in here.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.500
This is a cycle like that,
there's a cycle like this,

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.270
and the moment you
put an edge in here,

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.760
now you're saying this goes
over here, goes like this.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.100
There's a three cycle here.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.930
But even if this
didn't exist, there

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.520
would be a five cycle,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.760
So there's a lot of
cycles and graphs, right?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.450
And your algorithm,
essentially, needs

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:25.930
to ensure that for-- that
every cycle is an even cycle.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.990
OK.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.580
And that is exactly equivalent
to coloring it with two colors.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.540
OK.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:41.360
So we, obviously, need to
have a way of stopping here

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.090
in the sense that
when you have a cycle,

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.920
you are going to come back
and the cycle may be fine

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.810
because it's an even cycle.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.410
But you, obviously, can't
keep going around the cycle

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.690
without terminating
in a computer program.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.960
So we're going to have
to do a recursive search.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.680
Which has interesting
termination conditions,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.360
you know, as opposed
to the divide

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.264
and conquer, or even the
iterative enumeration

00:19:10.264 --> 00:19:12.680
that we did where it was pretty
clear what the termination

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.550
condition was.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.530
That the base case was
fairly straightforward

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.560
because you came down
to a list of length 1,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.050
or you had something where you
broke things up to the point

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.300
where you had really
small problems

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.910
and that corresponded to
your base case, right?

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.535
But cycle detection,
especially when

00:19:30.535 --> 00:19:31.910
you're doing
recursive traversal,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.980
can be pretty tricky.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.470
And we also, of course,
as I said initially,

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.620
we have to be able to
represent this graph structure.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.120
Right.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.235
I mean, you could
represent it as a matrix.

00:19:43.235 --> 00:19:43.830
Right.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.020
This-- or you could say,
well, I hate dictionaries,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.249
I love lists, and that's
all I'm going to use

00:19:49.249 --> 00:19:50.540
for the rest of my life, right?

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.950
Not a good idea.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.710
But if you did that,
you could certainly

00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:01.080
represent the graphs as a
matrix or two dimensional list.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.010
It's called an adjacency
matrix representation--

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.610
and I won't write it out--
but, effectively, your rows

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.180
are all the nodes, and your
columns are all the nodes.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.760
And you have a 1 or a zero
in the appropriate location

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.540
based on whether there's
an edge between the row

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.550
node and the column node.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.170
And you can certainly do that.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.890
And it's-- for most
cases-- in most cases,

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.870
it's a painful
representation to deal with.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.071
Graphs are much easier
to deal with, especially

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.320
when you want to do traversal.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.340
So we'll stick with
a graph structure.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.830
All right.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.020
So let's talk algorithms.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.660
I want to take a slightly
different example.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.620
It's similar to what
we have here, but--

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:56.580
and I want to talk about exactly
how an algorithm would work.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:57.650
And we kind of did that.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:02.090
So, actually, let's
run it on this one,

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.071
and then I'll write out what
the pseudocode for the algorithm

00:21:05.071 --> 00:21:05.570
would be.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.920
I'm going to ignore A here.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.430
You can imagine that this
particular algorithm would

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.305
be run on this degenerate
case that corresponds to A,

00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:21.810
and you'd end up coloring
this red or blue.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.690
So I'm just going to go
ahead and color this red.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.690
And I'm not done
with my problem,

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.450
but I'm done with the
particular graph that

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.480
corresponds to A,
because A can't reach

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.264
any other node in the graph.

00:21:35.264 --> 00:21:36.930
So you ought to be a
little bit careful.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.346
And the code I'm
going to show you

00:21:38.346 --> 00:21:41.640
would need to be generalized
to take into account

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.160
this forest of graphs.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.820
OK.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.903
Because there's really a
bunch of different graphs

00:21:46.903 --> 00:21:49.900
that are disconnected that are
part of the overall problem.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.070
But if I start with B,
then I get connectivity

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.980
to all of the remaining
edges, and so I'm good there.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.090
So let me go ahead
and color this red.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.500
And so the way we
described it, we say,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.440
I'm going to look for
the neighbors of B.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.890
And so B is connected
to just C in this case.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.280
And when I traverse
an edge, what do

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.120
I do with respect to the color?

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.350
I flip the color.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.950
Right.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:20.880
I change the color.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.470
There's only two
colors so I can think

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.270
of it as flipping the color.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.610
So I go and I traverse an edge.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.900
I need to flip the color to--

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.390
to blue, right?

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.460
And then I get to C,
and when I get to C,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.070
I then start traversing edges.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.500
But when I traverse an edge,
I need to flip the color.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.135
So this goes to R.
In the case of D,

00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:46.320
I can go to two
different places,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.290
and so I need to go
ahead and traverse to E.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.940
And just for the
heck of it, I'm going

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.151
to add another edge there.

00:22:52.151 --> 00:22:52.650
Right.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.440
Because now you're
going to see how--

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.580
the code is going to get
a little more complicated

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.400
with respect to the
termination condition

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.230
that I described to
you, and the checks

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.020
that we need to perform
with respect to the fact

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.150
that we wanted this graph
to be two colorable.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.350
OK.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.820
So when I-- the way-- the way
this code is going to work

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.300
is I'm going to get to D,
and with that color red,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.460
and I'm going to now see
for the first time-- this

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.500
is an interesting case.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.620
For the first time, I'm going
to see that D has two neighbors.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.570
OK.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:27.310
Now, I need to traverse
both of these edges that

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.540
correspond to these two
neighbors in sequence.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.560
I'm going to pick
one and go with that.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.920
And then I'm going to
pick the other one, right?

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.240
In general, there's two
strategies that you can follow.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.480
And one of which is called depth
first search, and the other

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.190
is called breadth first search.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.970
OK.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.300
So I'm not going to-- you're
going to see effectively

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.250
a depth first algorithm.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:55.340
And I'm happy to tell you
about breadth first in detail

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.632
off line, but I'll mention
what the difference is here

00:23:58.632 --> 00:24:00.590
so you get a sense of
what the differences are.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.090
And they're two fundamental
search techniques,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.500
traversal techniques.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:10.650
And the depth first technique
says I'm going to take D,

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:12.810
and I'm going to pick
one of its neighbors,

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.755
and I'm going to go ahead
and say that, effectively,

00:24:15.755 --> 00:24:18.990
that that's the only
neighbor, and I'm

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.730
going to explore
everything that I

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.130
can get to from that neighbor.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.500
And then once I'm all done
and there's some termination

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.380
condition that happens,
I'm going to come back

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.990
and I'm going to look at this
other neighbor corresponding

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.880
to F.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.790
So-- so what would
happen here in depth

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.270
first search is the following.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.440
D would go to E, and when
I go through an edge,

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.921
I need to flip the color.

00:24:41.921 --> 00:24:42.420
Right.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.670
So I get a B here.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.210
At this point,
unlike what we did

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.140
early on when we did
this particular example,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.480
or something similar, I--

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.430
what I did was
when I saw R here,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.110
I colored F and E both blue.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.360
That's effectively what I did.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.220
Remember that?

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:02.962
Right?

00:25:02.962 --> 00:25:04.920
But now I'm actually
doing something different.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.420
Right.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.950
This is a different
execution corresponding

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.230
to depth first search.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.740
Right.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.790
When I looked at
all of my neighbors,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.210
including the F case, I remember
we had some color for this,

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.420
and then we immediately
took G, H and I

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.640
and we colored them, right?

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.040
That is breadth first search.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:21.540
OK.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.080
That is looking at taking
one step in all directions

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.330
that you can take
and, essentially, it's

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.750
a frontier based
approach where I'm

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.120
taking the frontier
of my neighbors

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.630
and pushing it outward
one step at a time, right?

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.170
Contrast that with
what we're doing here.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.420
You are going to take this--

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.830
the neighbor E
corresponding to D,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.290
and then you're not
going to go to F,

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.810
you're, in fact, going
to go ahead and pick one

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.030
of the neighbors of E, right.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:58.800
And you might even have in your
representation E's neighbor

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.980
being D. Because, you
know, D has E as a neighbor

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.410
and so does E having--

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.940
has D as a neighbor.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.320
But you'll say,
oh, look, look, I

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.460
don't need to go look at D
now in my depth first search,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.260
because D's already
been colored.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:13.770
Right.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.920
So you check that.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920
And then you say, oh,
what has not been colored?

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.540
I has not been colored.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.120
And when I traverse an edge,
I need to flip the color,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.040
and I'm going to go
ahead and put R in here.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.240
All right.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.970
And it's not that you
even go back to F now

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.010
from D. You don't go
back to D at this point.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.300
You now look at I and you do
another recursion corresponding

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.090
to I, and you say, OK,
what about I's neighbors.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.400
Well, E may be first,
but you already

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.870
done with E. I'm
going to go ahead

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.810
and I'm going to get to
F. And you do the flip

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.450
and you get B over here, right?

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.130
You still don't go-- go
back to D. You look at F

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.140
and you say I'm going to now
look at the neighbors of F,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.150
and maybe you get H. And you
say this is R. Then you go back

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.700
and, now, for the
first time, you're

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:06.360
going to look at exhausting
the neighbors of a node

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.690
that you've actually reached
and you've gone to one neighbor

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.410
for.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.530
And so-- so at this point
you go and you make this R.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.210
So now you come back
and you say, am--

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.580
have I exhausted F's neighbors?

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.970
Yes, in the sense that all--

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:24.800
the neighbors that
I needed to look at,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.350
because they didn't have
colors, have been exhausted.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.140
And, of course, F had
D and I as neighbors.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:35.090
And they already had colors
so I'm cool with that, right?

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.050
I don't need to--

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.580
I don't need to touch them.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.950
Now, at this point,
I'm popping up

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:43.310
because I've exhausted
F's neighbors.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.800
I'm going to go back
to where I came from.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.120
How did I get to F?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.480
I did not get to F from D.
I actually got to F from I,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:51.980
right?

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.260
So I'm going to go to I.
But the fact of the matter

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:59.030
is that I is done because I
didn't have to deal with E

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.780
and I've already--

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.560
I'm already done with that.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.670
Then I go back to E,
same thing, right?

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.890
Then, finally, I get
back to D, and I say,

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.730
oh, now I need to go look
at F, and I go and I say,

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:14.420
oh, F is already colored
so, therefore, I'm done.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.610
This is the simplest
representation

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:22.640
that I can think of for a graph
that's also very efficient.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.870
So I've messed with
this graph quite a bit,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.860
so I want to claim that that
dictionary representation that

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.067
says graph equals
open curly brackets,

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:35.650
and then eventually close curly
brackets, corresponds to that,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.430
but it's kind of roughly
corresponds to that.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:43.340
And I can certainly write
out any graph representation

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:49.040
in Python for any
topological representation

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.150
that you give me.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.190
But if you look at
what's up there,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.240
the important thing is
I want to show you--

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.380
or tell you about the
constituents of this graph.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.440
So graph is a dictionary, OK.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.665
A dictionary is a set
of key value pairs.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.840
You represent sets in
Python using curly brackets.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.540
Right.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.590
And each of the key value
pairs is represented

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:32.120
using some key colon val.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.950
And you see a set
of key value pairs,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.240
because you see these
commas between them,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.040
and so what you see
here is the key.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.910
And the keys could be
strings, they could be tuples,

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.910
you can have many
possibilities for keys.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.690
And the key comes first.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.840
And in this case, the
key is the string B. OK.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.680
And so that represents
the name of the node B,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:06.030
and the value is usually a list.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:08.090
And in this case,
you have a list

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.330
that has a single entry
in it because B only has

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.260
one edge that goes to C. Right.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:19.160
And so a more interesting
case, as you can see up there,

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:25.496
is D. And D connects to C,
F and E. And so you see D--

00:30:25.496 --> 00:30:27.060
see E and F. Right.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.450
So that's exactly what
the point here is.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.020
Right.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.210
This algorithm would
run differently

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.500
if you had a representation
that was equivalent

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.780
from a topological
standpoint, because there's

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.600
no order in the topology.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.280
But I chose C, E, F. I-- you
know, it got typed somewhere,

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.980
C, E, F, and so the
order of neighbors

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.380
is C followed by
E followed by F.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.500
Now, that is if you took
this list of neighbors

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.760
and you went from 0, 1, 2, in
terms of indices of that list.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.800
There's nothing that's stopping
you from going 2, 1, zero.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.790
In which case, you
would go F, E, C. Right.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:11.120
Or you could do some crazy,
random ordering for the list

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:11.660
itself.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:11.870
Right.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.300
But it's all entirely up to you.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:13.800
Right.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.790
It is deterministic.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.020
It's entirely up to you.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:21.200
But, now, you see how the order
of the values that corresponds

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.160
to these lists that give you
the neighbors for every node

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.180
affects the execution
of the algorithm.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:27.860
Right.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.050
Now, you do not want the
result of the algorithm

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.220
yes or no, this graph
is bipartite or not,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.630
to be affected by the
order that you see there.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.130
Right.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.190
Because when I draw a
graph like this, I mean,

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.530
this graph is
effectively something

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.090
that doesn't have order.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:48.230
You can't really say anything
about the order of G,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.110
H and I in relation to
F. I mean, they're--

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.340
well, that one is to the
left of it, they're all--

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.730
two of them are at the bottom.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.640
But that's not
what this is about.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.330
And so, obviously, that graph,
regardless of whether I--

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:08.590
I drew it like this or I--
you know, I drew it like that,

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.600
should be bipartite.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.180
Both of those graphs that I--

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.870
that correspond to H
and G with their names

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:18.100
flipped, are either
bipartite or not bipartite.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:18.600
Right.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.170
So you absolutely cannot have
the algorithm being affected

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.520
by the order in which you
see C, E, F or what have you.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.840
That make sense?

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.090
So you can do a lot of
operations on dictionaries.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.460
It's probably
something that you want

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.090
to look at by looking at
the code that we have here

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:48.060
and looking at the code from
graph analysis algorithms,

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.940
and I'm happy to point
you to other literature.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.220
But the way you access
a dictionary is--

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.270
looks a lot like
accessing a list.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.720
So you can say
something like graph A,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.880
and you say something
like graph A,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.950
if A is not a key in the graph,
it would give you an error.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:20.160
But you can certainly
get values back,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.610
and you can also assign values.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:29.950
So graph A, B would give-- it
would give you this list C,

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.530
and you can go off and you can
say something like graph A,

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.400
B dot append--

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:42.840
--and you can say D. And if you
did that, if you did graph A,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.260
B dot append D, then
that's effectively

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:51.910
taking this and adding D to it.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.220
So you can mutate the
graph if you wanted.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.320
We don't have to
do that in our code

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.780
for bipartite, graph
checking, because we are not

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.110
mutating the graph, we're
just traversing the graph.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.740
But you could certainly do that.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.830
So the dictionaries are a
pretty cool representation.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.389
Encourage you to
learn about them.

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:14.949
And they're useful
in many instances.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.159
Clearly, they replace lists
because you can certainly

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.760
have keys as integers, right?

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.699
You can also have
negative numbers as keys.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.889
There's nothing that's
stopping you from doing that.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:29.530
And you don't have to
represent the negative number

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.940
as a string.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.210
I mean, you could just
have keys that are--

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.840
that go from minus 22
to 27, what have you.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.380
So, hopefully, you
have some sense

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.210
of what this code is
going to look like.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.250
Both from a standpoint
of the algorithm, which

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.159
we executed a few times,
and from the standpoint

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.620
of the structure, the
representation of the graph.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:56.139
So let's take a look at
about 10 lines of code

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.350
that corresponds to
bipartite graph coloring.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.090
So it fits on a screen.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:01.870
OK.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.240
And so this is a
pretty tight code.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.000
It does exactly what
we want it to do

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.700
in the sense of it's going to
determine whether a graph is

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.230
bipartite or not.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.770
And it has a bunch of arguments.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.290
A graph is what you
imagine it to be.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.000
It's the input graph.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.580
We have to start from somewhere.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.950
This graph has a list
of key value pairs.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.370
The keys happen to be the nodes.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.040
You should never depend
on the keys being

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.350
stored in a particular order.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:33.490
There's ways of saying--

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.531
you know, you can say
things like graph dot keys.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:46.540
And this is going to give
you back a list of keys.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.755
And it's possible that
when you say graph dot

00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:50.530
keys, at one point
in the program,

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.889
you get the keys in
a particular order.

00:35:52.889 --> 00:35:55.180
And when you say it at a
different part of the program,

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.890
you get the keys in
a different order.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:57.880
OK.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.000
But all-- the keys won't change.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.510
If there's no bugs
in your program,

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.400
you'll get the same
set of keys, but they

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.960
may be in different order.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.230
So you obviously want to start
with some node in the graph,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.540
and you're going to color
it with a particular color,

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.500
color it red.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.830
I think I had shaded and hatched
here, so sha stands for shaded,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.720
and hat stands for hatched.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.370
But you can use what you want.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:28.300
So if you see the invocation
here, bipartite graph color--

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.980
graph three starts with a node.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.970
This is an-- its
coloring is a dictionary,

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.480
and so we are also
representing not only the graph

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.510
as a dictionary, but we're
also representing the mapping

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.380
that we get.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:44.170
Namely, the node B
was colored with red.

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:47.890
So B is a key in this
coloring dictionary.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:50.810
And R red is--

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.460
is the color that's a value.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:52.960
Right.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.310
So you can represent mappings.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.570
Key values or mappings.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:56.200
Right.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.165
So the coloring of a node
is also a dictionary.

00:37:00.165 --> 00:37:01.790
And so that's
essentially what we have.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:02.956
So I'm going to start with--

00:37:02.956 --> 00:37:06.220
none of the nodes are colored,
so that's why this is empty,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.900
and I'm going to
start with A, and I'm

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.255
going to start with the color
shaded, which means that A

00:37:10.255 --> 00:37:11.950
is going to be colored shaded.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:13.330
Or A is going to be shaded.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:14.080
OK.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:18.460
And this is going to return
true or false depending

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.070
on whether the graph
is bipartite or not.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.760
And if it's true,
then I'm going to get

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.870
something interesting with
respect to the mapping of nodes

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:29.830
to colors.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.200
That's my dictionary coloring.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.300
And, otherwise,
I get false back,

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.470
which an empty dictionary.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.870
Because when I have something
that's false, I mean,

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:42.350
you could imagine saying, well,
there's a problem case here.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.160
You can color all of
these different nodes,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.520
but I'm kind of stuck here
because of that five cycle.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.260
But that's kind of
indeterminate in terms

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.760
of what the colors need to be.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.440
And so-- unless you were
actually going to go off

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.420
and mutate the graph
and remove a node and--

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.240
and say this is the friend
you want to dump today,

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:08.265
and then the rest of them are
going to be invited for dinner.

00:38:08.265 --> 00:38:09.640
In that case, you
could obviously

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.800
return a coloring
dictionary, even

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.240
in this case of the graph--

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.280
original graph not
being bipartite.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.400
But most of the time you're
probably in a situation

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.580
where if it's not bipartite,
you don't return anything other

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.510
than false.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.470
All right.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:28.210
So let's take a look at
what each of these things

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.810
do, and then you'll also get
a sense of how we manipulate

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.310
dictionary structures.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.150
So I'm just going to explain
very quickly each line of code

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.000
here.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.790
So this pair of lines of--
this pair of lines of code,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.460
essentially, say
something like, well,

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.000
if you've given me
a starting node,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.717
it's just a check on the input.

00:38:50.717 --> 00:38:52.300
The starting node
is not in the graph,

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.951
it's not a key in
the graph, then

00:38:54.951 --> 00:38:56.200
I'm throwing up my hands here.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.760
This is not a graph.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.110
It's not a bipartite graph.

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.550
I can give you a
coloring, right.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.810
So easy check.

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.880
Not much there.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.950
This is an interesting check.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.780
This, essentially,
is going to check

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.490
to see whether the particular
node that you have,

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.600
this is going to be
done recursively.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.140
So anytime you
arrive at a node, you

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.170
have to check whether there's
already a color there or not.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:25.120
If there's no color, then you
move forward, and you color it,

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.800
and you also move
forward in the sense

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.407
that you'll probably go ahead
and if it has neighbors,

00:39:29.407 --> 00:39:30.740
you will traverse the neighbors.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.450
Right.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.750
But if it has a color, if
it's already in coloring,

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.320
that means it
already has a color.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:36.820
Right.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.480
Because the keys that correspond
to the coloring dictionary

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.440
are exactly the same in the
sense that they're graph nodes

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.300
and they're also in
the graph dictionary.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.170
Right.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.460
The mappings are, of course,
completely different,

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.195
and the coloring dictionary
is being grown as we speak,

00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:53.920
or as we execute.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.220
But the graph dictionary
is actually not mutated.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.300
It's static.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:59.200
OK.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.580
And so this check here says
that I'm going to go ahead,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.870
and if it's not in
coloring, oh, that's great.

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.870
I'm going to go ahead and
whatever color I have,

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.030
I'm going to go ahead
and color it with that.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:12.760
That's what coloring
start equals color does.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.090
It just colors the node.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:14.590
OK.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:18.970
And then that effectively
is adding the key value pair

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.530
start comma color to
the coloring dictionary.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:23.950
That's what it does.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.750
Otherwise-- well, I
got two cases here.

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:27.250
Right.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.490
This thing has already been
colored, but I have two cases.

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.910
I want to color it with
something different from what

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.320
it's already been colored.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.180
That's a problem.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:37.970
That's a problem.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.760
That's exactly when
we get a five cycle

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.410
and we throw up our hands.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.490
So we're done here.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.870
We just say doesn't matter
what we've colored so far,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.150
it's all garbage.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.160
You know, this thing can't be
colored with two colors given

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.990
the constraints I
have, so I'm just

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.630
going to return false
and an empty dictionary.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.030
So anything that coloring
had in it, I mean, is gone.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.530
Right.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.330
Because it's bogus.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.630
Otherwise, this
recursion would say,

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.850
oh, well, I'm going to return
true for this thing here,

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.070
and I'm going to--

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:16.330
it has been colored, which means
that, you know, I haven't--

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.032
I don't want to do
any more work on it.

00:41:18.032 --> 00:41:19.240
I mean, I got this node here.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.781
It's already-- it
was already colored

00:41:20.781 --> 00:41:22.360
and was consistently colored.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.880
So if I don't want to
get into infinite loops,

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.910
I better not, you know, start
traversing nodes from this node

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:29.691
because I've already
seen it before.

00:41:29.691 --> 00:41:30.190
All right.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.190
So the fact that it's
already colored correctly

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:34.960
is a termination condition.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.470
This is important.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.820
That says that I don't want
to keep repeating myself,

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.395
that is like going through
the cycle over and over.

00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:42.895
Right.

00:41:42.895 --> 00:41:44.440
If you didn't have that, right?

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.530
That make sense?

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.450
Yep.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.670
That's important.

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:52.250
So, now-- well, this is a flip.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.670
So there's no recursion,
there's no procedure calls here,

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.650
this is just flipping the color.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:58.860
That make sense?

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.110
So, now, the last part, which
is the part where I'm actually

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:08.300
doing depth first search
is the part which says, OK,

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:14.900
I got to the point now
where I'm-- essentially,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.640
haven't done any returns here.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.880
Right.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.810
I've colored this with color,
and I've flipped the color.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:22.310
Right.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.560
So these two lines are executed.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.180
No returns.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.710
These lines are executed.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:33.429
And, now, I have clearly
already colored start

00:42:33.429 --> 00:42:34.970
and I flipped the
color and I'm going

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.220
to go ahead and make the
recursive call corresponding

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:43.520
to the neighbors
of start, and all

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.620
I have to do to look at
the neighbors of start

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.450
is to return the
list corresponding

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.510
to the value of graph start.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.370
Remember, I said,
graph A or graph start

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.930
is going to give you this--

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.800
this list, and I can go
ahead and append to it and--

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.495
I'm not going to mutate,
but I could have done that.

00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:02.120
And so that is going
to give me my list

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.911
and I'm just going to
go through, enumerate

00:43:03.911 --> 00:43:08.672
that list in whatever order that
it came to me, and start with--

00:43:08.672 --> 00:43:10.130
I'm going to call
the first element

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.970
vertex, because that's also a
vertex or a node synonymous.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.330
And I'm going to send in vertex
here, graph stays the same,

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.710
vertex is the same.

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.451
I've modified colorings, so
I want to pass that over.

00:43:21.451 --> 00:43:23.450
And, obviously, I'm going
to pass new color here

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:24.740
because I've done the flip.

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.610
Right.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.140
And if I ever--

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.390
I get something
that's false, that

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:33.505
means I've found an odd
cycle and I return false.

00:43:33.505 --> 00:43:34.880
And then if
everything works out,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.570
I return true in the coloring.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.620
OK.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.970
So if I go ahead and run that,
if my machine hasn't gone

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:45.120
to sleep, doesn't do very much.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.910
You know, the first graph,
it was not colorable.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.710
You can check these
results by yourself.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.380
But this is more--

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.250
the reason I'm
putting this up is

00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:00.300
to give you a sense of what the
coloring dictionary looks like.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.850
It's just so you get some
more exposure to these things.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.020
So in this case you get a
non-empty coloring dictionary

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.110
for the second run.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.650
So I ran it four times
on four different graphs.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.540
You get a non-empty
coloring dictionary.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.320
It's true.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.870
The graph is bipartite.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:17.670
And notice that the order in
which this coloring dictionary

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:18.990
was--

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.750
what was created was
certainly a function

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.920
of the execution
of the algorithm.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.810
But this order might
actually change

00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:29.280
if I keep running
this algorithm,

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.070
and if my machine had different
loads, and so on and so forth.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:36.540
But you would always get through
for any graph representation

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.570
that is bipartite
or too colorable.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.890
But you have no control over
whether F hat comes first,

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.652
or E hat comes first.

00:44:46.652 --> 00:44:47.610
Those could be flipped.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:48.660
All right.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.880
So never depend on the order
of keys in a dictionary.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.760
OK.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.530
But, certainly, the
existence of keys

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.930
in a dictionary you can-- or the
nonexistence you can depend on.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:44:59.430
All right.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.929
Good.

00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:04.100
So that's really
all I had to say.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.097
Any questions?

00:45:08.771 --> 00:45:09.270
All right.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.380
Excellent.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.580
I want credit for
finishing one minute early.
