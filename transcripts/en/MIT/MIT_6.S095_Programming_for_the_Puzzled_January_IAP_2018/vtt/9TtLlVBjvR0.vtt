00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.270
SRINI DEVADAS: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.650
Thanks for making it here
through the snow and sleet.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.450
You will be, quote
unquote, rewarded

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.260
with a cool little puzzle that
has both recreational value as

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.480
well as a deep connection to the
most popular sorting algorithm,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.700
or at least the most commonly
used sorting algorithm,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.670
called quicksort.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.270
And so what we have
up here is what

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.460
I call the disorganized
handyman puzzle.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.550
This is not a puzzle
of my invention,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
but I called it this because
I think at some point

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.200
when I read this, it
was a carpenter who

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.620
had a bunch of nuts
and bolts in his bag,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.600
and they were all mixed up.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.650
So rather than having these
nuts attached to the bolts,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.640
he was disorganized and the
nuts and bolts were separate.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.670
And then they all got
mixed up together in a bag,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.540
OK?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
Now, obviously, all puzzles
are a little bit contrived.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.820
And so we're going
to assume here

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.990
that there's 100 different
nuts and 100 associated bolts.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.730
And these 200 objects are all
mixed up into this one bag

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.100
that the carpenter is carrying.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.820
And not only that,
each of the bolts

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.210
is unique in terms of its size.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.250
And as I mentioned, there is
an associated nut associated

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.550
with each unique bolt. And
so, as you can imagine,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.320
the goal of this puzzle
is going to be finding

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.150
the most efficient
way of creating

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.730
some organization in
this bag by attaching

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.230
each nut to the corresponding
bolt, or vice versa.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.280
And you can assume that
there's no ambiguity because

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.920
of the uniqueness of
the nuts and the bolts.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.450
And there's 100 pairs
waiting to be discovered.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.600
And you can try to
make that process as

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.220
efficient as possible.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.910
As with all of the puzzles
that we look at here,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.180
there's going to be naive slash
straightforward way of doing

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.180
this.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.250
You're going to go ahead and
figure that out pretty quickly.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
We're going to analyze
the complexity of that,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.140
or how long it takes for
a specific example of 100

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.180
nuts and 100 bolts,
and then we're

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.847
going to scratch our heads and
try and do better, all right?

00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:59.430
And as I mentioned,
obviously, there's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.530
going to be some programming
associated with this.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.190
And we're not going to
represent nuts and bolts

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.040
in programs or codes.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.270
We're going to switch gears and
talk about sorting once we're

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.250
done with this puzzle.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.110
Good.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.460
The only way that
you or the carpenter,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.410
if you're the
carpenter's helper,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.000
have of checking to see that
a nut attaches to a bolt

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.490
is to try it out.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.080
And the nuts and bolts are
different enough in size

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.990
that even if you had
your eyes closed or it

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.410
was a dark room, if the
nut attaches to the bolt,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.290
it would screw on perfectly.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.360
If the bolt is smaller than the
nut, it would just go through

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.670
and it would be obvious that the
bolt is smaller than the nut.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.160
And if the nut is
smaller than the bolt,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.690
it would also be obvious
because the bolt won't

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.780
go through it, which
makes perfect sense

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.920
from a physical
standpoint, right?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.140
And you all tried this before.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.110
We've had-- maybe
not all of you,

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.400
but I've certainly had
occasion to discover

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.350
pairs of nuts and bolts, though
it was never 100 of them.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.180
So that's kind of a little
bit contrived, as I said.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.940
All right, good.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.275
So the setup is clear?

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:27.960
We're good on the setup?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.740
Excellent.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.170
So what is the straightforward
way of doing this?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.070
Someone.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.360
Yeah, Fadi back there.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.120
AUDIENCE: So like
choose a nut by random

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.950
and try every
different bolt in turn.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.200
SRINI DEVADAS: Right, we
could choose a nut at random,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.420
try every different bolt,
or choose a bolt at random

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.000
and try every different nut.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.830
And we're guaranteed, in this
case, that there is a pairing.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.730
And so after we do that, we can
put this paired nut and bolt

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.700
aside and we've shrunk
the problem down to one

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.720
less than the original problem.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.690
If I started out with 100 pairs
that are not paired together,

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.150
but there's 100
nuts and 100 bolts,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.110
then I get one pair
which is a correct pair,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.200
and I have 99 nuts
left and 99 bolts left.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.640
And I keep going.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.020
Perfectly reasonable
way of doing things.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.600
And let me show you
how that would work.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.680
These slides were made by
my daughters many years ago

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.475
you know, back when
they listened to me.

00:05:33.475 --> 00:05:35.850
I have a fat chance of getting
them to do any work for me

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.010
anymore.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.260
But they are busier than they
were, I guess, years ago.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.070
At least they pretend to be.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.310
And there you go.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.970
You end up, in this particular
example, which obviously

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.330
has many fewer than
100 nuts and bolts,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.150
you end up checking this.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.100
And in the worst case,
how many comparisons

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.170
would I have had to do if I
had 100 nuts and 100 bolts?

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.157
In the worst case,
I would have to--

00:06:08.157 --> 00:06:09.032
AUDIENCE: Do all 100.

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:10.532
SRINI DEVADAS: I
have to do all 100,

00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:12.570
because I might just
have gotten unlucky.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.740
Like I said, we're not
eyeballing this at all.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.020
You could probably prune
the search a little bit

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.300
with respect to putting aside--

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.490
not having to do an
exact comparison.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.290
But let's just say
that even looking

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.650
at a nut, as opposed
to even touching it

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.740
with the bolt that
you've chosen,

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.520
is, in fact, a comparison.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.852
You're just eyeballing it
as opposed to physically

00:06:36.852 --> 00:06:38.310
touching the bolt
and nut together,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.060
and we're going to
call that a comparison.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.070
And if you do that, and if
you make that assumption, then

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.750
obviously, you're going to
have to look at all 100 nuts

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.630
if you have a random bolt,
in the worst case, OK?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:51.670
You might get lucky.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.270
On an average, it
might be only 50.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.570
We're not going to do that
type of analysis here.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.980
So that's good.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.980
And what is the complexity
in terms of the growth rate

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.100
of this particular algorithm?

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:18.050
If I had N nuts
and bolts, then I

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:34.800
do N comparisons in the worst
case, to find the first pair.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.230
And when I say first pair,
I mean the correct pairing

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.000
that's associated with
the nut and the bolt.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.615
And what happens-- yeah,
Kevin, you have a question?

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:46.490
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
be less than N squared,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.730
because once you find each
pair, you have one less?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.230
SRINI DEVADAS:
That's exactly right.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:58.370
It's absolutely less than N
square in terms of numerics.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.050
The growth rate is a slightly
different question, right?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.650
It's related, obviously.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:10.640
And so if you do this and
you get the first pair,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.710
you now have a problem that
is of size N minus 1, right?

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.140
And so in this case,
how many comparisons

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.490
am I going to make when
I have N minus 1 nuts

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.830
and N minus 1 bolts,
in the worst case?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.220
I'm going to do N minus
1 comparisons, right?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.560
And then I keep going down.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:38.030
And you could argue
that at the very end,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.870
when I have two nuts and
two bolts, one comparison,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:49.140
if I assume that this was a
perfect set of nuts and bolts,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.800
that we had all pairs
right at the beginning,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.880
you could argue that that
small problem corresponding

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.530
to two nuts and bolts can be
solved using one comparison.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:07.350
And you immediately know which
nut pairs with which bolt,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.270
and the other one as well.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.590
But let's call it a
confirmation comparison,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:18.870
and essentially say you need two
comparisons here and one here.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:25.320
You can obviously shave a
number a little bit out of this.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.445
But this goes back to--

00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:29.070
Kevin is right.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.580
It's less than N square if
you look at it numerically.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.860
But the growth rate is
N square, because we

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.255
know that N plus N
minus 1 plus N minus 2,

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:47.690
dot dot dot, 2 plus 1 is N
times N plus 1 divided by 2.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.750
And sure, you could
take this 1 off

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.530
and this would become N
times N minus 1 divided by 2,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.620
but that growth
rate is N square.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.100
Grows as N square.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.630
So if you had 100 nuts
and hundreds bolts,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.410
you're talking about something
of the order of 5,000

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.800
comparisons if you want
to do it numerically.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.420
And it grows as N squared.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.430
If you had 1,000,
then it would be

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.150
1,000 times 1,000,
which is 1 million,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.040
divided by 2, that's 500,000.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.760
So that is astronomical
in terms of its growth.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.530
You don't want to do that.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.120
Obviously a contrived problem,
but N square in general,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.480
when you talk
about manual labor,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.790
is generally not very good.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.190
So we'd like to improve this.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.450
And we've been talking
about recursion.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.680
We've been talking about
divide and conquer.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.770
This is not divide and
conquer in the true sense

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:54.740
in that you're going to a
smaller problem, admittedly.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.080
But recall I said,
divide and conquer

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.960
is usually used when
you break the problem

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:07.220
up into fractional pieces,
which means in mergesort,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.630
for example, we took--

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.660
or the tiling puzzle, we took
courtyard and we broke it up

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.930
into four courtyards.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.100
So essentially, we
had four quarters

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.140
in the case of
the tiling puzzle.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.630
We had two halves in
the case of mergesort.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:30.980
Here we are solving,
basically, one nut and bolt

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.140
in the original puzzle.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.900
And then we're going
from N to N minus 1,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.882
and so there's many
more steps, right?

00:11:38.882 --> 00:11:42.110
The one thing to remember when
you think about complexity

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:48.044
is that when you go N to N
divided by 2 to N divided by 4,

00:11:48.044 --> 00:11:50.210
and then you keep going,
and you go all the way down

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:55.100
to 1, this, of course,
when you go like this,

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.130
there's a linear
number of steps.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.100
But when you do
that, how many steps

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.290
do you have to get all
the way to 1 in relation--

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.180
if you start with N, how
many steps do you have?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.840
If this were 64--

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.400
or let's just take
a simpler one.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.620
If this were 4, how
many steps would I have?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.760
I would have two steps.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.686
If this were 8, I'd
have three steps.

00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:25.810
And so what's that formula?

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.600
AUDIENCE: Logarithm.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.641
SRINI DEVADAS: Logarithm.

00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:30.720
Log to the base 2, right?

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.980
So that's the power
of fractional sizes.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.010
And this is actually a
very fundamental notion

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.940
that is going to appear
over and over if you

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.810
do any algorithms work or
take any algorithms classes.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:49.250
That divide and conquer
is very efficient,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.760
because the number of
steps in order to get down

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.050
to small problems
is relatively small.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.800
It's a logarithm.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.160
Now, if you broke this
up into three parts

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.490
and you went to
N/3, et cetera, then

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.560
this would be log to
the base something else,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.920
log to the base 3.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.524
So log to the base 2 came
because we broke it up

00:13:14.524 --> 00:13:18.219
and we went down
to half the size.

00:13:18.219 --> 00:13:19.760
Now remember, of
course, I mean, it's

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.490
not that the complexity
here is just logarithmic.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.890
It's that you do
have two problems.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:33.380
This is a function of the
particular specific algorithm

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.150
that corresponds to
divide and conquer.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.920
But in the case
of mergesort, it's

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.820
not that we just
went from N to N/2--

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.490
well, we went from N to N/2,
but there were two N/2 size

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.250
problems.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.460
But the beauty of
divide and conquer

00:13:49.460 --> 00:14:02.880
is if I magically broke
up the N sized problem--

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.820
and let's go back
to nuts and bolts--

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:15.570
into two problems
of size N/2, so

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:21.900
each problem has N/2 nuts
and N/2 bolts, each problem--

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:27.960
I'll repeat that-- N/2 nuts
and N/2 bolts, then if I used--

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.580
and this is magical, right?

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.610
I don't quite know
how to do that yet.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.360
But if I did that, then think
about what happens with respect

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.620
to these comparisons.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:46.730
So I said when N was 100,
I needed 5,000 comparisons

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.270
for this naive algorithm.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:54.760
But now if I did this and I
got two N/2's, then I have 50,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.320
so I call that M equals 50.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.110
And then I have another
one which is M equals 50.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.880
And so roughly how
many comparisons would

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.590
I need if I had, as problem of
size 50, 50 nuts and 50 bolts,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.600
using our original
naive strategy?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.454
Roughly?

00:15:10.454 --> 00:15:11.770
AUDIENCE: 1200

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.740
SRINI DEVADAS: 1,225, right?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.520
Roughly.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.210
And this would be 1,225.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.530
And so, so that is 2,500.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:24.680
So of course, I haven't quite
told you how to do this.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.150
This is still magic.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.220
But I was upfront about it.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.900
But clearly, I've
gotten an improvement

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.670
if I have this magic, OK?

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.000
And so let's talk about that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.950
Let's turn this nuts and
bolts puzzle, or the solution

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.500
to this puzzle, and try
and figure out a divide

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.960
and conquer strategy
which is distinctly

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.420
different from the brute
force strategy that

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.950
just reduced by one, all right?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:59.070
Now, we'll-- this
is just going on.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:02.480
So the comparisons in the
worst case is what I just said.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.790
And it grows as N square.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.190
So big O N square means
it just grows as N square.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.520
That's asymptotic notation
that we won't go into,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.810
but you understand
what that means now.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.080
So if I do a
straightforward divide

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.720
and conquer, like I
did with mergesort,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.120
where I just took the
array and I split it

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.050
in half, if I take
these nuts and bolts

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.490
and I separate the nuts out,
and I put 50 on this side, 50

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.320
on the other side,
take the bolts,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.990
put 50 on this side and
50 on the other side,

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:37.572
is that going to work?

00:16:37.572 --> 00:16:38.780
No, that's not going to work.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.330
And the reason is if I do this
arbitrary partition, then--

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.540
and let's say that I take
this, and the two of you

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.940
get together, you're
friends and partners,

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:53.515
and you say, let's do this in
parallel and save some time,

00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:54.890
you're still going
to be counting

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.600
the number of comparisons.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.490
And so, obviously,
you also would

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.260
like to reduce the
number of comparisons.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.740
But you can't even use a
helper here in the sense

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.569
that if you split
this up-- obviously,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:09.349
this was not 50 and 50,
but three nuts and three

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.200
bolts on one side and four
and four on the other side.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.319
As you can see
from this example,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:22.849
you had a situation where the
matching nut was in one pile

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:27.589
on the left for a bolt that
was on the right-hand side.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.840
And that could happen
not just for one,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.240
which would kill the
process, but could

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.220
happen for many nut-bolt pairs.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.500
So we can't do that.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.810
We cannot use the
straightforward divide

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.020
and conquer approach.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.000
So this comes to the
first interesting question

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.694
that we have here, which is, how
do we exploit the fact that all

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:51.860
of you are going to help me?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.920
So I'm the disorganized
carpenter or handyman.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.020
And I'd like to break this
up, first into two piles, such

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.960
that I can go off and send
one or more of you off

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.700
and say, OK, I can guarantee
that this is a subproblem,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.860
in the sense that the
original problem had

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.830
all of the bolts that
matched all of the nuts that

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.210
were in my pile.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.735
I want to break it up
into two problems in--

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:25.620
this is the magic that we have.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.300
We need to figure
out this magic--

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.730
such that if I give you
50 nuts and 50 bolts,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.350
and I keep 50 nuts
and 50 bolts, that you

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.320
can solve that problem.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.090
It is a problem.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.220
I mean, there's a
matching there, right?

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.610
For those 50 nuts, you have
the 50 bolts in your pile.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:44.967
Same thing with me.

00:18:44.967 --> 00:18:45.800
So how do I do that?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.903
Yeah, go ahead, Josh.

00:18:51.903 --> 00:18:53.090
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.940
Can you compare the size
of nuts to each other?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.190
SRINI DEVADAS: No, you cannot.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.170
Yeah, good question.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.910
So the only thing you
can do is you have a nut

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.770
and you have a bolt,
and if it goes through,

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.790
then the nut is bigger.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:11.890
If it doesn't, then
the bolt is bigger.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:15.880
And then if it fits exactly,
you have a match, all right?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.300
Great, so yeah,
go ahead, Ganatra.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.600
AUDIENCE: So once
you get one to fit,

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.370
you can use that to sort of
like order the other ones.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.906
Because it fits in
perfectly, right, it fits,

00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:29.510
so all the ones that-- you
just go through all of them,

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.530
and if it goes
through just the hole,

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.284
then you know
those are smaller--

00:19:34.284 --> 00:19:35.950
well, they're bigger.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.459
And then if it
doesn't fit through,

00:19:37.459 --> 00:19:38.542
then you know that those--

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:39.310
SRINI DEVADAS: Right, great.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.030
Excellent.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:46.810
So Ganatra has discovered
this notion of pivoting.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.440
And pivoting is
essentially something

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.320
that is best described here in
the animation that gives you

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.290
a divide and conquer strategy.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.040
Now, I answered Josh's question,
and that was a key question.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.220
And I'm not going to violate
the answer to that question

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:13.480
by using some other strategy
that does not correspond

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.540
to this nut-bolt check, right?

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.730
So the only thing I
can do in this puzzle

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.140
is a nut-bolt check.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.650
But I do get three
potential possibilities

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.860
whenever I do a nut-bolt check.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.840
I do get the information
about a perfect match,

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.880
whether the nut is smaller,
or whether the nut is bigger.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.550
And that's all I need in
order to do pivoting, right?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.380
And so what's going to
happen here is I go ahead

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:48.580
and I choose an arbitrary
bolt. And I don't even

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.515
actually need to find the match
before I start this process.

00:20:52.515 --> 00:20:55.450
So it's a small variant
on what Ganatra said,

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.660
but it's really a
pretty small variant.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.680
And when I see that
this is not a match,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.160
and in fact, the nut is
bigger, then I put the nut

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.540
on the right-hand side pile.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.330
When I see that
the nut is smaller,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.310
then I put the nut in
the left-hand side pile.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.407
And I see a match, I
just put that aside.

00:21:18.407 --> 00:21:19.990
I don't put it in
either of the piles,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.570
because I'm going to
actually-- it turns out

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.590
I'm not going to get a pile
of 50 and 50, or in this case,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.670
I'm actually going to get
something like three and three,

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.950
because I'm going to
get one match out of it.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.350
So in general, I'm
not necessarily

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.970
going to get equal size piles.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.660
So that's actually a
little bit of an issue,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.700
and we'll get back
to that maybe later.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:49.270
But I will get a
matching, and I'll

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.680
get a pile on the left that
is the perfect problem,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.270
perfect subproblem.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.400
There I can hand it
off to any of you

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.650
and you can go off and
solve it and it will work.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.350
And I'll get a pile on the
right, same thing for that.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.950
So this was a match,
but I don't stop.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.100
I don't put the nut in
either of the two piles.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.840
It's just going
to stay up there.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.820
And then I keep going.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:20.020
And I make up my right
pile and my left pile.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.770
Now, I'm not quite done yet.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.400
What do I do now?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.645
Yeah, back there.

00:22:25.645 --> 00:22:28.435
AUDIENCE: You would test
every screw into that nut

00:22:28.435 --> 00:22:29.554
to see which one--

00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:30.720
SRINI DEVADAS: That's right.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.070
So remember, I kept the--

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.960
I guess you used a
different term here.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.570
You used-- I said
bolt, you said screw.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.090
That's fine.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.520
But we're talking
about a nut here.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.020
So let's go with the nut.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.260
And this nut that
I put aside, I'm

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.760
going to now compare that, not
with this pivot bolt that I

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.770
picked, which is now set aside
and never have used that again,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.600
but I'm going to put
that aside, and I'm

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:07.901
going to compare each of the
bolts with this pivot nut

00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:08.400
that I have.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:15.370
So the pivot bolt was
picked and I discover

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.510
the associated pivot nut.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.170
And now I'm going to use
that pivot nut, which

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:29.820
is the nut that I have up
here, the light green one,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.280
and then I'm going
to do the same thing.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:38.600
And all of this does not violate
the answer to Josh's question.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.700
And it's going to do
exactly the right thing

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:47.970
in terms of giving
me two piles that

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:54.990
are beautiful problems that
are going to be solvable.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:24:00.690
There's nothing that's stopping
me from repeating this process.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.580
When we talk about
divide and conquer,

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.530
usually we talk about
recursion, and we

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.680
talk about repeatedly
doing divide and conquer.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:13.710
Then I wrote this up here in
terms of the N size problem

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.900
turned into two N/2 problems.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.120
Well, each of those
N/2 problems I

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.310
could turn into
two N/4 problems,

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.490
so I could have four N/4's,
and so on and so forth.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.450
And so I could clearly do that.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.410
And especially if
N is large, then I

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.500
want to get a reduction
in comparisons.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.780
And get this to
grow, by the way.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.580
And we won't do this analysis.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:39.550
But rather than
growing as N square,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:47.450
you'd like it to
grow as N log N.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:54.120
And that's kind of the
asymptotic analysis

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.420
that you'll have to do if
you take a class like 6006.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.830
But the general sense that
you should take away from this

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.040
is that you're going to have
a logarithmic number of steps.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.680
And obviously, that doesn't
imply a logarithmic number

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.950
of comparisons, because the
number of subproblems in each

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.630
of those steps is doubling.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.390
Initially, you had a problem,
then you have two subproblems,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.010
and then you have
four subproblems.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:22.380
Each of them are small
in size, but together,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.390
assuming these problems
are N/2 and N/2, then

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.210
you can get something that's
substantially smaller than N

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.690
square, namely N log N, OK?

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.070
And you can do that numerically.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.290
And I don't want to
get into that too much,

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.380
but be happy to talk to you
about this after lecture

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.640
or during office hours.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.370
There's a couple of caveats.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.490
One of them is there's
no guarantee here

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.510
if I pick a random pivot
bolt that I'm actually

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.980
going to get N/2 and N/2.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.930
It's going to be
one less than that.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.960
Maybe it'd be in over
N/2 and N over 2 minus 1.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.250
I could get something-- if
I picked a large pivot bolt,

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:13.010
I might get a very skewed
pair of piles, right?

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.227
One of them could
have 80 in them--

00:26:15.227 --> 00:26:17.060
80 nuts and bolts in
them, and the other one

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.880
could have 20 nuts
and bolts in them, OK?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.150
So that's something
to worry about.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.280
We won't worry about that.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.719
But we'll talk about
it when we move

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:29.510
to sorting, which is
what we're going to do

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.980
in just a couple of minutes.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.510
So people buy the solution
to the nuts and bolts puzzle.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:37.520
Clearly, it's going to
give you some efficiency.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.660
If you pick a
middling size bolt,

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.880
maybe you can eyeball that.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.980
It's a little bit of a violation
of what we've talked about,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:46.940
but you could clearly--

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.120
I mean, let's assume
that you can make out

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.220
the difference between
something that's as

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.530
thick as this and that finger.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.520
And then you pick
something in the middle.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.360
And then you can
get two large piles

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.510
that are roughly equal in size
from the original really large

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.320
pile.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.330
And at least at
the beginning, you

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.030
could probably
get, in the context

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.605
of this puzzle, piles that
are roughly similar in size.

00:27:11.605 --> 00:27:12.980
And after that,
it doesn't really

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.900
matter once you've
broken things up.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.407
So N is not 100, but N
is more like 5 or 10.

00:27:18.407 --> 00:27:20.990
At that point, it doesn't really
matter what strategy you use,

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:24.770
because the numbers aren't
really different, regardless

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.750
of the strategy.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.440
So good, all right.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.870
So I promised you a
relationship to sorting.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.540
And obviously, we want to
do some programming here.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.310
And it turns out
that just like we

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.200
had mergesort,
which was a divide

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.630
and conquer out
algorithm, it turns out

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:49.360
this pivoting strategy turns
into a strategy for divide

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.300
and conquer that is quite
different from mergesort,

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:57.490
but is equally applicable
to sorting numbers.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.510
And so let me remind
you what mergesort was.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.420
And then I'm going
to contrast mergesort

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.910
with quicksort, which is a
pivot-based sorting algorithm.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.830
So forget about nuts and bolts.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:17.090
We're now down to boring
numbers, integers.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:22.000
And we want to just sort these
numbers in ascending order.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:35.640
So if I have a bunch
of numbers and I

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.800
want to sort these in ascending
order, mergesort would say,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:48.090
I'm going to go ahead and
break it up into halves.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.580
And let's just do one
level of recursion.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.650
With all of these things
you can always do more,

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.810
but these problems
aren't large enough

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:58.860
that you really want to
do that in this example.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.920
And the important thing is
you just broke it into half.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.880
But it was easy.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.680
The split was easy.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.030
You slice the list, splice
the list, what have you.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:13.860
And you assume that
somehow you can sort this

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:14.870
in ascending order.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:21.580
And in this case, you
need to go to that.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.520
And then you sort this
in ascending order.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.680
So you go like that.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.160
And then you need to do a merge.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.880
And we used what we call the
two finger algorithm to do

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.970
the merge that
essentially says, I'm

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.850
going to assume that
this array is sorted

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.400
and this array is
sorted, and I'm

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.210
going to put pointers up at the
beginning of these two arrays.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.322
And I'm going to do comparisons.

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:51.780
And I'm essentially
going to assume

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:59.490
that I have a blank array of
size six, blank list of size

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.080
six.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.220
And I'm going to be writing
into this blank array

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:09.450
the result of the comparison
that is, which one is

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:10.950
less in the comparisons.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:12.840
So I'm going to get minus 31.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.940
And then I compare
0 with minus 4,

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.140
and I'm going to get minus
4, 0, et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.220
So that was our merge.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.840
And the important
thing to remember

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:28.170
is that our merge algorithm
had an easy divide step,

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.130
and it had a more
difficult step that

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:36.420
corresponded to taking the
subarrays that were sorted,

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.510
and the work was
all in the merge,

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.680
putting the things together.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.080
Because the divide,
obviously, is just like chop.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:48.630
Now, as you can see
from the nuts and bolts,

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.060
division was non-trivial, right?

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.120
Division required pivoting.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.850
But there was no real
merge after that.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.630
And one side handed off,
let's say, to Ganatra

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:04.620
these 50 nuts and bolts after
I did the work in pivoting.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.609
And I kept 50 nuts
and bolts as well.

00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:09.150
We were done.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.760
I mean, maybe I wanted
the nuts and bolts back.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.530
I don't want him to
run away with it.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.980
But it wasn't like I
had to process anything

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.822
that he gave me back, right?

00:31:18.822 --> 00:31:20.280
If he paired them
up, then I didn't

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.960
have to process that, right?

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.788
So this is mergesort.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:34.120
The quicksort algorithm, which
I'll now describe to you,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.960
is divide and conquer,
two-way divide and conquer,

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.340
same as mergesort, but it
kind of flips the work.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.790
And it does more work up
front before the division,

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:49.760
and then this little
or no work at the end.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.700
So what happens here is--

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:55.060
the way we're going to
think about quicksort

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.900
is we're going to
choose a pivot.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.890
You can have some array here.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.710
And I can go ahead and just
call these a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.420
And I'm going to choose a pivot.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.440
And in the code that
I'm going to show you,

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.460
we're just going to go ahead
and choose the last element.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.530
We assume that this
is in random order.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.170
We're going to choose the
last element of this array

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.000
as the pivot.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.660
And what did we do with
the pivot back in our nuts

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.110
and bolts example?

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.736
We-- someone, what did
we do with the pivot?

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.659
Yeah, go ahead.

00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:36.950
AUDIENCE: We spliced around it.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:39.366
SRINI DEVADAS: Yeah, you just
basically spliced around it.

00:32:39.366 --> 00:32:40.780
You compared it with--

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.690
we took the pivot bolt, and
in this case of the puzzle,

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:44.940
you compared it with the nuts.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:47.274
Here we don't have nuts and
bolts, we just have numbers.

00:32:47.274 --> 00:32:48.856
And so you're going
to take that pivot

00:32:48.856 --> 00:32:51.230
and you're to start comparing
it with the other numbers.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:54.350
And you're exactly right in that
we're going to get to the point

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.660
where we have to
splice round it,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.230
which isn't your
standard Python splicing,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.860
because that requires
contiguous locations.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.770
But what you want to do is
you want to get to a situation

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.290
where you have something
like this, where you have

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.160
g somewhere in the
middle and all elements

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.230
less than g are to the left.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.960
And let's assume they're
all unique elements.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.980
All elements greater than
g are to the right, OK?

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.330
So this is exactly
pivoting around g.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:34.390
So it's referred to
as pivoting around g.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:38.470
Now, the nice thing
here, when you do this,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:44.530
is that you can go off and
you can fix the location of g.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:49.630
In fact, g's location,
just like the pair,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.900
the nut-bolt pair was
corresponding to the pivot nut,

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.881
and the pivot bolt was
determined during the pivoting

00:33:57.881 --> 00:33:58.380
step.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.420
And you never had
to check whether--

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.170
you never had to
discover that pair again.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:06.240
You can put that pair aside.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.330
The location of g,
the pivot chosen,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.650
in the final sorted
array, is determined

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.989
by this pivoting step, OK?

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:18.020
That makes sense?

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.330
And so this location,
whatever that index is,

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.270
it might be right in the middle.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.949
It might be a little bit skewed.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:26.750
But that location is determined.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:31.730
And if you did this with roughly
equal piles, if you will,

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.090
or equal sides, if there
were 100 elements here,

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.980
you might see 50-odd here
and 40-odd over there.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.620
Now, of course, if g happened
to be the largest number,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.320
then g would be all
the way to the right.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.670
So there's that to worry about.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.810
But this is the divide step.

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:57.290
So the divide step
is the pivoting step.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:07.000
And then you can go off and
sort each of those sublists.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.010
Because those less
than g are not

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:13.060
necessarily in ascending order.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:14.390
You just dumped them.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.160
There's still work to be done.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.890
And then the greater
than g, likewise.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.820
They're not necessarily
in ascending order.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.530
But you know that there's
42 elements corresponding

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.937
to less than g, and you
can go sort that array.

00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:27.520
And those are going
to be the first 42

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.310
elements of your final array.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:34.456
And the g is going to
be at the 43rd position.

00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:36.580
And then the ones that are
greater than g are going

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.840
to be to the right of that.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.300
All make sense?

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.556
Yeah, go ahead, Fadi.

00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:44.639
AUDIENCE: So like if we were
very unlucky and at each step,

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:46.555
we just picked the largest
number, the largest

00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:48.060
number, the largest
number, then it's

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.160
got to be N squared, correct?

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:49.630
SRINI DEVADAS: That's right.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.920
So that's pathological.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.130
Now, it turns out that,
amazingly, in order

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.190
to avoid that
situation when people

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:00.580
use quicksort in practice, which
is essentially this algorithm

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.240
that I describe, they take
the array that they're given

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.130
and they actually randomize it.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.450
They actually make it--

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.120
they shake it up.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.185
It's like you get
these nuts and bolts,

00:36:12.185 --> 00:36:13.810
and you want to close
your eyes and you

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.210
want to pick up a nut
that's middling in size,

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.544
and maybe all the small
ones are up at the top

00:36:18.544 --> 00:36:20.210
and the big ones are
down at the bottom.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.940
You want things in
the middle, so you

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.200
go, you shake, shake, shake.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.179
You randomize.

00:36:24.179 --> 00:36:25.720
And then go stick
your hand in About.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.090
Halfway through the
pile and pick up a nut,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.410
or pick up a bolt, right?

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.380
That's kind of
what happens here.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.400
So quicksort, it turns out--

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.160
and I'll just say this, and
if this doesn't make sense,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.910
ask me later.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.900
But it should give
you some intuition.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:46.720
The randomized quicksort, where
you have this random input,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.240
and you have some probabilistic
guarantee that you're

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.920
picking a pivot that is middling
in size in terms of an integer

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.700
size, is going to be
N log N in complexity.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.910
But the worst case
complexity of quicksort

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.180
is exactly as you
said, it's N square.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.570
But that's really not
something that you

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.530
need to understand deeply
to understand, well,

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.800
either the puzzle or the
rest of this lecture.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.534
You do get a sense of--

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.700
as long as you have a sense
of if you pick something

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.400
in the middle and these piles
are roughly equal in size,

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.200
I'm going to get
some improvement.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.660
The guarantee that
the piles are roughly

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.950
equal in size, all the way down
to the depths of recursion,

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:33.880
is a difficult one to achieve
in a deterministic way.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.780
But it's not hard to achieve
in a probablistic way

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.289
by doing this randomization.

00:37:39.289 --> 00:37:40.330
You had another question?

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:40.860
Yeah.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.235
AUDIENCE: So then why do we
use this more than mergesort,

00:37:43.235 --> 00:37:43.860
which is like--

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.443
SRINI DEVADAS: Ah,
that's exactly-- so

00:37:45.443 --> 00:37:48.300
that is the rest of the lecture,
which is only 10 minutes left.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.750
But OK, so that's the
rest of the lecture.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.810
So one of the things
that I said here,

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.460
I said a blank list of size six.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.480
So what mergesort requires,
in order for mergesort

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.630
to be efficient, you
needed auxiliary storage

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:10.750
that corresponded to
the size of the list.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.660
Because right at the
first level of recursion,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.140
when you got two arrays
that were N/2 and N/2,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.290
and they were both sorted,
and you had to merge the two

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.080
together to create the
final result corresponding

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.570
to the sorted
array, you ended up

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.140
requiring storage
that was N in size

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.740
in order to actually do
this two finger algorithm

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.050
and compare the minus
31's with the zeros

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.540
and then write them
into this array.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:44.800
Now, the obvious way of
taking this and going to here

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.570
is code that I'm going to show
you that is easy to write.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:55.516
And it requires a
blank list as well.

00:38:55.516 --> 00:38:56.890
I mean, the easy
way to do that--

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.380
and I'll just show you the
code, because it's easier

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:06.040
to show you the code as
opposed to waving my hands here

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.240
and potentially
confusing people.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.600
But let me show you first the
quicksort divide and conquer,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.910
which is absolutely trivial.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.640
I mean, just like mergesort was.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.660
But pivot partition
is this step here.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.820
This is the pivoting step.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.630
And this is what
that procedure does.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.950
So we'll get to that
in just a second.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.420
But the rest of it is simply
I'm going to go ahead,

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.010
and once I do the
pivot partition,

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.290
I have something
that looks like this.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.290
And then I just go off
and run quicksort on this

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.670
and quicksort on that.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.850
And I'm doing that
on the array itself.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.980
It's just like I
have this array,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.150
and I'm just saying I'm
going to call quicksort

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.560
with the indices
that are associated

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.841
with the beginning and
the end of this array.

00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:57.340
And then I'm going
to call quicksort

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.460
with the indices that begin
with the beginning and the end

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.860
of this array.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.960
And that same array is going
to be my final output, right?

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.470
So everything is done--

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.570
the term that's used
here is "in place."

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.550
So in place sorting
and insertion

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:17.950
sort, which is also N square,
and a few other things

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.100
are in place sorting algorithms,
which essentially say, look,

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:25.960
I need to sort all
of you in some way,

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.240
perhaps by age or something.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.480
And I don't want
another room, right?

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.430
I don't want to say,
who's the youngest here,

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.342
and then go over to
that room, and then

00:40:35.342 --> 00:40:37.800
who's the next youngest and go
over to the room, et cetera.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.265
I just want you to start
swapping positions here.

00:40:40.265 --> 00:40:41.890
And we're all going
to be in this room,

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.840
and somehow we're
going to get sorted.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.260
So that's in place.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.030
And when I have an array
that corresponds to integers,

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.850
I don't want another
blank list or blank array

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.650
and use that storage.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.870
And so that answers
your question

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.810
at the top level as to
why quicksort is used.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.780
And it's used because the
memory requirements of quicksort

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.610
are substantially
less than the memory

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.380
requirements of mergesort.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.280
And in fact, you can
do this pivoting step

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.375
using one integer as storage.

00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:16.000
You need the original
array, of course,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.700
but you needed that to
store all of the numbers.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.850
And the auxiliary storage, the
extra storage that you need,

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.785
is exactly the storage
for one integer

00:41:23.785 --> 00:41:26.110
where you store the pivot, OK?

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:28.200
And I'm going to show
you the naive way, which

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.970
is the regular quicksort.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.690
And that is a trivial
pivot partition.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:37.070
It's not the clever one,
which essentially says,

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:38.620
look, I'm going to
go ahead and I'm

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.350
going to create a new array.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.110
In fact, I have two arrays
that are less and more,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.190
or two lists.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.830
Together the sizes
of less and more

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:52.300
are going to be the size of
the original, maybe minus 1.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.940
I'm adding to less
and adding to more,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.460
depending on whether the
element is less than the pivot

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.060
or greater than the pivot.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.490
And then I'm good.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.790
So there's that algorithm,
which would just be, oh yeah,

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:06.010
I'm going to create
a new list here.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:07.960
And I'm going to compare a to g.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.740
And then I'm going to compare
b to g, et cetera, et cetera.

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:13.870
So this does not
give you anything.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.000
This is an
uninteresting algorithm.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.830
I'm sorry.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.680
Implementation-- this is an
uninteresting implementation,

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.150
OK?

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.410
It is much more--

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.620
you need to be
much more clever--

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.020
I don't need this anymore--

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.260
to do this in place.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:45.770
So what I want to do is I'm
going to take an example here.

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:53.503
I want to take this array.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.390
And I'm going to not
talk about the recursive

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.940
sorting or anything like
that, because that's easy.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.470
We kind of know how to do that.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:12.460
What I want to do is I want
to choose this as the pivot.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:16.950
And I want to
translate that somehow

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:23.800
into the final
pivoted output, which

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:37.560
is going to be 0,
minus 31, 1, 2, 65, 99.

00:43:41.326 --> 00:43:47.165
Oops, I have
something wrong here.

00:43:47.165 --> 00:43:48.790
So this should be
the other way around.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:49.920
83, right?

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.056
OK.

00:43:51.056 --> 00:43:51.800
Mm, bug.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.779
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:43:59.779 --> 00:44:00.320
This is fine.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.770
This is fine.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:01.436
I just need it--

00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:03.031
I don't need it to be sorted.

00:44:03.031 --> 00:44:03.530
OK, good.

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:04.850
Whew.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.760
All right.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.920
I just thought I found
the first bug in my book.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.420
So there's probably
many bugs in the book,

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.000
but I don't want to know.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.570
So I don't need
this to be sorted.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.910
Yeah, so there's
a 0, a minus 31.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.680
So the key is that
I've discovered this.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.650
And everything to the left
of that is less than 1.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:33.110
And everything to the right
of that is greater than 1.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.290
And that's the only
requirement that I have.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.020
And as I said, I mean, I
said this to begin with

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.182
and then I forgot, I
said we're not going

00:44:41.182 --> 00:44:42.390
to worry about the recursion.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.620
So clearly, I have
to do more work here

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:49.880
with respect to taking
this set of numbers

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.640
and sorting them in
ascending order, et cetera.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:57.620
But what I've done here is I
know that 1 is fixed in place,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.690
and 1 will never move.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.500
And I just have to turn
this into minus 31 and 0.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.090
And I have to do
some reordering here.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.150
But 1 is fixed in place.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.879
Now, the algorithm that
I'm going to show you,

00:45:10.879 --> 00:45:12.170
I'm going to show you the code.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:16.410
And it's probably
code that you won't

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:24.050
be able to parse, at least
in minutes or seconds.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:28.490
And this code is
in place pivoting.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.310
It's clever code.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:37.610
And what it does is it has
one additional variable

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:42.800
worth of storage that we're
going to call the pivot.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.190
So you see the
variable pivot there.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:51.860
And just using that one
additional integer storage,

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.590
it manages to transform this
array using a linear number

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:01.160
of steps into this array.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.380
So you can see that
this is non-trivial.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.530
And I need to move from
here to there without having

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.350
this extra storage.

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:09.141
If you had extra storage,
it would be easy.

00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:10.260
We know how to do that.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.890
But if you didn't,
you need this code

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.020
that has an outer while loop.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.430
You see while not done.

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:18.560
And then it's got two
inner while loops in it.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.590
And it's got a couple of
counters, couple of pointers

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:23.790
I should say, to indices.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:29.150
And you go left and right, and
you magically get this answer.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:32.720
But there's no magic here,
because we have the code up

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.750
and we can run it.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.430
And computers aren't
smart, so clearly,

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:38.930
that code is doing
something clever,

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.192
and we just need to
understand that, all right?

00:46:41.192 --> 00:46:41.900
So I'm going to--

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.562
in the couple of
minutes I have left,

00:46:43.562 --> 00:46:45.020
this is the last
thing I want to do

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:48.590
is I want to tell you
how this code works.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.440
And it's really pretty code.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.130
And it's clever code.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:59.430
So what I have is I have two
pointers, top and bottom.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.510
So I'm going to, essentially,
say that top is--

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:05.700
bottom is 0.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.840
Initially, it's minus 1, but
we go ahead and increment it.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.700
And top is 8.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.130
And so how many--

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:20.870
I have 9-- 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:24.110
So top is pointing to the pivot.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.990
So this is pointing to
pivot, which top is 8.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.240
And bottom is pointing
to the first element.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.250
So these two while
loops are essentially

00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:40.160
going from the left of the
array and going this way

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.200
from the right of the array.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.800
So what we're going to do--

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.770
and don't worry about exactly
how the code does this.

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:52.130
I'm going to show you the
way this array is transformed

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:56.990
and the way these
pointers are changed.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.200
And then you'll get a sense
of how this code works.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.910
And obviously,
this transformation

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.500
happens in one of
those while loops.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.270
So we have the pivot
corresponding to 1.

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:10.910
And bottom equals
0 and top equals 8.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.980
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:19.610
to start moving leftward from--

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:21.845
this would be the
second inner while loop.

00:48:21.845 --> 00:48:22.970
I'm going to start moving--

00:48:29.718 --> 00:48:32.490
oh, I'm sorry.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.832
I'll start with bottom.

00:48:35.832 --> 00:48:38.040
I'm going to increment--
bottom is initially minus 1.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.410
I increment it to 0.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:47.850
And I start moving rightward
from the left of the list

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:53.490
and try and find an element
that is greater than 1.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.530
And that is immediate.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:59.460
I realize that 4 is
greater than 1, OK?

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.430
So when I realize that
4 is greater than 1,

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.670
I'm going to copy over 4.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:08.640
And this is doesn't mean that
I'm copying the entire array.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.350
I'm just going to copy over 4.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.960
But I'm writing what the array
looks like, because that's

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.080
important, over to here.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.860
And you might say--

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.950
pivot equals 1.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.910
You might say, oh, but I
overwrote the location 1.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.680
And I'm like, don't
worry about it.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:30.570
I do have 1 stored in my pivot.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.600
So my pivot has 1 in it.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.310
So I haven't lost anything here.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.350
It's not like I threw
away any locations.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.290
I do have that extra location.

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:44.100
So I did this rightward
move going from the left.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:52.890
Now I'm going to go
leftward from the right.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:56.765
And I'm going to look for
something that is less than 1

00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:58.140
and I'm going to
try and move it.

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.880
So basically, what
this algorithm does

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.230
is it tries to find
things that are--

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:09.349
if a is greater than g, it
moves a to the rightmost part

00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.890
of the array.

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:14.450
And the same thing,
if d is less than g,

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:17.640
then it moves it to the
left part of the array.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.420
So depending on whether
the comparison to g

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.550
is greater or less,
you want to end up

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.020
in the edges of the array.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.480
And you're going to try and
get the edges of the array

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.470
to be correct in the sense
that they have elements

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:33.294
on the left that are
less than the pivot,

00:50:33.294 --> 00:50:34.710
and the elements
on the right that

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:35.980
are greater than the pivot.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.850
And you're trying to
get to the middle.

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:41.370
And when your two
pointers converge,

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.060
your top and bottom pointers
converge, you're done.

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:50.010
So let's do a couple more
steps and close this lecture.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.520
So I did the right step.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.020
Now I'm going rightward.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.630
And now I'm going
to go leftward.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:01.740
What is the first element
that is less than 1--

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:06.960
no, less, than 1.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.654
0, right?

00:51:10.654 --> 00:51:11.820
Yes, but I'm going this way.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:12.990
AUDIENCE: oh!

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.370
SRINI DEVADAS: Yeah, I'm going--

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.850
I'm glad you pointed that out.

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:19.740
I needed to make sure.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:22.920
So I went rightward
the first time,

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.130
and I want to go
leftward this time.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:29.050
So this would be-- so I
come here and I see 0.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.470
When I see 0, what
I'm going to do

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.950
is I'm going to
transform the array.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:38.060
I'll write this out to
make sure I get this right.

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:48.180
And so right now I have 4,
65 to minus 31, 0, et cetera.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.940
And I'm going to go this
way, and I'm going to put--

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.290
when I see the 0, I'm going
to copy over 0 over here

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:04.570
and leave the 0 in
here for a second.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:09.590
And there's no problem here,
because 4 was copied over here.

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:13.030
And so now I overwrote 4 with 0.

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.444
OK, now you kind of see,
maybe get some sense

00:52:15.444 --> 00:52:16.610
of how this algorithm works.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:21.050
This is the first interesting
step where I took 0,

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:23.350
and because 0 is less
than 1, as I mentioned,

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.200
I want to jam it all
the way to the left.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:28.030
Just put it all the
way to the left.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:31.540
And I'm cool with losing
4, because 4 is being put

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.650
all the way to the right, OK?

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.690
Now, at this point,
my bottom and top

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.630
are going to get modified.

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:45.820
My bottom is still
0, but the top is 4,

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:50.530
because I moved-- top was 8, and
I decremented top all the way

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:51.940
to the point where it became 4.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.340
And I realized that
0 was less than 1.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.540
And then I copied over that
value over to the bottom.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.030
You can kind of see
the code up there.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:05.350
This is actually an
output of that code.

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.330
And I put a 0 in here.

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.250
So that's what my
counters look like.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:11.920
And it's only a
couple of more steps.

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.900
We're going to go now go right.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.130
And I'm going to go do this
again, except that 0 is already

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.850
taken care of, so now I see 65.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:28.270
Clearly I'm going to
have a situation where

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:32.710
if I go this way, 65 is
greater than the pivot,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:39.670
so I'm going to go
0, 65, 2, minus 31.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.810
And because 65 is
greater than the pivot,

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:46.580
I'm going to write it into what
the top was, which obviously

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.080
got copied over that way.

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:54.820
So I'm going to have 65 in
here, 99, 83, 782, and 4.

00:53:54.820 --> 00:54:00.370
So now after this
step, bottom equals 1.

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:04.450
And the reason for that was
65 was in the location on 1,

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.730
and top equals 4.

00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:09.680
And then the next
one, someone want

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.550
to tell me what the
next one is going to be?

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.410
If I go leftward.

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.990
I'm going to start
from here, top was 4.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.690
So I was pointing at 65.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:33.050
And I'm looking for something
that when I go this way,

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.090
I saw 65 greater than 1.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:38.690
Now I'm looking for something
that is less than 1.

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.256
And minus 31 is less
than 1, correct?

00:54:41.256 --> 00:54:43.880
When I go this way, I'm looking
for something that's less than.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:48.560
So given that it's minus 31,
I'm going to copy over minus 31

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.630
to what top was pointing to.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:55:00.890
So I have minus 31, 2, minus
31, 65, 99, 28, 782, and 4.

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:04.280
And at this point, I'm
going to have bottom

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:08.750
equals 1 and top equals 3.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:16.420
Keep going one more, and I get
to the point where I see 2.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.070
2 is greater than 1.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.220
0 and minus 31 are less than 1.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:23.770
And so I take 2 and
I copy it over here.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.650
And now at this point,
when I do an increment,

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:41.820
I realize that bottom
is 2 and top is 3.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.940
And in the very next step,
bottom will equal top.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.360
And I'm sitting up
here, and so I copy--

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.770
I make two--

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:53.400
I'd write the pivot
into the location that

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:58.950
corresponds to the bottom
after top got decremented.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.620
And in that case, both
bottom and top are 2.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:06.090
And that index, 0, 1, and 2,
the pivot gets written into it.

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:07.732
And so that's
exactly what I had,

00:56:07.732 --> 00:56:10.380
which I wrote right
at the beginning.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:16.860
So I would say this is probably
the most complicated code

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:20.150
from a control flow standpoint
that I've ever shown you.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.510
This algorithm is an in
place algorithm that does not

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.710
require any extra storage.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.400
And that's exactly
why it's so popular.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.420
People are sorting billions
of elements in lists,

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.850
and you can't use
gigabytes of storage

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:37.680
during the sorting process.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:41.340
And what this clever
strategy tells you is you

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.780
don't need all of that storage.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.310
You can do things in place.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.710
And as long as you choose
the pivot reasonably well,

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:49.510
you get your average
case N log N complexity,

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:52.620
which is the same as the worst
case complexity of mergesort.

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.660
So you've got to be a little
bit careful with that.
