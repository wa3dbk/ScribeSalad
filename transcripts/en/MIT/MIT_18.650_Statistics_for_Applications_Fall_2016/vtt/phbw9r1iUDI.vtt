00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.240
So welcome back.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.180
So we are now moving
to a new chapter, which

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.050
is going to have a little
more of a statistical flavor

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.720
when it comes to designing
methods, all right?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.090
Because if you
think about it, OK--

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.139
some of you have probably
attempted problem number two

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.930
in the problem set.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.360
And you realize that maximum
likelihood estimators does not

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.080
give you super trivial
estimators, right?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.752
I mean, when you have an n theta
theta, then the thing you get

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:53.210
is not something you could have
guessed before you actually

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.410
attempted to solve that problem.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.270
And so, in a way, we've seen
already sophisticated methods.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.630
However, in many instances, the
maximum likelihood estimator

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.710
was just an average.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.010
And in a way, even if
we had this confirmation

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.950
for maximum likelihood that
indeed that was the estimator

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.960
that maximum likelihood
would spit out,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.780
and that our intuition
was therefore pretty good,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.560
most of the statistical analysis
or use of the central limit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.390
theorems, all these
things actually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.780
did not come in the
building of estimator,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.700
in the design of the
estimator, but really

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.365
in the analysis
of the estimator.

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:29.955
And you could say,
well, if I know already

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.580
that the best estimator
is the average,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.996
I'm just going to
use the average.

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:35.450
I don't have to, basically,
quantify how good it is.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.760
I just know it's
the best I can do.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.290
We're going to talk about tests.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.460
And we're going to talk about
parametric hypothesis testing.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880
So you should view this
as-- parametric means,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.420
well, it's about a parameter,
like we did before.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.420
And hypothesis testing is on
the same level as estimation.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510
And on the same
level as estimator

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.760
will be the word "test," OK?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.100
And when we're going
to devise a test,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.200
we're going to actually
need to understand

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.090
random fluctuations that arise
from the central limit theorem

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.860
better, OK?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.940
It's not just going
to be in the analysis.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.610
It's also going to
be in the design.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.901
And everything we've been
doing before in understanding

00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.720
the behavior of an
estimator is actually

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.910
going to come in
and be extremely

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.820
useful in the actual
design of tests, OK?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.120
So as an example, I want to talk
to you about some real data.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690
I will not study this data.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.420
But this data actually exist.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.330
You can find it
on R. And so, it's

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.450
the data from the so-called
credit union Cherry Blossom

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.890
Run, which is a 10 mile race.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.550
It takes place
every year in D.C.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.550
It seems that some of the
years are pretty nice.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.820
In 2009, there were about
15,000 participants.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.290
Pretty big race.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.330
And the average running time
was 103.5 minutes, all right?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.710
So about an hour and a
half or a little bit more.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.240
And so, you can ask the
following question, right?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.580
This is actual data, right?

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.330
103.5 actually averaged the
running time for all of 15,000.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.630
Now, this in practice, may not
be something very suitable.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.330
And you might want to
just sample a few runners

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.130
and try to understand
how they're

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.900
behaving every
year without having

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.910
to collect the entire data set.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.710
And so, you could ask
the question, well,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.160
let's say my budget is to
ask for maybe 10 runners

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.960
what their running time was.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.760
I still want to be
able to determine

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.600
whether they were running
faster in 2012 than in 2009.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.420
Why do I put 2012, and not 2016?

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.860
Well, because the data set
for 2012 is also available.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.770
So if you are interested
and you know how to use R,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.300
just go and have fun with it.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.180
So to answer this question, what
we do is we select n runners,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.680
right?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.430
So n is a moderate number that's
more manageable than 15,000.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.500
From the 2012 race at random.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.199
That's where the random variable
is going to come from, right?

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.615
That's where we actually inject
randomness in our problem.

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:04.205
So remember this
is an experience.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:06.970
So really in a way, the
runners are the omegas.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.150
And I'm interested in
measurements on those guys.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.980
So this is how I have
a random variable.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.570
And this random verbal here is
measuring their running time.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.120
OK.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.179
If you look at the data
set, you have all sorts

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:19.720
of random variables
you could measure

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.310
about those random runners.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.630
Country of origin.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.330
I don't know, height,
age, a bunch of things.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.860
OK.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.401
Here, the random
variable of interest

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.750
being the running time.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:30.250
OK.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.510
Everybody understand
what the process is?

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.010
OK.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.220
So now I'm going to have to
make some modeling assumptions.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.930
And here, I'm
actually pretty lucky.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.770
I actually have all the
data from a past year.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.500
I mean, this is not the data
from 2012, which I also have,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.504
but I don't use.

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.920
But I can actually use past
data to try to understand what

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.210
distribution do I have, right?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.610
I mean, after all,
running time is going

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.780
to be rounded to something.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.632
Maybe I can think of it as
a discrete random variable.

00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:58.090
Maybe I can think of it as the
exponential random variable.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.040
Those are positive numbers.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.896
I mean, there's many
kind of running times

00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:03.020
that could come up to mind.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.686
Many kind of distributions
I could think

00:05:04.686 --> 00:05:06.630
of for this modeling part.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.200
But it turns out
that if you actually

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.440
plug the histogram of those
running times for all 15,000

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.410
runners in 2009,
you actually are

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.145
pretty happy to
see that it really

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:18.020
looks like a bell-shaped
curve, which suggest

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.630
that this should be a Gaussian.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.630
So what you go on to do
is you estimate the mean

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.800
from past observations, which
was actually 103.5, as we said.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.900
You submit the
variance, which was 373.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.960
And you just try to
superimpose the curve

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.740
with this one, which is a
Gaussian PDF with mean 103.5

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.160
and variants 373.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.110
And you see that they
actually look very much alike.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.530
And so here, you're
pretty comfortable to say

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.570
that the running time actually
is Gaussian distribution.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.070
All right?

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.410
So now I know that
the x1 to xn, I'm

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.960
going to say they're
Gaussian, OK?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.550
I still need to
specify two parameters.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.260
So what I want to know is,
is the distribution the same

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.220
from past years, right?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.380
So I want to know if the random
variable that I'm looking

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.463
for-- if I, say, pick one.

00:06:09.463 --> 00:06:10.510
Say, x1.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.730
Does it have the same
distribution in 2012

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.820
that it did in 2009?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.560
OK.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.330
And so, the question
is, is x1 has

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.530
a Gaussian distribution with
mean 103.5 and variance 373?

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.580
Is that clear?

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.450
OK.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.250
So this question that calls
for a yes or no answer

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.840
is a hypothesis testing problem.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.090
I am testing a hypothesis.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.850
And this is the basis
of basically all

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.490
of data-driven
scientific inquiry.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.570
You just ask questions.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.930
You formulate a
scientific hypothesis.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.816
Knocking down this gene is going
to cure melanoma, is this true?

00:06:48.816 --> 00:06:49.690
I'm going to collect.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.430
I'm going to try.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.990
I'm to observe some patients on
which I knock down this gene.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.615
I'm going to collect
some measurements.

00:06:54.615 --> 00:07:00.190
And I'm going to try to answer
this yes/no question, OK?

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.120
It's different
from the question,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.150
what is the mean running
time for this year?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.210
OK.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.350
So this hypothesis
testing is testing

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.770
if this hypothesis is true.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.750
The hypothesis in common
English we just said,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.111
were runners running faster?

00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:22.610
All right?

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.451
Anybody could formulate
this hypothesis.

00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:25.700
Now, you go to a statistician.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.241
And he's like, oh,
what you're really

00:07:27.241 --> 00:07:32.750
asking me is x1 has a Gaussian
distribution with mean

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.630
less than 103.5 and
variance 373, right?

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.380
That's really the question that
you ask in statistical terms.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.050
And so, if you're asking if
this was the same as before,

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.720
there's many ways it could
not be the same as before.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.490
There's basically
three ways it could not

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.840
be the same as before.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.360
It could be the case that x1
is in expectation to 103.5

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.610
So the expectation has changed.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.710
Or the variance has changed.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.320
Or the distribution has changed.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.400
I mean, who knows?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.060
Maybe runners are now just all
running holding their hands.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.190
And it's like now a point
mass at 1 given point.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:08.690
OK.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.000
So you never know what
could [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.060
Now of course, if you
allow for any change,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.111
you will find change.

00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:18.610
And so what you have to do is
to factor in as much knowledge

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.270
as you can.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.710
Make as many
modeling assumptions,

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.210
so that you can
let the data speak

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.730
about your particular question.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.230
Here, your particular question
is, are they running faster?

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.460
So you're only really asking a
question about the expectation.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.159
You really want to know if
the expectation has changed.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.114
So as far as you're
concerned, you're

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:37.030
happy to make the
assumption that the rest has

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.309
been unchanged.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.760
OK.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.429
And so, this is the
question we're asking.

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.760
Is the expectation
now less than 103.5?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.880
Because you specifically
asked whether runners were

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.650
going faster this year, right?

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:55.420
They tend to go faster rather
than slower, all right?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.470
OK.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.030
So this is the question we're
asking in mathematical terms.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.350
So first, when I did that, I
need to basically fix the rest.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.450
And fixing the rest
is actually part

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.160
of the modeling assumptions.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.470
So I fixed my
variance to be 373.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.300
OK?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.250
I assume that the
variance has not

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.120
changed between 2009 and 2012.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.620
Now, this is an assumption.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.110
It turns out it's wrong.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.910
So if you look at
the data from 2012,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.496
this is not the
correct assumption.

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:26.120
But I'm just going
to make it right now

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.700
for the sake of argument, OK?

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.340
And also the fact
that it's Gaussian.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.850
Now, this is going to be
hard to violate, right?

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.640
I mean, where did this
bell-shaped curve come from?

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.480
Well, it's just natural when you
just measure a bunch of things.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.070
The central limit
theorem appears

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.320
in the small things of nature.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.200
I mean, that's the bedtime story
you get about the central limit

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.900
theorem.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.940
And that's why the bell-shaped
curve is everywhere in nature.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.730
It's the sum of little
independent things

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.910
that are going on.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.080
And this Gaussian assumption,
even if I wanted to relax it,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.910
there's not much else I can do.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.020
It is pretty robust
across the years.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.520
All right.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.930
So the only thing
that we did not fix

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.892
is the expectation of x1, which
now I want to know what it is.

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:11.350
And since I don't know what it
is, I'm going to call it mu.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.641
And it's going to be a variable
of interest, all right?

00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:14.770
So it's just a number mu.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.320
Whatever this is I can try
to estimate it, maybe using

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.162
maximum likelihood estimation.

00:10:19.162 --> 00:10:21.370
Probably using the average,
because this is Gaussian.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.995
And we know that the
maximum likelihood

00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:26.000
estimator for a Gaussian
is just the average.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.590
And now we only want to test
if mu is equal to 103.5,

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.100
like it was in 2009.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.774
Or on the contrary, if
mu is not equal to 103.5.

00:10:37.774 --> 00:10:39.440
And more specifically,
if mu is actually

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.240
strictly less than 103.5.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.950
That's the question you ask.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.370
Now, why am I in writing
mu equal to 103.5 or is

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.240
less than 103.5
and equal to 103.5

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.450
versus not equal to 103.5?

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.640
It's because since you asked
me a more precise question,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.270
I'm going to be able to give
you a more precise answer.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.890
And so, if your question
is very specific--

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.960
are they running faster?

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.440
I'm going to factor
that in what I write.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.310
If you just ask
me, is it the same?

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.647
I'm going to have to write,
or is it different than 103.5?

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:15.230
And that's less
information about what

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.200
you're looking for, OK?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.500
So by making all these
modeling assumptions--

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.250
the fact that the
variance doesn't change,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.708
the fact that it's
still Gaussian--

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:31.050
I've actually reduced
the number of.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.440
And I put numbers in quotes,
because this is still

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.660
an infinite of them.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.220
But I'm limiting
the number of ways

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.875
the hypothesis can be violated.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.050
The number of possible
alternative realities

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.540
for this hypothesis, all right?

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.520
For example, I'm
saying there's no way

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.400
mu can be larger than 103.5.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.710
I've already
factored that in, OK?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:56.700
It could be.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.550
But I'm actually just going
to say that if it's larger,

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.940
all I'm going to be able to tell
you is that it's not smaller.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.290
I'm not going to
be able to tell you

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.710
that it's actually larger, OK?

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.830
And the only way it
can be rejected now.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.990
The only way I can
reject my hypothesis

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.900
is if x belongs to very specific
family of distributions.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.650
If it has a distribution
which is Gaussian

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.820
with mean mu and variance of
373 for mu, which is less 103.5.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:30.320
All right?

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:40.240
So we started with
basically was x1--

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.470
so that's the reality.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:49.840
x1 follows n 103.5 373, OK?

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.690
And this is everything
else, right?

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.680
So for example,
here is x follows

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.410
some exponential, 0.1, OK?

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.270
This is just another
distribution here.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.040
Those are all the
possible distributions.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.010
What we said is we said,
OK, first of all, let's just

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.780
keep only those Gaussian
distributions, right?

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.100
And second, we said, well, among
those Gaussian distributions,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.290
let's only look at
those that have-- well,

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.370
maybe this one should
be at the boundary--

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.650
let's only look at
the Gaussians here.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:33.820
So this guy here are
all the Gaussians

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:43.290
with mean mu and variance 373
for mu less than 103.5, OK?

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.360
So when you're going
to give me data,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.660
I'm going to be able to
say, well, am I this guy?

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.772
Or am I one of those guys?

00:13:49.772 --> 00:13:51.480
Rather than searching
through everything.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.940
And the more you search
the easier for you

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.980
to find something that fits
better the data, right?

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.000
And so, if I allow
everything possible,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.800
then there's going
to be something

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.770
that just by pure randomness is
actually going to look better

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.490
for the data, OK?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.780
So for example, if I draw
10 random variables, right?

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.840
If n is equal to 10.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.150
And let's say they take
10 different values.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.070
Then it's actually more
likely that those guys

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.040
come from a discrete
distribution that

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.350
takes each of these values
with probability 1 over 10,

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.560
than actually some Gaussian
random variable, right?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.507
That would be perfect.

00:14:31.507 --> 00:14:32.590
I can actually explain it.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:36.740
If the 10 numbers
I got were say--

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.870
let's say I collect
3, 90, 95, and 102.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.420
Then the most likely
distribution for those guys

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.490
is the discrete
distribution that

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:51.260
takes three values, 91
with probability 1/3, 95

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:57.387
with probability 1/3, and
102 with probably 1/3, right?

00:14:57.387 --> 00:14:59.720
That's definitely the most
likely distribution for this.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.090
So if I allowed this,
I would say, oh no.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.610
This is not distributed
according to that.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.920
It's distributed according
to this very specific

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.800
distribution, which is
somewhere in the realm

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.450
of all possible
distributions, OK?

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.480
So now we're just going to try
to carve out all this stuff

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.570
by making our assumptions.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.070
OK.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.870
So here in this
particular example,

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.270
just make a mental note
that what we're doing

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.580
is that I actually--

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:31.340
a little birdie told me that the
reference number is 103.5, OK?

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.760
That was the thing I'm
actually looking for.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.680
In practice, it's
actually seldom the case

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.260
that you have this reference
for yourself to think of, right?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
Maybe here, I just happen
to have a full data

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.620
set of all the runners of 2009.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.680
But if I really just
asked you, I said,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.990
were runners faster
in 2012 than in 2009?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.262
Here's $10 to perform
your statistical analysis.

00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:01.720
What you're probably going to
do is called maybe 10 runners

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.380
from 2012, maybe 15
runners from 2009,

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.930
ask them and try to
compare their mean.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.250
There's no standard reference.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.680
You would not be able to
come up with this 103.5,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.630
because these data maybe is
expensive to get or something.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:15.130
OK.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.250
So this is really more of
the standard case, all right?

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.310
Where you really compare
two things with each other,

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.830
but there's no actual
ground truth number

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.280
that you're comparing it to.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:26.780
OK.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.700
So we'll come back
to that in a second.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.070
I'll tell you what the
other example looks like.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.430
So let's just stick
to this example.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.710
I tell you it's 103.5, OK?

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.170
Let's try to have our
intuition work the same way.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.710
We said, well,
averages worked well.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.970
The average, tell me,
of over these 10 guys

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.820
should tell me what
the mean should be.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.460
So I can just say,
well x bar is going

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.500
to be close to the true mean
by the law of large number.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:17:00.600
So I'm going to decide whether
x bar is less than 103.5.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.069
And conclude that in this case,
indeed mu is less than 103.5,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.859
because those two
quantities are close, right?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.609
I could do that.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.670
The problem is that this
could go pretty wrong.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.730
Because if n is
small, then I know

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.400
that xn bar is not equal to mu.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.819
I know that xn bar
is close to mu.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:21.859
But I also know that
there's pretty high chance

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:23.150
that it's not equal to mu.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.410
In particular, I know it's going
to be somewhere at 1 over root

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.580
n away from mu, right?

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.690
1 over root n being the
root coming from what?

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.600
CLT, right?

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.700
That's the root n that comes
from CLT. In blunt words,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.510
CLT tells me the
mean is at distance

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.600
1 over root n from the
expectation, pretty much.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.920
That's what it's telling.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.910
So 1 over root n.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.790
If I have 10 people in
there, 1 over root 10

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.170
is not a huge number, right?

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.290
It's like 1/3 pretty much.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.850
So 1/3 103.5.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:07.940
If the true mean
was actually 103.4,

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.834
but my average was telling
me it's 103.4 plus 1/3,

00:18:12.834 --> 00:18:15.250
I would actually come to two
different conclusions, right?

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.400
So let's say that mu
is equal to 103.4, OK?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.700
So you're not supposed
to know this, right?

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.350
That's the hidden truth.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.400
OK.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.380
Now I have n is equal to 10.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:49.190
So I know that x
bar n minus 103.4

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.470
is something of the order of
1 over the square root of 10,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.840
which is of the
order of, say, 0.3.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.340
OK.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.480
So here, this is
all hand wavy, OK?

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.120
But that's what the central
limit theorem tells me.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:13.260
What it means is
that it is possible

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:20.030
that x bar n is actually
equal to is actually

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:30.970
equal to 103.4 plus 0.3,
which is equal to 103.7.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:40.350
Which means that while the truth
is that mu is less than 103.5,

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:47.572
then I would conclude that
mu is larger than 103.5, OK?

00:19:47.572 --> 00:19:49.780
And that's because I have
not been very cautious, OK?

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.170
So what we want to do is
to have a little buffer

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.750
to account for the
fact that xn bar is not

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.525
a precise value for the true mu.

00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:05.180
It's something that's 1
over root n away from you.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.420
And so, what we want is
the better heuristic that

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.550
says, well, if I want
to conclude that I'm

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:14.270
less than 103.5, maybe I
need to be less than 103.5

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.920
minus a little buffer that goes
to 0 as my sample size goes

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.300
to infinity.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.354
And actually, that's what the
law of large number tells me.

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.770
The central limit
theorem actually

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.740
tells me that this
should be true,

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.030
something that goes to
0 as n goes to infinity

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.850
and the rate 1
over root n, right?

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.680
That's basically what the
central limit theorem tells me.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.170
So to make this
intuition more precise,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.490
we need to understand
those fluctuations.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.610
We need to actually
put in something

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.102
that's more precise than
these little wiggles here, OK?

00:20:47.102 --> 00:20:49.560
We need to actually have the
central limit theorem come in.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.340
So here is the example
of comparing two groups.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.700
So pharmaceutical
companies use hypothesis

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.167
testing to test if a
drug is efficient, right?

00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:04.000
That's what they do.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.170
They want to know,
does my new drug work?

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.175
And that's what the Federal
Drug Administration office

00:21:09.175 --> 00:21:11.560
is doing on a daily basis.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:18.660
They ask for extremely well
regulated clinical trials

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.530
on a thousand people,
and check, does this drug

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.460
make a difference?

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.900
Did everybody die?

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.270
Does it make no difference?

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.450
Should people pay $200 for
a pill of sugar, right?

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.030
So that's what people
are actually asking.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.060
So to do so, of course, there
is no ground truth about--

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.830
so there's actually
a placebo effect.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.970
So it's not like actually
giving a drug that does not work

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.400
is going to have no
effect on patients.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.320
It will have a small effect,
but it's very hard to quantify.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.460
We know that it's there, but
we don't know what it is.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.670
And so rather than saying,
oh the ground truth

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.280
is no improvement, the ground
truth is the placebo effect.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.020
And we need to measure
what the placebo effect is.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.730
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.730
going to split our
patients into two groups.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.590
And there's going to
be what's called a test

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.020
group and a control group.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.040
So the word test here is
used in a different way

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.220
than hypothesis testing.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.490
So we'll just call it
typically the drug group.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:22.790
And so, I will refer to
mu drug for this guy, OK?

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.120
Now, this let's say this
is a cough syrup, OK?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.990
And when you have a
cough syrup, the way

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:34.520
you measure the efficacy
of a cough syrup

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:40.000
is to measure how many times
you cough per minute, OK?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.740
And so, if I define
mu control the number

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:48.840
of expectoration per hour.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.500
So just the expected
number, right?

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.000
This is the number I don't know,
because I don't have access

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.430
to the entire population
of people that will ever

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.590
take this cough syrup.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.526
And so, I will call it mu
control for the control group.

00:23:00.526 --> 00:23:02.900
So those are the people who
have been actually given just

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.330
like sugar, like maple syrup.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.440
And mu drug are those people who
are given the actual syrup, OK?

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.710
And you can imagine that maybe
maple syrup will have an effect

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:18.020
on expectorations per hour just
because, well, it's just sweet

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.040
and it helps, OK?

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.290
And so, we don't know what
this effect is going to be.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.920
We just want to measure
if the drug is actually

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.670
having just a better
impact on expectorations

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:34.700
per hour than the just
pure maple syrup, OK?

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.385
So what we want to know is if
mu drug is less than mu control.

00:23:38.385 --> 00:23:39.260
That would be enough.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.540
If we had access to
all the populations

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.390
that will ever take
the syrup for all ages,

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.760
then we would just measure,
did this have an impact?

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.880
And even if it's a slightly
ever so small impact,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.760
then it's good to
release this cough syrup,

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.430
assuming that it has no side
effects or anything like this,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.370
because it's just better
than maple syrup, OK?

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.430
The problem is that we
don't have access to this.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.110
And we're going to have to make
this decision based on samples

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:09.140
that give me imprecise knowledge
about mu drug and mu control.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.870
So in this case,
unlike the first case

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.990
where we compared an
unknown expected value

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.530
to have a fixed number, which
was one of the 103.5, here,

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.980
we're just comparing two unknown
numbers with each other, OK?

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.522
So there's two
sources of randomness.

00:24:22.522 --> 00:24:23.896
Trying to estimate
the first one.

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.492
And trying to estimate
the second one.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:31.860
Before I move on, I just
wanted to tell you I apologize.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.480
One of the graders was not able
to finish grading his problem

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.240
sets for today.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.390
So for those of you who are here
just to pick up their homework,

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.010
feel free to leave now.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.071
Even if you have a name tag, I
will pretend I did not read it.

00:24:45.071 --> 00:24:45.570
OK.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.300
So I'm sorry.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.970
You'll get it on Tuesday.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.540
And this will not happen again.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.510
OK.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.722
So for the clinical
trials, now I'm

00:24:56.722 --> 00:24:57.930
going to collect information.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:00.138
I'm going to collect the
data from the control group.

00:25:00.138 --> 00:25:03.420
And I'm going to collect data
from the test group, all right?

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.490
So my control group here.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.170
I don't have to collect the same
number of people in the control

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.600
group than in the drug group.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.520
Actually, for cough syrup,
maybe it's not that important.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.790
But you can imagine
that if you think

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:20.160
you have the cure to a
really annoying disease,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.910
it's actually hard to tell
half of the people you

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.460
will get a pill of nothing, OK?

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.140
People tend to want
to try the drug.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.942
They're desperate.

00:25:28.942 --> 00:25:30.900
And so, you have to have
this sort of imbalance

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.390
between who is getting the drug
and who's not getting the drug.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.865
And people have to qualify
for the clinical trials.

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:39.240
There's lots of
fluctuations that

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.091
affect what the final numbers
of people who are actually

00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:44.340
going to get the drug and
are going to get the control

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.180
is going to be.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.277
And so, it's not easy for you
to make those two numbers equal.

00:25:49.277 --> 00:25:51.360
You'd like to have those
numbers equal if you can,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.910
but not necessarily.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.270
And by the way, this is all part
of some mystical science called

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:00.440
"design of experiments."

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.780
And in particular,
you can imagine

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.910
that if one of the series
had higher variants,

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.040
you would want to like
more people in this group

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.000
than the other group.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.982
Yeah?

00:26:10.982 --> 00:26:13.964
STUDENT: So when we're
subtracting [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:13.964 --> 00:26:20.425
something that [INAUDIBLE] 0
[INAUDIBLE] to be satisfied.

00:26:20.425 --> 00:26:22.420
So that's on
purpose [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's on purpose.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.055
And I'll come to that
in a second, all right?

00:26:25.055 --> 00:26:31.130
So basically, we're
going to make it

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.760
if your answer is, is this true?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.170
We're going to make it as hard
as possible, but no harder

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.150
for you to say yes
to this answer.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.230
Because, well, we'll see why.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.040
OK, so now we have two set
of data, the x's and the y's.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.810
The x's are the
ones for the drug.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.230
And the y's are the data that I
collected from the people, who

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.520
were just given a placebo, OK?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.280
And so, they're all
IID random variables.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.220
And here, since it's the
number of expectorations,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.352
I'm making a blunt
modeling assumption.

00:27:07.352 --> 00:27:08.810
I'm just going to
say it's Poisson.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.990
And it's characterized only by
the mean mu drug or the mean mu

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.440
control, OK?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.090
I've just made an
assumption here.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.750
It could be something different.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.260
But let's say it's a
Poisson distribution.

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.655
So now what I want to know
is to test whether mu drug is

00:27:21.655 --> 00:27:22.530
less than mu control.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.880
We said that already.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.340
But the way we said it before
was not as mathematical

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.120
as it is now.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.520
Now we're actually making
a test on the parameters

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.540
of Poisson distribution.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.610
Whereas before, we
were just making test

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.410
on expected numbers, OK?

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.650
So the heuristic-- again, if we
try to apply the heuristic now.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.890
Rather than comparing mu x
bar drug to some fixed number,

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.306
I'm actually comparing x
bar drug to some control.

00:27:46.306 --> 00:27:48.680
But now here, I need to have
something that accounts for,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.200
not only the fluctuations
of x bar drug,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.406
but also for the fluctuations
of x bar control, OK?

00:27:55.406 --> 00:27:56.780
And so, now I need
something that

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.540
goes to 0 when all those
two things go to infinity.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.840
And typically, it should go to
zero with 1 over root of n drug

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.340
and 1 over square
root of n control, OK?

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.830
That's what the central
limit theorem for both x bar

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.320
drug and x bar control.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.261
Two central limit theorems
are actually telling.

00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:15.760
OK.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.840
And then we can conclude
that this happens.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.570
And as you said, we're
trying to make it

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.700
a bit harder to conclude this.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.830
Because let's face it.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.800
If we were actually using
two simple heuristic, right?

00:28:30.114 --> 00:28:31.030
For simplicity, right?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:43.930
So I can rewrite x bar drug
less than x bar control

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.060
minus this something
that goes to 0.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:54.650
I can write it as x bar drug
minus x bar control less

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.930
than something negative, OK?

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.280
This little something, OK?

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.990
So now let's look at those guys.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.470
This is the difference
of two random variables.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.570
From the central
limit theorem, they

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:12.914
should be approximately
Gaussian each.

00:29:12.914 --> 00:29:14.330
And actually, we're
going to think

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.660
of them as being independent.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.460
There's no reason why the
people in the control group

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.210
should have any effect
on what's happening

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.350
to the people in the test group.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.550
Those people probably
don't even know each other.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.056
And so, when I look at this,
this should look like n 0

00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:28.430
with some mean
and some variants,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.590
let's say I don't
know what it is, OK?

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.940
The mean I actually know.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:37.250
It's mu drug minus
mu control, OK?

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.950
So if they were to plot
the PDF of this guy,

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.210
it would look like this.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.890
I would have something
which is centered

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.590
at mu drug minus mu control.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.880
And it would look like this, OK?

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.780
Now let's say that mu drug is
actually equal to mu control.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.810
That this pharmaceutical
company is a huge scam.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.810
And they really are trying
to sell bottled corn

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.580
syrup for $200 a pop, OK?

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.980
So this is a huge scam.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.010
And the true things are
actually equal to 0.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.670
So this thing is really
centered about 0, OK?

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.760
Now, if were not to do
this, then basically, half

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.890
of the time I would
actually come up

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.900
with a distribution
that's above this value.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.370
And half of the time I
would have something that's

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.070
below this value, which would
mean that half of the scams

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.040
would actually go through
FDA if I did not do this.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.340
So what I'm trying to
do is to say, well, OK.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.830
You have to be here, so
that there is actually

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.930
a very low probability
that just by chance

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.120
you end up being here.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.520
And we'll make all the
statements extremely precise

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.780
later on.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.060
But I think the
drug thing makes it

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.330
interesting to see why
you're making it hard,

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.220
because You don't
want to allow people

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.420
to sell a thing like that.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.620
Before we go more into the
statistical thinking associated

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.050
to tests, let's just
see how we would

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.460
do this quantification, right?

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.410
I mean after all, this
is what we probably

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.590
are the most comfortable
with at this point.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.650
So let's just try
to understand this.

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:16.060
And I'm going to make the
statisticians favorite test,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.700
which is the thing that
obviously you do at home all

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.450
the time every time
you get a new quarter,

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.740
is testing whether it's
a fair coin or not.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.240
All right?

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.840
So this test, of course,
exists only in textbooks.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.780
And I actually did
not write this slide.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.670
I was lazy to just
replace all this stuff

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:37.410
by the Cherry Blossom Run.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.440
So you have a coin.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.330
Now you have 80
observations, x1 to x80.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.420
So n is equal to 80.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:53.820
I have x1, xn, IID, Bernoulli p.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.570
And I want to know if
I have a fair coin.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.330
So in mathematical
language, I want

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.380
to know if p is equal to 1/2.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.680
Let's say this is
just the heads, OK?

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.030
And a biased coin?

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.536
Well, maybe you
would potentially

00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:11.910
be interested
whether it's biased

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.034
one direction or the other.

00:32:13.034 --> 00:32:15.900
But not being a fair
coin is already somewhat

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.360
of a discovery, OK?

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.520
And so, you just want to know
whether p is equal to 1/2

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:25.280
or p is not equal to 1/2, OK?

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.890
Now, if I were to apply the
very naive first example

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.080
to not reject this hypothesis.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.710
If I run this thing
80 times, I need

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:40.360
to see exactly 40
heads and 40 tales.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.960
Now this is very unlikely
to happen exactly.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.200
You're going to have close to
40 heads and close to 40 tails,

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.510
but how close should
those things be?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.310
OK?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.540
And so, the little
something is going

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.300
to be quantified by
exactly this, OK?

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:06.490
So now here, let's say that my
experiment gave me 54 heads.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:07.541
That's 54?

00:33:07.541 --> 00:33:08.040
Yeah.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:21.100
Which means that my xn bar
is 54 over 80, which is 0.68.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.970
All right?

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.580
So I have this estimator.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.620
Looks pretty large, right?

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.950
It's much larger than
0.5, so it does look like,

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.080
and my mom would
certainly conclude,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.240
that this is a
biased coin for sure,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.870
because she thinks I'm tricky.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.370
All right.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.110
So the question is, can
this be due to chance?

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.050
Can this be due to chance alone?

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.490
Like what is the likelihood
that a fair coin would actually

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:51.800
end up being 54 times
on heads rather than 40?

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.900
OK?

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.540
And so, what we do
is we say, OK, I

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.370
need to understand, what is
the distribution of the number

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.732
of times it comes on heads?

00:33:59.732 --> 00:34:01.190
And this is going
to be a binomial,

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:02.984
but it's a little
annoying to play with.

00:34:02.984 --> 00:34:05.150
So we're going to use the
central limit theorem that

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:10.790
tells me that xn
bar minus p divided

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:15.940
by square root of p1 minus p
is approximately distributed

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.300
as an n01.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.944
And here, since
n is equal to 80,

00:34:18.944 --> 00:34:21.110
I'm pretty safe that this
is actually going to work.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.300
And I can actually
use [INAUDIBLE],,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.510
and put xn bar here.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.980
[INAUDIBLE] tells me
that this is OK to do.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.480
All right.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.350
So now I'm actually
going to compute this.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.870
So here, I know this.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.280
This is square root of 80.

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.860
This is a 0.68.

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.210
What is this value here?

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.179
We'll talk about it.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.090
Well, we're trying to
understand what happens

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.610
if it is a fair coin, right?

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:02.220
So if fair, then p is
equal to 0.5, right?

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.160
So what I want to know
is, what is the likelihood

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.240
that a fair coin
would give me 0.68?

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.560
Let me finish.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.850
All right.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.190
What is the likelihood
that a fair coin will

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:17.470
allow me to do this, so I'm
actually allowed to plug-in p

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.530
to be 0.5 here?

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:25.000
Now, your question is, why
do I not plug-in p to be 0.5?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.640
But you can.

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.140
All right.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.024
I just want to make you plug-in
p at one specific point,

00:35:29.024 --> 00:35:30.190
but you're absolutely right.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.540
OK.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.270
Let's forget about your
question for one second.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:41.590
So now I'm going to have to
look at xn bar minus 0.5 divided

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:45.300
by xn bar 1 minus xn bar.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:51.130
Then this thing is
approximately Gaussian and 0,1

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.270
if the coin is fair.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:36:01.120
Otherwise, I'm going to have
a mean which is not zero here.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.730
If the coin is something else,
whatever I get here, right?

00:36:07.772 --> 00:36:09.230
Let's just write
it for one second.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.010
Let's do it.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:27.510
So what is the
distribution of this if p--

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:33.380
so that's p is equal to 0.5.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:33.930
OK?

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:39.910
Now if p is equal to 0.6,
then this thing is just, well,

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.660
I know that this is equal
to square root of n xn

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:52.140
bar minus 0.6,
divided by xn bar 1

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.740
minus xn in the bar
squared root, plus--

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.050
well, now the difference.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.710
Is So square root
of n, 0.6 minus

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:07.520
0.5, divided by square root of
xn bar 1 minus xn bar, right?

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:13.790
Now if p is equal to 0.6,
then this guy is n 0,1,

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:17.950
but this guy is
something different.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:22.155
This is just a number that
depends on square root of n.

00:37:22.155 --> 00:37:24.130
It's actually pretty large.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.620
So if I want to use the
fact that this guy has

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:33.650
a normal distribution, I need
to plug-in the true value here.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.630
Now, the implicit question
that I got was the following.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:43.630
It says, well, if you know
what p is, then what's

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:46.600
actually true is also this.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.450
If p is equal to
0.5, then since I

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:57.180
know that root n xn bar minus
p divided by square root of p 1

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.590
minus p is some n
0, 1, it's also true

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:06.570
that square root of
n xn bar minus 0.5

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:14.940
divided by square root of 0.5
1 minus 0.5 is n 0,1, right?

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.750
I know what p is.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.620
I'm just going to
make it appear.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.460
OK.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.100
And so, what's actually
nice about this particular

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.460
[INAUDIBLE] experiment is that
I can check if my assumption is

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:31.386
valid by checking
whether I'm actually--

00:38:31.386 --> 00:38:32.760
so what I'm going
to do right now

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.697
is check whether this is likely
to be a Gaussian or not, right?

00:38:36.697 --> 00:38:38.280
And there's two ways
I can violate it.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.496
By violating mean, but also
by violating the variance.

00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:44.120
And here, what I did
in the first case,

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.340
I said, well I'm not allowing
you to check whether you've

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.040
violated the variance.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.340
I'm just plugging whatever
variance you're getting.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.110
Whereas here, I'm
saying, well, there's

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.460
two ways you can violate it.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.430
And I'm just going to
factor everything in.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.700
So now I can
plug-in this number.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.146
So this is 80.

00:39:00.146 --> 00:39:02.440
This is 0.68.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.210
So I can compute all this stuff.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.910
I can compute all this
stuff here as well.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.210
And what I get in this
case, if I put the xn bar 1,

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:15.160
I get 3.45, OK?

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.120
And now I claim
that this makes it

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.430
reasonable to reject
the hypothesis that p

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:21.790
is equal to 0.5.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:22.900
Can somebody tell me why?

00:39:27.819 --> 00:39:28.860
STUDENT: It's pretty big.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.235
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
3 is pretty big.

00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:31.510
So it's very unlikely.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.730
So this number that
I should see should

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:39.460
look like the number I would get
if I asked a computer to draw

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.960
one random Gaussian for me.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.250
This number, when I draw
one random Gaussian,

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.510
is actually a number with
99.9% this number will

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.700
be between negative 3 and 3.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.540
With 78% it's going to be
between negative 2 and 2.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.410
68% is between minus 1 and 1.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.560
And with like 90% it's
between minus 2 and 2.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.860
So getting a 3.45
when you do this

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.260
is extremely unlikely
to happen, which

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:17.260
means that you would have to
be extremely unlucky for this

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:17.890
to ever happen.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:19.750
Now, it can happen, right?

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:25.000
It could be the case that you
flip 80 coins and 80 of them

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.505
are heads.

00:40:27.505 --> 00:40:29.130
With what probability
does this happen?

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.390
1 over 2 to the 80, right?

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:39.890
Which is probably better
off playing the lottery

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.140
with this kind of odds, right?

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.840
I mean, this is just not going
to happen, but it might happen.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.490
So we cannot remove completely
the uncertainty, right?

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:53.250
It's still possible that
this is due to noise.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.640
But we're just trying to
make all the cases that

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:58.340
are very unlikely go away, OK?

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.350
And so, now I claim that 3.45
is very unlikely for a Gaussian.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:07.700
So if I were to draw the PDF
of a standard Gaussian, right?

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.320
So n 0, 1, right?

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.880
So that's PDF of n 0, 1.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:21.900
3.73 is basically here, OK?

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.260
So it's just too
far in the tails.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.030
Understood?

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.320
Now I cannot say that the
probability that the Gaussian

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.810
is equal to 373 is small, right?

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.660
I just cannot say
that, because it's 0.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.770
And it's also 0 for the
probability that it's 0,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.060
even though the most
likely values are around 0.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.236
It's the continuous
random variable.

00:41:44.236 --> 00:41:45.610
Any value you give
me, it's going

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:47.720
to happen with probability zero.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.190
So what we're going to say
is, well, the fluctuations

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.780
are larger than this number.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.030
The probability that
I get anything worse

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.040
than this is actually
extremely small, right?

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:00.970
Anything worse than this is
just like farther than 3.73.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:03.710
And this is going to
be what we control.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:04.300
All right?

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.550
So in this case, I claim
that it's quite reasonable

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:07.740
to reject the hypothesis.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.830
Is everybody OK with this?

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:12.440
Everybody find this shocking?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.290
Or everybody has no
idea what's going on?

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.422
Do you have any questions?

00:42:16.422 --> 00:42:17.410
Yeah?

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.386
STUDENT: Regarding
the case of p, where

00:42:19.386 --> 00:42:21.362
minus p isn't close to xn.

00:42:21.362 --> 00:42:24.820
If you use 1 minus p
as 0.5, then you're

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.772
dividing by a larger number
than you would if you used xn.

00:42:28.772 --> 00:42:32.230
So it feels like our
true number is not 3.45.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.700
It's something a
little bit smaller

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.146
than 3.45 for the distribution
to actually be like 1/2.

00:42:39.146 --> 00:42:40.628
Because it seems
like we're adding

00:42:40.628 --> 00:42:43.574
an unnecessary extra
error by using xn bar.

00:42:43.574 --> 00:42:45.074
And we're adding
an error that makes

00:42:45.074 --> 00:42:50.014
it seem that our result was less
likely than it actually was.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.490
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.790
And you're right.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.540
I didn't want to plug-in
the p everywhere,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.670
but you should plug it
in everywhere you can.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.010
That's for sure, OK?

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:12.205
So let's agree on that.

00:43:12.205 --> 00:43:15.022
And that's true that it makes
the number a little bigger.

00:43:15.022 --> 00:43:16.480
You compute how
much you would get,

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.000
we would get if we 0.5 there.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.040
Well, I don't know what
the square root of 80 is.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.370
Can somebody compute quickly?

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:27.600
I'm not asking you to do it.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:46.150
But what I want is two times
square root of 80 times 0.18.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.850
3.22

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:49.970
OK.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:55.462
I can make the same
cartoon picture with 3.22.

00:43:55.462 --> 00:43:56.170
But you're right.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:57.370
This is definitely
more accurate.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:58.536
And I should have done this.

00:43:58.536 --> 00:44:02.350
I didn't want to get the
confused message, OK?

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:02.850
All right.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:07.770
So now here's a second
example that you can think of.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.520
So now I toss it 30 times.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:17.310
Still in the realm of the
central limit theorem.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:23.910
I get 13 heads rather than 15.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.127
So I'm actually much closer
to being exactly at half.

00:44:27.127 --> 00:44:28.710
So let's see if this
is actually going

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:29.918
to give me a plausible value.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.830
So I get 0.33 in average.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:40.950
If the truth was 0.5, I would
get something like 0.77.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.700
And now I claim that 0.77
is a plausible realization

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.950
for some standard Gaussian, OK?

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.620
Now, 0.77 is going to
look like it's here.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.830
So that could very well
be something that just

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.420
comes because of randomness.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:01.860
And again, if you
think about it.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.740
If I told you, you were
expecting 15, you saw 13,

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.479
you're happy to put that on
the account of randomness.

00:45:09.479 --> 00:45:11.270
Now of course, the
question is going to be,

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:12.770
where do I draw the line?

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:13.760
Right?

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.740
Is 12 the right number?

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.840
Is 11?

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.570
Is 10?

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:18.070
What is it?

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.770
So basically, the answer is
it's whatever you want to be.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.250
The problem it's hard to
think on the scale, right?

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.332
What does it mean to
think on the scale?

00:45:30.332 --> 00:45:31.790
If I can't think
in this scale, I'm

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.950
going to have to think on
the scale of 80 of them.

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:38.390
I'm going to have to think on
the scale of running 100 coin

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:39.170
flips.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.004
And so, this scale is a
moving target all the time.

00:45:43.004 --> 00:45:44.420
Every time you
have a new problem,

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.961
you have to have a
new skill in mind.

00:45:45.961 --> 00:45:47.660
And it's very difficult.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.840
The purpose of
statistical analysis,

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.810
and in particular this
process that content

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:55.670
that takes your x
bar and turns it

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:58.530
into something that should
be standard Gaussian,

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.010
allows you to map
the value of x bar

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:06.350
into a scale that is the
standard scale of the Gaussian.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:07.070
All right?

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.050
Now, all you need
to have in mind

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:13.220
is, what is a large number
or an unusually large number

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.014
for a Gaussian?

00:46:14.014 --> 00:46:15.180
That's all you need to know.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.760
So here, by the way,
0.77 is not this one,

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.860
because it was
actually negative 0.77.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.660
So this one.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.160
OK.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:34.460
So I can be on the right or
I can be on the left of zero.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.030
But they are still plausible.

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:40.000
So understand you could
actually have in mind

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.040
all the values that are
plausible for a Gaussian

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.415
and those that
are not plausible,

00:46:43.415 --> 00:46:46.190
and draw the line based on what
you think is the right number.

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.690
So how large should a positive
value of a Gaussian to become

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.990
unreasonable for you?

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.530
Is it 1?

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.190
Is it 1.5?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.819
Is it 2?

00:46:56.819 --> 00:46:57.860
Stop me when I get there.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.900
Is it 2.5?

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.557
Is it 3?

00:47:00.557 --> 00:47:02.348
STUDENT: I think 2.5
is definitely too big.

00:47:02.348 --> 00:47:03.014
PROFESSOR: What?

00:47:03.014 --> 00:47:04.808
STUDENT: Doesn't it
depend on our prior?

00:47:04.808 --> 00:47:06.776
Let's say we already
have really good evidence

00:47:06.776 --> 00:47:09.864
at this point [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:09.864 --> 00:47:12.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this
is not Bayesian statistics.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.160
So there's no such thing
as a prior right now.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:15.150
We'll get there.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.360
You'll have your moment
during one short chapter.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.580
So there's no prior here, right?

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.380
It's really a matter
of whether you think

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.820
is a Gaussian large or not.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.230
It's not a matter of coins.

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.530
It's not a matter of anything.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.950
Now I've just reduced
it to just one question.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:36.350
So forget about
everything we just said.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.240
And I'm asking you,
when do you decide

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.010
that a number is too large
to be reasonably drawn

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.790
from a Gaussian?

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:50.190
And this number is 2 or 1.96.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.010
And that's basically the number
that you get from this quintel.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.560
We've seen the
1.96 before, right?

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.920
It's actually q alpha over 2,
where alpha is equal to 5%.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.620
That's a quintel of a Gaussian.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.130
So actually, what we
do is we map it again.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.300
So are now at the Gaussians.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.380
And then we map it again
into some probabilities,

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.796
which is the probability of
being farther than this thing.

00:48:10.796 --> 00:48:12.460
And now probabilities,
we can think.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.060
Probability is something
that quantifies my error.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.220
And the question is
what percentage of error

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.300
am I willing to tolerate.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.310
And if I tell you
5%, that's something

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.570
you can really envision.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.750
What it means is that if I
were to do this test a million

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.380
times, 5% of the time
I would expose myself

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.400
to making a mistake.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:30.900
All right.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.950
That's all it would say.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:36.790
If you said, well, I don't
want to account for 5%,

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:42.280
maybe I want 1%, then you
have to move from 1.94 to 2.5.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.710
And then if you say
at I want 0.01%,

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:47.180
then you have to move to
an even larger number.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.100
So it depends.

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.610
But stating this
number 1%, 5%, 10%

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:57.380
is much easier than seeing those
numbers 1.96, 2.5, et cetera.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.370
So we're just putting
everything back on the scale.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.480
All right.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.190
To conclude, this,
again, as we said,

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.720
does not suggest that
the coin is unfair.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.260
Now, it might be that
the coin is unfair.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.330
We just don't have enough
evidence to say that.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:12.580
And that goes back to
your question about,

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:17.420
why are we siding with
the fact that we're

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:22.086
making it harder to conclude
that the runners were faster?

00:49:22.086 --> 00:49:23.210
And this is the same thing.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.830
We're making it
harder to conclude

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.540
that the coin is biased.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.700
Because there is a status quo.

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.500
And we're trying to
see if we have evidence

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.910
against the status quo.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:35.380
The status quo for the runners
is they ran the same speed.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.880
The status quo for the coin,
we can probably all agree

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:39.560
is that the coin is fair.

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.150
The status quo for a drug?

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:43.940
I mean, again,
unless you prove me

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.920
that you're actually
not a scammer

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.959
is that the status quo is
that this is maple syrup.

00:49:48.959 --> 00:49:50.000
There's nothing in there.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.060
Why would you?

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.060
I mean, if I let you
get away with it,

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.810
you would put corn syrup.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:58.720
It's cheaper.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.840
OK.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.171
So now let's move on to math.

00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:01.670
All right.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:04.460
So when I started
doing mathematics,

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.690
I'm going to have to talk
about random variables

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.270
and statistical models.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:13.110
And here, there is actually
a very simple thing,

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:15.800
which actually goes
back to this picture.

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:27.230
A test is really asking
me if my parameter

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.850
is in some region
of the parameter set

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:30.766
or another region of the
parameter set, right?

00:50:30.766 --> 00:50:32.000
Yes/no.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.490
And so, what I'm going to be
given is a sample, x1, xn.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:38.120
I have a model.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:46.460
And again, those can be
braces depending on the day.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:54.670
And so, now I'm going to give
myself theta 0 and theta 1

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:55.660
to this joint subset.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.170
OK.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:02.840
So capital theta
here is the space

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.200
in which my parameter can live.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.950
To make two disjoint
subsets, I could just

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:11.356
split this guy in half, right?

00:51:11.356 --> 00:51:13.730
I'm going to say, well, maybe
it's this guy and this guy.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:14.230
OK.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.250
So this is theta 0.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.830
And this is theta 1.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.840
What it means when I split
those two guys, in test,

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.510
I'm actually going to focus
only on theta 0 or theta 1.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.010
And so, it means that
a priori I've already

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:32.240
removed all the possibilities
of theta being in this region.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.540
What does it mean?

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.910
Go back to the
example of runners.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.180
This region here for
the Cherry Blossom Run

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:44.420
is the set of parameters,
where mu was larger

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.354
than 103.5, right?

00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:48.020
We removed that.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.880
We didn't even consider
this possibility.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:52.820
We said either it's less--

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.320
sorry.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.860
That's mu equal to 103.5.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.770
And this was mu
less than 103.5, OK?

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.950
But these guys were like
if it happens, it happens.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.980
I'm not making any
statement about that case.

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:07.520
All right?

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.565
So now I take those two subsets.

00:52:09.565 --> 00:52:11.690
And now I'm going to give
them two different names,

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:15.050
because they're going to
have an asymmetric role.

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:18.710
h0 is the null hypothesis.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:23.630
And h1 is the
alternative hypothesis.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:27.030
h0 is the status quo.

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.560
h1 is what is
considered typically

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.140
as scientific discovery.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:36.550
So if you're a regulator,
you're going to push towards h0.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:39.832
If you're a scientist, you're
going to push towards h1.

00:52:39.832 --> 00:52:41.290
If you're a
pharmaceutical company,

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.990
you're going to push towards h1.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.900
OK?

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:47.410
And so, depending on whether you
want to be conservative-- oh,

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:49.272
I can find evidence
in a lot of data.

00:52:49.272 --> 00:52:50.980
As soon as you give
me three data points,

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.563
I'm going to be able
to find evidence.

00:52:52.563 --> 00:52:55.000
That means I'm going to
tend to say, oh, it's h1.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.010
But if you say you
need a lot of data

00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:00.260
before you can actually move
away from the status quo,

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.870
that's age h0, OK?

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.940
So think of h0 as
being status quo,

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:08.480
h1 being some discovery that
goes against the status quo.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:08.980
All right?

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:12.310
So if we believe that
the truth theta is either

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:17.330
in one of those, what we say is
we want to test h0 against h1.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:17.830
OK.

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:19.790
This is actually wording.

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:22.360
So remember, because this
is how your questions are

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.770
going to be formulated.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:26.320
And this is how you want
to probably communicate

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.730
as a statistician.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.347
So you're going to
say I have the null

00:53:29.347 --> 00:53:30.430
and I have an alternative.

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:32.830
I want to test h0 against h1.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.480
I want to test the
null hypothesis

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.220
against the alternative
hypothesis, OK?

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.590
Now, the two hypotheses I
forgot to say are actually this.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:46.710
h0 is that the theta
belongs to theta 0.

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:50.911
And h1 is that it theta
belongs to theta 1.

00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:51.410
OK.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:53.280
So here, for example,
theta was mu.

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:57.320
And that was mu equal to 103.5.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.530
And this was mu less than 103.5.

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:02.480
OK?

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.360
So typically, they're not going
to look like thetas and things

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:06.860
like that.

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:09.140
They're going to look like very
simple things, where you take

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.180
your usual notation for
your usual parameter

00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.060
and you just say in mathematical
terms what relationship this

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:16.910
should be satisfying, right?

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:18.320
For example, in
the drug example,

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:25.150
that would be mu drug
is equal to mu control.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:30.380
And here, that would be mu
drug less than mu control.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.150
The number of
expectorations for people

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.800
who take the drug
for the cough syrup

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.300
is less than the number
of expectoration of people

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:42.990
who take the corn syrup, OK?

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.090
So now what we want to do.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:51.060
We've set up our
hypothesis testing problem.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.260
You're a scientist.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.020
You've set up your problem.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:58.170
Now what you're going
to do is collect data.

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.660
And what you're going to
try to find on this data

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.050
is evidence against h0.

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.060
And the alternative
is going to guide you

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:08.010
into which direction
you should be looking

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.200
for evidence against this guy.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.290
All right?

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:13.820
And so, of course, the
narrower the alternative,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.570
the easier it is for
you, because you just

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:19.410
have to look at the one
possible candidate, right?

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.650
But typically, h1 is a
big group, like less than.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:27.990
Nobody tells you it's
either it's 103.5 and 103.

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:32.460
People tell you it's either
103.5 or less than 103.5.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.280
OK.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:37.330
And so, what we want to do is
to decide whether we reject h0.

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:40.480
So we look for evidence
against h0 in the data, OK?

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.880
So as I said, h0 and h1 do
not play a symmetric role.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.700
It's very important to
know which one you're

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.465
going to place as h0
and which one you're

00:55:53.465 --> 00:55:54.340
going to place at h1.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:01.480
If it's a close
call, you're always

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.000
going to side with h0, OK?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.860
So you have to be
careful about those.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.609
You have to keep that
in mind that if it's

00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:10.410
a close call, if data does
not carry a lot of evidence,

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:12.280
you're going to side with h0.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.700
And so, you're actually
never saying that h0 is true.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.430
You're just saying I did not
find evidence against h0.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.400
You don't say I accept that h0.

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:25.590
You say I failed to reject h0.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:26.090
OK.

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:28.189
And so one of the
things that you

00:56:28.189 --> 00:56:29.980
want to keep in mind
when you're doing this

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.960
is this innocent
until proven guilty.

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:37.010
So if you come from a
country, like America,

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.090
there's such a thing.

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.270
And in particular,
lack of evidence

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:45.410
does not mean that you
are not guilty, all right?

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:47.720
OJ Simpson was found not guilty.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.270
It was not found innocent, OK?

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:52.100
And so, this is
basically what happens

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.760
is like the prosecutor
brings their evidence.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.940
And then the jury has
to decide whether they

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:07.400
were convinced that this
person was guilty of anything.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.820
And the question is, do
you have enough evidence?

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.550
But if you don't
have evidence, it's

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:17.257
not the burden of the defender
to prove that they're innocent.

00:57:17.257 --> 00:57:18.590
Nobody's proving their innocent.

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.120
I mean, sometimes it helps.

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.160
But you just have to make
sure that there's not

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.560
enough evidence against you, OK?

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.370
And that's basically
what it's doing.

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:28.980
You're h0 until proven h1.

00:57:31.529 --> 00:57:32.820
So how are we going to do this?

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:37.200
Well, as I said, the
role of estimators

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:40.460
in hypothesis testing is played
by something called tests.

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.300
And a test is a statistic.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.340
Can somebody remind me
what a statistic is?

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:48.140
Yep?

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.050
STUDENT: The measure [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:53.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
actually just one step more.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:54.940
So it's a function
of the observations.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.734
And we require it
to be measurable.

00:57:56.734 --> 00:57:58.150
And as a rule of
thumb, measurable

00:57:58.150 --> 00:58:00.567
means if I give you data, you
can actually compute it, OK?

00:58:00.567 --> 00:58:02.649
If you don't see a
[INAUDIBLE] or an [INAUDIBLE],,

00:58:02.649 --> 00:58:04.140
you don't have to
think about it.

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:04.780
All right.

00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.590
And so, what we do is
we just have this test.

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:14.590
But now I'm actually
asking only from this test

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.280
a yes/no answer, which I
can code as 0, 1, right?

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.640
So as a rule of thumb, you
say that, well, the test

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.140
is equal to 0 then h0.

00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:25.490
The test is equal to 1 at h1.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.604
And as we said, is that
if the test is equal to 0,

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.020
it doesn't mean
that a 0 is truth.

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.060
It means that I
feel to rejected h0.

00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:33.390
And if the test is
equal to 1, I reject h0.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:38.750
So I have two possibilities.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:39.640
I look at my data.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.800
I turn it into a yes/no answer.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.310
And yes/no answer is
really h0 or h1, OK?

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.260
Which one is the most
likely basically.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.720
All right.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:57.530
So in the coin flip
example, our test statistic

00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:00.850
is actually something
that takes value 0, 1.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:04.600
And anything, any function
that takes value at 0,

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.030
1 is an indicator function, OK?

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:11.507
So an indicator function
is just a function.

00:59:11.507 --> 00:59:13.090
So there's many ways
you can write it.

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:20.440
So it's a 1 with a double bar.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.940
If you aren't
comfortable with this,

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:27.650
it's totally OK to write i
of something, like i of a.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.534
OK.

00:59:28.534 --> 00:59:29.200
And that's what?

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.270
So a, here, is a statement,
like an inequality, an equality,

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:38.600
some mathematical statement, OK?

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.700
Or not mathematical.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.430
I mean, "a" can be, you know,
my grandma is 20 years old, OK?

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:50.390
And so, this is basically 1 if
a is true, and 0 if a is false.

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.260
That's the way you
want to think about it.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.420
This function takes only
two values, and that's it.

01:00:10.290 --> 01:00:12.080
So here's the
example that we had.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:17.330
We looked at whether
the standardized xn

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:20.220
bar, the one that actually
is approximately n 0,1

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.590
was larger than something
in absolute value,

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:27.550
either very large or
very small, but negative.

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.020
I'm going back to this picture.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.270
We wanted to know
if this guy was

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:35.660
either to the left of something
or to the right of something,

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.160
right?

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.642
Was it in these regions?

01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:49.250
Now this indicator, I can view
this as a function of x bar.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.100
What it does, it really
splits the possible values

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.500
of x bar, which is just
a real number, right?

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.180
In two groups.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.030
The groups on which they
lead to a value, which is 1.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.590
And the groups on
which they lead

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.270
to value, which is 0, right?

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:05.420
So what it does is that
I can actually think

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.140
of it as the real line, x bar.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:13.010
And there's basically
some values here,

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.927
where I'm going to get a 1.

01:01:14.927 --> 01:01:16.260
Maybe I'm going to get a 0 here.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.670
Maybe I'm going to get a 0.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.840
Maybe I'm going to get a 1.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.470
I'm just splitting all
possible values of x bar.

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.350
And I see whether to spit
out the side which is 0

01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:26.880
or which is 1.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.471
In this case, it's
not clear, right?

01:01:29.471 --> 01:01:31.095
I mean, the function
is very nonlinear.

01:01:31.095 --> 01:01:34.530
It's x bar minus 0.5 divided
by the square root of x bar 1

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.532
minus x bar.

01:01:35.532 --> 01:01:36.990
If we put the p in
the denominator,

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:38.070
that would be clear.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:40.530
That would just be exactly
something that looks like this.

01:01:45.427 --> 01:01:46.760
The function would be like this.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.370
It would be 1 if it's
smaller than some value.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:52.580
Less than 0 if it's
in between two values.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.220
And then 1 again.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:02:00.730
So that's psi, OK?

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:02.470
So this is 1, right?

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.130
This is 1.

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.540
And this is 0.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.390
So if x bar is too small
or if x bar is too large,

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.590
then I'm getting a value 1.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.640
But if it's somewhere in
between, I'm getting a value 0.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.410
Now, if I have this
weird function,

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:18.090
it's not clear
how this happened.

01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:20.434
So the picture
here that I get is

01:02:20.434 --> 01:02:27.080
that I have a weird
non-linear function, right?

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.420
So that's x bar.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:32.270
That's square root
of n x bar n 0.5

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:36.980
divided by the square root of
x bar n 1 minus x bar n, right?

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.210
That's this function.

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.890
A priori, I have no idea what
this function looks like.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.320
We can probably
analyze this function,

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.740
but let's pretend we don't know.

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.680
So it's like some
crazy stuff like this.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.320
And all I'm asking is
whether in absolute value

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.510
it's larger than c, which means
that is this function larger

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.383
than c or less than minus c?

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.100
The intervals on which
I'm going to say 1

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:17.821
are this guy, this guy,
this guy, and this guy.

01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:18.320
OK.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:20.897
And everywhere
else, I'm seeing 0.

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:21.980
Everybody agree with this?

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.930
This is what I'm doing.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.370
Now of course, it's
probably easier for you

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.350
to just package it into
this nice thing that's

01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:31.602
just either larger than
c, an absolute value,

01:03:31.602 --> 01:03:33.810
or less Than C. I want to
have to plot this function.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.950
In practice, you don't have to.

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:40.050
Now, this is where I
am actually claiming.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.200
So here, I actually
defined to you a test.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.500
And I promised, starting
this lecture, by saying,

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.250
oh, now we're going
to do something better

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.880
than computing the averages.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.450
Now I'm telling you it's
just computing an average.

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:52.910
And the thing is
the test is not just

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:54.830
the specification of this x bar.

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:57.901
It's also the specification
of this constant c.

01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:58.400
All right?

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.270
And the constant c
was exactly where

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:07.360
our belief about what a large
value for a Gaussian is.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.200
That's exactly where it came in.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:12.500
So this choice of c is
basically a threshold

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.320
at which we decide above
this threshold this isn't

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.104
likely to come from a Gaussian.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:18.770
Below this threshold
we decide that it's

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:20.660
likely to come from a Gaussian.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.200
So we have to choose what
this threshold is based

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.750
on what we think likely means.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.490
Just a little bit
more of those things.

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.520
So now we're going to
have to characterize

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:43.030
what makes a good test, right?

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.770
Well, I'll come back
to it in a second.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.755
But you could have a test
that says reject all the time.

01:04:48.755 --> 01:04:50.380
And that's going to
be bad test, right?

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.120
The FDA is not
implementing a test

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.440
that says, yes all drugs work,
now let's just go to Aruba, OK?

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.650
So people are trying
to have something that

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.560
tries to work all the time.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.700
Now FDA's not either
saying, let's just

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:07.340
say that no drugs work, and
let's go to Aruba, all right?

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.880
They're just trying
to say the right thing

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.180
as often as possible.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.300
And so, we're going to
have to measure this.

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.790
So the things that are
associated to a test

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:17.440
are the rejection region.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:21.550
And if you look at this
x in en, such that psi

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:25.420
of x is equal to 1, this is
exactly this guy that I drew.

01:05:29.024 --> 01:05:30.940
So here, I summarized
the values of the sample

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.460
into their average.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.080
But the values of the
sample that I collect

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.691
will lead to a test that says 1.

01:05:38.691 --> 01:05:39.190
All right?

01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:40.610
So this is the rejection region.

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.990
If I collect a data point,
technically I have--

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:51.250
so I have e to the n, which
is a big space like this.

01:05:51.250 --> 01:05:52.540
So that's e to the n.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.150
Think of it as being
the space of xn bars.

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:59.200
And I have a function that
takes only value 0, 1.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.962
So I can decompose
it into this part

01:06:01.962 --> 01:06:04.420
where it takes value 0 and the
part where it takes value 1.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.740
And those can be super
complicated, right?

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:07.880
Can have a thing like this.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.990
Can have some weird little
islands where it takes value 1.

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:14.090
I can have some islands
where it's takes value 0.

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:16.237
I can have some
weird stuff going on.

01:06:16.237 --> 01:06:18.070
But I can always partition
it into the value

01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:20.570
where it takes value 0 and the
value where it takes value 1.

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:25.530
And the value where it takes
1, if psi is equal to 1,

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:32.630
this is called the rejection
region of the plot, OK?

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:37.810
So just the samples that
would lead me to rejecting.

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:42.460
And notice that this is the
indicator of the rejection

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.010
region.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:48.190
The test is the indicator
of the rejection region.

01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:52.530
So there's two ways you can make
an error when there's a test.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:56.460
Either the truth is in h1, and
you're saying actually it's h1.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.310
Or the truth is in h1,
and you say it's h0.

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:04.710
And that's how we build-in the
asymmetry between h0 and h1.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.480
We control only one
of the two errors.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.510
And we hope for the
best for the second one.

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:13.370
So the type 1 error is
the one that says, well,

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:16.640
if it is actually the
status quo, but a claim

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.220
that there is a discovery--
if it's actually h0,

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.700
but I claim that
I'm in h1, then I

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.560
admit I commit a type I error.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.870
And so the probability
of type I error

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:29.730
is this function
alpha of psi, which

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.920
is the probability of saying
that psi is equal to 1

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.809
when theta is in h0.

01:07:36.809 --> 01:07:38.850
Now, the problem is that
this is not just number,

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:41.790
because theta is just like
moving all over h0, right?

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:45.980
There's many values that
theta can be, right?

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:48.500
So theta is somewhere here.

01:07:52.854 --> 01:07:53.520
I erased it, OK.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.335
All right.

01:08:00.335 --> 01:08:02.210
For simplicity, we're
going to think of theta

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:07.980
as being mu and 103.5, OK?

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:11.720
And so, I know that
this is theta 1.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:18.990
And just this point
here was theta 0, OK?

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.490
Agreed?

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:22.800
This is with the
Cherry Blossom Run.

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.699
Now, here in this case,
it's actually easy.

01:08:25.699 --> 01:08:27.240
I need to compute
this function alpha

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:37.144
of psi, which maps theta in
theta 0 to p theta of psi

01:08:37.144 --> 01:08:37.689
equals 1.

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:40.682
So that's the probability that
I reject when theta is in h0.

01:08:40.682 --> 01:08:42.390
Then there's only one
of them to compute,

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.220
because theta can only
take this one value.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.840
So this is really 103.5.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.340
OK.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.964
So that's the
probability that I reject

01:08:48.964 --> 01:08:52.649
when the true mean was 103.5.

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:54.870
Now, if I was testing whether--

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.660
if h0 was this entire
guy here, all the

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:00.090
values larger than
103.5, then I would

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:03.450
have to compute this function
for all possible values

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:06.220
of the theta in there.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220
And guess what?

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.414
The worst case is when
it's going to be here.

01:09:09.414 --> 01:09:11.080
Because it's so close
to the alternative

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.149
that that's where I'm making
the most error possible.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:17.550
And then there's
the type 2 error,

01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:22.200
which is defined basically
in the symmetric ways.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.089
The function that maps
theta to the probability.

01:09:25.089 --> 01:09:26.880
So that's the probability
of type 2 errors.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.330
The probability that I
fail to reject h0, right?

01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:34.080
If psi is equal to 0,
I fail to reject h0.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.840
But that actually
came from h1, OK?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.540
So in this example, let's clear.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:45.629
If I'm here, like if
the true mean was 100,

01:09:45.629 --> 01:09:48.170
I'm looking at the probability
that the true mean is actually

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.569
100, and I'm actually
saying it was 103.5.

01:09:51.569 --> 01:09:53.504
Or it's not less than 103.5.

01:09:53.504 --> 01:09:54.004
Yeah?

01:09:54.004 --> 01:09:56.045
STUDENT: I'm just still
confused by the notation.

01:09:56.045 --> 01:09:59.471
When you say that [INAUDIBLE]
theta sub 1 arrow r,

01:09:59.471 --> 01:10:02.650
I'm not sure what
that notation means.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.650
PROFESSOR: Well, this
just means it's a function

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:08.060
that maps theta 0 to r.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:09.450
You've seen functions, right?

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:10.220
OK.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.690
So that's just
the way you write.

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:20.800
So that means that's a function
f that goes from, say, r r,

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.381
and that maps x to x squared.

01:10:25.381 --> 01:10:25.880
OK.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.921
So here, I'm just saying
I don't have to consider

01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:29.030
all possible values.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:32.540
I'm only considering
the values on theta 0.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:33.620
I put r actually.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.320
I could restrict myself
to the interval 0, 1,

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.160
because those are probabilities.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.090
So it's just telling me
where my function comes from

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.330
and where my function goes to.

01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:47.240
And beta is a function, right?

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.990
So beta psi of theta
is just the probability

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:55.610
that theta is equal to 1.

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:57.930
And I could define
that for all thetas--

01:10:57.930 --> 01:10:58.430
sorry.

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.600
If psi is equal
to 0 in this case.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.810
And that could define
that for all thetas.

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:05.240
But the only ones
that lead to an error

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.812
are the thetas that are in h1.

01:11:06.812 --> 01:11:08.270
I mean, I can define
this function.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:11.121
It's just not going to
correspond to an error, OK?

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:18.960
And the power of a
test is the smallest--

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.101
so the power is basically
1 minus an error.

01:11:22.101 --> 01:11:23.600
1 minus the probability
of an error.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.324
So it's the probability of
making a correct decision, OK?

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:29.490
So it's the probability of
making a correct decision

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.830
under h1, that's
what the power is.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:34.830
But again, this
could be a function.

01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:36.900
Because there's many
ways that can be in h1

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.150
if h1 is an entire
set of numbers.

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:42.200
For example, all the numbers
there are less than 103.5.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.510
And so, what I'm doing here when
I define the power of a test,

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:50.057
I'm looking at the smallest
possible of those values, OK?

01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:51.390
So I'm looking at this function.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.028
Maybe I should actually
expand a little more on this.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.200
OK.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:10.790
So beta psi of theta is
the probability under theta

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.590
that psi is equal to 0, right?

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:18.710
That's the probability
in theta 1,

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.110
which means then the
alternative, that they

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.884
feel to reject.

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:23.300
And I really should,
because theta

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.520
was actually in theta 1, OK?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.150
So this thing here is the
probability of type 2 error.

01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:34.560
Now, this is 1 minus the
probability that I did reject

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:36.960
and I should have rejected.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.830
That's just a little
off the complement.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:42.910
Because if psi is not equal
to 0, then it's equal to 1.

01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:44.620
So now if I rearrange
this, it tells me

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:48.260
that the probability
that psi is equal to 1--

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.100
this is actually 1
minus beta psi of theta.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.110
So that's true for
all thetas in theta 1.

01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:58.640
And what I'm saying
is, well, this

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.904
is now a good thing, right?

01:13:00.904 --> 01:13:02.570
This number being
large is a good thing.

01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:05.330
It means I should have
rejected, and I rejected.

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.650
I want this to happen
with large probability.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.025
And so, what I'm
going to look at

01:13:09.025 --> 01:13:11.894
is the most conservative
choice of this number, right?

01:13:11.894 --> 01:13:13.310
Rather than being
super optimistic

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:16.970
and say, oh, but indeed if theta
was actually equal to zero,

01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:19.300
then I'm always going
to conclude that--

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.730
I mean, if mu is equal to 0,
everybody runs in 0 seconds,

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.990
then I with high
probability I'm actually

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:27.770
going to make no mistake.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.920
But really, I should look at
the worst possible case, OK?

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.900
So what I'm looking
at is basically

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:45.002
the smallest value it
can take on theta one

01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:53.490
is called power of psi.

01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:55.850
Power of the test psi, OK?

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:58.930
So that's the smallest
possible value it can take.

01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:02.110
All right.

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.651
So I'm sorry.

01:14:02.651 --> 01:14:05.310
This is a lot of definitions
that you have to sink in.

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.870
And it's not super pleasant.

01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.180
But that's what testing is.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.540
There's a lot of jargon.

01:14:10.540 --> 01:14:12.440
Those are actually
fairly simple things.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.460
Just maybe you should
get a sheet for yourself.

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:17.400
And say, these are the
new terms that I learned.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.584
What is their test,
rejection region?

01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:21.000
Probably of type
I error, probably

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.740
of type 2 error, and power.

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:23.910
Just make sure you know
what those guys are.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:24.410
Oh.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:27.162
And null and alternative
hypothesis, OK?

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:28.620
And once you know
all these things,

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.953
you know what I'm talking about.

01:14:29.953 --> 01:14:31.320
You know what I'm referring to.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.000
And this is just jargon.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.610
But in the end, those
are just probabilities.

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:38.369
I mean, these a
natural quantities.

01:14:38.369 --> 01:14:40.160
Just for some reason,
people have been used

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.850
to using different terminology.

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:46.420
So just to illustrate.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.090
When do I make a typo 1 error?

01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:51.880
And when do I not
make a type 1 error?

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.500
So I make a type 1 error if h0
is true and I reject h0, right?

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.560
So the off diagonal blocks
are when I make an error.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.920
When I'm on the diagonal
terms, h1 is true

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.530
and I reject h0, that's
a correct decision.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.200
When h0 is true and
I fail to reject h0,

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.210
that's also the correct
decision to make.

01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:17.110
So I only make errors when
I'm in one of the red blocks.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:20.860
And one block is the type
1 error and the other block

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:21.730
is the type 2 error.

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:24.059
That's all it means, OK?

01:15:24.059 --> 01:15:26.100
So you just have to know
which one we called one.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.960
I mean, this was chosen
in a pretty ad hoc way.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.440
So to conclude this lecture,
let me ask you a few questions.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:46.780
If in a US court, the
defendant is found either say,

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:49.601
let's just say for the sake of
discussion, innocent or guilty.

01:15:49.601 --> 01:15:50.100
All right?

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.516
It's really guilty
for not guilty,

01:15:51.516 --> 01:15:53.900
but let's say
innocent or guilty.

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:56.106
When does the jury
make a type 1 error?

01:16:03.414 --> 01:16:03.914
Yep?

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.180
And he's guilty?

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.560
And he's innocent, right?

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.560
The status quo, everybody is
innocent until proven guilty.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.500
So that's our h0 is that
the person is innocent.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.510
And so, that means
that h0 is innocent.

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.760
And so, we're looking at the
probably of type 1 error,

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.560
so that's when we reject
the fact that it's innocent.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.752
So conclude that this
person is guilty, OK?

01:16:27.752 --> 01:16:29.710
So type 1 error is when
this person is innocent

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.090
and we conclude it's guilty.

01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.131
What is the type 2 error?

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.160
Letting a guilty
person go free, which

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.290
actually according
to the constitution,

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:42.320
is the better of the two.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:42.820
All right?

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:45.361
So what we're going to try to
do is to control the first one,

01:16:45.361 --> 01:16:47.870
and hope for the best
for the second one.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:51.260
How could the jury make sure
that they make no type 1

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.500
error ever?

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:01.406
Always let the guy
go free, right?

01:17:01.406 --> 01:17:03.030
What is the effect
on the type 2 error?

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.430
Yeah, it's the worst
possible, right?

01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:12.550
I mean, basically, for every guy
that's guilty, you let them go.

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.970
That's the worst you can do.

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:15.930
And same thing, right?

01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:20.470
How can the jury make sure
that there's no type 2 error?

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:21.140
Always convict.

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.890
What is the effect on
the American budget?

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:25.135
What is the effect
on the type 1 error?

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:28.680
Right.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.710
So the effect is that basically
the type 1 error is maximized.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:33.540
So there's this trade
off between type 1

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.430
and type 2 error
that's inherent.

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:39.030
And that's why we have this
sort of multi objective thing.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.530
We're trying to minimize
two things at the same time.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:44.340
And I can't find many
ad hoc ways, right?

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.730
So if you've taken
any optimization,

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.040
trying to optimize two
things when one is going up

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.540
while the other one is going
down, the only thing you can do

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.370
is make ad hoc heuristics.

01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:55.740
Maybe you try to minimize
the sum of those two guys.

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.310
Maybe you try to minimize
1/3 of the first guy

01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:00.940
plus 2/3 of the second guy.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:03.390
Maybe you try to minimize
the first guy plus the square

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:04.140
of the second guy.

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.973
You can think of many
ways, but none of them

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:07.470
is more justified
than the other.

01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:10.120
However, for statistical
hypothesis testing,

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.790
there's one that's very well
justified, which is just

01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:15.990
constrain your type 1
error to be the smallest,

01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:18.460
to be at a level that
you deem acceptable.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:18.960
5%.

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:27.850
I want to convict at most
5% of innocent people.

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.850
That's what I deem reasonable.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:33.570
And based on that, I'm going to
try to convict as many people

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.170
as they can, all right?

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.780
So that's called the
Nieman Pearson paradigm,

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.240
and we'll talk
about it next time.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.140
All right.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:44.990
Thank you.
